Moreover, we hold that the \u201cmiscellaneous agreement\u201d (equivalent to a guilty plea agreement), applicable to his codefendant at their joint trial, operated to violate Morris\u2019s confrontation right, as protected by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution (\u201cConstitution\u201d) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights (\u201cDeclaration of Rights\u201d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the peculiar facts of this case. Furthermore, we resolve that that error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and, accordingly, reverse Morris\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">A. Factual Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Late one Friday morning, 23 February 2007, Stewart Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d) and a compatriot walked into a retail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>store, The Wine Underground, located at 4400 Evans Chapel Road in Baltimore City. In the midst of unpacking boxes, Richard Seleany, a store employee, looked up and saw the two individuals. In the course of his prior employment with The Wine Underground, Seleany had been robbed. Noticing that at least one of these men was wearing a hood and a mask, he assumed another robbery was in the offing. Taking preemptive action, Seleany charged the would-be robbers and a fight ensued. As the brawl moved out of the store and onto the sidewalk, Williams drew a semi-automatic hand gun and fired a single shot, narrowly missing Seleany\u2019s head.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The assailants then turned and fled. As they ran toward a side road, Williams fired a second shot at the store employee, missing him again. Seleany was unable to get a good look at the would-be robbers\u2019 faces.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Someone, perhaps a neighbor, called the police. One of the responding police officers, Joshua Galemore, gleaned relevant information from witnesses at the crime scene, which data he relayed to police dispatch. In turn, dispatch broadcasted an alert for a white sedan. Officer Raul Alvarez, sitting in his marked police cruiser at the corner of Millbrook Road and Cold Spring Lane and hearing the dispatch, saw a white sedan matching the description and traveling east on Cold Spring Lane with two black male occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Alvarez followed the vehicle as it turned right (south) onto York Road and then left (east) onto Willow Avenue. As the sedan made this second turn, Officer Alvarez observed what he believed was the top of a third person\u2019s head in the back seat. Alvarez activated his emergency lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Nearby, Officers Steven Weiss and Kenneth Scott were driving in their unmarked police car. They quickly joined the \u201cpursuit.\u201d The white sedan increased its speed in response. The two police cars tracked the white sedan to the 600 block of Willow Avenue, a residential area. The front passenger, later identified as Williams, ran into a house (numbered 609) where he stowed a handgun. Police learned eventually that it was Williams\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Alvarez drew his sidearm and approached the white sedan. The driver, Morris, the back-seat passenger, and ultimately Williams were taken into custody. They were transported to the Robbery Division, where Detectives Byron Conaway and Robert Jackson interviewed them separately. Williams provided written and taped statements in which he confessed to the crimes at The Wine Underground. In his taped statement, Williams made clear that he entered the store \u201cto rob ... for cash.\u201d \u201cWhen [he] attempted to rob the store,\u201d however, he claimed to have been alone. Once inside, \u201cthe worker[, Seleany,] ... rushed towards me .... [and t]he gun fired once in the air.\u201d At some point, after the fight had moved outdoors, Williams started \u201cr[unning] towards Falls Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Pertinently, the following exchange then occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-6\">[Detective]: After you ran towards Falls Road, how did you get into the white [sedan] where the police attempted to pull you over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">[Williams]: Basically, I just entered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">[Detective]: And the person driving, did they drop you off at your house in front of the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-9\">[Williams]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-10\">[Detective]: What color was the vehicle that you got into at the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-11\">[Williams]: White.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-12\">[Detective]: What kinds of articles of clothing did you have? Like, what was the description of the clothing that you had on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-13\">[Williams]: Blue jeans, black shirt and I think I had on \u2014 I forgot what hoody I had on. I had a hoody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-14\">[Detective]: You had a hoody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-15\">[Williams]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-16\">[Detective]: Did you have a black mask on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-17\">[Williams]: Not a mask, but like a shirting, a shirt sleeve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>[Detective]: A shirt sleeve that you, is like a makeshift mask? Did it look like a mask?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-5\">[Williams]: Some, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-6\">[Detective]: What color was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">[Williams]: Gray. Like black-gray. It was faded, though, so I would say gray.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">A search warrant was obtained for 609 Willow Avenue. Detective Conaway, while executing the warrant, discovered a handgun in the basement of the house. A ballistics examination revealed that a shell casing, recovered from the scene of the attempted robbery, had been fired from the weapon. A subsequent (and authorized) search of the white sedan yielded a piece of black cloth, along with other black items of clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">For his part, Morris denied any involvement with the attempted armed robbery. At trial, he testified that, over the course of a fifteen-year friendship, Williams had telephoned him often and asked for rides \u2014 approximately 40-50 times. On the morning of 23 February 2007, Williams assertedly phoned Morris around 11:30 a.m., asking to be picked up at the corner of Falls Road and Coldspring Lane. When Morris and his white sedan arrived at that location, Williams was not there, so Morris called Williams\u2019s cell phone number. According to Morris, when Williams and another man arrived, Williams was not \u201cout of breath[.]\u201d Williams asked Morris to drive him home and, with no query or volunteering about what the two men\u2019s recent activities had been, off they drove.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">When Officer Alvarez activated his vehicle\u2019s emergency lights, Morris did not pull over the car and stop immediately because he claimed not to have noticed the lights. Upon hearing the police cruiser\u2019s siren, however, he stopped the sedan, albeit virtually at the intended destination \u2014 Williams\u2019s house. Morris believed initially that he was pulled over for the expired temporary tags on his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">B. Procedural History.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-12\">On the theory that Williams was the gunman/robber and Morris the getaway driver, the State charged both men with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>various offenses and sought a joint trial in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The morning of the trial dawned with a predicament \u2014 although Williams and the State had discussed a plea agreement previously, Williams announced that he desired a bench trial, while Morris wanted a jury to decide his fate. Remarking that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cstrongly disapprove^]\u201d of a simultaneous bench and jury trial, <em>see Nair v. State, </em>51 Md.App. 234, 239, 442 A.2d 196, 199 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>293 Md. 617 (1982), the trial judge \u201csuggested]\u201d that, \u201cif the State is [still] seeking to keep the co-defendants together,\u201d \u201cwe could enter into a miscellaneous agreement where at the end of the proceeding, [Williams] would be the beneficiary of [the aforementioned proposed] plea agreement [to which] the State has kind of grudgingly acquiesced....\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In particular, the judge proposed that, in exchange for an agreed upon sentence of seventeen years, suspend all but ten, Williams would \u201cstand trial by jury along with [Morris], [so that] the State [has] got the Defendants side by side.\u201d During the trial itself, however, Williams and his counsel simply would \u201cbe[ ] there and contribute] nothing to [it]\u201d \u2014 that is, Williams would \u201cwaive opening and closing argument, [and] assert the Fifth....\u201d Nonetheless, he would retain \u201cthe right to argue [a] Motion for Judgment of Acquittal just in case the State\u2019s case goes sour on it and a witness doesn\u2019t testify or anything like that.\u201d In later pre-trial exchanges, Williams, the prosecutor, and the judge added additional conditions to the \u201cmiscellaneous agreement\u201d \u2014 Williams would waive peremptory jury challenges, but retain his right to cross-examine witnesses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Moreover, if the jury found Williams guilty, as was contemplated would occur in all likelihood, the State would drop additional charges against Williams, stemming from an unrelated incident; otherwise, the State would be permitted to proceed on those separate charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">After a brief recess, Williams expressed his desire to \u201ctake advantage of the Court\u2019s offer....\u201d Morris, however, objected and sought a severance, arguing that \u201cthe Court has made an agreement ... [that is] beneficial to the State____[b]ecause obviously the State would ... like to be in the position to try both of the Defendants at one time.... \u201d Countering, the trial judge averred that \u201c[Williams\u2019s presence] is not adding anything to the jury trial.\u201d \u201cIf there were no agreement,\u201d he continued, the jury trial would <em>not </em>unfold differently\u2014 \u201c[Williams would] still [assert] the Fifth and you\u2019d not be able to get him to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Morris\u2019s counsel persisted, claiming (erroneously) that, but for this \u201cmiscellaneous agreement,\u201d he would be able to call and interrogate Williams on the witness stand during Morris\u2019s defense case in the joint trial. The objection was overruled. The State then made clear its intention to use Williams\u2019s pretrial statements, \u201csince the State still has to prove to a jury Mr. Williams\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In the State\u2019s eyes, Williams\u2019s statements \u201cin no way facially incriminate[ ], or facially make[ ] reference to, anybody else,\u201d so they would be used only against Williams. Although Morris sought initially a severance, contesting the State\u2019s proposed use of the statements, he withdrew ultimately his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">After another recess, Morris changed his mind and renewed his objection to the State\u2019s intended introduction of Williams\u2019s statements. Apparently, during the break, Morris\u2019s counsel obtained a copy of the statements and concluded that they inculpated, albeit indirectly, his client; according to Morris\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>counsel, the statement \u201cputs my client into the mix\u201d by placing his pick-up of Williams closer to the scene of the attempted robbery than did Morris\u2019s pre-trial version of the events and, therefore, \u201cfurthers] my argument as to severance.\u201d The parties and the judge then engaged in a discussion about implications for the situation from <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and related cases. The gist of this discussion was that, even if a court delivers a limiting instruction, the confession of a co-defendant in a joint trial, which incriminates facially the other co-defendant, may not be admitted against that co-defendant\u2014 unless the original co-defendant is available for cross-examination. The confession <em>may </em>be admitted, however, if redacted or otherwise altered so that it is incriminating only \u201cwhen linked with evidence introduced later at trial----\u201d <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1707, 95 L.Ed.2d 176, 186 (1987). In the present case, the trial judge determined that Williams\u2019s statement was \u201clinkage,\u201d rather than <em>\u201c[Bruton </em>] evidence,\u201d and, thus, he overruled Morris\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The joint trial commenced. Williams did not participate in voir dire, did not make an opening or closing statement, did not cross-examine any witness, and generally did not present a defense. Furthermore, the judge was not asked to, and did not, instruct the jury that Williams\u2019s statements should not be considered as regards Morris guilt or innocence. Ultimately, the jury found Morris, as a principal in the second degree, guilty of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon; first-degree assault; transporting a handgun in a vehicle; use of a handgun during a felony or crime of violence; and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, the trial judge sentenced Morris to twenty years incarceration for first-degree assault and, after merging attempted robbery into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>first-degree assault, concurrent twenty-year sentences for use of a handgun in a crime of violence and conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Morris appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. His brief in this Court summarized well our intermediate appellate colleagues\u2019 treatment of that appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-6\">On appeal, Mr. Morris argued that the trial court erred in permitting Mr. Williams to be tried \u201calongside\u201d Mr. Morris under the \u201cmiscellaneous agreement,\u201d because the sham joint trial defrauded the jury and permitted the State to circumvent Mr. Morris\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights. Additionally, Mr. Morris argued that the trial court erred by permitting Detective Conaway to testify that the items recovered from Mr. Morris\u2019s vehicle were \u201cdescribed on the scene of the robbery,\u201d and that the trial court compounded this error by questioning Detective Conaway about these items. The Court of Special Appeals rejected both arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">[In an unreported opinion, t]he Court of Special Appeals characterized the first argument ... as a <em>\u201cCrawford [v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) ] argument,\u201d and held that Mr. Morris had \u201cwaived his <em>Crawford </em>argument for appeal\u201d by giving \u201ctestimony virtually identical to that portion of the statement that he is complaining about.\u201d Additionally, the court concluded that Mr. Williams\u2019[s] statement did not inculpate Mr. Morris, and, moreover, that \u201cit supports [Morris\u2019s] own testimony and therefore is exculpatory.\u201d With respect to the issue regarding the detective\u2019s testimony, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that this testimony \u201cserved the limited purpose of establishing why he seized certain articles of clothing,\u201d and that, in any event, the testimony \u201cdid not harm the appellant any more than the evidence already admitted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">We granted Morris\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Morris v. State, </em>414 Md. 330, 995 A.2d 296 (2010). Based on the parties\u2019 briefs, as well as their oral arguments, there exists confusion, however, over what issues are actually before this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Court. By reordering the questions presented in the successful petition for certiorari \u2014 and discussing the relationship between severance and <em>Crawford </em>in these circumstances \u2014 we endeavor to provide needed clarity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">([1]) Did [the Court of Special Appeals] properly find Petitioner did not argue that the trial court\u2019s severance ruling was in error and that Petitioner waived his <em>Crawford </em>argument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">([2]) Should this Court decline to review Petitioner\u2019s affirmatively waived complaint about his joint trial when the [Court of Special Appeals] found that he did not argue that the trial court\u2019s severance ruling was in error in his opening brief or reply brief?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">(3) Did the [Court of Special Appeals] correctly find that the trial court properly admitted a detective\u2019s testimony for a limited purpose and merely asked appropriate clarifying questions?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">A. Preservation Contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">Morris acknowledges that he did not raise below, and is not raising here, \u201ca simple, traditional severance issue____\u201d He concedes also that he is not \u201craising] a <em>Bruton </em>issue in this appeal.\u201d Instead, he unfurls a broad \u201csham trial\u201d tent, propped up by at least two supporting arguments. In particular, Morris avers, as he did before the Court of Special Appeals, that \u201cthe trial court erred by authorizing the sham \u2018joint trial\u2019 in this case, and that the circumvention of <em>Crawford </em>was [but] <em>one </em>of the harms inflicted by this error.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Presumably, the second harm inflicted by this \u201csham \u2018joint trial\u2019 \u201d is the \u201cdefrauding of] the jury....\u201d Morris relies on <em>State v. Bowers, </em>349 Md. 710, 724, 709 A.2d 1255, 1262 (1998), for the precept that \u201c[o]ur cases never intended to permit juries to be mislead.\u201d (Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b240-13\">The State rejoins that Morris\u2019s \u201ccurrent complaint ... is not preserved for appellate review; even if preserved, he lacks standing to advance it; even if he has standing, his complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>has no merit.\u201d First, the State highlights that, at trial, Morris objected on two grounds, one erroneous \u2014 but for the \u201cmiscellaneous agreement,\u201d he would have been able to call Williams as a witness at their joint-trial \u2014 which we shall not consider further, and the other based on <em>Bruton. </em>Before the Court of Special Appeals, however, Morris abandoned these trial objections and articulated that this was a \u201csham trial\u201d which violated \u201cMorris\u2019s confrontation clause rights\u201d and \u201cdefrauded the jury----\u201d The abandonment of his trial objections, according to the State, should prevent Morris from raising substantively different arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Second, the State remonstrates that, even if Morris preserved a \u201csham trial\u201d argument, \u201cany complaints about its validity should come from Williams, not Morris.\u201d Only those injured by an action have standing to object to it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, responding to the merits of Morris\u2019s appellate argument, the State counters that Morris\u2019s \u201csham <em>trial\u201d/Crawford, </em>argument is \u201cbased on the incorrect premise that Williams was not on trial.\u201d To the State, Williams was on trial. The State, Williams, and the trial court had not formed a plea agreement. Rather, Williams struck an agreement with the State and trial court, \u201cwhereby his sentence would be capped in return for dropping his demand for a bench trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In the State\u2019s words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-8\">Williams went before the jury \u201ccloaked in the presumption of innocence[,]\u201d and the State was obligated to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>elements of the offenses against him beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Gerald v. State, </em>299 Md. 138, [144-45, 472 A.2d 977, 981] (1983[1984]). The jury could have acquitted Williams on some or all of the charges against him \u2014 and indeed did acquit him of attempted first degree murder. Williams essentially agreed to exercise his right to a jury trial in return for a guaranteed sentence, but enjoyed the possibility of an acquittal whether from a failure of the State\u2019s evidence, leniency on the part of the jury, or some unforseen structural error in the conduct of the trial. As this Court noted in <em>Smith [v. State, </em>375 Md. 365, 377-78, 825 A.2d 1055, 1062-63 (2003)], a defendant may waive any number of rights, constitutional or otherwise, as part of a negotiated agreement. Williams was entitled to specific performance of the court\u2019s agreement notwithstanding the State\u2019s lack of participation in the agreement. \u201cLike a plea agreement, an agreement to cap the sentence in exchange for a waiver of the right to a jury trial should be enforceable.\u201d <em>Ogonowski [v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 173, 185, 589 A.2d 513, 519 (1991) ]. There is no principled basis for arguing that the same is not true when a sentence cap is offered in exchange for exercising the right to a jury trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Assuming that there was a bona fide trial, the State claims that certainly it was within its right to use Williams\u2019s statement to prove Williams\u2019s guilt. The fact that Morris also was on trial demanded only that the State follow the redaction requirements of <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Marsh, </em>so that Williams\u2019s statement did not incriminate inadvertently Morris. As Williams\u2019s statement did not so inculpate Morris, and, in any event, Morris \u201cexpressly\u201d waived his <em>Bruton </em>argument, Williams\u2019s statement was admitted properly. <em>Crawford, </em>the State entreats, is inapplicable, as it concerns the Sixth Amendment right of an accused to confront witnesses against him or her. Because Williams\u2019s statement was used against Williams alone, any <em>Crawford </em>concerns evaporate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The Court of Special Appeals determined that Morris did not challenge, on appeal, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s severance ruling,\u201d \u201cits <em>Bruton </em>ruling,\u201d or the impact of <em>Crawford. </em>(\u201c[Morris] is correct that he made a <em>Crawford </em>argument [to the trial court] ---- as part of his severance and <em>Bruton </em>arguments, [none of] which ... are ... raised on appeal.\u201d). Nonetheless, it acknowledged, paradoxically that, \u201c[i]n his opening brief, [Morris] contends the \u2018miscellaneous agreement\u2019\u201d violated \u201chis Sixth Amendment confrontation rights under Crawford____\u201d \u201c[Morris] maintains that, <em>if he </em>had been tried separately from Williams,\u201d the intermediate appellate court continued, \u201cWilliams\u2019s statement would not have been admitted into evidence at his ([Morris\u2019s]) trial____\u201d Thus, it appears \u2014 in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s own words and Morris\u2019s brief in that court \u2014 that Morris, in fact, <em>did </em>raise properly a <em>Crawford </em>argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Morris gathers not only <em>Crawford, </em>but also jury deception under his \u201csham trial\u201d tent. Under the weight of preservation principles, however, his tent buckles on the latter point. Nonetheless, Morris adequately, if not inarticulately, preserved his <em>Crawford </em>claim. Before the trial court, Morris\u2019s counsel did not rely initially on any particular case, but focused rather on his client\u2019s general confrontation rights. As <em>Crawford </em>is grounded in Sixth Amendment confrontation right principles, we conclude that Morris asserted, <em>at trial, </em>a <em>Crawford </em>complaint, \u201calbeit tangentially.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">The Court of Special Appeals \u2014 regarding its perception that Morris failed to maintain his confrontation argument before it \u2014 begins with its identification of a sharp contrast between the \u201ctrial court\u2019s severance ... [and] <em>Bruton </em>ruling[s],\u201d and Morris\u2019s \u201c \u2018sham trial\u2019/confrontation right\u201d argument. Morris objected to the former at trial, but, according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the intermediate appellate court, raised the latter \u2014 characterized as a wholly different claim \u2014 on appeal. We fail to see so clear a distinction. Instead, by raising confrontation concerns before the Court of Special Appeals, Morris was not merely alleging error in the admission of Williams\u2019s statements. <em>But see Morris v. State, </em>No. 455, September Term, 2008, slip op. at 13 (Md.App. February 4, 2010) (\u201c[Morris] contends the \u2018miscellaneous agreement\u2019 ... prejudiced him because the State was able to introduce into evidence Williams\u2019s recorded statement without regard for his ... confrontation rights----\u201d). He was taking issue directly with the \u201ctrial court\u2019s severance ruling____\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Although Morris\u2019s trial counsel did not state clearly that he was seeking a severance \u201cbecause the miscellaneous agreement was simply a subterfuge or sham, by which the State could admit Williams\u2019s statement against Morris in violation of <em>Crawford,\u201d </em>he did object to \u201cthe agreement ... as ... beneficial to the State\u201d and, presumably, unduly prejudicial, to his client. He also stated that he wanted a severance (not simply a redaction pursuant to <em>Bruton) </em>because the State proposed to admit a statement which \u201cconnects]\u201d Morris more proximately to the crime scene and \u201cactually hurts my client.\u201d (\u201c[W]hat I think [Williams\u2019s statement] does, [is] to further my argument as to severance \u2014 .\u201d). On this record, we conclude that Morris preserved, albeit tangentially, a claim that severance was proper, in light of an impending Confrontation Clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>violation caused by the existence of the \u201cmiscellaneous agreement\u201d <em>(ie., </em>the joint trial).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">B. Waiver of Appellate Arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Although determining that Morris did <em>not </em>raise a <em>Crawford </em>argument on appeal, the Court of Special Appeals continued, holding that even if he had, the ultimate issue was waived. That is because, at the trial level, Morris took the stand in his own defense and gave testimony \u201cvirtually identical to the portion of [Williams\u2019s] statement that he is complaining about.\u201d Relying principally upon <em>Tichnell v. State, </em>287 Md. 695, 715-16, 415 A.2d 830, 841(1980), the intermediate appellate court observed that a defendant \u201cwaive[s] his objection to the admission of ... contested evidence,\u201d where he challenges initially the admission of certain evidence, but subsequently \u201cconfirm[s],\u201d through his \u201cown testimony,\u201d \u201cthe evidence to which he had previously objected____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Morris counters with <em>State v. Logan, </em>394 Md. 378, 390, 906 A.2d 374, 381 (2006), in which we stated that a \u201cdefendant does not waive an error by attempting to minimize or explain improperly admitted evidence.\u201d We perceived that \u201c[i]t would be unfair to permit the State to introduce evidence, albeit later found to be inadmissible, but not to permit the defendant, upon pain of waiver, to attempt to meet it, explain it, rebut it or deny it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Based on our reading of the record, it appears to us that Morris took the stand to try to explain, if not rebut, his seeming involvement as the pre-ordained getaway driver. The characterization of him as the getaway driver was based partly on the officers\u2019 testimony, which, among other things, placed Williams in Morris\u2019s white car shortly after the attempted robbery. Williams\u2019s statement, however, also identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>fied Morris, but in an indirect, subtle, and potentially conflicting way. Earlier in his confession, Williams indicated that, after the botched robbery attempt, he \u201cran towards Falls Road.\u201d In response to the question, \u201c[w]hat color was the vehicle that you got into <em>at the scene,\u201d </em>however, Williams said \u201c[wjhite,\u201d without acknowledging \u2014 let alone delimiting \u2014 the inquisitorial phrase \u201cat the scene.\u201d When Morris took the stand at trial, he tried to explain his version of the origin and nature of his encounter with Williams on the date in question and, thereby, establish his \u201cunwitting participant\u201d defense. Without more, we must assume Morris was doing so in response to both the police testimony and Williams\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We determine that Morris raised \u2014 and did not subsequently waive \u2014 his severance and <em>Crawford </em>arguments (indeed, they are one and the same). We also disagree with our appellate colleagues that Morris \u201caffirmatively waived [his] complaint about his joint trial .... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">C. Morris\u2019s Confrontation Right Argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">1. Was There a Bona Fide Trial of Williams?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Before this Court, Morris alleges more specifically that the \u201cmiscellaneous agreement,\u201d which facilitated the joint trial with his co-defendant, allowed the State to circumvent <em>Crawford </em>and, thereby, violate his right to confront a witness against him. <em>Crawford </em>may be implicated when the State proposes to use a prior, out-of-court statement against a nondeclarant. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. at 1369, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197. The State disagrees -with Morris, arguing that <em>Crawford </em>\u201chas no applicability ... for the simple reason that [the statement] was used against [the declarant,] Williams, not ... Morris.\u201d After all, as this argument goes, the State had to make its case against Williams, or so it claimed. As such, <em>Bruton </em>provides the proper analytical framework because it addresses the use of a prior, out-of-court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>statement against the declarant himself, in a joint trial.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">We might agree with the State, had the joint trial been bona fide as to the prosecution of Williams. Were that the case, our analysis would examine whether the taped statement was redacted sufficiently, or otherwise altered, to not incriminate Morris, as Williams did not subject himself to cross-examination by taking the stand. We conclude, however, that this was not a bona fide trial, at least not as that term has been defined by the Constitution, the Declaration of Rights, and the Maryland Rules. As a result, <em>Crawford </em>is at the heart of the matter. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In its consideration of this point, the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the State regarding the bona fide nature of the joint trial. The \u201c \u2018miscellaneous agreement\u2019 applied only to sentencing,\u201d it reasoned, and so \u201c[t]he State was still required to prove criminal liability against Williams____\u201d In arguing that the \u201cmiscellaneous agreement\u201d is most akin to a sentencing cap, the State relied upon <em>Smith </em>and <em>Ogonowski, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>In <em>Smith, </em>the defendant agreed to waive his right to a jury trial and proceed with a bench trial. <em>See Smith, </em>375 Md. at 369, 825 A.2d at 1057-58. In exchange, the State consented to, among other things, drop \u201cfour of five charges and ... to [recommend] a sentence cap of 10 years without parole.... \u201d <em>Smith, </em>375 Md. at 387, 825 A.2d at 1068. The judge bound himself to the sentencing cap agreement. <em>See Smith, </em>375 Md. at 381, 825 A.2d at 1065.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Like <em>Smith, Ogonowski </em>involved a defendant bargaining away his right to a jury trial, in exchange for a sentencing cap. <em>See Ogonowski, </em>87 Md.App. at 175, 589 A.2d at 514. The State initially offered a plea bargain, in return for a sentence of ten years. <em>See Ogonowski, </em>87 Md.App. at 176, 589 A.2d at 514. The trial judge then agreed to impose ten years, if the defendant pleaded guilty. <em>See id. </em>The defendant, however, asked whether the court would \u201cbe willing to make the same cap in a \u2014 if the case was tried before the Court?\u201d <em>Ogonowski, </em>87 Md.App. at 176, 589 A.2d at 515. The trial judge consented, -without objection from the State. <em>See Ogonowski, </em>87 Md.App. at 178, 589 A.2d at 515. Acknowledging there are no \u201crules governing conditions attached to such a waiver,\u201d the Court of Special Appeals declined nonetheless \u201cto declare that these agreements are void\u201d and, instead, \u201cconclude[d] that the most appropriate vehicle for analysis is that of a contract.\u201d <em>Ogonowski, </em>87 Md.App. at 183, 589 A.2d at 518. In determining the appropriate remedy for the trial court breaching the agreement, the intermediate appellate court compared the waiver to a plea agreement, stating, \u201clike a plea agreement, an agreement to cap the sentence in exchange for a waiver of the right to a jury trial should be enforceable.\u201d <em>Ogonowski, </em>87 Md.App. at 185, 589 A.2d at 519 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Although the legal arguments involved in <em>Smith</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>Ogonowski<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> are not relevant for present purposes, the State points out that both cases condoned an agreement where a defendant uses his right to a jury trial as a bargaining chip in exchange for a sentencing cap. The fact that Williams agreed to waive multiple rights (both constitutional and procedural in nature) associated with presenting a defense, the State argues, is inapposite, as <em>Smith </em>approves the notion that \u201c \u2018[t]here are few, if any instances where a criminal defendant is prohibited from surrendering his rights, be they constitutional or otherwise <em>____Smith, </em>375 Md. at 378, 825 A.2d at 1063 (quoting <em>State v. Magwood, </em>290 Md. 615, 619 n. 2, 432 A.2d 446, 448 n. 2 (1981) (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In <em>Smith </em>and <em>Ogonowski, </em>the fact that the defendants retained all of their rights, aside from the right to a jury trial, was important. The ensuing bench trials were actual trials. Stated another way, the defendants possessed the right to mount a defense. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the \u201cmiscellaneous agreement\u201d required Williams to assert the Fifth and, thereby, waive his constitutional right to testify, a precept elucidated in <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 49-50, 107 S.Ct. 2704, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>2708, 97 L.Ed.2d 37, 44-45 (1987). Moreover, pursuant to the agreement, Williams could not make an opening statement or a closing argument. <em>See Spence v. State, </em>296 Md. 416, 419, 463 A.2d 808, 809 (1983) (\u201cIt is well-settled ... that the opportunity for summation by defense counsel prior to verdict ... is a basic constitutional right guaranteed by Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as applied to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d); <em>Baltimore v. Hurlock, </em>113 Md. 674, 677, 78 A. 558, 559 (1910) (referring to \u201c[t]he <em>right </em>to open <em>and </em>close\u201d) (emphasis added). Finally, Williams also had to waive his right to peremptory jury challenges, as afforded under Maryland Rule 4-313.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Considering the aggregate effect of these additional and substantial waivers, we believe \u2014 as the trial judge in this case framed it \u2014 Williams was not really \u201ccontesting guilt or innocence\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201che did not put on any defense.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is one thing for a defendant to waive his right to a jury trial; it is quite another for that defendant to waive his rights to take the stand in his own defense, to present opening and closing statements, and to question the biases of the very citizens selected to decide his guilt or innocence. Compared to <em>Smith </em>and <em>Ogonowski, </em>our conclusions here are fairly straightforward: a defendant may waive (or agree to exercise, as is the current situation) his right to a jury trial, in exchange for a sentencing cap, and the proceedings may partake of a trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Where a defendant waives, in essence, his right to present a defense, the proceedings are not entitled to be so characterized. In so ruling, we note that the principle that a defendant may waive nearly all of his or her rights, <em>see Smith </em>and <em>Magwood, supra, </em>appears almost singularly in plea agreement, not sentencing cap, cases.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>Brookhart v. Janis, </em>384 U.S. 1, 7-8, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 1248-49, 16 L.Ed.2d 314, 318-19 (1966) (explaining that, for a defendant to plead guilty, he or she must also waive the right to a jury trial, to confront witnesses, and the privilege against self-incrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We grant, as the State notes, that \u201c[t]he jury could have acquitted Williams on some or all of the charges against him\u2014 and indeed did acquit him of attempted first degree murder.\u201d The likelihood, however, of the jury acquitting Williams on all charges was greatly diminished (if not negligible), as Williams, in fact, did not contest his guilt. In <em>Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. 359, 365-66, 424 A.2d 755, 759 (1981), we confronted an illustrative situation, in which the parties agreed to proceed on an agreed statement of facts, and, as a result, the defendant \u201cwaiv[ed] her right to a jury trial, to confront witnesses, [and] to testify....\u201d She also waived her right, however, to \u201cdeny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the allegations of assault\u201d and \u201cwas told that the trial court had indicated that she would be placed on probation....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">As a result,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">[t]he State ... presented an agreed statement of facts that delineated conduct that showed an apparent assault and that raised no defense. At the close of the State\u2019s case, the [defendant], \u201cmerely for the record,\u201d made a motion for judgment of acquittal that was denied. Thereafter, she presented no evidence and renewed her motion for judgment of acquittal that was again denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\"><em>Sutton, </em>289 Md. at 366, 424 A.2d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">We acknowledged that \u201c[t]rying a case on an agreed statement of facts ordinarily does not convert a not guilty plea into a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Based on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, and in particular, the facts that the [defendant\u2019s] plea was entered at the direction of the trial court and that she was aware that she would be placed on probation,\u201d we held that \u201cthe proceeding was not in any sense a trial and offered <em>no reasonable chance </em>that there would be an acquittal. Under these particular circumstances, the [defendant\u2019s] plea was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">In the present case, Williams waived his right to a jury trial, to confront witnesses, to testify, and to make opening and closing arguments. Moreover, he also waived his right to deny the State\u2019s allegations and, in fact, was told what sentence to expect. He, of course, preserved his right to move for judgment of acquittal, should the State fail unexpectedly to present a prima facie case against him, a truly long-odds bet in view of Williams\u2019s pre-trial statements. Thus, such a motion appeared cosmetic and \u201cfor the record.\u201d Moreover, although nominally reserving his right to cross-examination, he engaged in no such exercise. In view of the totality of the circumstances, the proceeding was not a trial as to Williams\u2019s guilt or innocence, in that Williams presented no defense and, therefore, was afforded \u201cno reasonable chance\u201d of a complete acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>2. The Resemblance to a Guilty Plea Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">If anything, the rather peculiar \u201cmiscellaneous agreement\u201d in this case resembles a guilty plea agreement (as was the case in Sutton). The State, however, argues that the agreement was simply between the trial court and Williams, unlike a plea agreement, which must involve the State. We believe the State consented to the agreement here explicitly or implicitly. In its brief, the State concedes that \u201cit can be inferred ... that the State expressed reluctance,\u201d when the miscellaneous agreement was being forged, \u201cat giving either defendant an \u2018empty chair\u2019 defense, if at all possible.... \u201d Moreover, we doubt whether the agreement would have been struck, in the first place, without the State\u2019s acquiescence. Thus, the agreement seems to have been agreed upon by all the parties, including the trial judge, save Morris.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Further demonstrating that this agreement was the functional equivalent of a plea bargain is the fact that Williams was found guilty of attempted second-degree murder. At the sentencing hearing, Williams\u2019s counsel voiced concern that \u201cthe plea agreement was [only] to the attempted robbery.\u201d After some consideration, the trial court agreed to grant a new trial, presuming that the State would then enter the matter <em>nolle prosequi. </em>If the proceeding was a bona fide trial, the trial court would not have ordered a new trial and, in the process, overturned the jury\u2019s finding of guilt.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In the final analysis, this miscellaneous agreement may be characterized fairly as a plea agreement with escape clauses for the State and Williams. If the State, despite the significant procedural advantages in its favor fashioned by the trial court, bungled presentation of its case against Williams, Williams might have left the courtroom that day as a free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>man, but the State was free to pursue the unrelated charges against him. In short, it does not appear that Williams, like the defendants in <em>Smith </em>and Ogonowski, assented simply to face a certain type of fact-finder. Rather, he conceded, in effect, his guilt, pending no extraordinary and clearly unexpected misstep on behalf of the State.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">3. The <em>Crawford </em>Violation and Harmless Error.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">From a practical standpoint, this rather unique \u201cmiscellaneous agreement\u201d allowed the State to employ an out-of-court statement against a non-declarant, Morris, with regard only to <em>Bruton, </em>but not <em>Crawford.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Had the co-defendants been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>tried separately, the State could not have used Williams\u2019s statement against Morris, pursuant to <em>Crawford, </em>unless (1) Morris had enjoyed an opportunity to cross-examine Williams, or (2) the State had obtained a final guilty verdict or plea from Williams, thereby extinguishing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In sum, to introduce directly the Williams statement/confession against Morris, the State could have tried Williams first, or it could have refused to go along with the plea agreement and, thereby, force a bona fide joint trial (provided <em>Bruton </em>was satisfied). It could not proceed, however, as it did and, ultimately, circumvent <em>Cranford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">This is not to say the violation demands automatically a new trial for Morris. Like any violation of the Confrontation Clause, a <em>Crawford </em>violation is subject to harmless error review. <em>See Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 829, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d 224, 241 (2006) (assuming to be correct the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that a statement violative of <em>Crawford </em>was nonetheless harmless); <em>see also Luginbyhl v. Commonwealth, </em>628 S.E.2d 74, 77, 48 Va.App. 58, 64 (Va.Ct.App.2006) (en banc) (citation omitted) (\u201cIt is well established that violations of the Confrontation Clause ... are subject to harmless error review, ... and <em>Crawford </em>does not suggest otherwise.\u201d). As we stated in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>plained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In the present case, the taped statement (1) confirmed that, after the attempted robbery, Williams entered a white sedan, but (2) presented potentially conflicting evidence as to where Williams got into that vehicle vis \u00e1 vis the crime scene or a more remote location. The former point is cumulative evidence, provided already by the officers, and so we consider it no further in our harm analysis. <em>See Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 743-44, 4 A.3d 976, 985-86 (2010) (stating that \u201ccumulative evidence,\u201d which \u201ctends to prove the same point as other evidence presented during the trial or sentencing hearing,\u201d may render harmless otherwise reversible error). The latter point warrants additional reflection. To start, we recall the following exchanges, some of which were alluded to previously in this opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">[Detective]: And where did you run[, after the attempted robbery]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">[Williams]: I don\u2019t even know where I was at to be honest, but I ran towards Falls Road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">[Detective]: Did you have anybody with you when you attempted to rob the store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-10\">[Williams]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">* H&lt; Hi</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-12\">[Detective]: After you ran towards Falls Road, how did you get into the white [sedan] where the police attempted to pull you over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-13\">[Williams]: Basically, I just entered it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-14\">[Detective]: And the person driving, did they drop you off at your house in front of the door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-15\">[Williams]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-16\">[Detective]: What color was the vehicle that you got into at the scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-17\">[Williams]: White.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>These remarks show that, early in the statement, Williams provided little evidence of a getaway plan (\u201cI don\u2019t even know where I was at to be honest, but I ran towards Falls Road.\u201d). Then, the detectives adopt, by the premise of their next question, a supposition (\u201cAfter you ran towards Falls Road.... \u201d). They ask about the \u201cperson driving,\u201d but do not solicit, and do not receive, the driver\u2019s identity. Finally, the detectives asked about the color of the vehicle that Williams entered <em>\u201cat the scene.\u201d </em>Without parsing further the potentially ambiguous reference to \u201cat the scene,\u201d Williams responded simply, \u201c[w]hite.\u201d This last question and answer, therefore, could suggest \u2014 in an indirect and conflicting way \u2014 that Morris may have been closer to The Wine Underground than Morris represented in his direct-examination responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">A reasonable jury could decipher the conflicting evidence, by parsing the wording of the question, and specifically its phrase \u201cat the scene,\u201d to connect this indirect evidence in a meaningful way to Morris. Framed rhetorically, but in another way, after the attempted robbery, did Williams \u201cr[u]n toward Falls Road,\u201d where he met Morris at Falls Road at Coldspring Lane, or did he dive into Morris\u2019s getaway car \u201cat the [crime] scene\u201d? The latter inference endorses the State\u2019s theory that Morris was the pre-ordained getaway driver for the intended robbery.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Morris took the stand and explained his exact location on that fateful morning. Such testimony was consistent with his \u201cunwitting participant\u201d defense, raised in response, in part, to Williams\u2019s statement. Viewed in its entirety, Morris\u2019s testimony addressed as well the victim\u2019s and officers\u2019 directly incriminating testimony,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> as well as Williams\u2019s statement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Therefore, we cannot state, with the requisite conviction, that the error, beyond a reasonable doubt, did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict, with respect to Morris\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">We turn now briefly to two other matters (one of which we shall address for the guidance of the trial court on remand, should there be a new trial), which, though briefed, were discussed infrequently at oral argument. Initially, we consider whether the trial court erred in admitting certain allegedly hearsay testimony. Then, we ponder whether this Court should determine, on our initiative, whether the trial court erred by not issuing a certain limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">A. Hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">As summarized efficiently by the Court of Special Appeals in its unreported opinion in this case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">[Morris] contends the trial court erred by admitting into evidence certain improper testimony by Detective Conaway about items he recovered from [Morris\u2019s] vehicle; and that the trial judge compounded the error by conducting his own examination of the detective. Detective Conaway gave the challenged testimony after he asked him what items had been recovered from the white [sedan]. The detective responded, \u201cI believe it was a dark t-shirt like cut up, it was a piece of black cloth, and a couple of other items that were black that [were] described on the scene of the robbery.\u201d Defense counsel objected and moved the court to strike the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>response. The court overruled the objection and a bench conference ensued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Based on the argument that the detective had no basis to know what was described at the crime scene, Morris\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial. The State remonstrated that Detective Conaway had \u201cconducted a number of interviews,\u201d with Seleany and Williams among others, to which Morris responded that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing written in any report that said Seleany identified anything out of that car coming from the robbery.\u201d The trial judge decided to \u201cde-prejudice\u201d the testimony by his questioning the detective so as to \u201cenlighten the jury as to [the detective\u2019s source for the statement].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Although Morris\u2019s counsel objected to the trial court\u2019s stratagem, the trial judge proceeded anyway, although agreeing to admonish the detective for his \u201ctendency to give us conclusions rather than facts,\u201d which was \u201cmaking for a difficult administration of this trial.\u201d Then, this exchange occurred.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">[Trial Judge]: With respect to the last statement you said, just so I understand, in your affidavit you say because all suspects were inside the vehicle at the time of the car stop. It\u2019s believed that the article of clothing used during the incident should still be inside the vehicle and the dwelling. And when you seized the items that you just referred to, that was based on the conclusion, plus what Mr. Seleany told Officer Galemore, plus what Mr. Stewart Williams told you, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">[Det. Conaway]: You have to repeat that sir, I didn\u2019t get that one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">[Trial Judge]: Okay. You say in the affidavit; because all suspects were inside the vehicle at the time of the car stop, it\u2019s believed that articles of clothing used during the incident could still be inside both the vehicle and the dwelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">[Det. Conaway]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">[Trial Judge]: And you just testified that you\u2019re not executing the warrant looking for items that you believe were associated with the robbery, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>[Det. Conaway]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">[Trial Judge]: Your source of choosing which objects were associated with the robbery was what Mr. Seleany, the victim, told Officer Galemore and what Mr. Stewart Williams told you, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">[Det. Conaway]: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">At the conclusion of the trial judge\u2019s questioning, Morris\u2019s counsel approached the bench, insisting that the trial court \u201ccreated another very serious problem,\u201d by \u201cReading] the jury to believe ... that [Seleany and Williams] ... identified these items that were found in the car....\u201d The trial judge disagreed, stating that his questioning clarified <em>why </em>the detective took certain items from the white sedan, while leaving others. Moreover, Seleany and Williams, the latter via his taped statement, described previously the items to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The intermediate appellate court set the foundation, explaining that \u201c[a] relevant extrajudicial statement is generally admissible as non-hearsay \u201cwhen it is offered for the purpose of showing that a person relied on and acted upon the statement and is not introduced for the purpose of showing that the facts asserted in the statement are true.\u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Graves v. State, </em>334 Md. 30, 38, 637 A.2d 1197, 1201 (1994) (citations omitted)). It recognized, however, that extrajudicial statements which explain police conduct, but nonetheless directly implicate the defendants, are excluded typically as overly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">The Court of Special Appeals decided that the detective\u2019s statement \u201cserved the limited purpose of establishing why he seized certain articles of clothing (at least some of which were moved into evidence) during the search\u201d of the white sedan. Moreover, the explanatory statement did not prejudice overly Morris, as \u201c[i]t was undisputed that Williams was in [Morris\u2019s] car immediately following the attempted robbery....\u201d Indeed, the presence of a mask, which was identified by witnesses, served to corroborate Morris\u2019s testimony. Regarding the trial judge\u2019s questioning, the intermediate appellate court concluded that it \u201cclarified for the jury the purpose of the detective\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>statement, and was not a departure from his role as an impartial arbiter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">We agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s straightforward reasoning that (1) the statement illuminated why the detective collected certain items of potential evidence, and (2) the trial court\u2019s questioning, although somewhat confusing, revealed successfully that the detective\u2019s statement was not offered for its truth. In particular, the trial court\u2019s last question confirmed that the detective\u2019s statement was simply detailing the \u201csource[s for] choosing which objects were associated with the robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">B. Limiting Instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Morris claims that the trial judge erred by not instructing the jury that it may consider the taped statement as evidence only against its maker, Williams, but not against Morris. Morris points to Maryland Rule 5-105, which provides that \u201c[w]hen evidence is admitted that is admissible as to one party ... but not admissible as to another party ..., the court, <em>upon request, </em>shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Morris concedes, however, that he did not request such an instruction at trial. Nonetheless, he asks this Court to review the issue pursuant to plain error analysis. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 4-325(e) (stating that \u201c[a]n appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may ... take cognizance of any plain error in the [jury] instructions, material to the right of the defendant, despite a failure to object\u201d). We decline to do so as this matter is quite likely not to re-appear in any new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTION TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY (AS TO MORRIS) AND TO REMAND TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY MAYOR &amp; CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-11\">. \"The Heart of the Matter,\" <em>The End of the Innocence, </em>Don Henley, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\">.

The jury acquitted Williams of attempted first-degree murder, but convicted him of attempted second-degree murder; attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon; first degree assault; wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun; use of a handgun during a felony or crime of violence; and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\">. We dispatch with the State\u2019s standing argument in this footnote. Morris, indeed, would face formidable standing problems, if he attempted to object to how Williams waived his rights, without a thorough on-the-record colloquy, see <em>Cubbage v. State, </em>304 Md. 237, 240, 498 A.2d 632, 634 (1985) (reiterating that waivers of rights must be knowing and voluntary), or to the trial judge\u2019s active participation in the negotiation process, <em>see Barnes v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 694, 707, 523 A.2d 635, 641 (1987) (holding that a \"trial judge ... [may not] improperly interject[] himself into the plea bargaining process as an active negotiator\u201d as that \u201dinfring[es] upon the function reserved to counsel in the adversary process\u201d). Morris, however, protests how the \"miscellaneous agreement\u201d impacted his personal right to confront witnesses presented against him. As such, he satisfies the standing requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. In <em>Gray v. Maryland, </em>523 U.S. 185, 192, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 1155, 140 L.Ed.2d 294, 301 (1998), the Supreme Court reconsidered <em>Bruton </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Marsh, </em>stating that \"[r]edactions [which] simply replace a name with an obvious blank space or a word such as \u2018deleted\u2019 or a symbol or other similarly obvious indications of alteration ... leave statements that ... closely resemble <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>unredacted statements\u201d and are similarly inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b244-7\">. Morris argues that, because the statement was not admissible against him had he been tried separately, the trial court was required, \"as a matter of law,\u201d to grant his severance request. In support of this assertion, Morris directs our attention to <em>Osburn v. State, </em>301 Md. 250, 482 A.2d 905 (1984). For joinder to be proper, a trial court first asks whether \"the evidence offered [is] mutually admissible as to each defendant____\" <em>Osburn, </em>301 Md. at 254, 482 A.2d at 907 (citing <em>McKnight v. State, </em>280 Md. 604, 375 A.2d 551 (1977)). If not, the trial court then considers the \"possibility of significant damagef, or prejudice,] ... by evidence ... admissible [only] against a co[-]defendant....\u201d <em>Eiland v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 56, 73, 607 A.2d 42 (1992), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Tyler v. State, </em>330 Md. 261, 623 A.2d 648 (1993). If the evidence is not mutually admissible and prejudices the defendant (against whom it is inadmissible), then severance is proper normally.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">. Stated another way, Morris's counsel (1) objected to the miscellaneous agreement, (2) raised confrontation right concerns, and (3) sought a severance as a consequence. Taken together, we think he fairly preserved the substance of some, but not all, of the question framed on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\">. As aptly stated by the Kentucky Supreme Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Stone, </em>291 S.W.3d 696, 700 (Ky.2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\"><em>Bruton, [Marsh </em>], and cases descending from them, address the dilemma that arises when two or more defendants are jointly tried, and one (or more) of them has made a voluntary out-of-court statement which the prosecution wishes to present as evidence at trial. While a defendant may be incriminated by his own voluntary out-of-court statement without offending the rule against hearsay or the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation ..., <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the use of such statements against another defendant violates the hearsay rule and, if the declarant is not subject to cross-examination, the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 129, 88 S.Ct. 1620....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\"><em>Crawford, </em>on the other hand, applies when the out-of-court statement is offered as evidence against a defendant other than the declarant. <em>Crawford </em>holds that a defendant is denied his Sixth Amendment right to confront his accusers by the introduction into evidence of an out-of-court \"testimonial statement\u201d made by a declarant who is unavailable for cross-examination. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 69, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\">.

The trial court held that obeying the law was an implicit condition of the agreement and, thereafter, imposed a sentence exceeding the agreed-upon ten years. <em>See Ogonowski, </em>87 Md.App. at 182, 589 A.2d at 518. The Court of Special Appeals held that \u201d[t]he agreement had limited terms\" and declined to rewrite it. <em>Ogonowski, </em>87 Md.App. at 184, 589 A.2d at 518.

To address the possible occurrence of a \u201cmanifest injustice,\u201d which may result from Williams's waiver of this right, the trial judge allowed creatively that, if necessary, Williams would get \"one or two\u201d challenges, and the State would thereafter get \u201chalf....\u201d This pressure valve was not utilized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">. The trial court\u2019s full comment at the sentencing hearing \u2014 in response to the State's assertion that \u201c[Williams] did not plead guilty, he did have a trial \u2014 was \"[w]ell, if we severed, they could still put your client's [Morris\u2019s] words in. So how does the presence of [Williams] who may have the right to a separate trial under <em>[Bruton </em>] if he were contesting guilt or innocense affect the presentation of the evidence that\u2019s admissible against your client?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b251-6\">. We are not commenting indirectly or negatively upon trial courts proceeding by way of an agreed statement of facts, joined with a not guilty plea. In such a situation, the defendant usually waives numerous rights, like the right to confront witnesses against him or her. That is because usually there is no one to confront; after all, there is no factual dispute. Thus, where \"[tjhere is no fact-finding function left to perform[, t]o render judgment, the court simply applies the law to the facts agreed upon.\u201d <em>Barnes v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 25, 35, 354 A.2d 499, 505 (1976). With these agreed statements, however, the defendants are contesting still their guilt and usually argue at least sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In the instant case, there were myriad, outstanding factual issues, the resolution of which required traditional trial mechanisms. <em>See id. </em>(intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial because, by offering only stipulated-to conflicting evidence, the parties deprived the judge/ fact-finder from evaluating the credibility of live witnesses or the reliability of evidence. As a result, \"there was no proper way to resolve the evidentiary conflicts ... to determine ultimate facts which would be sufficient in law to sustain a verdict of guilty\u201d). Moreover, Williams was not, in the final analysis, challenging his guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">. It appears the State and the trial judge envisioned the miscellaneous agreement as applying only to sentencing, regardless of on which counts the jury returned a guilty verdict against Williams. Williams's counsel wanted the attempted second-degree murder verdict vacated, however, because he feared it would impact adversely the conditions of his client\u2019s imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\">. Not only may this miscellaneous agreement be compared favorably to a plea agreement, but it may be distinguished from a sentencing cap. From the definition of the word \"cap,\u201d as well as our caselaw, <em>see generally Dixon v. State, </em>364 Md. 209, 772 A.2d 283 (2001), a sentencing cap provides a ceiling, which may not be surpassed by the trial judge, (continued ...) when he or she imposes a sentence. With the State\u2019s consent, however, the judge is able to impose a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">It would have been interesting to see the judge\u2019s and State\u2019s responses had the jury returned guilty verdicts against Williams only on the lesser counts. It is not clear, under the \"miscellaneous agreement,\u201d that the trial court had discretion to impose anything less than \"17, serve the first 10.\u201d For, while crafting the miscellaneous agreement, the trial judge explained that, at sentencing, \"you [will] receive your original bargain,\u201d which the State initially offered Williams. He did not state that \u201cyou will receive a sentence not more than 17, serve the first 10.\" Indeed, at the sentencing hearing, the State supported this supposition \u2014 \"it was my understanding that the Court had never made clear what counts, but only made clear what the sentence was.\u201d We deem this as further indication of the plea bargain-nature of the miscellaneous agreement. <em>See Chertkov v. State, </em>335 Md. 161, 175, 642 A.2d 232, 239 (1994) (\"[I]t is clear that a court that binds itself to fulfill the plea agreement thereby relinquishes his or her right to modify the sentence, thereby imposed, absent the consent of the parties, and, in particular, in the case of reducing the sentence, absent the consent of the State.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b254-9\">. In his opening statement, the prosecutor stated that, after the attempted robbery, \"Stewart Williams and [the third man] run around to the alley ... and Mr. [Seleany] loses sight. In that alley is a ... white Crown Victoria, being driven by Defendant Franklin Morris.\u201d Then, he observed that Williams waived his right to remain silent and gave police a statement, which details how \"he fled down towards Falls Road and got into a Crown Victoria and fled the scene.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. With respect to option two, if the State secured a guilty verdict against Williams, then his right to appeal would need to expire before the State could force him to testify against Morris. In the alternative, if the State obtained a guilty plea from Williams, then it would have him likely waive his right to appeal, as is customary in such circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">. Moreover, Williams was not permitted to and did not take the stand to testify in his own defense. As a result, the jury may have inferred that his pre-trial statement, in its entirety, was uncontested and true. This would have strengthened the prejudice against Morris who was trying, at least in part, to rebuff an implication of the statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b257-8\">. Seleany testified that one assailant wore a \u201cmask.\u201d Detective Conaway testified that a clothing item capable of being so described was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>recovered from Morris\u2019s car. More specifically, Detective Conaway stated that the item recovered \"was described on the scene of the robbery,\" a remark the admissibility of which we consider separately and later in this opinion for the guidance of the trial court on remand, should a new trial occur. Seleany also stated that there were two assailants \u2014 adding the presence of a driver suggests that the police should have found three people in the stopped white sedan, which they did. Officers Alvarez and Weiss observed that, after Alvarez activated his emergency lights, the white sedan sped up.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
