The Statute entitles a driver to challenge the order of suspension at a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). At that hearing, the MVA must present a prima facie case for suspension of the license. The question we decide in the present case is whether, as part of that prima facie case, the MVA must establish the validity of the test by providing evidence that the test was administered by a \u201cqualified person,\u201d as that term is defined and employed in Maryland Code (2009 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJP), and that the testing equipment was approved by a State toxicologist. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Statute does not require the MVA to present such evidence at the administrative hearing as part of its burden to present a prima facie case for suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">At 12:48 a.m. on July 23, 2008, Maryland State Trooper Kolle stopped Respondent, Brittany Faith Aiken, for traveling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>77 miles per hour in a 55-mile-per-hour zone on northbound 1-270. Trooper Kolle, upon talking to Respondent, detected a strong odor of alcohol on her breath. He conducted field sobriety tests, which Respondent failed. Trooper Kolle arrested Respondent on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and transported her to the State Police barracks in Rockville.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">When, as in the present case, an officer who has \u201cstop[ped] or detain[ed]\u201d a person whom the officer \u201chas reasonable grounds to believe is or has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,\u201d the officer is authorized under the Statute to request the driver to submit to a chemical breath test. <em>See </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(2). Trooper Kolle made that request of Respondent and informed her, also pursuant to the Statute, <em>see id., </em>of her right to refuse to submit to the breath test and, if she did, the resulting administrative sanctions. Trooper Kolle gave Respondent Form DR-15, titled \u201cAdvice of Rights DR-15,\u201d which also sets out this information and other rights afforded a driver under \u00a7 16-205.1.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent agreed to submit to a chemical breath test and signed the DR-15 form.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Sergeant Bowling of the Maryland State Police administered the breath test. The result of the test indicated Respondent\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was 0.16 at the time of testing. Consequently, Trooper Kolle issued Respondent an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Order of Suspension, in accordance with subsection (b)(3) of the Statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Trooper Kolle and Sergeant Bowling then completed and signed Form DR-15A, titled \u201cOfficer\u2019s Certification and Order of Suspension.\u201d By signing the form, the troopers affirmed under penalty of perjury that, inter alia: Trooper Kolle had reasonable grounds to believe that Respondent was operating her vehicle while impaired; Sergeant Bowling had explained to Respondent the testing procedures and found her to be cooperative; Sergeant Bowling administered the test using Intox EC/TR equipment; and, based on the test, Respondent\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was shown to be 0.16 at the time of testing. Trooper Kolle and Sergeant Bowling made those sworn statements pursuant to subsection (b)(3)(vii) of the Statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Also pursuant to that subsection, the State Police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>forwarded to the MVA Respondent\u2019s driver license, the completed Form DR-15, and the completed Form DR-15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\n<em>The show cause hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Respondent exercised her right to request a hearing before an ALJ, <em>see </em>TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(v)(l.), \u201cto show cause why [her] driver\u2019s license should not be suspended ... for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing[.]\u201d Respondent was represented by counsel at the hearing. The MVA appeared through its paper record, which consisted only of Form DR-15 and Form DR-15A. The MVA did not supply two documents that, we surmise from comments of counsel, the ALJ, and, later, the Circuit Court, are often included in such proceedings. We refer to the Maryland State Police Form 33 (\u201cMSP Form 33\u201d), titled \u201cNotification to Defendant of Result of Test for Alcohol Concentration,\u201d which contains, inter alia, (1) a certification that the testing equipment is approved, and (2) the Intox EC/IR testing strip produced during Respondent\u2019s test, which includes information related to the timing of the test and the identification of the testing instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The Statute expressly circumscribes the issues that can be litigated at the administrative hearing. The Statute provides in subsection (f)(7)(i) that \u201c[a]t a hearing under this section ... the only issues shall be\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-8\">1. Whether the police officer who stops or detains a person had reasonable grounds to believe the person was driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol, while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">2. Whether there was evidence of the use by the person of alcohol, any drug, any combination of drugs, a combination of one more drugs and alcohol, or a controlled dangerous substance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">3. Whether the police officer requested a test after the person was fully advised, as required under subsection (b)(2) of this section, of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">4. Whether the person refused to take the test;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">5. <em>Whether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-9\">6. <em>Whether the person drove or attempted to drive a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">7. If the hearing involves disqualification of a commercial driver\u2019s license, whether the person was operating a commercial motor vehicle or held a commercial driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">The General Assembly has authorized the MVA to adopt rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of the Statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Among those regulations are two that pertain to administrative hearings conducted pursuant to the Statute. COMAR 11.11.03.07 (Subpoena) permits a party to the administrative hearing to request issuance by the ALJ of \u201ca subpoena to require the attendance of witnesses or the production of documents,\u201d which the ALJ has the discretion to refuse \u201cif the testimony or evidence to be offered: (1) Is immaterial, irrelevant, or unduly repetitious; or (2) Does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>pertain to a genuine issue in the contested case.\u201d COMAR 11.11.03.08 (Hearing) provides in part B (Evidence) the following, pertinent to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">(5) For the purpose of determining the accuracy of the test result indicating the alcohol concentration of the licensee, the following breath testing instruments shall be deemed reliable indicators of the alcohol concentration of a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">(a) Breathalyzer Model 900;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">(b) Breathalyzer Model 900A.;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">(c) Intoximeter 3000; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">(d) Intox EC/IR.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">(6) There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the test result of a test of blood or breath indicating the alcohol concentration of the licensee is accurate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">(7) The reliability of breath testing instruments approved in \u00a7 B(5) of this regulation and the presumption established in \u00a7 B(6) of this regulation may not preclude a licensee from demonstrating that the specific breath testing instrument used to test the alcohol concentration of the licensee was malfunctioning at the time of testing, or that human error caused the test result to be inaccurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Respondent did not request, prior to the hearing, issuance of a subpoena for either Sergeant Bowling or any of the MVA documents generated in her case. Furthermore, during her testimony at the hearing, Respondent did not contradict the certifications of Trooper Kolle and Sergeant Bowling contained on the completed Form DR-15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-13\">Respondent nevertheless made a motion for \u201cNo Action.\u201d Respondent argued in support of the motion that the MVA\u2019s failure to produce the MSP Form 33 and the Intox EC/IR testing strip precluded a finding that the MVA had established a prima facie case for administrative suspension of her license.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Respondent argued that the sworn statement of Sergeant Bowling on the Form DR-15A did not reflect \u201cthat the ECIR was working properly,\u201d that \u201cit hasn\u2019t been shown that there were two tests that was [sic] run,\u201d and that the DR-15A form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>also \u201cdoesn\u2019t show when the twenty minute observation period was done or conducted, at all, which is obviously step one of the test, at least according to the Regulations of the Toxicologist.\u201d Respondent also pointed out that \u201c[t]he test strip [which the MVA did not make part of the administrative record][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] shows the twenty minute observation period; it shows the time when the observation period started.... And we can\u2019t tell from what\u2019s give[n] here whether the test was administered properly.\u201d Respondent asserted that the MSP Form 33 would \u201ccertif[y] that the equipment is approved by the toxicologist. The certification that the MVA submitted here says nothing about the testing equipment.... And it doesn\u2019t say here which test this technician gave to my client.... It just says ECIR. It doesn\u2019t give model number.\u201d Respondent argued that it cannot be known from the DR-15A whether the arresting officer, rather than the test technician, had conducted the twenty-minute observation period, if one even was conducted. Finally, Respondent argued that \u201cthere\u2019s no certification in the record that the ... administrator of the test is qualified under [\u00a7] 10-304 [of the CJP]\u201d and no certification of the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Respondent relied on subsection (a)(2) of the Statute to argue that the MVA\u2019s prima facie case must include evidence of compliance with sections 10-302 through 10-309 of the CJP. Subsection (a)(2) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a]ny person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway ... in this State is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol.,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The ALJ stated for the record, and Respondent\u2019s counsel agreed, that the motion for \u201cNo Action\u201d was being requested \u201cbecause of the failure of the [MVA] to include the notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>defendant [of] a test result (i.e., the MSP Form 33) and the test strip.\u201d The ALJ denied the motion, reaffirming his ruling earlier in the hearing that \u201cthe failure, if there was one, would be an affirmative defense and you would have to show if it wasn\u2019t complied with.\u201d We infer that the ALJ was referring to Respondent\u2019s failure to present any such evidence, notwithstanding that the regulations provided Respondent with the means to do so. The decision of the ALJ also reflects his reliance on subsection (f)(7)(ii) of the Statute, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANf\">The sworn statement of the police officer and of the test technician or analyst shall be prima facie evidence of a test refusal, a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing, or a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The ALJ, noting that he \u201c[hadn\u2019t] heard anything which makes me believe that [the relevant provisions of the CJP] weren\u2019t followed,\u201d ruled that \u201ccompletion of the certification [on Form DR-15A] is prima facie that there\u2019s been a following of the rules.\u201d The ALJ concluded that the completed DR-15A form satisfied the prima facie case because the form indicated that Respondent had been advised properly of her rights and the alcohol concentration test was administered in accordance \u25a0with relevant regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the ALJ complied with the requirements of the Statute that certain findings be made.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>In particular, the ALJ found that an \u201cofficer requested that the Licensee take a test as defined in Maryland Transportation 16-205.1(a)(l)(iii) and that she scored a .16 grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.\u201d As provided by subsection (b)(l)(i)(2) of the Statute, the ALJ suspended Respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license for 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\n<em>Judicial review in the Circuit Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Respondent filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a petition for judicial review of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h) of the State Government Article. Respondent reduced the arguments she made before the ALJ to the single contention that the MVA failed to make a prima facie case for license suspension because there is no evidence in the record either that a \u201cqualified person\u201d administered the test or that the testing equipment had been approved by a State toxicologist, as provided in CJP \u00a7 10-804. That section provides that a breath test \u201cshall be administered by a qualified person with equipment approved by the toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission,\u201d and defines \u201cqualified person\u201d as \u201ca person who has received training in the use of the equipment in a training program approved by the toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission.... \u201d Respondent argued that, because the DR-15 and DR-15A forms the troopers signed in the present case contain no such express certifications, the ALJ should have sustained the motion for \u201cNo Action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">The MVA, which was represented by counsel before the Circuit Court, disagreed with Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the Statute. The MVA directed the court to the language of TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f)(7)(ii) (providing in pertinent part that the \u201csworn statement\u201d of the officer and test technician shall be prima facie evidence of a test result indicating an alcohol <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing) and argued that the DR-15A form that was presented to the ALJ sufficed to establish a prima facie case for administrative license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The Circuit Court agreed with Respondent\u2019s view that the MVA\u2019s prima facie case must include evidence that a qualified person administered the test and that testing equipment approved by the State toxicologist was used. The court reversed the decision of the ALJ, ruling that there was not \u201csubstantial and competent\u201d evidence of those facts in the administrative agency record.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The MVA filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which we granted, <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Aiken, </em>409 Md. 47, 972 A.2d 861 (2009), to address the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">Where the evidence presented to the ALJ included prima facie evidence of a test result in the form of a sworn statement by a test technician or analyst that a driver had a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more, as provided in TR \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(f) (7) (ii), did the circuit court err in finding a lack of competent material and substantial evidence to support suspension of the driver\u2019s license on the ground that the record did not also include various other evidence that is not required by the statute, specifically, (a) a certification that the approved test equipment was used and that the technician or analyst is a \u2018qualified person\u2019; (b) the actual test strip used in the test; and (c) corroboration of the test results on a separate form, MSP-33?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">The MVA asks us to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court on the ground that, contrary to that court\u2019s ruling, there exists substantial evidence supporting the administrative suspension of Respondent\u2019s license. The MVA identifies the crux of the issue before us as whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record of an un-rebutted prima facie case for suspension of Respondent\u2019s driver\u2019s license. In arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>that the record presents a prima facie case, the MVA takes the position that \u201cthe sworn statement at the bottom of the form [DR-15A] satisfies the statutory requirement [of the prima facie case] under \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(ii).\u201d The MVA finds support for that position in the plain language of the Statute, its legislative history, the statutory scheme of which it is a part, and this Court\u2019s cases on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Respondent counters with the arguments she made to the ALJ and the Circuit Court. She argues that more is required of the prima facie case for administrative license suspension under the Statute than was presented by the MVA in this case; specifically, the MVA is obligated to present evidence (not included in the currently worded DR-15A certification) that the test technician is a \u201cqualified person,\u201d as defined in CJP \u00a7 10-304(a)(3), and the breath test was performed on \u201cequipment approved by the toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission,\u201d as provided in CJP \u00a7 10-304(b)(1). Respondent relies in support of that argument on the reference in subsection (a)(2) of the Statute, which states in pertinent part that the driver\u2019s consent to the test is \u201csubject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d For the reasons we shall explain, the MVA has the better part of the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Judicial review of administrative decision-making \u201cis constrained.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 14, 997 A.2d 768, 775 (2010) (citing <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Delawter, </em>403 Md. 243, 256-57, 941 A.2d 1067, 1076 (2008)); <em>see also </em>Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222(h)(3) of the State Government Article (\u201cSG\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The role of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the courts in administrative agency review can be summarized by the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is not to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency. Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO\"><em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 14-15, 997 A.2d at 775-76 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">This case involves the ALJ\u2019s interpretation and application of the Statute, which the MYA administers. Accordingly, we will review the ALJ\u2019s decision for legal correctness, giving appropriate weight to the MVA\u2019s interpretation of the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The legal question we decide in this case requires us to discern the intent of the General Assembly in enacting the Statute. That undertaking</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad_\">begins with the language of the statute as the primary source of legislative intent. When the language is clearly consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute and the result is not absurd, we have held that no further inquiry into legislative intent is required. Beyond plain meaning, the purpose of the statute may be ascertained by examining the Legislature\u2019s statement of a statute\u2019s purposes, and courts may consider other \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d indicating the legislative intent. The language of a statute cannot be divorced from its context. [Thus], even where the language of the statute is plain, its meaning is controlled by its context. In short, the statutory language must be construed in light of and governed by its context within the overall statutory scheme. An appellate court may consider evidence such as a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the Legislature, and its relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s goal in enacting the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\"><em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Lytle, </em>374 Md. 37, 57, 821 A.2d 62, 73-74 (2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Before addressing the particular question of statutory interpretation at issue here, we restate the legislative purpose behind the Statute. That purpose is \u201c \u2018to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and to protect public safety by encouraging drivers to take alcohol concentration tests; the [S]tatute [is] not meant to protect drivers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 15-16, 997 A.2d at 776 (quoting <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 255, 923 A.2d 100, 108 (2007) (citing <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Richards, </em>356 Md. 356, 374, 739 A.2d 58, 68 (1999))); <em>accord Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 179, 844 A.2d 388, 397 (2004). The Statute is remedial in nature, and its purposes, stated more particularly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>are, first, to help effectuate the administrative goals of the MVA in ridding Maryland roadways of drunk drivers and, second, to encourage both general compliance with Maryland law as well as specific fulfillment of the consent to taking a properly requested chemical breath test implied by a motorist\u2019s entry upon and usage of this State\u2019s roads.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYT\"><em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 374, 739 A.2d at 68. To that end, the General Assembly crafted the Statute to provide for \u201cspeedy Administrative sanctions [that] would help the offender to recognize the cause and effect relationship between the offense and the sanction which would otherwise be weakened by lengthy delays in the court processes.\u201d <em>Lytle, </em>374 Md. at 63, 821 A.2d at 77 (quoting Governor\u2019s Legislative Office, \u201cPositive Aspects of Administrative Per Se,\u201d House Bill 556 (1989)). The procedures attendant to administrative license suspension under the Statute, moreover, are \u201cintended to be informal and summary in nature.\u201d <em>Richards, </em>356 Md. at 376-77, 739 A.2d at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The question before us deals with the prima facie case the Statute requires the MVA to present at the administrative hearing. The answer to that question is straightforward, and is found in the plain language of subsection (f)(7)(ii) of the Statute. To repeat, that subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-6\">The sworn statement of the police officer and of the test technician or analyst shall be prima facie evidence of a test refusal, a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing, or a test result indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The content of the \u201csworn statement\u201d required by subsection (f)(7)(ii) is detailed in subsection (b)(3)(viii). <em>See supra </em>note 4. That subsection provides that the \u201csworn statement\u201d the police officer is required to forward to the MVA must state in pertinent part that the person detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol either refused the test, or as here, \u201csubmitted to the test\u201d and the test \u201cindicated an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Form DR-15A contains a \u201cCERTIFICATION OF POLICE OFFICER,\u201d that includes in pertinent part the following preprinted language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">I certify under penalty of perjury that the contents of the foregoing document [which recounts the officer\u2019s reasonable grounds for detaining a person on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol] are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information and belief, and after being fully advised of sanctions that shall be imposed as provided in the Advice of Rights Form DR-15, the person described above (1) refused to take a test to determine alcohol concentration when requested by this officer, [or] (2) was tested and the test result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, as indicated above....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The preprinted language in the \u201cCERTIFICATION OF TEST TECHNICIAN OR ANALYST\u201d portion of Form DR-15A sets forth all the components of the \u201csworn statement\u201d required by TR \u00a7 16-205.1(b)(3)(vii).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The certification language states: \u201cI do solemnly declare and affirm, under penalty of perjury, and upon personal knowledge that I performed a test for alcohol concentration on the person described above and the test results were 0__from the Intox EC/IR.\u201d The certification contains boxes for the tester to check to indicate whether the \u201cTesting procedure was explained!,]\u201d the \u201cPerson appeared in good health!,]\u201d and if there was a \u201cRefusal-Insufficient Breath!,]\u201d in which case the tester \u201cfurther certifies] that the driver refused to take a test when the driver failed to provide sufficient breath samples for analysis.\u201d There follows space for the test technician to provide an \u201cEXPLANATION: (Specify instructions issued and behavior of driver).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>In the present case, the certifications on the Form DR-15A were signed by Trooper Kolle and Sergeant Bowling. By his signature on the certification Trooper Kolle certified, among other things, that Respondent was tested and the test result indicated a blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.08. Sergeant Bowling, in turn, certified, among other things, that Respondent\u2019s test produced a 0.16 blood alcohol concentration.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The DR-15A form containing the certifications of Trooper Kolle and Sergeant Bowling satisfies the requirements of the subsection (f)(7)(ii) \u201csworn statement.\u201d That subsection, moreover, could not be more plain in providing that the MVA\u2019s prima facie case requires only those sworn statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Notwithstanding the clarity with which the General Assembly has spoken in subsection (f)(7)(ii) of the Statute, Respondent argues that the MVA also must establish that the test result was obtained by a \u201cqualified person\u201d using equipment approved by the State toxicologist, as set forth in CJP \u00a7 10-304. As noted, Respondent relies for this proposition on the prefatory language contained in subsection (a)(2) of the Statute that \u201c[a]ny person who drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle on a highway ... is deemed to have consented, subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, to take a test if the person should be detained on suspicion of driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol____\u201d Respondent\u2019s reliance on this language is poorly placed, for any of several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">To begin, the Statute, when viewed in its entirety, undercuts Respondent\u2019s argument. Although we have commented that the provisions of the Statute and CJP \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309 are to be read \u201cin pari materia,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Dove, </em>413 Md. 70, 81, 991 A.2d 65, 71 (2010) (citing <em>Lowry v. State, </em>363 Md. 357, 368-69, 768 A.2d 688, 694 (2001)); <em>see also Lytle, </em>374 Md. at 43, 821 A.2d at 65 (quoting the language of subsection (a)(2) of the Statute for the proposition that the \u201cTransportation Article authorizes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>tests \u2018subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-302 through 10-309, inclusive, of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article\u2019 \u201d), it does not follow from these observations that every subsection of the Statute impliedly incorporates and requires compliance with one or more of those CJP sections. Tellingly, the Statute plainly identifies which of its many provisions require compliance with the strictures of one or another of those sections of the CJP, and subsection (f)(7)(ii) is not among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Subsection (c) of the Statute, which addresses testing for alcohol concentration of a person who has been involved in an accident involving a death or serious bodily injury of another person, provides that the officer, with the requisite reasonable grounds, may direct the person to submit to a breath test or blood test or both, and, <em>if the detaining officer so directs, </em>then \u201cthe provisions of \u00a7 10-304 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article shall apply.\u201d Subsection (g) of the Statute (entitled \u201cWithdrawal of initial refusal to take test; subsequent consent\u201d) also refers expressly to \u00a7 10-304 of the CJP. That subsection states that the AL J, in determining whether a person properly withdrew his or her initial refusal and consented to take the test, may examine a number of factors, among which are \u201c[wjhether a qualified person, as defined in \u00a7 10-304 of the [CJP], to administer the test and testing equipment were readily available,\u201d see (g)(3)(ii), and \u201c[w]hether the delay in testing would have interfered with the attention to other duties of the arresting officer or a qualified person, as defined in \u00a7 10-304 of the [CJP],\u201d <em>see </em>(g)(3)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In contrast, subsection (f)(7)(ii) of the Statute, at issue in the present case, makes no mention of the requirements of CJP \u00a7 10-304, much less that those requirements must be met to establish a prima facie case for administrative license suspension. If the General Assembly intended for the prima facie case to include a showing that the test was administered by a \u201cqualified person,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 10-304 of the CJP, \u201cwith equipment approved by the toxicologist under the Postmortem Examiners Commission,\u201d as further prescribed by \u00a7 10-304, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>surely the General Assembly knew precisely how to do it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Our construction of subsection (f)(7)(ii) is further supported by the reasoning we employed in <em>Jones, </em>380 Md. 164, 844 A.2d 388, to reject a similar effort by a licensee to require more of the prima facie case than is set forth in subsection (f)(7)(ii). It was argued in <em>Jones </em>that, when a person has refused to take a breath test, the MVA must establish at the show cause hearing that the arresting officer complied with the requirement of CJP \u00a7 10-303, which provides that the chemical breath test of the driver must be taken within two hours of his or her apprehension. <em>Jones, </em>380 Md. at 175, 844 A.2d at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We made several points in rejecting that argument. We observed that the issues that can be raised at the administrative hearing are limited to those grounds expressly set forth in TR \u00a7 16-205.1(f)(7)(i), and that compliance with the two-hour testing window was not listed as one of those cognizable issues. <em>Jones, </em>380 Md. at 177, 844 A.2d at 395-96. We also looked to subsection (f)(8)(i) of the Statute, which mandates suspension of the driver\u2019s license if the ALJ makes four expressly stated findings, none of which addresses the timing of the test. <em>Jones, </em>380 Md. at 177-78, 844 A.2d at 396; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>supra </em>note 7. Finally, we observed that a \u201cplain language interpretation limiting the (f)(7)(i) factors to those specifically enumerated in the statute is in line with\u201d the purpose of the Statute, which is to provide \u201ca swift penalty which is separate from any criminal penalties that may be imposed for the driving offenses,\u201d by implementing \u201cprocedures that would be an expedient and effective deterrent and sanction against drunk driving.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>380 Md. at 178-79, 844 A.2d at 396-97 (citations omitted). For those reasons, we held in <em>Jones </em>that compliance with the two-hour window testing requirement set forth in CJP \u00a7 10-303(a)(2) is <em>not </em>required to be a part of the MVA\u2019s prima facie case for administrative license suspension. <em>Id. </em>at 179, 844 A.2d at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Much of the reasoning we employed in <em>Jones </em>serves equally well to rebut the arguments Respondent presents here. We begin with the final point made in <em>Jones, </em>that the Statute \u201cwas written to provide, in cases of drunk driving, a swift penalty which is separate from any criminal penalties that may be imposed for the driving offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 178, 844 A.2d at 396 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Legislature furthers this legislative purpose by providing that the prima facie case requires only the sworn statements of the detaining police officer and the technician who administered the test, attesting to either the person\u2019s refusal to take the test, or a test result indicating a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 (or 0.15) or more at the time of testing. Moreover, much as we reasoned in <em>Jones, </em>the findings the ALJ must make before directing that the person\u2019s license be suspended do not include a finding that the testing was done by a \u201cqualified person,\u201d as defined in CJP \u00a7 10-304(a)(3), with equipment authorized by the toxicologist, as required by CJP \u00a7 10-304(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> All that is required under subsection (f)(8) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>this regard is a finding by the ALJ, in the case of a person who has taken the test, that \u201c[a] test to determine alcohol concentration was taken and the test result indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more at the time of testing.\u201d See (f)(8)(i)(4.).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Even further support for our conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to incorporate the certification requirements of CJP \u00a7 10-304 in administrative license suspension situations is found in the fact that license suspension occurs automatically, solely on the basis of the test result as it appears on the DR-15A form, whenever a person opts <em>not </em>to contest the test result. It defies common sense to conclude, as Respondent evidently would have us do, that the General Assembly places upon the MVA a greater burden of making out a prima facie case for suspension when the driver requests a show-cause hearing than is required when the driver does not seek to contest the certified test result.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Undeniably, in the present case, the MVA did not present to the ALJ the Intox EC/IR strip produced during Respondent\u2019s breath test. That strip, we assume, would have identified specifically the testing equipment used and <em>theoretically </em>have been useful in challenging the accuracy of the alcohol concentration test.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Equally certain, however, is that Respondent, and any other person in her position, was entitled to request from the ALJ, prior to the hearing, a subpoena for production of the document. <em>See supra </em>p. 6; COMAR 11.11.03.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In other words, Respondent and any similarly situated person is entitled to and has the means with which to attempt to <em>rebut </em>the presumption of reliability of the breath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>test result.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But the Statute does not mandate that the MVA establish the validity of the test, as part of its prima facie case. To the contrary, and for all the reasons we have discussed, the Statute expressly provides that the technician\u2019s and the officer\u2019s sworn statements, without more, establish a prima facie case of drunken driving, for purposes of administrative license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We have said that, in the present case, Sergeant Bowling administered the test, the result of which indicated that Respondent had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.16 at the time of testing. The sergeant signed the sworn certification on the Form DR-15A, attesting to the facts that he performed the test, explained the procedures, and the test result from the EC/IR instrument was 0.16. Trooper Kolle also included the test results in his sworn certification that appears on the Form DR-15A. The MVA offered that form at the administrative hearing and, based on the sworn statements in it, the ALJ correctly found that the MVA had made a prima facie showing of Respondent\u2019s drunk driving. Because that finding was supported by substantial evidence, the ALJ properly suspended Respondent\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ADMINISTRATION.
