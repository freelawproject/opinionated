We must decide whether and, if so, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>when persons, assumedly aggrieved by the Board of County Commissioners of Kent County\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> approval of a growth allocation request to amend the County\u2019s local Critical Area Plan under the regulatory scheme of the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program, Maryland Code (1990, 2007 RepLVol.), Natural Resources Article \u00a7\u00a7 8-1801 <em>et seq., </em>may seek judicial review of that approval. Jerry Smith and a number of other Kent County residents (collectively, \u201cPetitioners\u201d) question here the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s dismissal of their appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Kent County, which affirmed the County\u2019s approval of a growth allocation application by Drayton Manor, LLC (the Developer), to allow increased development of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The problem in this case arises from a proclamation that states that the County\u2019s decision is not effective until approved by the State Critical Area Commission (the Commission). Apparently while consideration of the local growth allocation approval by the County was pending before the Commission, Petitioners sought judicial review in the Circuit Court of the County\u2019s decision. The Circuit Court affirmed the County\u2019s approval, and Petitioners thereafter filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. After requesting specific briefing on the finality of the County\u2019s approval vis \u00e1 vis the ability to maintain a judicial review action, the intermediate appellate court, by order, dismissed the appeal as premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Before us, Petitioners argue generally that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">The [County\u2019s] approval of the Developer\u2019s application for growth allocation was a final, appealable order because it terminated the case before the [County]. Furthermore, the [Commission's subsequent review of the growth allocation does not affect the appealability of the [County\u2019s] decision because the [Commission] and the County conduct separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>reviews, apply different standards and develop different records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In response, the County maintains that the intermediate appellate court\u2019s dismissal of Petitioners\u2019 appeal was correct, considering \u201c[t]hat decision <em>[ie., </em>the County\u2019s approval] was not a final, appealable act because the proposed program amendment was required by law to be reviewed and approved by the Critical Area Commission before it could have any legal effect.\u201d The Commission filed an amicus brief generally supporting Petitioners\u2019 position regarding their ability to seek judicial review of the County approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">We hold that the County\u2019s approval of Drayton Manor\u2019s growth allocation request was not a final action, considering that the Commission\u2019s required decision may modify, reject, delay, or even preclude the local approval from becoming effective. As a non-final order, even assuming that a right to seek judicial review existed (a premise with which we do not agree, for reasons to be explained), no immediate right existed to have judicial review take place. Accordingly, although the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s appeal to that court was in the right church, it was in the wrong pew. It should have gone further and, as explained more fully <em>infra, </em>endorsed dismissal by the Circuit Court of the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">STATUTORY BACKGROUND, FACTS, AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">A. <em>Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">The General Assembly established the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Critical Area Protection Program (\u201cCritical Area Program\u201d or Program), Md.Code (1990, 2007 RepLVol.), Natural Resources Article \u00a7\u00a7 8-1801 <em>et seq., </em>in 1984, in recognition of the Chesapeake Bay\u2019s importance and the State\u2019s and local governments\u2019 role in its future health, and in response to then-growing concerns over the deteriorating condition of what the Legislature deemed \u201cnatural re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>sources of great significance to the State and the nation.... \u201d Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1801 (a)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The Critical Area Program \u201crequire[s] all local jurisdictions, under the direction of [the] Chesapeake Bay Critical Area Commission, to formulate and implement a plan to control development in the \u2018critical\u2019 or protected area.\u201d <em>Critical Area Comm\u2019n for the Chesapeake and Atl. Coastal Bays v. Moreland, LLC, </em>418 Md. 111, 117, 12 A.3d 1223, 1226 (2011). The Critical Area Program\u2019s primary mechanism for protecting the Bay is limiting development in statutorily defined \u201ccritical areas,\u201d Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1807, where unchecked human growth could cause harm to the Bay. The Program establishes a development-free \u201cbuffer of at least 100 feet landward from the mean high water line of tidal waters, tributary streams, and tidal wetlands....\u201d Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1801(a)(4). The Program requires local governments to zone all critical areas as one of three tiers: (1) Resource Conservation Area (\u201cRCA\u201d), <em>see </em>COMAR \u00a7 27.01.02.05; (2) Limited Development Area (\u201cLDA\u201d), <em>see </em>COMAR \u00a7 27.01.02.04; or (3) Intensely Developed Area (\u201cIDA\u201d), <em>see </em>COMAR \u00a7 27.01.02.03. The amount of growth in ID As and LDAs allowed in each jurisdiction\u2019s \u201ccritical area\u201d is known as the county\u2019s \u201cgrowth allocation.\u201d <em>See </em>Nat. Res. Art. 8-1802(a)(ll) (\u201c \u2018Growth allocation\u2019 means the number of acres of land in the Chesapeake Bay Critical Area that a local jurisdiction may use to create new intensely developed areas and new limited development areas.\u201d). Each county\u2019s growth allocation is capped at five percent of its RCA. Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1808.1(b). In each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>jurisdiction, these Critical Area Zones overlay the pre-existing zoning; that is, local zoning ordinances must comply with the Program, but may add additional zoning conditions or restrictions. <em>See Bucktail, LLC v. County Council of Talbot County, </em>352 Md. 530, 535, 723 A.2d 440, 442 (1999); <em>see also Md. Overpak Corp. v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>395 Md. 16, 26 n. 10, 909 A.2d 235, 241 n. 10 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The Program is complicated by the division of responsibilities in its implementation between the State and local governments. <em>See </em>Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1801(b)(2) (stating that implementation of the Program is to be done \u201con a cooperative basis between the State and affected local governments\u201d). While \u201ceach local jurisdiction ... ha[s] primary responsibility for developing and implementing a [local] program,\u201d such responsibility is \u201csubject to review and approval by the Commission.\u201d Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1808(a); <em>see </em>Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1808.1(c)(2) (stating that the Commission shall ensure that the local plan is \u201cconsistent with the purposes, policies, goals, and provisions of th[e Critical Area Program]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">After the adoption by a local government of its initial plan, all changes to the local plan, including growth allocation amendment requests, are subjected to a two-tiered approval process, similar to the process for the initial plan adoption. The local government, in considering growth allocation amendment requests, is governed by guidelines set forth in Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1808.1(c)(l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If the local government rejects a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>growth allocation request, the application is terminated and the Commission plays no role because there is nothing for it to review. If, however, the local government approves a growth allocation request (with or without restrictions/conditions), the Commission must \u201censure that the guidelines ... have been applied in a manner that is consistent with the purposes, policies, goals, and provisions of [the Program].\u201d Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1808.1(c)(2). On review, the Commission may approve the request, deny the request, approve the request subject to conditions, or return the request to the local government with a list of changes to be made. <em>See </em>Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1809(o )(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">B. <em>Kent County\u2019s Critical Area Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Kent County\u2019s initial Critical Area plan \u201cwas approved by the Critical Area Commission on January 20,1988 and became effective on April 12\u201d of that year. <em>Wharf at Handy\u2019s Point, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res., </em>92 Md.App. 659, 663, 610 A.2d 314, 316 (1992). The Kent County Critical Area Plan is incorporated into Kent County\u2019s Land Ordinance, where the balance of Kent County\u2019s zoning and planning provisions reside. <em>See </em>Kent County Land Use Ordinance, http://www.kentcounty. com/gov/planzone/newzone/Partl_A10.pdf (last visited 7 February 2011). As such, the local plan is a part of a public local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">Growth allocation amendment requests in Kent County purportedly also are governed by the Kent County Growth Allocation Policy (\u201cthe Policy\u201d), adopted initially by the County on 9 March 1999. More will be said about the circumstances of the adoption of the Policy later. The Policy reiterates that the County Board of Commissioners has the authority to grant growth allocation requests in the \u201cincorporate[d] towns\u201d and the \u201cunincorporated territory\u201d of Kent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>County. For growth allocation requests in the unincorporated territory to be approved, the Policy provides that an applicant must meet the following conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">1. The proposed project is identified in the Kent County Comprehensive Plan as a means to expand and provide more diversity in the size, number, and type of businesses in Kent County or as a means to enhance and expand locally based tourism that relies upon the unique natural, cultural, and historic features and qualities of Kent County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">2. Proposed projects are suitable for the sensitive location and pose minimal risks to the environment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">3. The project is compatible with the surrounding community and land use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">4. Site location and development will use innovative design features to minimize negative impacts on water quality, habitat protection areas, woodlands, and forests. Examples include but are not limited to the use of buffer areas to protect habitat, wildlife corridors, and other important natural areas, the use of conservation landscapes or bays-capes, and limitation of impervious surfaces through clustering and shared roadways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">5. The proposed project is consistent with the goals and intent of the Kent County Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision Ordinance, and Critical Area Program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">6. The proposed project must accomplish two of the following standards to mitigate the negative effects caused by higher intensity development than normally allowed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-11\">a. The project is within a developed area such as a village.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-12\">b. The project has direct access to public sewer and water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-13\">c. Man-made structures on the site are clustered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-14\">d. Efforts are made to enhance the habitat of threatened or endangered species or species in need of protections beyond the minimum required standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>e. Permanent environmental easements are donated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-4\">f. All agricultural lands on the site are placed into a protective easement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">g. Public access to natural and physical amenities is provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">h. The development uses infill or existing structures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">i. Habitat for forest interior dwelling birds and/or other sensitive species is created or expanded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-8\">j. The restoration, enhancement or creation of wetlands are included in the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-9\">k. Afforestation/reforestation is provided beyond the minimum required standards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-10\">l. Historic structures are restored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-11\">m. Buildings are designed to reflect the heritage of Kent County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">Significantly, the Policy, as originally adopted, purports to provide for an aggrieved person a right to seek judicial review of the County\u2019s decision on a growth allocation amendment. The Policy states that \u201c[a]ny aggrieved person with standing may within thirty (30) days after the decision[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] appeal[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] to the Circuit Court of Maryland.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, the Policy provides that \u201c[applications for growth allocation shall not be effective until approve[d by the Commission] under Natural Resources Article 8-1809....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>C. <em>Drayton Manor\u2019s Growth Allocation Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Drayton Manor is a 32-acre tract, improved by a farmhouse, supporting buildings, and a small retreat center, in Kent County. The property is located on Still Pond, which drains into the Chesapeake Bay. Since 1965, the retreat center use of Drayton Manor had a maximum capacity of twenty beds, and had been used for small, religious retreats. In 2003, however, the owners sought to develop the property into a \u201cRetreat Center, Spa &amp; Conference Center\u201d which would intensify meaningfully the property\u2019s use.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">Because the proposed use of the tract, classified as RCA, exceeded the County\u2019s Critical Area Program\u2019s development restrictions for the property, the Developer sought a growth allocation to reclassify the property to IDA. The County held a hearing on the request on 23 January 2007. The request was granted, subject to thirty-four explicit restrictions/conditions, on 27 March 2007. Thereafter, on 23 April 2007, Petitioners filed the present judicial review action in the Circuit Court for Kent County. The Circuit Court, in a 4 March 2008 memorandum opinion, considered the list of Petitioners\u2019 claims and affirmed the County\u2019s decision to approve conditionally the Developer\u2019s growth allocation request.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Petitioners appealed timely to the Court of Special Appeals. On 30 September 2009, the intermediate appellate court dismissed Petitioners\u2019 appeal on the ground that it was premature to seek judicial review of the County\u2019s action, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">The Kent County Commissioner\u2019s decision was subject to approval by the Critical Area Commission and was not \u201ceffective\u201d at the time it was issued. Under applicable law governing the Chesapeake and Atlantic Bays Critical Area Program, the Commissioners\u2019 grant of the growth allocation was not final because it was not \u201ceffective\u201d at the time it was granted----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Petitioners filed timely a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with this Court on 5 November 2009. Before we could act on the Petition, however, on 1 December 2009, the County amended the Policy to \u201cclarify the time period in which an aggrieved person may appeal a decision of the County Commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>regarding a Growth Allocation application.\u201d The amended Policy reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-4\">Any aggrieved person with standing may, within thirty (30) days after the decision, file a petition for judicial review of the decision with the Circuit Court for Kent County, Maryland pursuant to Rules 7-201 et seq. of the Maryland Rules of Procedure. If the decision in which judicial review is sought is the granting of Growth Allocation, the decision shall not be considered final until approved by the Critical Area[ ] Commission ... is obtained, and the petition shall be filed within thirty (30) days of such approval.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-5\">Applications for growth allocation shall not be effective until approved by the Critical Area Commission for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays pursuant to Article 8-1809 of the Natural Resources Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, as the same may be amended from time to time.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">On 18 December 2009, we granted Petitioners\u2019 Petition for Writ of Certiorari, <em>Smith v. Kent County, </em>411 Md. 740, 985 A.2d 538 (2009), to consider the sole question posed: whether \u201cthe decision of the County Commissioners of Kent County, Maryland[,] to approve an application for growth allocation [is] a final, appealable decision despite the fact that it was conditioned upon an approval by the Critical Area Commission.\u201d In rebanee on the 1 December 2009 amendment of the \u201cappeal\u201d provisions of the Policy, the County moved this Court on 30 December 2009 to dismiss the case as moot. According to the County, the question for which we issued our writ of certiorari became moot when the County made \u201cclear\u201d in the 1 December 2009 amendment to the Pobcy that judicial review was not authorized until the Commission acted. Petitioners, in a response filed on 11 January 2010, opposed dismissal, arguing that the County should not be allowed to change the \u201claw\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>the Pobcy) \u201cto defeat a citizen\u2019s challenge to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>government\u2019s action.\u201d Moreover, if the action was dismissed, Petitioners declaimed that \u201cthe [c]itizens will be precluded from challenging the County\u2019s decision to grant the growth allocation because the Critical Area Commission does not consider the same criteria as the County.\u201d We deferred action on the motion to dismiss until oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Notwithstanding this timeline with respect to the judicial review action of the County action, a parallel dimension evolved with respect to the Commission\u2019s consideration of the County\u2019s approval of the growth allocation. As noted <em>swpra, </em>apparently while consideration of the local growth allocation approval by the County was pending before the Commission, Petitioners filed their judicial review action in the Circuit Court from the County\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On 27 April 2007, the Commission requested additional information from the County. On 1 August 2007, it requested certain changes be made to the Developer\u2019s growth allocation application. A panel of the Commission (\u201cthe Panel\u201d) held a hearing on 30 May 2008, <em>see </em>Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 8-1809(o )(1),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to consider whether Dray-ton Manor\u2019s request was consistent with the Critical Area Program. At that time, the Panel requested Commission staff to research additional information on a number of topics attendant to the Drayton Manor request.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On 4 June 2008, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the Panel recommended to the full Commission that the growth allocation request be approved with various additional conditions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>Petitioners filed, on or about 2 July 2008 in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, a petition for judicial review of the presumed 4 June 2008 approval by the Commission of the County\u2019s local program growth allocation amendment for Drayton Manor.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Kent County, possibly for venue reasons, and surfaced on the docket of that court on or about 16 October 2009.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Commission moved in the Circuit Court to dismiss that petition on two grounds: (1) the underlying governmental proceedings and action were quasi-legislative in nature <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and, therefore, not subject to scrutiny in a petition for judicial review proceeding; and (2) there is no provision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Md.Code (2000, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Natural Resources Article \u00a7\u00a7 8-1801 \u2014 8-1817, authorizing specially judicial review of the Commission\u2019s action on a proposed local program amendment. Agreeing with the Commission\u2019s first ground, the Circuit Court, by order of 8 March 2010 and supporting memorandum opinion, dismissed the action. The Court of Special Appeals has no record of an appeal being taken by Petitioners from this dismissal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Considering the rather convoluted procedural posture of the parties\u2019 disputes, it may be beneficial to render the relevant events in a summary and comparative chronological order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7O\">\n<em>COMPARATIVE TIMELINES</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\n<em>Kent County Action State Commission Action</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>3/9/99 Board adopts by resolution Growth Allocation Policy (the Policy), including apparent \u201cappeal\u201d opportunity from local growth allocation amendment action</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">3/27/07 Board approves by resolution growth allocation amendment proposal for Drayton Manor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">4/23/07 Petitioners file petition for judicial review in Circuit Court for Kent County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">3/4/08 Circuit Court affirms Board action on merits</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">4/3/08 Petitioners file appeal to Court of Special Appeals (COSA)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">6/4/08 Panel of State Critical Area Commission recommends approval of County\u2019s proposed amendment, with revised conditions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-13\">7/2/08 Petitioners file petition for judicial review in Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9P8\">10/16/09 9/30/09 COSA dismisses appeal because of prematurity in seeking judicial review of County\u2019s action that was not effective until State Commission acted on it Case transferred to Circuit Court for Kent County</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-15\">12/1/09 County amends the Policy to make \u201cclear\u201d that \u201cappeal\u201d is authorized only from final State approval of locally approved proposal to amend local plan</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>12/18/09 Court of Appeals (COA) issues writ of certiorari</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">12/30/09 County moves in COA to dismiss case as moot in view of amended Policy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">1/11/10 COA defers ruling on motion to dismiss pending oral argument</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">3/8/10 Circuit Court, on State Commission\u2019s motion, dismisses petition as not authorized because State action was quasi-legislative; <em>no appeal to COSA taken</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">9/8/10 Oral argument in Court of Appeals, during which no mention was made by parties (State Commission did not participate) of the existence or disposition of the judicial review action from the State action</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">I.

Thus, in the present case, the only possible legislative source purporting to supply such special authorization is the Kent County Policy, seemingly adopted initially by resolution of the County Commissioners on 9 March 1999, and amended by resolution on 1 December 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Assuming that the Policy constitutes (or is the equivalent of) a public local law or ordinance sufficient to grant authority for a judicial review action,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> we must determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>from what governmental action \u2014 local or State \u2014 does the Policy grant the right to seek judicial review. Put simply, courts generally will review only a \u201cfinal\u201d decision of an agency.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>See generally </em>Rochvarg, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 4.5, at 110. An action is considered \u201cfinal\u201d when it \u201cdispose[s] of the case by deciding all question[s] of law and fact and leave[s] nothing further for the administrative body to decide.\u201d <em>Willis v. Montgomery County, </em>415 Md. 523, 534, 3 A.3d 448, 455 (2010); <em>see Arroyo v. Bd. of Educ. of Howard County, </em>381 Md. 646, 666 n. 16, 851 A.2d 576, 588 n. 16 (2004). In the administrative context, more specifically, we have stated that \u201cnot every administrative order which determines rights and liabilities, or from which legal consequences flow, is final and thus subject to judicial review. Generally, to be final, an administrative order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>must also leave nothing further for the agency to do.\u201d <em>Holiday Spas v. Montgomery County Human Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>315 Md. 390, 396, 554 A.2d 1197, 1200 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where, however, any remaining administrative procedures or processes are deemed \u201cministerial,\u201d the initial agency determination is reviewable immediately. <em>See, e.g., Foley v. K. Hovnanian at Kent Island, LLC, </em>410 Md. 128, 159, 978 A.2d 222, 241 (2009); <em>City of Bowie v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>384 Md. 413, 443, 863 A.2d 976, 993 (2004).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Applying these principles to the facts of the present case is a rather straightforward exercise. Under the Policy as it existed as of 9 March 1999 and as amended on 1 December 2009, it seems clear that effectively Petitioners, <em>at most, </em>had a facial right to seek judicial review of only the final approval action by the Commission.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is so because, at all times, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>the Policy stated expressly that no local approval action was effective until the Commission gave its approval (putting aside the potential need to reconcile any differences between the local and State approvals, such as exist in the present case). Further, the Commission may override ultimately the County\u2019s decision to approve a growth allocation request. In effect, the Commission\u2019s action may replace and supercede, or at least subsume, the local action where both actions, at their core, represent an approval. It cannot be said, then, that there is \u201cnothing further for the administrative body [here, the Commission] to decide\u201d or that the Commission\u2019s action on the growth allocation request is merely \u201cministerial.\u201d Accordingly, the County\u2019s approval of the growth allocation request was not a final and \u201cappealable\u201d action, and, thus, the Court of Special Appeals was correct to dismiss Petitioners\u2019 appeal, although the intermediate appellate court should have gone further and vacated the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment (on the merits of the County\u2019s approval) and remanded the matter to the Circuit Court with directions to dismiss Petitioners\u2019 judicial review action.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>II. Is There Nonetheless An Appropriate Avenue of Relief for Petitioners in the Present Litigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">There have been rare occasions in which we have ordered the stay of Circuit Court proceedings to await possible future exhaustion of available administrative remedies, <em>see Md. Reclamation </em>Assocs., <em>Inc. v. Harford County, </em>382 Md. 348, 855 A.2d 351 (2004); however, we most often have dismissed such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201cpremature\u201d appeals. <em>See, e.g., Univ. Sys. of Md. v. Mooney, </em>407 Md. 390, 413, 966 A.2d 418, 431 (2009); <em>Moose v. Fraternal Order of Police, Montgomery County Lodge 35, Inc., </em>369 Md. 476, 478, 800 A.2d 790, 791 (2002); <em>Josephson v. City of Annapolis, </em>353 Md. 667, 669, 728 A.2d 690, 691 (1998); <em>Quesenberry v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>311 Md. 417, 426, 535 A.2d 481, 485 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Assuming that the Policy grants an \u201cappeal\u201d (petition for judicial review) from the Commission\u2019s approval, arguably Petitioners had but a single statutory avenue of proceeding to pursue: a timely-filed petition for judicial review following the Commission\u2019s action.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Petitioners pursued such a remedy by filing a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which was transferred ultimately to the Circuit Court for Kent County. The Circuit Court agreed \u25a0with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Petitioners\u2019 petition for judicial review was not authorized because the Commission\u2019s process and action was quasi-legislative and dismissed the case. Because the Court of Special Appeals has no record of an appeal being taken by Petitioners from this dismissal \u2014 a fact of which we take judicial notice \u2014 Petitioners abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the only \u201cright\u201d to judicial review arguably afforded by the Policy.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Petitioners\u2019 predicament may be likened to that of Chrys Wilson, in <em>Public Service Commission of Md. v. Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 882 A.2d 849 (2005). Wilson, an employee of the Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d), was fired by the Chair of the PSC. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 34, 882 A.2d at 853. Based on an opinion letter ruling of the State Attorney General\u2019s Office concluding that the Chair, acting alone, lacked authority to fire her (the opinion concluded that at least a majority vote of the full Commission was required), Wilson noted timely an administrative appeal from her termination. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 35-36, 882 A.2d at 854. Under the PSC\u2019s administrative appeal procedure, such appeals were to the Chair. <em>Id. </em>To no one\u2019s surprise, the Chair sustained his decision to fire her. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 37, 882 A.2d at 855. Wilson filed a ten-count complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. <em>Id. </em>The Circuit Court, agreeing with Wilson\u2019s argument as to the Chair\u2019s lack of authority, ordered her reinstatement. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 39, 882 A.2d at 856. Her restoration was short lived. The full Commission promptly met and voted to terminate her. <em>Id. </em>Rather than file an administrative appeal from the second termination, as provided for by law, Wilson chose to petition the Circuit Court to find the PSC in contempt of the court\u2019s order in the earlier litigation. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 40, 882 A.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">This Court found that Wilson\u2019s failure to pursue in timely fashion (within 15 days of being notified of the second firing) the statutorily-prescribed administrative remedy for challenging her second termination barred further litigation of any of her claims (be they constitutional, statutory, and common law) under exhaustion of remedies principles. <em>Wilson, </em>389 Md. at 93, 882 A.2d at 888. Petitioners in the present case, by failing to pursue an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of their judicial review proceeding taken from the Commission\u2019s \u201cfinal\u201d action, would be barred similarly from challenging that \u201cfinal\u201d action in the present case were it remanded (and for other reasons argued by the Commission in its amicus brief here). To allow Petitioners to resuscitate these proceedings in the Circuit Court would be to give them an unwarranted additional bite at the proverbial apple, especially where the Commission\u2019s approval subsumed the County\u2019s approval. Petitioners exhausted whatever facial right they may have had to seek judicial review of the State\u2019s action when they filed the second judicial review action \u2014 the review of the Commission\u2019s decision \u2014 and then failed to seek appellate review in the Court of Special Appeals of the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Although the path to trod was not as clear for Petitioners here as for litigants in other administrative agency decisional contexts, a way was not so concealed by legal thickets that it could not be discerned, <em>i.e., see supra </em>note 22. <em>Anderson House, LLC v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Rockville, </em>402 Md. 689, 939 A.2d 116 (2008), albeit in a different context, illustrates how an analogous confoundment of how to proceed may be approached. In <em>Anderson House, </em>a property owner aggrieved by a zoning text amendment to the City of Rockville\u2019s zoning ordinance creating a new zone and an accompanying comprehensive rezoning of its property to the new zone, hedged its bet by filing first a petition for judicial review (which the City moved to dismiss) and later a \u201cprotective\u201d complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunctive Relief. <em>Anderson House, </em>402 Md. at 702-01, 939 A.2d at 123. We parsed the propriety of the modalities of each action according to the nature of the actions (legislative versus quasi-judicial) for which judicial scrutiny was sought and applicable law. <em>See Anderson House, </em>402 Md. at 707, 939 A.2d at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">There is no denying that the Critical Area regulatory scheme, combining local and State responsibilities to be carried out according to potentially varying criteria, creates complex administrative law problems from time-to-time. The present case illustrates that. The case also raises more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>questions than may (or should) be answered on its record and briefs.

This is a point that we assume, but do not hold as such. As noted, the authority for initiation of a judicial review action must be granted specially by law, typically by a public local law (ordinance) or State statute.

All that we know from the parties\u2019 briefs, appendices, and the record extract is that, seemingly by resolution (and without reference therein to whether its terms became part of the Land Ordinance in the Kent County Code), the Board adopted the Policy in March 1999 and amended it in December 2009. At best, the Policy appears to take the form of a stand-alone \"resolution.\u201d We couch this as \"at best\u201d because the initial Policy (at least the portions provided to us by the parties) does not use any permutation of the word \"resolution\" to describe itself. We contrast this with the 1 December 2009 amendment to the Policy which was framed as a \"resolution\u201d and contained the descriptor \"resolved\u201d throughout.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Assuming the Policy is a \"resolution,\u201d the question remains whether a \"resolution\u201d may grant a right of judicial review of the assumed (for present purposes) quasi-judicial actions of a local government or administrative agency. That is, as noted <em>supra, </em>\"in order for an administrative agency\u2019s action properly to be before this Court (or any court) for judicial review, there ... must be a <em>legislative grant </em>of the right to seek judicial review.\" <em>Harvey v. Marshall, </em>389 Md. 243, 273, 884 A.2d 1171, 1189 (2005) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>The Kent County Code is silent as to whether a \"resolution\u201d of the Board of County Commissioners is a public local law. Maryland Code (1957, 2005 Repl.Vol.), Art. 25B, \u00a7 1 defines a \"public local law\u201d \u2014 the phrase thought of typically as synonymous with a legislative act of a local government \u2014 as \"a law applicable to the incorporation, organization, or government of a code county and <em>contained in the county's code </em>----\u201d (Emphasis added). Further, Art. 25B, \u00a7 l\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic local law\u201d excludes specifically \"resolutions of the county government enacted under public local laws.\" <em>See also </em>Md. Const, art. XI-F, \u00a7 1. Our search of the Kent County Code did not reveal that the Policy is contained in the County Code. Absent these \"resolutions\u201d adding expressly their terms to some existing or new local law (which they do not apparently), what is the legal effect of the resolutions? It is best not to decide this question until presented with a case in which the parties brief and argue this point fully. In any event, a finite answer need not be reached here because of another mortal illness afflicting the \"patient.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. Intertwined with the doctrine of finality is the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. It may be said fairly that when a litigant fails to exhaust his or her administrative remedies, he or she seeks judicial review of an agency action that is not \u201cfinal.\u201d <em>See Arroyo v. Bd. of Educ. of Howard County, </em>381 Md. 646, 658, 851 A.2d 576, 583 (2004) (\"The issue raised ... requires us to address ... at what point during this potential chain of administrative decisions, judicial reviews and appeals can there be said to exist an administrative finality, <em>i.e. </em>an \u2018exhaustion\u2019 of administrative remedies.\u201d); <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v.

Although we have not been directed by the parties to a comparable process in the Kent County Critical Area Plan, some Eastern Shore counties appear to treat as non-final in their plans even the Commission\u2019s approval action on the local growth allocation amendment, where the Commission modifies the conditions of approval appended by the local government to its action. This sort of provision has implications for the finality of action on a plan amendment application for purposes of judicial review, if judicial review is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">For example, Queen Anne\u2019s County appears to treat its local approval decisions on growth allocation petitions as purely \"conceptual,\u201d unless and until the Commission acts on the County\u2019s conceptual approval. <em>See Foley v. K. Hovnanian at Kent Island, LLC, </em>410 Md. 128, 133-34 n. 3, 978 A.2d 222, 225 n. 3 (2009); Queen Anne's County Code \u00a7 14:1-74(D) (\"At their regularly scheduled meeting the County Commissioners shall evaluate the proposed amendment ... and either conceptually approve or disapprove the proposed amendment.\u201d). Moreover, Queen Anne\u2019s County\u2019s Critical Area Program contemplates that, once the Commission acts on the County's conceptual approval, the finality of that action depends on the County revisiting the petition to determine if it agrees with the Commission's action before the petition approval becomes effective. <em>See </em>Queen Anne\u2019s County Code \u00a7 14:1-74(F). Given the potential for differences between the County\u2019s conceptual approval (possibly with conditions) and the Commission's subsequent action (with possibly different conditions), such an approach seems prudent from the locality\u2019s vantage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b747-8\">.

Actions for declaratory and injunctive relief have been entertained as the modalities for challenges of the same or similar actions. <em>See, e.g., Foley, </em>410 Md. at 128, 978 A.2d at 222; <em>Talbot County v.

There is lurking in the shadows yet another reason why the Policy\u2019s allusion to a right of judicial review, if construed to be from the County's decision, may be ineffectual. As noted <em>supra </em>at p. 707, 18 A.3d at 24-25 and note 16, the proceedings and action before the Commission are deemed quasi-legislative in nature (rather than quasi-judicial) and, therefore, not amenable to judicial scrutiny through a petition for judicial review process. <em>See Gisriel v.

That is why the Petitioners' judicial review action, initiated after the Commission purported to approve (on a different conditional basis) the County\u2019s approval of Drayton Manor\u2019s application, was dismissed. <em>See supra </em>at p. 707, 18 A.3d at 24-25.

The litigation took the form of a declaratory judgment/injunctive action, rather than a petition for judicial review, because the final County action was characterized as \"legislative,\u201d rather than quasi-judicial. <em>See Foley, </em>410 Md. at 138, 978 A.2d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">It seems a complicated analysis whether the County's consideration of Drayton Manor\u2019s application should be deemed a quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative process. No such analysis was attempted by the parties in the present case, presumably because this issue was not embraced fairly within the lone question for which a writ of certiorari was granted. <em>See supra </em>at p. 704, 18 A.3d at 22-23. The analysis is complex because: (a) the County's action represents an overlay zoning decision (somewhat akin to the Planed Unit Development (PUD) classification at the core of <em>Maryland Overpak Corp. v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>395 Md. 16, 909 A.2d 235 (2006)) by a local government possessed of delegated zoning and planning powers relative to a discrete parcel of land and based on a factual record measured against prescribed criteria; (b) the analytical template for such an inquiry set out in our opinion in <em>Overpak </em>may not be apt here because the only reason the County\u2019s process exists is as an homage to a State statutory requirement \u2014 the Critical Area regulatory scheme \u2014 that partakes clearly of broad and regional criteria that carry out State legislative policy, <em>see Overpak, </em>395 Md. at 26 n. 10, 909 A.2d at 241 n. 10; and, (c) the developed caselaw characterizes the Commission's action and process in the Critical Area amendment scheme as quasi-legislative, which suggests that the County stage of the process also may be characterized similarly. <em>See supra </em>p. 707, 18 A.3d at 24 \u2014 25 and note 16.

The fact that MRA had two consecutive courses of action, neither of which MRA was constrained to pursue within a statutory time limitations period (unlike the 30 days to \"appeal\u201d the Petitioners had in the present case), was pivotal to this Court in fashioning the outcome in <em>MRA III.

If I understand the result that the Dissenting Opinion argues for in this case, were its views to prevail, the ultimate pyrrhic victory would obtain. First, it is a given that Petitioners forfeited any further ability to challenge directly the only arguably final governmental action in this case, the State Critical Area Commission\u2019s approval of an amendment to the Kent County Critical Area Plan to reflect the growth allocation for Drayton Manor\u2019s development proposal. That fact notwithstanding, the Dissent would return to the Circuit Court Petitioners\u2019 instant judicial review action regarding the County Board's decision, where, having had its prior affirmance, on the merits, of the County Board's approval vacated by the Dissent for prematurity, the Circuit Court effectively would be tasked with reconsidering, on the merits, the County\u2019s approval. Of course, the \u201cstay\u201d which the Dissent argues should have been entered before the Circuit Court decided the present litigation earlier (although no stay was requested by Petitioners in the Circuit Court) would have no effect on the record or legal arguments before the Circuit Court, which remain static as of the point in time immediately prior to the vacated affirmance on the merits. Moreover, the predicate of the Dissent's perceived \"prematurity\u201d of the Circuit Court\u2019s prior affirmance, premised as it must be on the concurrent or continuing ability of Petitioners to pursue a legal challenge to the State Commission\u2019s action, ceased to exist when Petitioners failed to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals the Circuit Court\u2019s disposition of their judicial review action regarding the State Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">So, at best, what the Dissent would have done here is have the Circuit Court reconsider its ruling on the merits, based on the same record and same legal arguments on which it affirmed previously the County Board\u2019s decision. Because hope springs eternal in the human breast, I suppose it is not beyond the pale for Petitioners to hope for an epiphany on the part of the Circuit Court judge, but the odds do not seem at all promising. Perhaps, under a different set of circumstances, the principles marshaled in the Dissenting opinion might have been applicable and made a difference; here, it appears they do not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b754-6\">ADKINS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"As_\">dissenting, in which BELL, C.J., and GREENE, J., join.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">I respectfully dissent because I believe the majority opinion achieves a new low point in the unfortunate strain of unfair, \u201cgotcha\u201d jurisprudence which has entered our finality and administrative exhaustion case law. I agree with the majority that the Circuit Court should not have reviewed the County\u2019s decision until after the State Commission proceeding was completed. I disagree, however, that we should dismiss this appeal. The majority concludes that the Petitioners should have filed a judicial review action at a later point in time, barely acknowledging the requirement in the local procedures that an appeal must be taken \u201cwithin thirty (30) days after the [County\u2019s] decisionf.]\u201d <em>See Kent County Growth Allocation Policy </em>(adopted March 9, 1999). Because I would, instead, remand this case to the Circuit Court, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">\u201cStay\u201d of a judicial review action as an alternative to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">The appropriate disposition of a prematurely filed review action depends, at least in part, on the reason that action is premature. The requirements of finality and administrative exhaustion serve two important purposes. First, these requirements screen out requests for judicial review of non-final agency decisions. Second, the requirements serve as an \u201cordering function,\u201d delaying review of certain \u201cfinal\u201d agency decisions until other administrative processes have been exhausted. Although immediate judicial review of a decision is prohibited in both of these categories, distinguishing between the two is important when deciding how to dispose of the premature review action \u2014 i.e., whether to dismiss the case or grant a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">When the challenged administrative decision is a <em>preliminary </em>or <em>non-final </em>decision, dismissal is warranted. In these decisions, there is something incomplete in the challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>decision itself, which will later be superseded or subsumed in a looming, final agency decision. Any complaints that a party has with the <em>preliminary </em>decision may be raised in a challenge to the final agency decision, if they survive. The preliminary decision, then will <em>never </em>be subject to judicial review, and the court has no reason to retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">For example, in <em>Maryland Comm\u2019n. on Human Relations (\u201cMCHR\u201d) v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>296 Md. 46, 459 A.2d 205 (1983) (\u201cBG &amp; E\u201d), the Maryland Commission on Human Relations\u2019s Appeal Board determined that BG <em>&amp; </em>E\u2019s refusal to hire the spouse of an employee was discriminatory on the basis of marital status, but remanded to a hearing examiner to determine whether the discrimination was motivated by \u201cbusiness necessity,\u201d and thus justified by Maryland law. <em>See id. </em>at 49, 459 A.2d at 208. BG &amp; E appealed this order to the Circuit Court, and the case eventually reached this Court on the issue of finality. We held that the appeal was premature, and ordered dismissal of the judicial review action. Judicial review would instead lie from the ensuing administrative decision on business necessity, and any issue with the prior decision could be raised in that proceeding. Dismissal ensured that \u201cthe efficiency of the unconsummated administrative process is not undermined by premature judicial interruption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58, 459 A.2d at 213. <em>See also Willis v. Montgomery County, </em>415 Md. 523, 535, 3 A.3d 448, 455-56 (2010) (dismissing judicial review action of agency\u2019s refusal to refer a worker\u2019s compensation case to fraud division; the County was later able to seek compensation for the alleged fraud through another agency proceeding, from which appeal would lie). <em>Cf. Soley v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 526, 356 A.2d 254, 257 (1976) (dismissing declaratory judgment action alleging ultra vires actions by State Commission on Human Relations because any judicial review must lie from the administrative remedy, not in a declaratory judgment action).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In many cases, however, judicial review of an agency decision is premature only because other administrative remedies exist, and <em>not </em>because the decision is a preliminary or non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>final decision. When judicial review of an agency decision is delayed to allow for exhaustion of administrative remedies, it is for practical considerations, and not because of a jurisdictional defect. <em>See Hubbard, </em>305 Md. 774, 787, 506 A.2d 625, 631 (1986) (Failure to exhaust a primary administrative review remedy \u201cdoes not ordinarily result in a trial court\u2019s being deprived of fundamental jurisdiction^\u201d); <em>Towson Univ. v.

This \u201cagencies first\u201d rule promotes judicial efficiency and protects the exercise of agency expertise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">The decisions of an administrative agency are often of a discretionary nature, and frequently require an expertise which the agency can bring to bear in sifting the information presented to it. The agency should be afforded the initial opportunity to exercise that discretion and to apply that expertise. Furthermore, to permit interruption for purposes of judicial intervention at various stages of the administrative process might well undermine the very efficiency which the Legislature intended to achieve in the first instance. Lastly, the courts might be called upon to decide issues which perhaps would never arise if the prescribed administrative remedies were followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\"><em>Soley v. State Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 526, 356 A.2d 254, 257 (1976). <em>See also Wilson, </em>286 Md. at 645, 409 A.2d at 717 (\u201c[Wjhen the Legislature enacts a comprehensive remedial scheme in which a claim is to be determined by an administrative agency and reviewed in an administrative appeal before judicial review is available, it establishes, as public policy, that such a procedure produces the most efficient and effective results.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Accordingly, in some instances of premature appeal, we have ordered the Circuit Court to retain jurisdiction so as to allow the remaining administrative processes to run their course. For example, in an exhaustion case involving the Inmate Grievance Commission, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-8\">Although the circuit court in this case correctly held that McCullough was required to invoke and exhaust his remedy before the Inmate Grievance Commission before receiving an adjudication on the merits of his tort action, we do not believe that a dismissal of the tort action was the preferable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>order. Under circumstances like these, where a plaintiff has both an administrative remedy and an independent judicial action, and the administrative agency\u2019s jurisdiction is deemed primary, it is appropriate for the trial court to retain, for a reasonable period of time, jurisdiction over the independent judicial action pending invocation and exhaustion of the administrative procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><em>McCullough v.

Md. BCA, </em>364 Md. 446, 773 A.2d 504 (2001) (\u201c[T]he Circuit Court should have refrained from reaching the- issue at this stage, and should have stayed the declaratory judgment action pending a final decision by the Board of Contract Appeals.\u201d); <em>Board of Educ. for Dorchester County v.

Administrative appeals and judicial reviews usually must be filed within specific mandatory time periods established by statute or rule of procedure. When a party is involved in complicated administrative proceedings, and also needs to seek judicial review, these filing deadlines may conflict, or the party may be practically unable to exhaust its remedies before the appeal deadline has passed. In order to protect its right to seek judicial review, therefore, the party may need to file a judicial review action prematurely. If the reviewing court then were to dismiss the review action, the party could be frozen out of its right to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>Mathirampuzha v. Potter, </em>548 F.3d 70, 84 (2nd Cir.2008) (dismissal, instead of issuing a stay, would create a \u201csignificant danger of unfair disadvantage here inasmuch as the plaintiffs claim is subject to a statute of limitations.\u201d); <em>Carnation Co. v.

As these cases demonstrate, the \u201cstay\u201d remedy serves to alleviate harsh outcomes when our finality and exhaustion requirements interface poorly with other procedural requirements in administrative appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">To be sure, the requirement that a party exhaust all administrative remedies can develop into an absolute bar requiring dismissal. This harsher treatment occurs, however, <em>only when a party fails to take the steps required by our exhaustion principles. See, e.g., Public Service Comm\u2019n. v. Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 882 A.2d 849 (2005). In <em>Wilson, </em>for example, an employee of the Public Service Commission (\u201cPSC\u201d) had been fired by the Chair of the PSC, and then reinstated after the Circuit Court for Baltimore City held that the Chair lacked the authority to fire her without a vote of the full PSC. After reinstatement, she was fired again, but this time by the required vote. By statute, an employee of the PSC could file \u201ca written appeal of a disciplinary action with the head of the principal unity ... within 15 days after the employee receives notice[, and] ... on the grounds that the disciplinary action is illegal or unconstitutional.\u201d Md.Code (1993, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 ll-113(b) of the State Personnel and Pensions Article.

Thus, the exhaustion requirement serves to deny relief for parties who sit on their rights to administrative review. Put differently, a party may not opt for judicial review by waiting out administrative review deadlines. <em>See State Ret. &amp; Pension Sys. of Md. v.

Reclamation Assocs., </em>382 Md. at 361, 855 A.2d at 358 (commenting, in remand for further agency procedures, that \u201c[f|ailure to prosecute variance applications within a reasonable time could result in dismissal[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">To apply the above standards to the instant case, a careful examination of the \u201cpremature\u201d appeal is required. The Growth Allocation process consists of two, distinct decisions, one at the local level and one at the state level. As all parties agree, the state and local decisions involve separate issues and involve separate evidence, though overlapping on the general standards of the State Critical Areas Act. The County decision is primarily concerned with the effect of the proposed growth allocation on local interests, while the State is concerned with the proposal\u2019s effect on the statewide regulatory scheme and the overall health of the State\u2019s water resources. For example, the State Commission will not determine whether the growth allocation will \u201cexpand and provide more diversity in the size, number, and type of businesses in Kent County or as a means to enhance and expand locally based tourism that relies upon the unique natural, cultural, and historic features and qualities of Kent County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">The County\u2019s decision is not subsumed by the State\u2019s decision, and judicial review of that decision lies separately from judicial review of the State decision. Indeed, when exhaustion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>of administrative remedies has not been at issue, \u201c[i]t [has] not [been] unusual for an aggrieved person to petition for judicial review of a local government\u2019s decision on a program amendment (including a growth allocation) before the Critical Areas Commission has acted on the local government\u2019s [submission].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Brief of Amicus Curiae Critical Area Commission for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays, </em>11 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The County\u2019s decision thus falls into the second category of decisions for which judicial review is <em>delayed, rather than extinguished, </em>by our exhaustion principles. If administrative exhaustion was the only procedural concern, then we could fairly require aggrieved parties to await the State decision before filing a judicial review action of the local decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In this case, however, review of a Kent County growth allocation decision is also subject to the procedural requirements of the Kent County Growth Allocation Policy, which specifies that \u201c[a]ny aggrieved person with standing may within thirty (30) days after the [County\u2019s] decision, appeal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>the Circuit Court of Maryland.\u201d Given the reality that the State Commission is highly unlikely to complete its review within 30 days, the Policy effectively requires a pre-exhaustion filing. This potential conflict is <em>exactly </em>the procedural problem which has led many courts to conclude that a stay is superior to a dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">When our exhaustion requirement delays, rather than extinguishes, judicial review of an administrative decision, and that delay may interfere with a filing deadline, the stay remedy allows the party to protect its right to judicial review of the local decision. In this case, with the 30-day appeals deadline looming, the Petitioners were at risk of losing their right to judicial appeal of the local decision. We should, instead of dismissing this appeal, vacate the Circuit Court\u2019s premature decision on the merits, and remand to that court for further proceedings. <em>See Md. BCA, </em>364 Md. at 459, 773 A.2d at 512 (after Circuit Court reviewed the merits of an administrative action prior to exhaustion, this Court vacated that decision and remanded for further proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Rather than follow this common-sense approach, the majority dismisses the appeal and abrogates the Petitioners\u2019 right to challenge the County\u2019s decision. The majority justifies its dismissal with three problematic assertions: (1) that this case is distinguishable from <em>MRA III, </em>(2) that the Petitioners are instead like the disappointed litigant in <em>Public Service Commission of Md. v. Wilson, </em>389 Md. 27, 882 A.2d 849 (2005), and (3) that the Petitioners abandoned their right to appeal by failing to appeal the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of its action for judicial review of the State Commission decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The majority\u2019s decision contradicts the approach adopted by the Court in <em>MRA III, </em>in which Judge Harrell explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3x\">When a litigant is entitled to bring two separate legal proceedings in an effort to obtain relief in a particular matter, when the litigant institutes the first of those proceedings and the case is pending in a trial court, and when the trial court is unable to decide the merits of that case because of primary jurisdiction or exhaustion principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>associated with the second proceeding, the trial court ordinarily should stay the first proceeding for a reasonable period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><em>See MRA III, </em>882 Md. at 867, 855 A.2d at 362. Here, no one disagrees that Petitioners are \u201centitled to bring two separate legal proceedings in an effort to obtain relief\u2019: a judicial review action of the County decision and an administrative challenge at the State level. The Petitioners \u201cinstitute[d] the first of those proceedings and the case [was] pending in a trial court[.]\u201d No one disagrees that \u201cthe trial court [was] unable to decide the merits of that case because of primary jurisdiction or exhaustion principles associated with the second proceeding^]\u201d This case thus aligns with <em>MRA III, </em>and Petitioners are perfect candidates for a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The majority makes only a half-hearted attempt to distinguish <em>MRA III, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\">This case is distinguished from <em>Maryland Reclamation Associates v. Harford County, </em>382 Md. 348, 855 A.2d 351 (2004) <em>(\u201cMRA III </em>\u201d)____The fact that MRA had two consecutive courses of action, neither of which MRA was constrained to pursue within a statutory time limitations period (unlike the 30 days to \u201cappeal\u201d the Petitioners had in the present case), was pivotal to this Court in fashioning the outcome in <em>MRA III.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The majority thus concludes that the 30-day appeal limitation in this case requires a departure from the \u201cstay\u201d remedy of <em>MRA III. </em>I could not disagree more.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">If anything, the 30-day window makes Petitioners better candidates for remand than the party in <em>MRA III. </em>In <em>MRA III, </em>the party was free to refile after exhaustion; here, without a remand, the Petitioners are time-prohibited from refiling any appeal of the County decision. This majority\u2019s holding thus ignores one of the main purposes of the stay remedy \u2014 to allow a party facing deadlines (be it administrative deadlines or statutes of limitations) to protect its right to appeal by filing an action for judicial review <em>prior to exhaustion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>The majority then concludes that \u201cthe Petitioners\u2019 predicament may be likened to that of Chrys Wilson,\u201d an administrative litigant whom this Court found had lost her right to further challenge an administrative decision. The similarities between the Petitioners and Ms. Wilson are scarce. To be sure, both were aggrieved at an administrative decision; in <em>Wilson, </em>Ms. Wilson was fired by the PSC, and here, the County granted a growth allocation. Both were required to pursue another administrative review: in <em>Wilson, </em>the statute required an aggrieved employee to file an administrative appeal, and here, the Petitioners had to contest the growth allocation in front of the State Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">But that is where the similarities cease. Ms. Wilson was required, by statute, to file an administrative grievance within 15 days. She failed to do so, and instead chose to file a judicial review action. In contrast, the Petitioners were required, by statute, to file a judicial review action within 30 days, which they did. Furthermore, while Ms. Wilson\u2019s administrative remedy was never exhausted due to her failure, the Petitioners\u2019 administrative remedy (the State Commission review) proceeded automatically and was duly completed. <em>Wilson </em>establishes that the administrative exhaustion requirement may become a bar to judicial review if not satisfied. But here, unlike <em>Wilson, </em>the required administrative proceeding was completed. Thus, none of the justifications for the dismissal in <em>Wilson </em>apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Finally, the majority faults the Petitioners\u2019 failure to appeal the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of its action for judicial review of the State Commission decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-7\">Assuming that the Policy grants an \u201cappeal\u201d (petition for judicial review) from the Commission\u2019s approval, arguably Petitioners had but a single statutory avenue of proceeding to pursue: a timely-filed petition for judicial review following the Commission\u2019s action. Petitioners pursued such a remedy by filing a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, which was transferred ultimately to the Circuit Court for Kent County. The Circuit Court agreed with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 petition for judicial review was not authorized because the Commission\u2019s process and action was quasi-legislative and dismissed the case. Because the Court of Special Appeals has no record of an appeal being taken by Petitioners from this dismissal \u2014 a fact of which we take judicial notice \u2014 Petitioners abandoned the only \u201cright\u201d to judicial review arguably afforded by the Policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">This conclusion is startling.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In the above passage, the majority considers the \u201csingle statutory avenue\u201d of judicial review, under the policy, to be a judicial review action following the State Commission\u2019s decision. Yet, in the same breath, the majority acknowledges that it is unsettled whether such an action is permissible: \u201cThe Circuit Court agreed with the Commission\u2019s conclusion that Petitioners\u2019 petition for judicial review was not authorized because the Commission\u2019s process and action was quasi-legislative.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, while denying the Petitioners the avenue to go forward with their timely filed appeal from the County decision, it refrains from holding that Petitioner had any right to appeal from the State Commission. Moreover, the majority fails to address (1) whether the Petitioners could raise issues unique to the County decision in its challenge to the State decision, and (2) whether the Petitioners could have re-filed a separate challenge to the County decision, within 30 days of the State decision, even though this current appeal was pending. Thus, the majority decision leaves the law regarding judicial review of Growth Allocation requests in a muddled state.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">At the same time, the majority applies the harshest standard to Petitioners \u2014 expecting that they be prescient. Under this harsh standard, Petitioners must have been able to correctly predict the following uncertainties: (1) that this Court, departing from <em>MRA III </em>and other cases, would not honor their timely effort to appeal from the County decision as called for under the Kent County Growth Allocation Policy, (2) that they had a right to judicial review of the State Critical Area Commission decision, (3) that they should raise all of the issues pertaining to the County decision in the possible appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>from the State Commission to the circuit court, and (4) that they had a right and obligation to appeal from the Circuit Court to the Court of Special Appeals, raising questions unique to this, earlier filed appeal from the County Growth Allocation decision, even though this appeal was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The majority admits that my concerns may be \u201capplicable and [make] a difference\u201d in future cases, but concludes that it is useless to vacate and remand in this case, because the Circuit Court has already reached the merits. Perhaps, as the majority suggests, the Circuit Court would reach the same result on remand. I would risk this \u201cpyrrhic victory\u201d rather than unfairly deprive the Petitioners of their day in court. We should respect the efforts of lawyers in the trenches, who must discern the meaning of complicated and conflicting regulations. The principles of fairness and reasonable conduct demand this. Otherwise, by adopting unnecessarily harsh procedural rules and interpretations, we reinforce the \u201cgotcha\u201d approach that has descended upon our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Petitioners took reasonable and diligent steps to preserve their right to have a court review the County\u2019s decision. Accordingly, I would vacate the Circuit Court\u2019s premature decision and remand to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b766-7\">Chief Judge BELL and Judge GREENE have authorized me to state that they join this dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-7\">. The pragmatic flexibility of the exhaustion rule is further demonstrated in <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n. v. Crawford, </em>307 Md. 1, 17-18, 511 A.2d 1079, 1087 (1986), a case representative of our procedural approach in an administrative exhaustion case. There, an employee at Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission was aggrieved by a personnel decision. <em>See id. </em>at 7, 511 A.2d at 1081\u2014 82. She initiated an administrative grievance and, while that was pending, filed a lawsuit in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County. <em>See id. </em>The court assumed jurisdiction over the matter while the administrative action was pending, and disposed of some preliminary, evidentiary matters in the case. After the administrative process was completed, the court held a trial on the merits regarding the initial decision. <em>See id. </em>at 8, 511 A.2d at 1082. Although the judicial action was filed \"prematurely,\u201d and the employee had not sought judicial review and consolidation of the second administrative decision, we approved of the court's approach, stating that \"the court properly applied any exhaustion requirement in its handling of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 511 A.2d at 1087. <em>Crawford </em>thus demonstrates that administrative exhaustion is a common-sense requirement concerned with the ordering of appeal procedures, and not a jurisdictional prerequisite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"><em>. </em>A party could seek to protect aspects of its case other than its timeliness. In <em>Crawford, </em>for example, the litigant was concerned over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>potential alteration or influence of potential testimony, and sought preliminary injunctive relief from the Circuit Court before exhausting her administrative remedies. <em>Crawford, </em>307 Md. at 8, 511 A.2d at 1082. If we had treated the exhaustion requirement as a jurisdictional prerequisite, and ordered dismissal of a case filed during the pendency of administrative exhaustion, the litigant in <em>Crawford </em>would have been unable to seek this type of evidentiary protection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">. The Critical Areas Commission offers the following examples:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-8\">[I]n the Four Seasons project growth allocation, separate actions were filed against the Queen Anne\u2019s County Commissioners and the Critical Area Commission by Robert Foley and the Kent Island Defense League. In 2006, the Critical Area Commission denied a growth allocation for the Blackwater Resorts project, which had been approved by Dorchester County and the City of Cambridge. Aggrieved parties challenged the local governments' approvals of the growth allocation, and subsequently, the County and the developer challenged the Critical Area Commission's denial of the same growth allocation. In 2007, the AES LNG Corporation filed an action against Baltimore County when the County enacted an ordinance pertaining to LNG facilities in the Critical Area.
