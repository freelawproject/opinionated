Villa, III, challenges his sentence for conspiracy to commit mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 &amp; 1341. First, he asserts that the district court abused its discretion in departing upward from the guideline sentencing range because it based the departure upon the same factors it used to calculate the sentencing range. We find no abuse of discretion because \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3) of the Guidelines allows a departure based upon factors that were used to determine the guideline range when, as here, such factors were present to a degree \u201csubstantially in excess\u201d of that which is normally involved in the type of offense. In addition, the reasons for the district court\u2019s departure (1) advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2); (2) are authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b); and (3) are justified by the facts of the case. <em>See United States v. Saldana, </em>427 F.3d 298, 310 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1097,163 L.Ed.2d 911 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">Next Villa asserts that, because the district court erred in sentencing him above the guideline range, his sentence is presumptively unreasonable. As stated above, the district court did not err in departing from the sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-15\">Finally, Villa asserts for the first time on appeal that the district court failed to provide advance notice of two of the seven reasons it relied upon in departing from the guideline range. We find no plain error because Villa has not established that the omission affected his substantial rights. The district court wrote that each of the reasons was adequate to support its decision to depart from the Guidelines. As such, Villa cannot establish that a lack of notice on two of the reasons affected the outcome of the proceeding. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43,163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-18\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
