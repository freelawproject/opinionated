On appeal, Childs asserts that the district court erred in imposing a two-level sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(B)(i), based on the use of fictitious account numbers on checks created by Childs. As the Government concedes, this enhancement should not have been imposed. <em>See United States v. Hughey, </em>147 F.3d 423, 433-36 (5th Cir.1998)(excluding account numbers from the definition of \u201caccess device\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">Therefore, the sentence imposed by the district court is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings pursuant to this ruling. In light of this remand and the resulting resentencing, we decline to address Childs\u2019s assertion that the district court\u2019s upward departure from the applicable guideline range was unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Southerland, </em>405 F.3d 263, 270 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
