We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion as untimely filed. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(I) (West 1999 &amp; Supp. 2005); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2005). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
