Sabo appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to the defendants on her claim of deliberate indifference to her medical needs under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and on her state law claims. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm substantially on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Sabo v. Canterbury, </em>No. 5:03CV84 (N.D. W. Va. June 16, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
