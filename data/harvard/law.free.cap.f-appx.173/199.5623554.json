See Local Rule 36(c).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b226-16\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b226-17\">Lincoln Monroe Brock was convicted by a jury of three counts of distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C); one count of distribution of five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B); one count of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B); and one count of possession of a firearm by a person who has been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). He was sentenced to a total of 186 months imprisonment, followed by six years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-18\">On appeal, Brock asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to the firearm charge because the evidence presented by the government was insufficient to prove that he possessed, used or carried the firearm at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-19\">We review de novo the denial of a Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>See United States v. Ryan-Webster, </em>353 F.3d 353, 359 (4th Cir.2003). We must sustain a jury verdict \u201cif there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And we \u201cremain cognizant of the fact that the jury, not the reviewing court, weighs the credibility of the evidence and resolves any conflicts in the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">During execution of a search warrant at a residence believed to belong to Brock, officers found 6.7 grams of cocaine base in a closet in the front bedroom. A safe containing intimate photographs of Brock and his wife were also in the closet. Letters addressed to Brock from his wife and various other personal documents bearing Brock\u2019s name were found in a shoebox in the same bedroom. The firearm, a 12-gauge shotgun, was found between the bed and the closet in the same bedroom, with ammunition nearby. In addition, the government presented evidence that Brock told a federal agent that he had possessed the shotgun taken from him on April 1, 2003, for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">We find that the evidence was sufficient to support the firearm conviction based upon Brock\u2019s possession of the 12-gauge shotgun found in the bedroom. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>124 F.3d 607, 610 (4th Cir.1997) (Constructive possession exists when \u201cthe defendant exercised, or had the power to exercise, dominion and control over the item.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Brock\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and we affirm his conviction on the count.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Brock next contends that he is entitled to be resentenced in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because his sentence was enhanced based on facts not found by the jury in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>See </em>125 S.Ct. at 750. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions and thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>See id. </em>at 756-67. After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. If a district court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the court must state its reasons for doing so as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547. Because Brock preserved his Sixth Amendment claim in the trial court, \u201cwe must reverse unless we find this constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, with the Government bearing the burden of proving harmlessness.\u201d <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003) (citations omitted); <em>see United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Here, the district court established a base offense level of twenty-eight based upon a determination of the quantity of controlled substances. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Guideline (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2D1.1. Because a firearm was possessed, the offense level was increased by two pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), for a total offense level of thirty. Brock was further found to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>have a criminal history category of VI, based upon fourteen criminal history points. Two of the fourteen criminal history points were added pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(e), based upon a finding that Brock had committed the instant offense within two years of his release from imprisonment. With a total offense level of thirty, and a criminal history category of VI, Brock\u2019s recommended guideline range was 168 to 210 months. The district court treated the guidelines as mandatory and imposed a total term of 186 months imprisonment and eight years supervised release. However, the district court noted that, without the enhancement for possession of the weapon and the two additional criminal history points, Brock\u2019s total offense level would be 28 and his criminal history would be V, resulting in a guideline range of 130 to 162 months imprisonment, followed by a term of 6 years of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Hammond, </em>381 F.3d 316, 353 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), judgment vacated, 543 U.S. 1097, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Thus, the maximum sentence under the guidelines without the judge-found facts was below even the minimum sentence that could have been imposed under the mandatory scheme. The government concedes that <em>Booker </em>error occurred based upon the criminal history finding and that resentencing is appropriate. We agree, and therefore vacate Brock\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Brock\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence, and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker. </em>We deny Booker\u2019s motion to relieve counsel, supplemental motion to relieve counsel, and motion for production of documents. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
