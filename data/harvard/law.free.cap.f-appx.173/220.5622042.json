Gresham appeals an order of the district court granting summary judgment to Kemper Casualty Company (Kemper)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> on Gresham\u2019s claim under the Mary<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>land Wage Payment and Collection Law (the \u2018Wage Payment Act\u201d), <em>see </em>Md.Code Ann., Lab. <em>&amp; </em>Empl. \u00a7\u00a7 3-501 to 3-509 (LexisNexis 1999 &amp; Supp.2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The facts are set forth fully in our previous opinion, <em>see Gresham v. Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>404 F.3d 253, 256-57 (4th Cir.2005), and need be only briefly summarized here. Gresham was hired by Kemper to help develop a line of professional liability insurance. His compensation package included a severance benefit payable upon \u201cterminat[ion] without cause.\u201d J.A. 7. Gresham subsequently accepted an offer of employment from The St. Paul Insurance Companies after that company purchased the professional liability line from Kemper.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Gresham thereafter sought payment of the severance benefit, which Kemper refused on the basis of Gresham\u2019s \u201ccontinued employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. Gresham subsequently filed this action claiming breach of contract and violation of the Wage Payment Act. A third count alleged an alternative claim for violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) (West 1999), in the event the district court determined that the employment agreement between Gresham and Kemper constituted an \u201cemployee welfare benefit plan\u201d within the meaning of ERISA, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1002(1) (West 1999). The district court granted summary judgment to Kemper, reasoning that Kemper had terminated Gresham \u201cfor cause\u201d under the terms of his employment agreement because \u201ca corporate executive cannot be simultaneously performing effective services to two different companies at the same time.\u201d J.A. 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">We reversed based on the rule that \u201can employee is \u2018terminated\u2019 for purposes of a severance agreement when his employer sells the business in which the employee works.\u201d <em>Gresham, </em>404 F.3d at 262. In the course of reaching this conclusion, we determined that Gresham\u2019s claims were not preempted by ERISA, despite arguably contrary dictum in <em>Stiltner v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>74 F.3d 1473, 1480 (4th Cir. 1996) (en banc). <em>See Gresham, </em>404 F.3d at 257-59. We remanded Gresham\u2019s claim under the Wage Payment Act for further proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 263 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The Wage Payment Act authorizes an award of up to treble damages, plus attorney\u2019s fees and costs, if the failure to pay is not the result of a \u201cbona fide dispute.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. \u00a7 3-507.1(b); <em>see Admiral Mortgage, Inc. v. Cooper, </em>357 Md. 533, 745 A.2d 1026, 1030 (2000). The parties agree that the test for whether a dispute is bona fide is an objective one.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">Having reviewed the parties\u2019 submissions, the decision of the district court, and the applicable law, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Gresham v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>426 F.Supp.2d 321, 324-28 (D.Md.2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and oral argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b246-16\"> Kemper is a subsidiary of Lumbermen\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company, the named defendant in this action. Although \"Lumbermen's\u201d has been spelled a variety of ways during the course of this litigation, we use the spelling adopted in our prior opinion. <em>See Gresham v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number><em>Lumbermen\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>404 F.3d 253 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
