Bivings\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the adequacy of the plea colloquy but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Bivings has filed a pro se supplemental brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Counsel questions whether the district court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Bivings\u2019 guilty plea. Because Bivings did not move to withdraw his guilty plea,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> we review his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have carefully reviewed the transcript of the Rule 11 hearing and find no plain error in the district court\u2019s acceptance of Bivings\u2019 guilty plea. <em>See United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 119-20 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Bivings contends that the district court erred by denying his motion for the appointment of new counsel. Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>See United States v. Reevey, </em>364 F.3d 151, 156 (4th Cir.2004) (stating standard of review and discussing factors courts consider in ruling on motion). Finally, with regard to Bivings\u2019 claim that counsel provided ineffective assistance due to a conflict of interest, we \u201cmay address [such claims] on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1407, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-, 2006 WL 386973 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2006) (No. 05-8667). Because we find no evidence of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness on the record presented, we decline to review this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Bivings\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> Bivings filed two motions to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court but withdrew them at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
