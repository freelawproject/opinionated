The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Murray that failure to timely file specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Murray failed to file specific objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-19\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to specifically object will waive appellate review. <em>See Page v. Lee, </em>337 F.3d 411, 416 n. 3 (4th Cir.2003); see <em>also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985); <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985). Murray has waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we deny Murray\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-20\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
