Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">Shah asserts the district court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) of Shah\u2019s involvement in a 1996 fire, an event for which Shah filed no insurance claim, and therefore was purportedly inadmissible to prove a plan to defraud his insurance company. Evidence of prior acts is admissible under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) and Fed.R.Evid. 403 if the evidence is: (1) relevant to an issue other than the general character of the defendant, (2) necessary, (3) reliable, and (4) if the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 997 (4th Cir.1997). The evidence at issue here, the 1996 fire, was critical to establish Shah\u2019s plan to defraud, and satisfies the criteria enumerated in <em>Queen. </em>We therefore find the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">Shah next alleges the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201cthat evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2019 <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). We review both direct and circumstantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>dence and permit \u201cthe government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982). Construing all inferences in favor of the Government, we find the evidence against Shah was abundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Shah finally argues that his statutorily-mandated sentence violated <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Shah contends that his sentence should be remanded as <em>Booker </em>vests sentencing discretion in the trial court and causes the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2005) to trump all mandatory statutes. This argument lacks merit. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 n* (4th Cir.2006) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000)); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005) (acknowledging, in the context of determining whether a sentence is reasonable, that \u201c[t]he statutory limits for both maximum and minimum sentences must be honored except as statute otherwise authorizes\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">We therefore affirm Shah\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
