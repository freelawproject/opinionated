The Supreme Court has vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-23\">We review de novo whether a waiver provision bars an appeal. <em>United States v. Baymon, </em>312 F.3d 725, 727 (5th Cir.2002). We determine whether the waiver was knowing and voluntary and whether the waiver applies to the circumstances at issue. <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-24\">The record reflects that Bryant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence \u201con any ground whatsoever.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cortez, </em>413 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>F.3d 502, 503 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir. 2005); Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(N). Because Bryant\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, we DISMISS the appeal as barred by the waiver contained in Bryant\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
