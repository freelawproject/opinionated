The district court sentenced Pirtle to life imprisonment. On appeal, Pirtle presses several claims. After thoroughly reviewing the record, we affirm Pirtle\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Pirtle first claims that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to two wiretap orders, one on May 7, 2003, the other on June 11, 2003. With regard to the May 7 wiretap order, Pirtle contends that the government failed to exhaust normal, less intrusive investigative procedures prior to applying for the wiretap order. With regard to the June 11 wiretap order, Pirtle contends that the wiretap order was unnecessary because the objectives of the wiretap order had been obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Turning to 'the May 7 wiretap order, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(3)(c) permits a district court to issue a wiretap order only after making a specific finding that \u201cnormal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d Section 2518(l)(c) requires a wiretap application to contain \u201ca full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">In discharging its burden, the government cannot rely on conclusory statements that normal techniques would be unproductive or that gathering usable evidence has been difficult. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>31 F.3d 1294, 1297 (4th Cir.1994). However, the government is not required to show that other methods have been \u201cwholly unsuccessful,\u201d or that it has exhausted \u201call possible alternatives to wiretapping.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1298 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, the government need only present specific factual information sufficient to establish that it has encountered difficulties in penetrating the criminal enterprise or in gathering evidence to the point where wiretapping becomes reasonable given the statutory preference for less intrusive techniques. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">In this case, the affidavit in support of the May 7 wiretap order explained how numerous normal investigative procedures had failed, particularly how the use of various informants were unsuccessful in obtaining meaningful evidence. The affidavit also set forth the difficulties that were encountered in investigating Pirtle\u2019s drug activities and the substantial risks involved. In our view, the affidavit set forth sufficient facts to warrant the issuance of the May 7 wiretap order.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-13\">With regard to the June 11 wiretap order, the affidavit in support of the wiretap order explained that normal investigative procedures were still unsuccessful and that the investigation continued to face difficulties and involved substantial risks. Moreover, the record discloses that, as of the date of the application, the government was aware of some, but not all, of Pirtle\u2019s sources of crack. Finally, the government had not yet determined the identity of all the participants on the distribution side of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Pirtle\u2019s organization. Under these circumstances, the issuance of the June 11 wiretap order was eminently reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Pirtle next claims that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights when it sentenced him to a mandatory term of life imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) based on two prior felony drug convictions that were not alleged in the indictment. A person that commits a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) violation is subject to a mandatory life sentence if they committed the instant \u00a7 841(a)(1) violation \u201cafter two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense have become final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The term \u201cfelony drug offense\u201d means \u201can offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, anabolic steroids, or depressant or stimulant substances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 802(44).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">A district court may enhance a sentence based on the \u201c \u2018fact of a prior conviction,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282 (4th Cir.2005), regardless of whether it was admitted to by the defendant or found by a jury so long as the facts necessary to support the enhancement \u201cinhere in the fact of conviction\u201d rather than being \u201cextraneous to it,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 283. Facts necessary to support a sentencing enhancement inhere in the fact of conviction rather than being extraneous to it so long as they come from \u201cthe charging document, the terms of a plea agreement, the plea colloquy, the statutory definition, or any explicit finding of the trial judge to which the defendant assented to determine a disputed fact about a prior conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Our review of the record discloses that the respective charging documents and certificates of disposition with respect to Pirtle\u2019s prior drug felony convictions provided the district court an adequate basis to conclude that Pirtle had two prior convictions for felony drug offenses. The first conviction (involving conduct committed in May 1996 for which he was arrested that same month) was for \u201cCRIMINAL POSSESSION\u201d of \u201ccocaine\u201d in the \u201c5th DEGREE.\u201d (J.A. 756). The second conviction (involving conduct committed in September 1996 for which he was arrested in October 1996) was for the \u201cCRIMINAL SALE\u201d of \u201ccocaine\u201d in the \u201c3rd DEGREE.\u201d (J.A. 762). Both of these offense are felonies under New York law. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.39 (\u201cCriminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree is a class B felony.\u201d); N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 220.06 (\u201cCriminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree is a class D felony.\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Brown, </em>937 F.2d 68, 69-70 (2d Cir.1991) (holding that a state drug offense that was a felony under New Jersey common law was a felony drug offense for purposes of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)). Accordingly, Pirtle\u2019s pri- or drug felony convictions required the court to sentence Pirtle to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Pirtle also attacks Special Agent David Shields\u2019 testimony at trial regarding the meaning of statements made by Pirtle and several coconspirators during two calls intercepted over the wiretap on May 9 and June 13, 2003. We find that any error here is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">Agent Shields testified about the meaning of statements during two calls and his testimony was consistent with the testimony of one of Pirtle\u2019s coconspirators who offered a similar interpretation of the calls. Thus, Agent Shields\u2019 testimony was largely cumulative to evidence already before the jury. Moreover, these calls only represented two of the seventeen calls played <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>during the trial. Finally, the evidence of guilt presented by the government was nothing short of overwhelming. In short, the admission of Agent Shields\u2019 testimony played no role in the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Finally, Pirtle contends that the district court erred when it declined to define the term \u201creasonable doubt\u201d after he requested such an instruction. We review the denial of a proposed jury instruction for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 551 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We have consistently expressed disapproval of attempts by courts to define reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Najjar, </em>300 F.3d 466, 486 (4th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Oriakhi, </em>57 F.3d 1290, 1300 (4th Cir.1995). Moreover, we have held that a court should not attempt to define reasonable doubt absent a specific jury request. <em>Oriakhi, </em>57 F.3d at 1300. In this case, there is no indication that the jury asked the district court to define reasonable doubt. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to give Pirtle\u2019s requested reasonable doubt instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm Pirtle\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
