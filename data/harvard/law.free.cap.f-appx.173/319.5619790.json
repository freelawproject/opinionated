We review dismissals under \u00a7 1915A de novo. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">On appeal, Lann argues that prison officials denied him access to the courts by confiscating his legal documents pursuant to a policy that limits a prisoner\u2019s storage space. Lann has failed to establish, however, that the prison\u2019s storage policy actually prejudiced his ability to pursue a legal claim. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Christopher v. Harbury, </em>536 U.S. 403, 415, 122 S.Ct. 2179, 153 L.Ed.2d 413 (2002). Thus, his claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-15\">Lann argues for the first time on appeal that the defendants violated their own regulations, his equal protection and Fourth Amendment rights, and the Privileges and Immunities Clause by their actions. A party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal merely because he believes that he might succeed on a different theory of recovery. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). We do not address these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-16\">Lann argues that the district court erred in finding that he had not shown a claim of retaliation by the defendants for his questioning them as to his rights, which he terms petitioning for redress of grievances. . To state a claim, Lann must allege a protected right and either produce direct evidence of a retaliatory motive or allege a chronology of events from which the court plausibly may infer a retaliatory motive. <em>Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1164 (5th Cir.1995). \u201c[Wjhere internal grievance procedures are available,\u201d a prison has the authority \u201cto circumscribe the <em>manner </em>in which a grievance or criticism right is exercised.\u201d <em>Freeman v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>369 F.3d 854, 864 (5th Cir.2004) (allowing proscription of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ternal circulation of petition within prison). \u201cPrison officials may legitimately punish inmates who verbally confront institutional authority without running afoul of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Questioning a prison officer as to his authority to enforce prison regulations is therefore not a protected activity under the First Amendment. Nor has Lann shown direct evidence of retaliation or alleged a chronology of events from which we can plausibly infer a retaliatory motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Lann argues that the district judge was biased against him and should be recused. An allegation of bias stemming from a judge\u2019s adverse ruling is not sufficient to support a finding of bias under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Lann\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Lann\u2019s complaint as frivolous and this dismissal both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Lann is warned that if he accumulates a third strike, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
