The district court granted relief on Jones\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion in which he challenged the calculation of his guidelines sentence. Jones was resentenced in July 2004 to 51 months on the bank robbery offenses and a mandatory consecutive 60-month sentence on the \u00a7 924(c) offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">Jones appeals, claiming that the district court erred in applying the guidelines as mandatory, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Jones did not raise this objection below, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). While the mandatory application of the guidelines constitutes plain error, <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 217 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005), a defendant who seeks resentencing on this ground must show actual prejudice, <em>i.e., </em>a \u201cnonspeculative basis for concluding that the treatment of the guidelines as mandatory \u2018affect[ed] the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223 (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)). The sentencing transcript contains no nonspeculative basis on which this court could conclude that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence had the corut proceeded under an advisory guideline regime. Thus, we find that Jones has failed to demonstrate that the plain error in sentencing him under a mandatory guideline scheme affected his substantial rights. See <em>id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-20\">Accordingly, we affirm Jones\u2019 convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
