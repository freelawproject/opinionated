Because we find no merit to Appellant\u2019s argument on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-23\">Appellant asserts that he was improperly sentenced in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). In <em>Booker </em>the Supreme Court applied the holding of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and concluded that the Sixth Amendment is violated when a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>trict court imposes a sentence under the Guidelines that is greater than a sentence based solely upon facts found by the jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 752-56. Rather than totally invalidating the Guidelines, however, the Court held that the Guidelines are no longer binding on the district courts and are advisory only. To effectuate this remedy, the Court severed two provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act: 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2005), requiring sentencing courts to impose a sentence within the Guideline range, and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005), setting forth standards of review on appeal. Sentencing courts are now required to consider the applicable Guideline range, but may \u201ctailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns....\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">We conclude that <em>Booker </em>provides Appellant no grounds for relief. First, the Supreme Court did not totally invalidate the Sentencing Reform Act, but in fact left the great majority of the Act\u2019s provisions intact and legally effective. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764 (\u201cThe remainder of the Act \u2018function[s] independently.\u2019 \u201d). More specifically, the provision of the Act that governs supervised release, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), was not affected by <em>Booker. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 764-68. Finally, the change effected by Booker\u2014making the Sentencing Guidelines merely advisory\u2014was not a change in the manner in which the Guidelines were applied to <em>pre-Booker </em>revocations of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cChapter 7\u2019s policy statements are now and have always been non-binding, advisory guides to district courts in supervised release revocation proceedings.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We accordingly find no reversible error and affirm the order of the district court revoking Appellant\u2019s supervised release and imposing a term of twenty-four months of imprisonment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
