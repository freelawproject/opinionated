In calculating his sentencing range, the district court found, inter alia, that Thompson was a career offender under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B1.1 (2004). Thompson\u2019s applicable Guideline range was 151 to 188 months of imprisonment, and treating the Guidelines as mandatory, the district court sentenced Thompson to a 180-month term of imprisonment. Thompson does not challenge his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-22\">At his sentencing hearing, Thompson objected to the procedures utilized by the court, arguing that they violated the Sixth Amendment principles outlined in <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), on appeal, Thompson asserts that his sentence is unconstitutional. Thompson asserts that his sentence violates <em>Booker </em>because the district court (1) sentenced him under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme and (2) violated his Sixth Amendment right by sentencing him as a career offender. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-23\">In <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.2005), we held that treating the Guidelines as mandatory constitutes error under <em>Booker. See id. </em>at 216-17. Moreover, because Thompson\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection sufficed to preserve his statutory <em>Booker </em>claim, we must review his claim of statutory <em>Booker </em>error for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d 411, 415 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that because the appellant had \u201cproperly preserved his claim of statutory <em>Booker </em>error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>by raising a timely <em>Blakely </em>objection at sentencing,\u201d the Court was \u201cobliged to review his preserved claim of statutory <em>Booker </em>error for harmless error\u201d). Accordingly, we must reverse unless the Government demonstrates that the error is harmless. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\u201cAny error ... that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.\u201d). Our review of the record as a whole leads us to conclude that the Government has not met its burden of demonstrating that the error in sentencing Thompson under a mandatory Guidelines scheme does not affect his substantial rights. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>433 F.3d at 416, (noting that the sentencing court\u2019s silence must be interpreted in the appellant\u2019s favor when the burden rests on the Government). Thus, the error is not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Accordingly, we vacate Thompson\u2019s sentence and remand for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-20\">. \u201cWe of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time of [Appellant's] sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 545 n. 4 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">. Because we vacate the sentence for statutory <em>Booker </em>error, we need not decide whether the district court committed Sixth Amendment error. We note, however, that to the extent that Thompson contends that sentencing him as a career offender based on his undisputed prior convictions is unconstitutional, that contention is foreclosed by this Court's opinion in <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515 (4th Cir.2005), which held that an application of the career offender enhancement did not violate <em>Booker </em>where facts were undisputed, thereby making it unnecessary to engage in further factfinding about a prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 523.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
