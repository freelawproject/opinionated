He contends that the Bureau of Prison\u2019s (BOP) policy of calculating good time credit (GTC) based on the time the prisoner has been incarcerated is contrary to the plain meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1); instead, the BOP should be calculating GTC based on the time the prisoner is sentenced to serve. He bought this action under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, hoping to obtain a court order requiring the BOP to calculate GTC based on the time he is sentenced to serve. The district court dismissed his petition. He now appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-8\">The statute at issue states that a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year ... may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner\u2019s sentence, beyond the time served, of up to 54 days at the end of each year of the prisoner\u2019s term of imprisonment, beginning at the end of the first year of the term, subject to determination by the Bureau of Prisons that, during that year, the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b)(1). The BOP interprets this section to mean that an inmate earns \u201c54 days credit toward service of sentence (good time credit) for each year served.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 523.20(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">In <em>Brown v. McFadden, </em>416 F.3d 1271, 1272 (11th Cir.2005), we decided the claim petitioner presents here. There, we held the BOP\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the statute that a federal prisoner should get good time credit of 54 days for each year he actually serves in prison [was] reasonable and therefore [was] due to be affirmed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\"><em>Brown </em>dictates our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"Atu\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
