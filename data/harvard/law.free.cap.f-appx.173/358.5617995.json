Garcia argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that members of the two street gangs involved in the offense participated in a jointly undertaken criminal activity\u2014a conspiracy\u2014 for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) and further challenges the drug quantity calculation methodology adopted by the district court in determining his relevant conduct for sentencing. The district court did not clearly err in finding that a jointly undertaken criminal activity existed for purposes of \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). <em>See United States v. Hull, </em>160 F.3d 265, 268-69 (5th Cir.1998). The district court\u2019s estimate of the drug quantity attributable to Garcia as relevant conduct also was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Medina, </em>161 F.3d 867, 876 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-22\">The Government argues that Garcia\u2019s remaining appellate arguments are barred by the waiver provision in Garcia\u2019s plea agreement. Garcia does not suggest that his waiver was other than knowing and voluntary. Because Garcia\u2019s challenge to the penalties for crack cocaine is within the scope of the waiver and is not covered by an exception to the waiver, the issue is barred by the waiver, and as to this issue the appeal is dismissed. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544-46 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-23\">Garcia argues that the district court erred by denying him a two-level adjustment pursuant to \u00a7 3B1.2(b) based on his minor role in the offense. The district court did not clearly err in denying a reduction for a minor role in the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>because Garcia did not meet his burden of showing that his role was \u201cperipheral\u201d to the advancement of the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 268, 1 63 L.Ed.2d 241 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Garcia further argues the district court should have considered adequately \u201cthe individual facts\u201d in imposing sentence in the light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Even if this issue is not barred by Garcia\u2019s appeal waiver, Garcia is not entitled to relief because his sentence, at the lowest end of the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range, is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
