We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this determination pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000), even in light of the recent passage of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231. <em>See Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, ISO-54 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Given this jurisdictional bar, we cannot review the underlying merits of Bosung\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Bosung also contends that the Board erred in denying his request for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that Bosung failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court. We therefore uphold the denial of his request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">We also find that substantial evidence supports the finding that Bosung fads to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). We find that Bosung failed to make the requisite showing before the immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the.facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
