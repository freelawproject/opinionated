On appeal, Plata-Mora argues that his sentence is unreasonable because: (1) \u201che is an illiterate young man who lives in grinding poverty;\u201d and (2) \u201c[h]is only other career path is borderline malnutrition and an early death.\u201d Plata-Mora contends that, because he received the exact same sentence after his case was remanded for resentencing based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court incorrectly applied the guidelines as mandatory. He further argues that the sentence does not serve the purposes of retribution or punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-19\">We review a defendant\u2019s final sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1322-23 (11th Cir. 2006); <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66. A sentence within the guideline range is not presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 787 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201creject[ing] the [government\u2019s] argument ... that a sentence within the Guidelines range is per se reasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-20\">In determining whether a sentence is reasonable, the district court should be guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. at 765-66; <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005). Those factors include: (1) the guideline range; (2) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (3) the history and characteristics of the defendant; and (4) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to provide punishment, and to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Although the sentencing court must be guided by these factors, we have held that \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in [\u00a7 ] 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Although a sentence within the guideline range is not per se reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-788. The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Because the record in this case demonstrates that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the advisory guideline range in sentencing Plata-Mora, and because we conclude that the sentence imposed was reasonable, we affirm Plata-Mora\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
