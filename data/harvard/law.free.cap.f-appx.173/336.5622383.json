He argues that the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles violated his constitutional rights by denying him release on parole or mandatory supervision and that he has been forced to work while in prison without just compensation in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">We construe Courtney\u2019s notice of appeal as a request for a certificate of appealability (COA) pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(1). To obtain a COA, Courtney must make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">During the pendency of this appeal, Courtney was released from Texas state prison to mandatory supervision, and Courtney is now serving a federal sentence in the Federal Correctional Institution in Yazoo City, Mississippi. Courtney\u2019s claims have been rendered moot by his release into federal custody. <em>See Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 278-79 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, this appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT. COA and IFP are DENIED AS MOOT. Any other requested relief also is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
