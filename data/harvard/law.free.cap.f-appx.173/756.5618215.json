Ford, claiming that he is immune from suit under the doctrine of qualified immunity, moved the court for summary judgment. The court denied his motion in an order entered on July 25, 2005. He now appeals the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-14\">In its July 25 order, the court, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to Rigdon (as it was required to do), explained at length (at pages 20-25) why Ford is not entitled to qualified immunity. We find no error in the court\u2019s explanation and therefore affirm its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
