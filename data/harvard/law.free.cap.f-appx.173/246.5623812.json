On appeal, Hill challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 851 after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because \u00a7 851 allows the Government to increase the maximum punishment without proving the facts supporting the increase to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or alleging those facts in an indictment. Hill also challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 851(e), which precludes a defendant from challenging a prior conviction that is more than five years old. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">First, we find Hill\u2019s allegation that \u00a7 851 is unconstitutional foreclosed by the prior conviction exception discussed in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which was reaffirmed by the Supreme Court in <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244, 125 S.Ct. <em>738 (\u201cAny </em>fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Next, Hill argues that the statute of limitations provision in \u00a7 851(e) that precludes a defendant from challenging the validity of a prior conviction used to enhance a sentence if the conviction is over five years old is unconstitutional. We find Hill\u2019s argument without merit. <em>See Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732,128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
