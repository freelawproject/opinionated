On appeal, Vereen argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by imposing an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence based on his three prior felony drug convictions. These prior convictions were neither charged in the indictment nor found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Vereen acknowledges that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>acknowledges that the mere fact \u201cof\u2019 a prior conviction may be used to enhance a sentence even if not charged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. However, Vereen argues that there is a \u201ccrucial distinction\u201d between the \u201cfact of a prior conviction,\u201d which can be constitutionally found by a judge, and a \u201cfact about a prior conviction,\u201d which must be submitted to a jury. Vereen asserts that the district court\u2019s finding that his prior convictions were felony drug offenses and that the convictions became final prior to June 3, 2004, were findings \u201cabout\u201d the convictions, which are beyond the scope of permissible judicial fact-finding. Vereen does not question the accuracy of the district court\u2019s characterization of the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">We review de novo constitutional errors in sentencing, but will reverse only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) and 851, an individual who committed an offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. Without the enhancement for a prior conviction, the mandatory minimum sentence is five years\u2019 imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">We recently addressed and rejected the argument \u201cthat even if <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>still permits a judge to determine \u2018the existence of a prior conviction,\u2019 the principles of <em>Apprendi </em>extended through <em>Booker </em>forbid a judge from determining \u2018the factual nature of a prior conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1268 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). In <em>Greer, </em>the district court found that the defendant\u2019s prior indictments and the statutes clearly established that the defendant was previously convicted of \u201cviolent\u201d crimes as defined by the Armed Career Criminal Act (the \u201cACCA\u201d). Id., at 1275. However, the district court did not apply the minimum required by the ACCA for defendants with prior convictions for violent crimes because it limited the evidence of the prior crimes nature to the state statute which prohibited both violent and non-violent behavior. <em>Id. </em>The district court refused to consider the evidence of the indictments. We held that this refusal was error and was \u201cnot justified in view of our decisions describing the non-effect of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Booker </em>on the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>rule.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1275. <em>Shepard </em>does not bar judges from finding facts \u201cabout\u201d a prior conviction, but \u201crestricts the sources or evidence that a judge ... can consider in making that finding.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1275. Those sources are \u201cthe statutory elements, charging documents, any plea agreement and colloquy or jury instructions, or comparable judicial record.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">Here, the Government produced judgments of conviction with the information filed pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. These judgments state that Vereen was convicted of three prior drug offenses in the state of Florida, namely one conviction for the second degree felony of possession of cocaine with intent to sell, in violation of section 893.13(1)(a)(l) of Florida Statutes, and two convictions for the third degree felony of possession of cocaine, in violation of section 893.13(1)(a)(2) of Florida Statutes. Reading these judgments and the relevant Florida statutes establishes that Vereen is subject to the mandatory statutory minimum sentence of ten years because he was previously convicted of felony drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Accordingly, Vereen\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
