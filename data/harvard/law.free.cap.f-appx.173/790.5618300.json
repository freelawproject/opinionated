The appellee in this case, J. Rae Hoyer (\u201cMrs. Hoyer\u201d), is the widow of deceased psychiatrist, Dr. David J. Hoyer (\u201cDr. Hoyer\u201d). Dr. Hoyer arrived at the Collier County, Florida, jail on January 3, 2001, to evaluate the competency to stand trial of known dangerous inmate Rodriguez Patten (\u201cinmate Patten\u201d). While interviewing and assessing inmate Patten\u2019s competency, inmate Patten strangled Dr. Hoyer, causing his death. This suit was filed by Mrs. Hoyer in state court but later was removed by Sheriff Hunter to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. After a five-day jury trial, the jury returned a verdict in Mrs. Hoyer\u2019s favor. A judgment was entered on the jury\u2019s verdict in the sum of $1,325,130.00. Sheriff Hunter contends in this appeal that the district court committed reversible error in permitting certain testimony of Mrs. Hoyer\u2019s expert witness, Randall Atlas (\u201cAtlas\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, including its rulings on the admissibility of expert testimony, for abuse of discretion. <em>Cook v. Sheriff of Monroe County, Fla., </em>402 F.3d 1092, 1103 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Wright v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>375 F.3d 1252, 1260 (11th Cir.2004). We also review the denial of a motion for new trial for abuse of discretion. <em>Lambert v. Fulton County, Ga., </em>253 F.3d 588, 595 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cOur cases, consistent with Rule 61 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, hold that a new trial is warranted only where the error has caused substantial prejudice to the affected party (or, stated somewhat differently, affected the party\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights\u201d or resulted in \u201csubstantial injustice\u201d).\u201d <em>Peat, Inc. v. Vanguard Research, Inc., </em>378 F.3d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">After reviewing the record, including the trial testimony of Atlas, as well as reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that, even if the district court erred in admitting certain aspects of Atlas\u2019s testimony, the error was harmless. First, Sheriff Hunter admitted at trial that he at least owed Dr. Hoyer a general duty of care. Second, and more importantly, even if there were error in admitting Atlas\u2019s testimony, the district court\u2019s jury instructions cured the error. In instructing the jury on the relevant law pertaining to Sheriff Hunter\u2019s liability, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-11\">The court instructs you, as a matter of law, that defendant Don Hunter, is responsible for any negligence <em>on </em>the part of his agents or employees, including those agents or employees of the Collier County Jail. In addition, the Sheriff has a duty to use reasonable care for the safety of persons who enter the jail. However, as a matter of law, Sheriff Hunter is not responsible for any damages resulting from failing to classify inmate Rodrigus [sic] as a high-risk inmate, or for any design defects in the building, such as the location and size of the window, or the direction in which the door opened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">(R. Vol. 10 at 754-755) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">Because of this curative instruction, and the other evidence presented at trial, we cannot say that, even if the district court committed error by permitting the jury to hear all of Atlas\u2019s testimony, it was \u201csubstantially prejudicial\u201d to Sheriff Hunter\u2019s case. Accordingly, we affirm the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>court\u2019s order denying Sheriff Hunter\u2019s motion for new trial and the judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
