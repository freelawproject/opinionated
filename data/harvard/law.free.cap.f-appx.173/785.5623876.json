Miguel Caridad, appointed counsel for Valentin, has filed a motion to withdraw on appeal supported by a brief prepared pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merit of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s denial of Valentin\u2019s motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
