Huitron\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Huitron contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny, we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Huitron properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-24\">For the first time on appeal, Huitron argues that the district court plainly erred by applying a 16-level sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Because Huitron did not raise this issue below, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Hull, </em>160 F.3d 265, 271 (5th Cir.1998). Contrary to Huitron\u2019s contention, his prior conviction for distribution of cocaine was in federal court, not state court. All of the offenses contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), which criminalizes the distribution of cocaine, are drug trafficking offenses under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 841(a) <em>with </em>\u00a7 2L1.2 comment. (n.(l)(B)(iv)). Thus, while the district court may have erred by relying upon the description of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the facts underlying Huitron\u2019s prior conviction in the presentence report, <em>see United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273-274 (5th Cir.2005), Huitron cannot establish plain error because his prior conviction does support the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Cortez, </em>988 F.2d 1408, 1415-16 <em>&amp; </em>n. 37 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
