We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-18\">Patton\u2019s sentence was imposed after the issuance of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), but before <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), issued. The probation officer determined Patton\u2019s base offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2B1.1(a)(2) (2003) was six. He applied a ten-level enhancement under' USSG \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(F), based on a loss amount between $120,000 and $200,000; a two-level enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) for Patton\u2019s role as an organizer; and a three-level decrease under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. He found Patton\u2019s criminal history category was IV, in part based on a determination that the instant offenses began within two years after Patton\u2019s release from custody on a prior charge pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(e). Accordingly, Patton\u2019s total offense level was fifteen and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>guideline range was thirty to thirty-seven months in prison. Patton did not object to the original presentence report or otherwise challenge the guideline calculations or findings of fact therein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">After <em>Blakely, </em>Patton argued the district court was still required to apply the sentencing guidelines but was prohibited from making judicial findings of fact and enhancing his sentence above his base offense level of six. The Government contended that <em>Blakely </em>either did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines or that the guidelines should be applied as advisory. The district court ruled that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the federal sentencing guidelines and that it would not apply the guidelines as mandatory but would consider them as advisory when sentencing Patton. After hearing unrebutted evidence from the Government in support of the presentence report, the court adopted its findings of fact and guideline applications without change. Based on Patton\u2019s extensive criminal history and the seriousness of the offenses, the court sentenced him to thirty-seven months in prison. Pursuant to the parties\u2019 plea agreement, the court dismissed three additional counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u201cConcluding that the mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines is what offended the Sixth Amendment jury right,\u201d the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>observed that if they were \u201c \u2018read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 454-55 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750). Because the guidelines were binding, the Court \u201cfound no distinction of constitutional significance between the guidelines and the state sentencing scheme it evaluated and found wanting in <em>Blakely.\u201d United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">To effectuate congressional intent, the Supreme Court \u201cexcised the provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act that mandated sentencing and appellate review in conformance with the guidelines, thereby rendering the guidelines \u2018effectively advisory.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Although they are no longer mandatory, a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 767. \u201c[T]he court must make factual findings, as appropriate or necessary to carry out its sentencing function, and in every case give the reasons for the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 455. \u201cWe will affirm the sentence imposed as long as it is within the statutorily prescribed range, and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47 (citations omitted). A sentence imposed within the properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>Green, </em>436 F.3d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">On appeal, Patton does not contend that the district court erred in its guideline calculations, only that the court\u2019s factual findings violated his Sixth Amendment rights. We disagree. Because the district court properly treated the guidelines as advisory only, there was no Sixth Amendment error. Moreover, it is undisputed that the sentence imposed was with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>in both the statutorily prescribed and properly calculated guidelines ranges. We conclude the sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-13\">. This appeal was previously in abeyance for <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162 (4th Cir. 2005). However, as the Government has not sought enforcement of Patton's waiver of appellate rights contained in his plea agreement, we decline to consider whether the waiver is dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">. The probation officer filed an addendum to the presentence report showing greater losses than stated in the original report, and Patton objected to the new restitution amounts. However, the probation officer did not increase the loss amount for purposes of determining Patton\u2019s guideline range. He further did not apply a two-level increase under USSG \u00a7 2B 1.1 (b)(2)(A) for an offense involving more than ten victims based on stipulations in the parties' plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
