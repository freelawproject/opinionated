On appeal, counsel filed an <em>Anders </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> brief, in which he states there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Buck was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Buck\u2019s motion for early termination of probation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3564(c) (2000); <em>United States v. Pregent, </em>190 F.3d 279, 282 (4th Cir.1999) (reviewing denial of motion for early termination of supervised release for abuse of discretion). In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Buck, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Buck requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Buck.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-11\"><em> Anders v.
