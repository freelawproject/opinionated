California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Gonzalez, acting <em>pro se, </em>has filed a memorandum of law in support of his initial brief and asks that counsel be appointed for him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Our independent review of the record and the sentencing transcript reveals no meritorious issues. We therefore grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw on appeal and affirm Gonzalez\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">In his memorandum, Gonzalez contends that he decided to plead guilty based on \u201cthe inducement of the unacomplished [sic] promises of the Government and misleading of defense counsel.\u201d He claims that the Government\u2019s plea agreement guaranteed that it would \u201crecommend and agree: to 78-months imprisonment if [Gonzalez would] enter a plea of guilt.\u201d Instead, Gonzalez was sentenced to 120 months. He claims that had he known, he \u201cwould probably not pleaded guilty and challenged the case in trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In Gonzalez\u2019s change of plea hearing before the magistrate judge, discussing Count One of Gonzalez\u2019s indictment, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(v\u00fc), 846, the court told Gonzalez that \u201c[a]ccording to your plea agreement, the potential punishment in this case involves a mandatory minimum ten years incarceration and the possible maximum term of life imprisonment.\u201d He then asked Gonzalez \u201cDo you understand the conspiracy allegation against you in Count One?\u201d Gonzalez answered \u2018Tes, sir.\u201d The court then asked \u201cDo you understand what the possible punishment is on that count?\u201d Gonzalez answered \u2018Tes, sir.\u201d (R2-9).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">From the change of plea transcript, in pleading guilty, Gonzalez stated \u201cI talked to my lawyer about it and we came up to terms by me pleading guilty that I will not be looking at ten to life. I will be looking at ten to twelve years ... That\u2019s why the reason I signed. That\u2019s the reason I agree to this ... But if it is going to be like ten to life, well, I want to disagree with that because that is not what I was told.\u201d (R2 at 9,10).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Later, at his sentencing hearing before the district judge, the court reiterated to Gonzalez that Count One carried a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years\u2019 imprisonment because the conspiracy involved 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana. (R3-7). The court then asked Gonzalez \u201cAnything you care to say? I have to give you 120 months, you know that.\u201d Gonzalez answered \u2018Tes, sir.\u201d (R3-16,17).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">It is clear from our review of the record that Gonzalez\u2019s plea of guilty was made voluntarily, that he understood the nature of the charges against him, and that he understood the consequences of his plea. <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir.2003). Gonzalez\u2019s argument that the Government guaranteed that he would receive 78 months if he pleaded guilty is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">MOTION TO WITHDRAW GRANTED; CONVICTION AND SENTENCE AFFIRMED; APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR ANOTHER APPOINTED COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
