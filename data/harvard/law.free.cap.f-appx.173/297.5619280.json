He was sentenced to thirty months in prison. Monahan now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue but stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Monahan was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not filed such a brief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The sole issue raised by counsel is whether the sentence is reasonable. We note that counsel identifies no error in the proceeding and concludes that the sentence, at the low end of Monahan\u2019s guideine range of 30-37 months, is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">After the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). In determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the defendant\u2019s guideline range and to consider that range along with the sentencing factors set forth at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Id. </em>We will affirm a post-<em>Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutory maximum. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Here, the district court, as required, considered both the guideline range and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when imposing sentence. The thirty-month sentence is with the statutory maximum of ten years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005). Accordingly, we conclude that Monahan\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have thoroughly reviewed the entire record and found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
