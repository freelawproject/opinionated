Robertson argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) was wrongly decided in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). He also asserts that the career enhancement provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 was improperly applied to his sentence because his driving while intoxicated convictions do not constitute \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d in light of <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004). Robertson contends that he is entitled to proceed under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the career offender enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Robertson has not made the requisite showing to qualify for the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. His challenge to the sentencing court\u2019s application of the Guidelines is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the bank robbery for which he was convicted no longer qualifies as a violation of law. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). His argument that he is actually innocent of being a career offender in light of <em>Leo-cal </em>\u201cis not the type of argument that courts have recognized may warrant review under \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>See Kinder v. Purdy, </em>222 F.3d 209, 213 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Additionally, this court has determined that <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>United States v. Booker </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), do not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review and do not satisfy the test for filing a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause. <em>See Wesson v. United States Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005). Further, Robertson\u2019s argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided in light of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Robertson also challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to hold his case in abeyance pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Washington v. Recuenco, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2546, 165 L.Ed.2d 466 (2006). The Supreme Court has issued its decision in <em>Recuenco </em>and has held that a <em>Blakely </em>error does not constitute a structural error. <em>See Recuenco, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2553. Thus, Robertson\u2019s argument that his sentence violates <em>Blakely </em>and constitutes a structural error is meritless. Moreover, <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not retroactively applicable to Robertson\u2019s case. <em>See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 427. Thus, the district court did not err in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Accordingly, the judgments of the district court are affirmed. Robertson is warned that the filing of repetitive or frivolous filings in the future will invite the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-37\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
