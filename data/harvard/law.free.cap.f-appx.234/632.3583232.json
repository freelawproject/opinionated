We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>dence, <em>Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Assuming credibility, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Martinez-Fernandez failed to establish that the harm he experienced occurred on account of a protected ground because he failed to show that guerillas were interested in him for any reason other than conscription. Thus, his asylum claim fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Because Martinez-Fernandez failed to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum, it necessarily follows that he failed to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b662-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
