We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on implausible testimony regarding the KGB, the submission of a document that is likely false, and inconsistencies regarding political activity in his home town. <em>See id. </em>at 1042-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Because petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Petitioner also fails to establish a CAT claim because he did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he was returned to Armenia. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b816-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
