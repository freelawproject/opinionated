R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b604-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-23\">Ian Anthony Suite appeals from his 24-month sentence for committing wire fraud in connection with telemarketing, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343, 2326, and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-24\">Suite was sentenced following a guilty plea he entered pursuant to a plea agreement that contained an appeal waiver. However, he contends that the government waived the appeal waiver. He is incorrect. Suite also contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, 543 </em>U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), means that he is not bound by his appeal waiver. We disagree. <em>Booker </em>did not vitiate the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Cortez-Arias, 425 </em>F.3d 547, 547-48 (9th Cir.2005), <em>amending, </em>415 F.3d 977 (9th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Cardenas, 405 </em>F.3d 1046, 1048 (9th Cir. 2005). Because Suite knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal the entry of judgment and the sentence, and because the sentence was within the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>of the plea agreement, we dismiss the appeal. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that an appeal waiver is valid when it is entered into knowingly and voluntarily).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
