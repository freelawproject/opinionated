We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 857 (9th Cir. 2004) (per curiam), we grant the petition for review, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-28\">The BIA abused its discretion when it applied the wrong standard to determine whether the performance of prior counsel resulted in prejudice to Ruiz-Flores and Rojas-Chavez. The BIA required Ruiz-Flores and Rojas-Chavez to demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>their eligibility for cancellation of removal, when they need only demonstrate that the deficient performance by counsel may have affected the outcome of proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 858-59 (BIA abused its discretion when it determined that counsel\u2019s performance did not result in prejudice by directly adjudging whether the petitioners would win or lose their claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Accordingly, we remand for the BIA to determine, under the correct standard, whether Ruiz-Flores and Rojas-Chavez were prejudiced by prior counsel\u2019s conduct. If either Ruiz-Flores\u2019 or Rojas-Chavez\u2019s application for cancellation of removal is ultimately granted, the agency should consider Ruiz-Rojas\u2019 claim that her removal would result in the requisite hardship to her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b839-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
