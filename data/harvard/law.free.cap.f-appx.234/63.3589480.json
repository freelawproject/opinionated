In Appeal No. 07-6197, Ebersole challenges the district court\u2019s orders denying his motion for a new trial and related motions, and denying his motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Ebersole, </em>No. 1:03-cr-00112-LMB (E.D. Va. July 25, 2006 &amp; Jan. 26, 2007). In Appeal No. 06-7405, Ebersole appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for immediate release. By failing to raise this claim in his informal brief, Ebersole has waived this issue. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b). Ebersole\u2019s motion to stay the subject appeals pending his recovery from surgery is denied. We also deny as moot his motion for a stay or extension of time to file his informal brief in Appeal No. 07-6197. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
