We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-24\">\u201cWhere, as here, the BIA conducts a de novo review of the IJ\u2019s decision, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-25\">The BIA denied Velasquez\u2019s petition for asylum and withholding of removal, finding that, even assuming Velasquez had proven past persecution on account of a protected ground, the Government had successfully rebutted the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution by demonstrating changed country conditions. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding. <em>See Gonzalez-Hernandez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 995, 1000 (9th Cir.2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Substantial evidence supports the denial of Velasquez\u2019s CAT claim because he did not establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Guatemala. <em>See Malhi, </em>336 F.3d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Finally, because substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings, we need not address Velasquez\u2019s contentions regarding firm resettlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b646-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
