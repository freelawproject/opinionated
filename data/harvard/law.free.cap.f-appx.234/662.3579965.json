We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>see Singh v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 1050, 1052 (9th Cir.2000), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-23\">In his motion to reopen, Debuque did not contest that he received the Order to Show Cause (\u201cOSC\u201d) and that the notice of hearing was sent by certified mail to his last known address. Accordingly, the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reopen. <em>See In re Grijalva, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 27, 32-34 (BIA 1995) (holding notice of hearing must be sent by certified mail to last known ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>dress); <em>see also Chaidez v.
