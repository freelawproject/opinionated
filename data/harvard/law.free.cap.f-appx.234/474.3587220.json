He argues on appeal that 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u00a7 3624(e) prohibits the district court from imposing consecutive sentences of imprisonment for his violation of the concurrent terms of his supervised release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm Casson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>176 F.3d 1175 (9th Cir.1999), we considered the application of \u00a7 3624(e) to a court\u2019s consideration of a supervised release violation. We concluded that \u201cthe District Court retains discretion to impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences, after revocation of a defendant\u2019s supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1177. As a three-judge panel, we <em>are </em>bound by <em>Jackson </em>unless an intervening decision by the Supreme Court has \u201cundercut the theory or reasoning underlying <em>[Jackson </em>] in such a way that the cases are clearly irreconcilable.\u201d <em>Miller v. Gammie, </em>335 F.3d 889, 900 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Casson\u2019s assertion that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000), undermines <em>Jackson </em>is not persuasive. <em>Johnson </em>did not consider or cite \u00a7 3624(e), or otherwise consider concurrent terms <em>of </em>supervised release, because Johnson was serving a single term of supervised release. We do not read <em>Johnson </em>as undermining our opinion in <em>Jackson </em>that a district court has the discretion to impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences after revocation of a defendant\u2019s supervised release, and accordingly, Casson\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b504-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
