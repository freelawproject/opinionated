Petitioner seeks review of two separate orders of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The orders upheld an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of Petitioner\u2019s requests for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), as well as, the denial of Petitioner\u2019s claim that he was a United States national. The IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and CAT relief was based on Petitioner\u2019s failure to demonstrate that he would suffer persecution and/or torture if returned to his homeland. The denial was not explicitly based on Petitioner\u2019s aggravated felony status.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>See Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 931, 936 (9th Cir.2005) (the jurisdiction-stripping provision in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) is inapplicable when the IJ does not rely on the aggravated felony conviction as the basis for denying Petitioner\u2019s application for withholding of removal and CAT relief). \"When the BIA incorporates the conclusions of the IJ in rendering its own decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s decision and the IJ\u2019s rationale to the extent that it is incorporated in the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Molinar-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), we deny the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Petitioner is a citizen and native of Nigeria. He filed an application for naturalization, but the application was later dismissed for failure to submit documentation regarding the disposition of a prior arrest. The filing of an application for naturalization does not change an applicant\u2019s immigration status from an alien to that of a national because, under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), a person may become a \u201cnational of the United States only through birth or naturalization.\u201d See <em>Perdomo-Padilla v. Ashcroft, </em>333 <em>F.3d </em>964, 965 (9th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1104, 124 S.Ct. 1041, 157 L.Ed.2d 887 (2004). Petitioner\u2019s claim that he is a United States citizen is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">An adverse credibility determination was made against the Petitioner as part of the IJ\u2019s overall merit assessment of Petitioner\u2019s claims. In affirming this determination, the BIA noted that although Petitioner\u2019s testimony was consistent with his application, any rational person would place his credibility in issue because he committed numerous instances of fraud. The BLA correctly determined that the IJ \u201cappropriately gave the applicant\u2019s testimony little weight, particularly given the applicant\u2019s propensity for fraud and the lack of corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>See Un-uakhaulu, </em>416 F.3d at 938 (IJ\u2019s adverse inference based on credit card fraud conviction, as well as, meager, nonspecific, uncorroborated testimony constituted an explicit adverse credibility determination).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">Petitioner\u2019s requests for withholding of removal and relief under CAT were properly denied because he failed to establish that it is more likely than not he would be persecuted and or tortured. <em>Id. </em>at 937-939.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Finally, Petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen his prior removal proceedings was also prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>erly denied because it was untimely. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b625-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
