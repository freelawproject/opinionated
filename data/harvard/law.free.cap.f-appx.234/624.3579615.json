We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\u2018Where, as here, the BIA reviews <em>de novo </em>the IJ\u2019s decision, our review is limited to the decision of the BIA.\u201d <em>See Garcia-Quintero v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 1006, 1011 (9th Cir.2006). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1018 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Because the incidents that Hengyu described did not rise to the level of persecution and because several of the incidents were not on account of a protected ground, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Hengyu did not suffer past persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003); see <em>also Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1488-91 (9th Cir.1997). In addition, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Hengyu failed to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution because his fear of future persecution is speculative. <em>See Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1018 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Furthermore, because Hengyu failed to meet his burden for asylum, he necessarily did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">Substantial evidence also supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Hengyu has not shown that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returns to China. <em>See Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 721-22 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b654-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
