Leighton, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b470-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">MHC Financing Limited Partnership Two (\u201cMHC\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, denying its as-applied and facial takings, due process and equal protection claims arising out of the City of Santee\u2019s enforcement of a series of rent and vacancy control ordinances applicable to mobile home parks, including one owned by MHC.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">MHC\u2019s as-applied takings claims were properly dismissed as unripe under <em>Williamson County Reg\u2019l Planning Comm\u2019n v. Hamilton Bank, </em>473 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985), because MHC had not sought or been denied compensation from the City or through state procedures prior to commencing its actions. MHC\u2019s facial takings claims were ripe but time barred, as each of its lawsuits was filed more than one year after the enactment of the rent and vacancy control provisions it challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Lingle v. Chevron USA, Inc., </em>544 U.S. 528, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876 (2005), decided after the district court\u2019s dismissal, forecloses MHC\u2019s facial takings claim based on its \u201cfailure to substantially advance\u201d theory. <em>See MHC v. City of San Jose, </em>420 F.3d 1022, 1034 (9th Cir.2005)(\u201cMHC\u2019s facial takings claim asserts that the Ordinance fails to \u2018substantially advance\u2019 a legitimate state interest. This claim is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding [in <em>Lingle </em>].\u201d) MHC now seeks a remand to pursue alternate takings theories. Because these alternative theories were never raise before the district court, we decline MHC\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Nor does <em>Lingle </em>resurrect MHC\u2019s substantive due process and equal protection claims. Like the facial takings claim, these claims are subject to a one year limitations period. MHC did not commence either of its lawsuits within a year of the effective date of the subject rent and vacancy control provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b470-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
