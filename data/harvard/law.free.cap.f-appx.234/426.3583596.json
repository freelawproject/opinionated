(\u201cLincoln\u201d) for authority to employ WEW as its Chapter 11 bankruptcy counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">In November 2002, when Lincoln filed for bankruptcy and applied for authority to employ WEW as its counsel, the president and one-third owner of Lincoln was John J. Carvelli. Lincoln\u2019s treasurer and chief financial officer was Bryan Weiss. At the same time as Lincoln sought to employ WEW, WEW represented another Chapter 11 debtor, California Psychiatric Management Services (\u201cCPMS\u201d). Carvelli and Weiss had been on CPMS\u2019s post-petition management committee until July 2002. In August 2002, CPMS\u2019s committee of unsecured creditors sued Carvelli and Weiss, alleging that Carvelli and Weiss stole $1.5 million from CPMS\u2019s estate. A stipulated order entered in CPMS\u2019s bankruptcy, signed on CPMS\u2019s behalf by its counsel, David R. Weinstein of WEW, obliged CPMS to assist the CPMS creditors committee in prosecuting any potential litigation. In the CPMS creditors committee\u2019s suit against Carvelli and Weiss, Weinstein was identified as a potential witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">In the Lincoln bankruptcy, the CPMS creditors committee and the United States Trustee objected to WEW\u2019s employment as Lincoln\u2019s counsel. The bankruptcy court refused to authorize Lincoln\u2019s employment of WEW. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel of the Ninth Circuit (\u201cBAP\u201d) affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory order denying WEW\u2019s appointment as counsel, and we refused to hear an interlocutory appeal of the BAP\u2019s ruling. When the bankruptcy court dismissed Lincoln\u2019s Chapter 11 petition, the bankruptcy court\u2019s interlocutory order denying the appointment of WEW became final, and WEW appealed that order to the district court. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of Lincoln\u2019s application to employ WEW. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1) gives us jurisdiction over WEW\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">We independently review the decision of the bankruptcy court, giving no deference to the district court\u2019s decision. <em>In re Strand, </em>375 F.3d 854, 857 (9th Cir.2004). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to deny employment of counsel for abuse of discretion. <em>See In re Elias, </em>215 B.R. 600, 603 (9th Cir. BAP 1997), <em>ajfd, </em>188 F.3d 1160 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam). We may affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>on any ground supported by the record. <em>In re Olsen, </em>36 F.3d 71, 73 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Under \u00a7 327(a) of Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a), an attorney must satisfy two requirements to qualify to serve as the debtor\u2019s attorney. First, the attorney must \u201cnot hold or represent an interest adverse to the estate,\u201d and, second, the attorney must be a \u201cdisinterested person!].\u201d Under the version of the Code applicable to this case, an attorney is disinterested if the attorney \u201cdoes not have an interest materially adverse to the interest of the estate or of any class of creditors or equity security holders, by reason of any direct or indirect relationship to, connection with, or interest in, the debtor ... or for any other reason.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14)(E) (2000).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The United States Trustee offers two explanations for why WEW\u2019s employment as counsel would be adverse to the interest of the estate of Lincoln. First, the Trustee asserts that Carvelli and Weiss might overpay or overuse WEW as counsel in the Lincoln bankruptcy to curry favor with WEW so that WEW, and Weinstein in particular, would not fully assist the CPMS creditors committee in pressing their $1.5 million claim against Carvelli and Weiss. However, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Carvelli, Weiss, or WEW did or would have acted in such a manner, and therefore we do not rely upon this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The second reason the Trustee offers for why WEW\u2019s employment would be adverse to the interest of Lincoln\u2019s estate is more persuasive. Under the stipulation entered in the CPMS bankruptcy, WEW, as counsel to CPMS, had to help CPMS\u2019s creditors committee maximize the amount of damages it could recover from Carvelli and Weiss, and Weinstein may have been called to testify against Carvelli and Weiss. As counsel in Lincoln\u2019s bankruptcy, however, WEW\u2019s duty would have been to work <em>with </em>Carvelli and Weiss to help Lincoln maximize payments to its creditors. Any informal actions of Weinstein or his firm to aid the CPMS creditors committee, and testimony by Weinstein against Carvelli and Weiss, if that materialized, would likely have created some tension between WEW and Lincoln\u2019s management and thus impaired WEW\u2019s ability to work constructively with Carvelli and Weiss in Lincoln\u2019s bankruptcy. As the district court noted, \u201c[t]his would have placed WEW in the impossible position of working cooperatively with Carvelli and Weiss in the Lincoln matter, while taking a position adverse to them in the [CPMS] matter.\u201d It is not necessary that such possibilities were a certainty; it is enough if there was any genuine risk that counsel\u2019s ability to work with the principals of Lincoln might be impaired. In light of the broad discretion of a bankruptcy court to approve counsel for a debtor with the interest of the estate in mind, we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Lincoln\u2019s application to employ WEW as its bankruptcy counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Our reaching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of this conclusion does not reflect negatively on the character or competence of Wein-stein or any lawyer at WEW.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b457-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">. In the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 \u00a7 414, Pub.L. No. 109-8, 119 Stat. 23, 107, Congress amended and recodified 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14)(E) as 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14)(C) to eliminate the section\u2019s applicability to investment banks. The amendment did not affect the language relevant to this case, and our analysis would be the same under either version of the Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b458-10\">. In its opening brief to our court, WEW states that ''[b]y the time the Lincoln case arose, Carvelli and Weiss had been out of the CPMS Case for five months.\u201d If so, this would alleviate the risk that Weinstein would have to take actions assisting the CPMS creditors committee's claims, or would be asked to testify, against Carvelli and Weiss, and WEW\u2019s employment would not be adverse to the interest of Lincoln's estate. However, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>appears to us that WEW\u2019s factual assertion is not supported by the record. Lincoln\u2019s application to employ WEW, filed on the first day of Lincoln\u2019s bankruptcy, indicates that the CPMS litigation against Carvelli and Weiss was ongoing. Although it appears that five months before Lincoln filed for Chapter 11 protection Carvelli and Weiss <em>resigned from the CPMS management committee, </em>these resignations did not alleviate the risk that Wein-stein would have to take some action adverse to Carvelli and Weiss in the CPMS matter, which would create problems for WEW in working effectively for Carvelli and Weiss in the Lincoln matter in the best interest of Lincoln\u2019s estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
