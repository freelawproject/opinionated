R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b480-17\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-18\">Appellant Dewey Willie, a former mechanic employed by the Nevada Highway Patrol filed a complaint alleging that Ap-pellee State of Nevada (\u201cEmployer\u201d) violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against him on the basis of his national origin and by retaliating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>against him for his involvement in his fiancee\u2019s discrimination claim. Willie also seeks relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that he made negative comments about Appellee Richard Kirkland and that Kirkland retaliated against him in violation of the First Amendment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees on each of Willie\u2019s claims. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\n<em>I. Title VII</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Assuming without deciding that Willie established a prima facie case for his discrimination and retaliation claims under Title VII, these claims still fail because he is unable to show that Employer\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for his termination are pretextual \u201ceither directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u201d <em>Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). Employer\u2019s legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for Willie\u2019s dismissal include insubordination, use of profanity, falsification of time sheets, improperly charging tires to the state, attempting to cover up the tire charges, and breaching confidentiality with a witness in Employer\u2019s investigation of his actions. These incidents are documented in the record and cited by the Hearing Officer as reasons for Willie\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Willie raises two arguments that Employer\u2019s proffered explanations were not the true reasons for his termination. Neither of these arguments is persuasive. First, Willie asserts that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether his supervisor directed him to order tires for another employee\u2019s personal vehicle. The relevance of this argument to the pretext issue is unclear; even if Willie\u2019s version of the facts is accepted as true, whether a superior asked him to improperly charge the state for these tires does not absolve him of violations of the Employer\u2019s rules of conduct. Willie\u2019s second argument is that he could not have been legitimately fired for falsifying invoices because the Employer has a \u201cthree-lie rule\u201d\u2014a general practice of terminating employees only after three dishonest statements. The undisputed facts indicate that Willie lied about the invoices more than three times. The record of the interview on the evening of October 3, 2002 contains multiple lies about the falsified invoices, ending with Willie\u2019s assertion that he was \u201cbeing truthful\u201d with the investigators. Willie also does not contest the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings of ten separate dishonest statements during the October 4, 2002 interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Because Willie has not raised a genuine issue of material fact that Employer\u2019s proffered legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons were pretextual, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Employer on Willie\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">\n<em>II. Section 1983</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Willie fails to state a prima facie case for his claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Kirkland for retaliation in violation of the First Amendment because the record does not show that Willie\u2019s speech was a substantial or motivating factor for his termination. <em>See Coszalter v. City of Salem, </em>320 F.3d 968, 973 (9th Cir.2003). Willie provides no direct evidence that Kirkland retaliated against him for his statements and no evidence that Kirkland even knew of his protected speech. <em>See Keyser v. Sacramento Unified Sch. Dist., </em>265 F.3d 741, 751 (9th Cir.2001). Merely alleging that Kirkland directed \u201cwhat should be done\u201d and \u201cwhat issues should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>be looked into,\u201d and that Kirkland was present in a meeting where Willie\u2019s dismissal was discussed is insufficient to show that Kirkland knew about Willie\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Even assuming that Kirkland was aware of Willie\u2019s statements, Willie also fails to provide circumstantial evidence that his statements against Kirkland were a substantial or motivating factor in his termination. <em>Id. </em>at 751-52 (describing circumstantial evidence of causation sufficient to survive summary judgment on a \u00a7 1983 claim for retaliation in violation of the First Amendment). Willie does not allege temporal proximity which could lead to an inference of causation in his \u00a7 1983 claim. Additionally, Willie has not provided evidence that Kirkland expressed opposition to his speech or evidence that the reasons for his termination were pretextual. The district court thus properly dismissed Willie\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Appellees is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b480-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
