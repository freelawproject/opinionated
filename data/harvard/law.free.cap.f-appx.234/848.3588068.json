R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">Defendant George Morris, Jr., pled guilty to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and was sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Morris now appeals his sentence, claiming the district court erred in treating his prior Oklahoma state conviction for \u201cDUI Alcohol\u2014Second Offense\u201d as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-19\">On January 27, 2006, officers from the Tulsa Police Department were dispatched to a specific location in response to an allegation of shots being fired. Upon their arrival, the officers observed Morris and another man walking in the area. As one of the officers approached the two men in his patrol unit, Morris reached into his waistband and threw a pistol on the ground. After further investigation, Morris was arrested for intoxication and being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-20\">On March 7, 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Morris on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). On May 5, 2006, Morris pled guilty, without benefit of a plea- agreement, to the charge alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-21\">A presentence investigation report (PSR) was prepared and submitted to the parties on June 30, 2006. The PSR proposed classifying Morris as an armed career criminal pursuant to the ACCA and imposing an offense level of 33 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B). In support thereof, the PSR noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-22\">The defendant stands convicted in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and he has at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>least three prior violent felony convictions, specifically, Tulsa County, Oklahoma, District Court Cases 22629, Robbery with Firearms and CF-2000-6513, DUI Alcohol\u2014Second Offense, and Sebastian County, Arkansas, Circuit Court Case Number 10-723A, Possession of Cocaine With Intent to Distribute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">ROA, Vol. II, PSR at 6-7. Although the PSR ultimately arrived at a guideline range of 135 to 168 months, it correctly noted that the district court was obligated to sentence Morris to the \u201cstatutorily required minimum sentence\u201d of 180 months applicable under the ACCA. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Morris objected to the PSR\u2019s proposed classification of him as an armed career criminal, arguing that his prior DUI conviction did not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">The district court conducted a sentencing hearing on August 7, 2006. During the hearing, the district court rejected Morris\u2019s objection to the PSR, concluding that the underlying conduct that gave rise to Morris\u2019s DUI conviction \u201cinvolve[d] conduct that present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d ROA, Vol. IV at 7-8. Accordingly, the district court concluded that the ACCA was applicable because Morris \u201cha[d] two convictions for a violent felony and one conviction for a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Ultimately, the district court, in accordance with the recommendation of the PSR, imposed the mandatory minimum sentence under the ACCA of 180 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-9\">On appeal, Morris asserts that his prior state conviction for DUI does not constitute a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. In turn, Morris argues that the district court erred in imposing a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months under the ACCA. We review de novo whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>401 F.3d 1220, 1226 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">The ACCA defines the term \u201cviolent felony,\u201d in relevant part, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT-\"><em>any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... </em>that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-11\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b880-12\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, <em>or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA, we use the \u201cformal categorical approach\u201d outlined by the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), \u201clooking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying th[e] conviction[ ]\u201d at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143. <em>But cf. Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (holding that in certain circumstances a court may look to certain judicial records pertaining to the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">The prior conviction at issue in this appeal is Morris\u2019s Oklahoma state conviction for \u201cDUI Alcohol\u2014Second Offense.\u201d That conviction arose under sections 11-902(A) and (C) of Title 47 of the Oklahoma Statutes, which provide, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-6\">A. It is unlawful and punishable as provided in this section for any person to drive, operate, or be in actual physical control of a motor vehicle within this state, whether upon public roads, highways, streets, turnpikes, other public places or upon any private road, street, alley or lane which provides access to one or more single or multi-family dwellings, who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-7\">1. Has a blood or breath alcohol concentration, as defined in Section 756 of this title, of eight-hundredths (0.08) or more at the time of a test of such person\u2019s blood or breath administered within two (2) hours after the arrest of such person; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-8\">2. Is under the influence of alcohol ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-9\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-10\">C. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-11\">2. Any person who, within ten (10) years after a previous conviction of a violation of this section or a violation pursuant to the provisions of any law of another state prohibiting the offense provided in subsection A of this section, is convicted of a second offense pursuant to the provisions of this section or has a prior conviction in a municipal criminal court of record for the violation of a municipal ordinance prohibiting the offense provided for in subsection A of this section and within ten (10) years of such municipal conviction is convicted pursuant to the provision of this section shall be deemed guilty of a felony----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-14\">Okla. Stat. Tit. 47 \u00a7 11-902(A), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-15\">In <em>United States v. Begay, </em>470 F.3d 964 (10th Cir.2006), we held that a felony conviction under New Mexico state law for driving while intoxicated (DWI) constituted a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. In so holding, we concluded that \u201cDWI is encompassed by the natural meaning of the statutory language \u2018any crime ... that ... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 971 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)). Further, we concluded that the \u201c[statutory purpose d[id] not suggest a different definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 972. More specifically, we noted \u201cthat Congress could have adopted the same language that appears in the definition of crime <em>of violence </em>in the very same statutory section,\u201d but chose <em>to </em>instead employ a different definition. <em>Id. </em>(italics in original). In turn, we noted that \u201c[t]he definition of violent felony ... is used to identify persons who should be sentenced to very long terms for their present offense ... because of their criminal history,\u201d and \u201cit seems perfectly reasonable to include within the definition those who have a confirmed history of displaying contempt for human life or safety\u2014those who, in the statutory language, have repeatedly committed felonies \u2018involv[ing] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(italics in original; quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)). Finally, we concluded that \u201c[n]either the legislative history nor [the] canons of construction\u201d pointed to a different interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 973.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-16\">We conclude that <em>Begay </em>is controlling in this case. Although the underlying conviction at issue in this case arose in a different state, and thus under a different criminal statute, than the underlying conviction at issue in <em>Begay, </em>the substance of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>crime is substantially similar, if not identical. In particular, both the Oklahoma statute under which Morris\u2019s \u201cDUI Alcohol\u2014Second Offense\u201d conviction arose, and the New Mexico statute under which the DWI conviction arose in <em>Begay, </em>make it a felony for any person, having already had a specified number of DWI or DUI convictions, to drive while under the influence of alcohol. Thus, consistent with <em>Begay, </em>we are bound to conclude that Morris\u2019s Oklahoma state conviction for \u201cDUI Alcohol\u2014 Second Offense\u201d qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the ACCA. <em>See generally In re Smith, </em>10 F.3d 723, 724 (10th Cir.1993) (\u2018We are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the Supreme Court.\u201d). In turn, we conclude that the district court in this case properly sentenced Morris to a statutory minimum sentence of 180 months under the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
