To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005). We dismiss the petition for review in No. 05-72380 and deny the petition for review in No. 05-76725.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s conclusion that Avalos-Gurrola failed to demonstrate his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his qualifying relatives. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Avalos-Gurrola\u2019s motion to reconsider because he failed to show an error of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s prior decision denying reopening. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DISMISSED (No. 05-72380) and DENIED (No. 05-76725).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
