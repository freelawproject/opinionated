Cooks, Jr. (\u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing their claims with prejudice and ruling that their state statutory claims were subject to the complete preemption doctrine of \u00a7 301 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Labor-Management and Relations Act 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), which provides that federal law must govern claims founded directly on rights created by a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) or substantially dependent on interpretation of a CBA. Appellants now argue that their claims are not subject to \u00a7 301 preemption because they (i) are based on independent rights conferred by statute and not established by a CBA; and (ii) are not substantially dependent on interpretation of the CBA. Appellants also seek attorney\u2019s fees for improper removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">After the expiration of a CBA, a labor dispute arose between a group of employers and their employees, who were members of the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers International Union (the \u201cUnion\u201d). The employers had previously formed a mutual aid pact whereby all signatories would lockout their employees in the event of a strike. After the Union called a strike against one of the signatory-employers, Ralph\u2019s Grocery Company and Albertson\u2019s, Inc. (\u201cAppellees\u201d) pursuant to the mutual pact, initiated a lockout of their employees. Appellees did not give their employees 60 days\u2019 notice of the lockout.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On October 14, 2003, the Union filed a lawsuit against Appellees alleging that they violated the Cal WARN Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by failing to provide their employees with 60 days\u2019 notice of a \u201cmass layoff.\u201d On February 27, 2004, the Union and Appellees simultaneously entered into a new CBA and a Labor Dispute Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d). This agreement required Appellees and the Union to waive, release, and dismiss all claims pertaining to the labor dispute and required arbitration for any disagreements regarding interpretation of the Settlement Agreement. The Union accordingly dismissed its Cal-WARN claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">On October 12, 2004, Appellants, as individuals of a putative class of grocery store employees subjected to the alleged mass layoff by Appellees, filed their own Cal-WARN claims against Appellees in state court. Appellees removed these claims to federal court based on \u00a7 301 preemption. The district court denied Appellants\u2019 motion to remand and granted Appellees\u2019 motion for dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure without opinion. Appellants timely appealed the ruling of preemption and dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">As removal is a question of federal subject matter jurisdiction, we review a district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>Providence Health Plan v. McDowell, </em>361 F.3d 1243, 1247 (9th Cir.2004). An order granting a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) is also reviewed de novo. <em>Cleghorn v. Blue Shield of Cal., </em>408 F.3d 1222, 1225 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">On its face, \u00a7 301 is a jurisdictional statute under which \u201c[sjuits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). Settlement agreements between employers and labor unions are included within this definition. <em>See Retail Clerks Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n v. Lion Dry Goods, Inc., </em>369 U.S. 17, 28, 82 S.Ct. 541, 7 L.Ed.2d 503 (1962); <em>Gen. Teamsters, Auto Truck Drivers &amp; Helpers Local 162 v. Mitchell Bros. Truck Lines, </em>682 F.2d 763, 765-766 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Cir.1982). Section 301 authorizes federal courts to develop a common law for the interpretation of CBAs. <em>Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. 448, 451, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957). This federal common law preempts state contract law for purposes of CBA interpretation and enforcement. <em>Local 174, Teamsters of Am. v. Lucas Flour, </em>369 U.S. 95, 103-04, 82 S.Ct. 571, 7 L.Ed.2d 593 (1962). Finally, \u00a7 301 preemption converts an ordinary state law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 65, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The first test for \u00a7 301 preemption is whether there are \u201cclaims founded directly on rights created by [a CBA].\u201d <em>Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 394, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987). Where a claim can be litigated under state law alone, it is independent of any CBA and not preempted by \u00a7 301. <em>Lingle v. Norge Div of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 399, 409-410, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410 (1988). Thus, as \u201cmaster of the claim,\u201d a plaintiff may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law. <em>Young v. Anthony\u2019s Fish Grottos, Inc., </em>830 F.2d 993, 996 (9th Cir.1987). The national policy of referring labor disputes to arbitration is not offended where the claims arise from rights independent of a CBA. <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 399 n. 15, 107 S.Ct. 2425.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u201c[T]o remove a state law claim to federal court under the complete preemption doctrine, federal law must both completely preempt the state law claim and supplant it with a federal claim.\u201d <em>Young, </em>830 F.2d at 997. Therefore, if the plaintiffs could not have asserted a federal claim based on the allegations in the state law complaint, there is no removal jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Cramer v. Consolidated Freightways, Inc., </em>we held that where \u201cplaintiffs [base] their claims on the protections afforded them by California state law, without any reference to expectations or duties created by the CBA ... their claims are neither founded directly upon rights conferred in the CBA nor \u2018substantially dependent upon\u2019 interpretation of the CBA terms.\u201d 255 F.3d 683, 694 (9th Cir.2001). California\u2019s statutory rights \u201cguaranteed to all persons, whether or not they may happen to work subject to a CBA ... are independent of [a] CBA and not subject to \u00a7 301 preemption.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Like the plaintiffs in <em>Cramer, </em>Appellants base their claims on rights conferred by a California statute, not a CBA. The Cal-WARN Act grants the right to 60 days\u2019 notice of a mass layoff regardless of whether an employee works subject to a CBA. Because the Settlement Agreement or any CBA in the present case did not provide a right to 60 days\u2019 notice of a mass layoff, there is no federal claim under \u00a7 301 that would supplant Appellants\u2019 state law claim. As such, Appellants\u2019 rights under the Cal-WARN Act are independent of any rights conferred by the Settlement Agreement or any CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">The second test for \u00a7 301 preemption is whether resolution of the claim is \u201csubstantially dependent\u201d upon interpreting a CBA. <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 220, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985). Appellees contend that resolution of Appellants\u2019 claims are substantially dependent on interpreting the Settlement Agreement to determine if the release provisions apply to Appellants\u2019 individual claims. However, the Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>specifically rejected this argument in <em>Caterpillar, Inc. v. Williams. </em>In <em>Caterpillar, </em>an employer unsuccessfully argued that \u00a7 301 preempts state law claims where the employer raises a defense that requires a court to interpret a CBA. 482 U.S. at 398-99, 107 S.Ct. 2425. The employer asserted that the employees had waived any preexisting rights in a subsequent CBA. <em>Id. </em>at 398, 107 S.Ct. 2425. In a unanimous opinion, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">It is true that when a defense to a state claim is based on the terms of a[CBA], the state court will have to interpret that agreement to decide whether the state claim survives. But the presence of ... a \u00a7 301 question, in a defensive argument does not overcome the paramount policies embodied in the well-pleaded complaint rule-that the plaintiff is the master of the complaint, that a federal question must appear on the face of the complaint, and that the plaintiff may, by eschewing claims based on federal law, choose to have the cause heard in state court ... a <em>defendant </em>cannot, merely by injecting a federal question into an action that asserts what is plainly a state-law claim, transform the action into one arising under federal law, thereby selecting the forum in which the claim shall be litigated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 398-99, 107 S.Ct. 2425; <em>see also Cramer, </em>255 F.3d at 691 (holding that \u201c[i]f the claim is plainly based on state law, \u00a7 301 preemption is not mandated simply because the defendant refers to the CBA in mounting a defense\u201d (citing <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 398-99, 107 S.Ct. 2425)). The Settlement Agreement in this case is only relevant to Appellees\u2019 asserted defenses of waiver, release, and duty to arbitrate. Because Appellees are looking to the Settlement Agreement\u2019s arbitration and release provisions in \u201cmounting their defenses,\u201d there is no preemption and removal was improper under <em>Caterpillar </em>and <em>Cramer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Section 301 preemption is an exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule only where the face of the complaint shows a \u00a7 301 issue requiring interpretation of a CBA. In this case, a \u00a7 301 issue arises only because of Appellees\u2019 defense, and not from the face of the complaint. As such, the exception does not apply and the district court lacked removal jurisdiction. Therefore, we REVERSE and REMAND to the district court with instructions to remand the case to state court and to determine if an award of attorney\u2019s fees for improper removal is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b476-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-11\">. Cal. Labor Code \u00a7 \u00a7 1401 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\">.
