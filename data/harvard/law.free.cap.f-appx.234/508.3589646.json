R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">An administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) from the Office of Administrative Hearings for the State of Oregon determined that Bend-LaPine School District (the \u201cDistrict\u201d) failed to offer K.H. a \u201cfree and appropriate public education\u201d (\u201cFAPE\u201d) as required under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1482. This determination was based on the ALJ\u2019s finding that the individual education plan (\u201cIEP\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d), prepared for K.H. by the District was inadequate. The ALJ also found that KH.\u2019s mother complied with the IDEA\u2019S notice provision, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(10)(C)(iii), before placing K.H. in a private residential school. Based on these findings, the ALJ awarded K.H.\u2019s mother reimbursement for private educational expenses incurred as a result of that placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2), the District appealed the ALJ\u2019s award to the district court. The District contended K.H.\u2019s IEP was adequate, K.H. was provided with a FAPE as required by the IDEA, and that, even if K.H. was not provided a FAPE, reimbursement should be reduced or denied because KH.\u2019s mother did not comply with the IDEA\u2019S notice provision before placing K.H. in private school.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The district court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision, finding that K.H.\u2019s IEP was inadequate and that K.H. was not offered a FAPE. The district court held that the IDEA\u2019S notice provision did not require the reduction or denial of reimbursement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact in an IDEA case for clear error and conduct a modified <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>See Amanda J. v. Clark County Sch. Dist., </em>267 F.3d 877, 887-88 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">We have reviewed the record. We conclude that the district court\u2019s findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and that the district court did not err in applying the IDEA\u2019S notice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
