This court ordinarily declines to entertain original ha-beas corpus petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), and this case provides no reason to depart from the general rule. Moreover, we note' that Gadd has filed an identical motion in the district court seeking relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). Because the interests of justice would not be served by transferring a duplicative case to the district court, we deny Gadd\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis and dismiss the petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (2000). We also deny his pending motions for production of documents and his motion for ruling on his petition without delay. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>PETITION DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
