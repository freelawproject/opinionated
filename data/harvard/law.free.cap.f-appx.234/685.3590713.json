Susan Serrano (\u201cAppellant\u201d) was convicted by a jury for committing health care fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347 and sentenced to 78 months imprisonment. On appeal, she asserts that errors at trial and sentencing require the reversal of her conviction and sentence. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">First, Appellant asserts that the district court erred in making certain statements during trial. Because Appellant did not object to these statements at trial or make a motion for a mistrial, we review Appellant\u2019s allegations of judicial misconduct for plain error. <em>See United States v. Morgan, </em>376 F.3d 1002, 1006-07 (9th Cir.2004). To demonstrate error, Appellant must establish that \u201cthe record shows actual bias or leaves an abiding impression that the jury perceived an appearance of advocacy or partiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Laurins, </em>857 F.2d 529, 537 (9th Cir.1988). We hold that none of the comments referenced by Appellant\u2014stating that Appellant\u2019s counsel was from Los Angeles, telling a witness to show an exhibit to the entire court, allegedly frustrating counsel\u2019s questions as to a witness\u2019s use of the terms \u201cprovided\u201d and \u201crendered,\u201d telling counsel \u201cyou know better than that\u201d in response to repeated questions about missing pages in an exhibit, allegedly disrupting counsel\u2019s questioning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>regarding Appellant\u2019s 1987 exam results, telling counsel \u201cyou must not have been listening\u201d after counsel continued to question a witness about claim detail reports (CDRs), and overruling counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecution shouting at Appellant during her testimony\u2014constituted more than routine trial administration and were not sufficiently prejudicial to be plainly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Second, Appellant argues that the district court erred in admitting certain documents offered by the government into evidence. We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Sua, </em>307 F.3d 1150, 1152 (9th Cir.2002). Here, the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Appellant\u2019s Medicare application to be submitted without the associated instructional pages because the government explained why Appellant\u2019s completed application\u2014submitted online\u2014would have lacked the instructional pages and, regardless, cured any defect by also introducing a complete version of the application into evidence. Likewise, the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the CDRs into evidence because they satisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6) to be admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(6); <em>United States v. Scholl, </em>166 F.3d 964, 978 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Third, Appellant asserts that the district court erred in its response to the jury\u2019s request for clarification as to a jury instruction. However, because Appellant\u2019s counsel engaged in the discussion of potential responses to the jury\u2019s request for clarification and the ultimate instruction to the jury reflects the exact phrase suggested by counsel, any error was invited error and the issue is waived. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>116 F.3d 840, 844-45 (9th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Fourth, Appellant asserts that the district court erred in applying U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2B1.1 to increase Appellant\u2019s offense level based on loss caused. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and estimates of loss for clear error. <em>See United States v. Barnes, </em>125 F.3d 1287, 1290 (9th Cir.1997). The commentary to \u00a7 2B1.1 indicates that \u201closs\u201d for purposes of the enhancement is \u201cthe greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A). \u201cActual loss\u201d is defined as \u201cthe reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense,\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A)(i), while \u201cintended loss\u201d is \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense,\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A)(ii). It is irrelevant to the intended loss calculation whether or not the intended harm \u201cwould have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1, cmt. n. 3(A)(ii) (citing \u201can insurance fraud in which the claim exceeded the insured value\u201d as an example); <em>see United States v. McCormac, </em>309 F.3d 623, 628 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Blitz, </em>151 F.3d 1002, 1010-11 (9th Cir.1998). We hold that the district court properly interpreted \u00a7 2B1.1 and that the court did not clearly err when it approximated the intended loss as the amounts Appellant submitted to Medicare and Medi-Cal for reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">Fifth, Appellant contends that the district court erred in applying U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction based on Appellant\u2019s trial testimony to enhance Appellant\u2019s sentence. Appellant argues that, as a licensed audiologist, she is exempt from the Hearing Aid Bureau Code\u2019s requirement of having a hearing aid license to dispense hearing aids. <em>See </em>Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof.Code 3351.3. However, even if correct, Appellant\u2019s argument does not contradict the district court\u2019s basis for applying the obstruction enhancement, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>namely that Appellant\u2019s application for a license to dispense hearing aids demonstrated that her testimony that she did not know her license had expired in 2002 was untruthful. Moreover, Appellant\u2019s challenge to the obstruction enhancement ignores the other reasons for applying the enhancement, specifically that during the December 1, 2005, detention hearing, Appellant \u201clied and presented information to the Pretrial Services officer contradicting prior financial information placed on record to the Court,\u201d and that Appellant falsely testified that she visited convalescent homes with a doctor in 2003 and that the doctor maintained a space at her business through 2003. Because Appellant does not challenge the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines or the district court\u2019s factual findings, and her argument is unrelated to those findings, we hold that the district court did not err in applying the obstruction enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b716-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
