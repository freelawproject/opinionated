In California state court, a jury convicted Anderson of four counts of aggravated sexual assault and three counts of lewd touching of a minor. Following unsuccessful appeals in state court, Anderson filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court denied the petition. On appeal, Anderson contends the state court\u2019s admission of propensity evidence during trial violated Anderson\u2019s due process rights. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm. Because the facts are known to the parties, we revisit them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-21\">We may grant Anderson habeas relief only if the last reasoned state court decision was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). It was neither. First, there is no clearly established federal law prohibiting admission of propensity evidence in all situations; indeed, the Supreme Court has expressly left open the question \u201cwhether a state law would violate the Due Process Clause if it permitted the use of \u2018prior crimes\u2019 evidence to show propensity to</p>\n<p id=\"A56\">commit a charged crime.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 75 n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991); <em>Alberni v. McDaniel, </em>458 F.3d 860, 863-64 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding <em>pre-Estelle </em>circuit cases discussing this issue to be no longer relevant). Second, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that it was \u201cclearly established\u201d that admission of propensity evidence could render a trial fundamentally unfair, the state court did not unreasonably apply the rule established in <em>Payne v. Tennessee, </em>501 U.S. 808, 825, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991), when it allowed for admission of the specific propensity evidence offered in this case; the disputed evidence\u2014which involved conduct far less unseemly than the charged conduct\u2014was not \u201cso prejudicial that it rendered] the trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Estelle, </em>502 U.S. at 75, 112 S.Ct. 475 (prohibiting admission of evi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>denee if it \u201cso infuse[s] the trial with unfairness so as to deny due process of law\u201d). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Anderson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b770-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
