Cosio, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s removal order. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>See Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006). We review de novo, <em>Molinar-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-21\">Cosio\u2019s 1988 conviction for possession for sale of a controlled substance constitutes an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (defining illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as an aggravated felony); <em>see also Aragon-Ayon v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 847, 851 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that Congress \u201cclearly manifested an intent for the amended definition of aggravated felo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>ny to apply retroactively\u201d to all defined offenses whenever committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Cos\u00edo was not eligible for a discretionary waiver at the time he pled and, thus, there is no impermissible retroactive effect. <em>Cf. Lopez-Castellanos v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 848, 853 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201c[t]o deprive Lopez-Castellanos of eligibility for discretionary relief would produce an impermissibly retroactive effect for aliens, who, like Lopez-Castellanos, were eligible for a discretionary waiver at the time of the plea.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The BIA therefore correctly concluded that Cos\u00edo was ineligible for both special-rule cancellation of removal under section 203 of the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (\u201cNA-CARA\u201d) and cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b). <em>See Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1154 n. 7 (9th Cir.1999) (stating that relief under NACARA is available only to those who have not been convicted of an aggravated felony); <em>see also 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(C) (barring cancellation of removal to individuals who have been convicted of offenses under INA \u00a7 237(a)(2), which includes aggravated felonies).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">PETITION <em>FOR </em>REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b690-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
