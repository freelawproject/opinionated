California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he asserts there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but presenting for our review the reasonableness of Carter\u2019s sentence. Although notified of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, Carter has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005). A court must initially calculate the appropriate Guidelines range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then considers the resulting advisory Guidelines range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007), and determines an appropriate sentence. <em>Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370. We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable. Hughes, 401 F.3d at 546-47. A sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). With these standards in mind, we have reviewed the record and conclude that Carter\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have thoroughly reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Carter\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
