We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Iturribarria v. </em>INS, 321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Calderon\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than nine years after she was ordered deported in absentia, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252b(c)(3) (1995) (motion to reopen must be filed within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances), and Calderon did not show that she was entitled to equitable tolling, <em>see Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (deadline for filing motion to reopen can be equitably tolled \u201cwhen petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-17\">Calderon\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b530-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
