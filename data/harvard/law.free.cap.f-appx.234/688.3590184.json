Following a jury trial, Defendant was convicted on both counts of the indictment: (a) importing marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 and \u00a7 960 and (b) possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Defendant was sentenced to 27 months\u2019 incarceration to be followed by three years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Defendant contends evidence of the structure and <em>modus operandi </em>of drug transactions were improperly admitted. He complains of references to courier and load vehicles, as well as testimony regarding car keys and an air freshener. He also argues that a Government attorney engaged in improper \u201cvouching\u201d and that the district judge erred in the imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The purported structure evidence in this case is distinguishable from the evidence at issue in <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>237 F.3d 1008, 1016-17, <em>as amended, </em>246 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Pineda-Torres, </em>287 F.3d 860, 863-66 (9th Cir.2002). Here, no separate witness testified as an expert describing how narcotics organizations generally function. Testimony of a DEA agent and questions to Defendant that involved the terms \u201ccourier,\u201d \u201ctrafficker,\u201d \u201cload,\u201d and variations of these terms, but no explanation of the terms, did not constitute evidence of the structure of narcotics organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">A customs officer testified that most \u201cload vehicles\u201d only contain one or two keys because most \u201cdrivers\u201d of the vehicles are not the owners and therefore do not have house keys or other keys on the key ring. As to the significance of the air freshener, she testified that most \u201cloaded vehicles\u201d had air freshener to mask the odors of the drugs. Although Defendant attempts to characterize this evidence as structure evidence, it is not. This is not the type of <em>modus operandi </em>evidence that explains how a narcotics structure operates and therefore implies that the Defendant is part of a large organization. <em>See United States v. Murillo, </em>255 F.3d 1169, 1177 (9th Cir.2001), <em>overruled on other grounds, United States v. Mendez, </em>476 F.3d 1077 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2277, 167 L.Ed.2d 1112 (2007). Defendant, however, is correct in characterizing the customs officer\u2019s testimony as expert testimony that the keys and air freshener matched a drug courier profile. Accordingly, the district court correctly found that the evidence should not have been admitted. Because there was no dispute at trial that Defendant was driving a vehicle containing marijuana and other evidence demonstrated Defendant\u2019s knowledge of the marijuana in the vehicle, the court also correctly concluded that the admission of the evidence was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-12\">The Government attempted a redirect examination with respect to an investigation report inconsistency, but two objections of vouching were sustained. The court subsequently denied a mistrial, finding no harm to Defendant in light of the curative instruction given and the fact that the Government was chastised in front of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-13\">\u201cVouching consists of placing the prestige of the government behind a witness through personal assurances of the witness\u2019s veracity, or suggesting that informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>tion not presented to the jury supports the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Weatherspoon, </em>410 F.3d 1142, 1146 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Necoechea, </em>986 F.2d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir.1993)). The questions and responses here did not constitute vouching. The questions did not ask whether the witness was being truthful with the prosecutor himself, nor did the questions reference out-of-court statements that the witness may have made to the prosecutor during an interview or preparation for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Defendant also contends that, even if the errors are not individually a basis for reversal, the cumulative effect of the errors supports reversal. Even if the court\u2019s trial rulings were erroneous, none of them was particularly prejudicial, either separately or when considered together. Defendant does not present sufficient grounds to vacate his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2005), the district court enhanced Defendant\u2019s offense level by two for obstruction of justice. Factual determinations under the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed for clear error and the district court\u2019s characterization of conduct as obstruction of justice is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Cordova Barajas, </em>360 F.3d 1037, 1043 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Shetty, 130 F.3d </em>1324, 1333 (9th Cir.1997)). The district court applied the enhancement based on Defendant\u2019s testimony at trial contradicting his confession. Defendant contends a remand is necessary because the district court did not expressly find that this testimony was material. There is no contention that there was insufficient evidence to support such a finding, only that the court did not expressly state such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The district court found that Defendant\u2019s testimony that he did not have knowledge of the marijuana was a false statement and that it went to a \u201ccritical element\u201d of the offense. The court also noted that Defendant\u2019s knowledge was the only element in dispute. That is a sufficient finding of materiality. <em>See Cordova Barajas, </em>360 F.3d at 1043-44; <em>United States v. Jimenez, 300 </em>F.3d 1166, 1170-71 (9th Cir.2002). Since the court made a finding as to materiality, the enhancement was properly applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Defendant requested a two-level reduction under the Guidelines \u201csafety valve\u201d provision. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(7) (2005). For drug offenses, this provision provides for a two-level reduction if a defendant satisfies the five criteria set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a) (2005). The district court found that four of the criteria were satisfied, but that Defendant did not satisfy \u00a7 501.2(a)(5) which requires that a defendant truthfully provide the Government, by the time of sentencing, with all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">The court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error and its interpretation and application of the Guideline provision is reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Feingold, </em>454 F.3d 1001, 1014 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 695, 166 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006); <em>United States v. Real-Hernandez, </em>90 F.3d 356, 360 (9th Cir.1996). The court found that Defendant did not disclose all the information he knew about the offense. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Pimental, 477 </em>F.3d 1100, 1103-4 (9th Cir.2007). Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that the district court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s denial of safety valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-13\">Last, Defendant complains that, in imposing his sentence, the district court failed to adequately consider the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>contends that the court instead essentially treated the Sentencing Guidelines as presumptively correct. The Government contends the court treated the Guidelines as advisory and gave adequate consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Because the district court\u2019s sentencing determination may be affected by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Rita, </em>177 Fed.Appx. 357 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. granted in part, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006), we sever this issue and defer consideration of Defendant\u2019s sentencing challenge pending that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED. ISSUANCE of MANDATE STAYED pending resolution of Defendant\u2019s sentencing challenges in a separate disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b720-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
