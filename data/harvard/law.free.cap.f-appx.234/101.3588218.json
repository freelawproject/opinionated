Gama-Saldivar\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred by imposing a sentence within the guidelines. The Government did not file a reply brief, and although advised of his right to do so, Gama-Saldivar did not file a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-26\">Counsel suggests that the district court erred by imposing a sentence within the recommended guidelines range. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. However, in imposing a sentence post-<em>Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006). \u201cThe district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u2018in checklist fashion;\u2019 \u2018it is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moreland, </em>437 F.3d at 432 <em>(quoting United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Here, the district court sentenced Gama-Saldivar <em>post-Booker </em>and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The court sentenced Gama-Saldivar after considering and examining the sentencing guidelines and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as instructed by <em>Booker. </em>Gama-Saldivar\u2019s 136-month sentence is well within the appropriate guidelines range and below the statutory maximum sentence of life in prison. Gama-Saldivar asked for a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range because he would be deported; the district court noted that it saw no reason to depart from the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Finally, neither Gama-Saldivar nor the record suggests any information so compelling to rebut the presumption that a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Gama-Saldivar\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Gama-Saldivar, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Gama-Saldivar requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Gama-Saldivar.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
