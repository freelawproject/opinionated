To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s factual determination of continuous physical presence for substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir. 2004). We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s denial of Mr. Contreras-Avina\u2019s application for cancellation of removal in the exercise of discretion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i),\u2022 <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 889-90 (9th Cir.2003). The petitioners\u2019 contention that the agency deprived them of due process by misapplying the law to the facts of their case does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]raditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Ms. Contreras failed to establish her continuous physical presence in the United States during the ten years prior to September 6, 2000, because Ms. Contreras was unable to adequately explain the discrepancies in her testimony and the inconsistency between her testimony and her application regarding her date of entry into the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(A), (d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The petitioners contend that the IJ violated due process by abandoning his role as a neutral fact finder. Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 contention, they were not \u201cprevented from reasonably presenting [their] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar, </em>210 F.3d at 971 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Finally, we do not address the petitioners\u2019 contentions regarding the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion to remand to present new evidence of hardship because the agency\u2019s discretionary denial of cancellation with respect to Mr. Contreras-Avina, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), and denial for failure to demonstrate physical presence with respect to Ms. Contreras, are dispositive of the petitioners\u2019 applications, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
