Denby contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his state court trial on charges of (1) possession of cocaine with intent to sell by a person who is not drug-dependent, Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 21a-278(b), and (2) possession of cocaine with the intent to sell within 1000 feet of a school, Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 21a-278a(b). Denby was convicted by a jury on both counts and was sentenced to nineteen years in prison. Denby argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to investigate whether he was drug dependent, a finding of which would have reduced his maximum penalty from twenty-three years on the two charges to fifteen years on the first count alone. Denby also contends that he was denied effective assistance of habeas counsel, but there is no federal constitutional right to habeas counsel let alone effective habeas counsel in state collateral proceedings. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 756-57, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). We assume that counsel and the parties are familiar with the facts, the procedural history of this case, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">To prove ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d 466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To grant petitioner\u2019s habeas petition, however, we must find not only that Denby\u2019s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance under <em>Strickland, </em>but also that the state court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s writ of habeas corpus \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). As this standard applies to the <em>Strickland </em>claim here, the state court\u2019s decision must have been not merely \u201cincorrect or erroneous\u201d but \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520-21, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (citing <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">The Appellate Court of Connecticut denied the ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on the ground that Denby failed to satisfy the prejudice prong of <em>Strickland. Denby v. Comm. of Correction, </em>66 Conn.App. 809, 815, 786 A.2d 442, 447 (Conn.App.2001). The Appellate Court relied on the trial court\u2019s determination that the defense of drug dependency, if investigated adequately prior to trial and pressed sufficiently during trial, would have undermined Denby\u2019s primary defense that he was actually innocent of the charges. <em>Id. </em>at 446-47; <em>see id. </em>at 447 (\u201c[T]he more he and his counsel chose to emphasize how much his desire for drugs controlled his actions, the less likely the jury was to believe that the petitioner would not have engaged in the crime of possession with intent to sell.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">Although Denby\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and pursue this defense was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>deficient, we cannot say that the Connecticut courts\u2019 conclusion that Denby was not prejudiced by his deficient counsel was \u201cobjectively unreasonable.\u201d Denby\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus therefore must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
