Amir-Sharif filed motions for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>injunction requesting that the district court order the defendants to cease tampering with his mail, permit him to receive publications in the mail, and permit him to access the law library. The district court denied the motions and denied his request to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in this interlocutory appeal. Amir-Sharif now moves this court for authorization to proceed IFP on appeal. He also requests appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Amir-Sharif s challenge to the denial of his requests for a TRO. <em>See Faulder v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 741, 742 (5th Cir.1999). Consequently, Amir-Sharifs appeal is DISMISSED FOR WANT OF JURISDICTION to the extent that he appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his requests for a TRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Amir-Sharif s requests for a preliminary injunction have been mooted by his release from prison. <em>See Herman v. Holiday, </em>238 F.3d 660, 665 (5th Cir.2001). This appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT to the extent that Amir-Sharif appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his requests for a preliminary injunction. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
