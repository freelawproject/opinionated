He argues that the district court erred in assessing a sixteen-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), based on the determination that he had a prior conviction for a crime of violence. Specifically, he contends that his Indiana felony battery conviction was not a crime of violence because it was neither an enumerated offense nor had as an element the use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-17\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 338 (5th Cir.2004). Tejada\u2019s state-court indictment demonstrated that he was convicted of felony battery with a deadly weapon, in violation of Indiana Code \u00a7 35M2-2-l(a)(3). As Tejada argues, the Indiana statute does not specifically require the use of force and can be committed by an offensive touching. Nevertheless, as the Government argues, \u201cthe touching of an individual with a deadly weapon creates a sufficient threat of force to qualify as a crime of violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 348 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see also United States v. Treto-Martinez, </em>421 F.3d 1156, 1157-60 (10th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 1089, 163 L.Ed.2d 904 (2006). Accordingly, Tejada\u2019s conviction was one for a crime of violence under the residual definition, and the sixteen-level enhancement was appropriate. <em>See id.; </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-20\">Additionally, Tejada challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. He raised the same claim, unsuccessfully, in the initial appeal in this case. As Tejada concedes, the previous determinations of this court stand as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the law of the case, and the issue will not be revisited. <em>See United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 752-53 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b242-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
