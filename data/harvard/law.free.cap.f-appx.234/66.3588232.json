California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in adopting the facts set forth in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and in sentencing Jean based on facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jean has filed a supplemental <em>pro </em>se brief essentially raising the same claim and specifically challenging the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs attributable to him and the three-level enhancement of his sentence under U.S. <em>Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.1(b) (2002), for his role in the offense as a supervisor or manager based on judicially determined facts found by a preponderance of the evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>not found by the jury, claiming that these findings violate his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Contrary to Jean\u2019s assertion regarding the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of drugs attributable to him and its enhancement of his sentence, <em>Booker </em>did \u201cnot in the end move any decision from judge to jury, or change the burden of persuasion.\u201d <em>United States v. Morris, </em>429 F.3d 65, 72 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 121, 166 L.Ed.2d 91 (2006). In sentencing defendants after <em>Booker, </em>district courts continue to make findings necessary for enhancement, applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, while taking into account that the resulting Guidelines range is advisory only. <em>Id. </em>The sentencing court is authorized to make factual findings in order to determine appropriately the defendant\u2019s advisory range under the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">The issue of whether the district court correctly calculated the quantity of drugs attributable to Jean for sentencing purposes is easily disposed of pursuant to the standard principles of derivative liability. A conspirator may be held accountable for all quantities of drugs attributable to the conspiracy so long as it was reasonably foreseeable that the drugs were possessed within the scope of the conspiratorial agreement. <em>See United States v. Gilliam, </em>987 F.2d 1009, 1013 (4th Cir.1993). The PSR recommended a drug quantity of 3.746 kilograms of cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d) and 53.493 kilograms of cocaine attributable to Jean, far in excess of the 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base required for a base offense level of thirty-eight under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l). The PSR specified a quantity of 1984.5 grams of crack based on evidence from Jaimie Green, one of the members of the drug conspiracy that included Jean, and this amount alone is sufficient to support a base offense level of thirty-eight. Specifically, the PSR reflects that Green reported to Task Force Agents that he witnessed Lewis Chisolm obtain five or six ounces of crack from Jean on six or seven occasions (at least 850.5 grams), that he personally obtained ten ounces of crack from Jean directly (283.5 grams), and that he had observed Jean in possession of thirty or more ounces of crack at one time (850.5 grams).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial evidence of the necessary drug quantity sufficient to support a base offense level of thirty-eight came from a myriad of witnesses, was overwhelming, essentially un-controverted, exceeded even the estimates used in the PSR to determine Jean\u2019s base level, and put Jean far in excess of the 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base necessary to trigger the application of a base offense level of thirty-eight. Thus, we find no basis to conclude that the district court plainly erred in sentencing Jean on a base offense level of thirty-eight, as reflected in the PSR.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">With regard to Jean\u2019s challenge to the three-level enhancement recommended by the PSR and adopted by the district court for a leadership role in a conspiracy pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), Jean has not offered any evidence to the contrary or specifically explained why the PSR was inaccurate or unreliable. His mere challenge, particularly on appeal for the first time, is, without more, insufficient to put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>the PSR\u2019s findings into dispute. <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990); <em>cf. Gilliam, </em>987 F.2d at 1013 (\u201c[T]he Government carries its burden if a defendant fails to properly object to a recommended finding in a presentence report that the court determines to be reliable.\u201d). Because Jean failed to make the required affirmative showing that the PSR was inaccurate or unreliable, the district court was \u201cfree to adopt the findings of the [PSR] without more specific inquiry or explanation.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>916 F.2d at 162 (internal quotation marks omitted). We affirm the imposition of a three-level leadership role enhancement to Jean\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, making any appropriate factual findings. <em>United States v. Davenport, </em>445 F.3d 366, 370 (4th Cir.2006). The court then should consider the resulting advisory guideline range in conjunction with the factors under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), and determine an appropriate sentence that is \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary,\u201d to achieve the goals of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Davenport, </em>445 F.3d at 370. We will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). We have repeatedly held that \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 3044, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2007); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Neither Jean nor the record suggest any information so compelling as to rebut the presumption that his sentence within a properly calculated guideline is reasonable. We find no error in the calculation of the advisory guideline range,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and Jean failed to provide evidence to overcome the presumption of reasonableness we accord such a sentence. The district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly sentenced Jean within that range.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Jean\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-10\">. We previously affirmed Jean\u2019s conviction, but vacated his sentence and remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-16\">. The district court originally sentenced Jean under the then-mandatory federal sentencing guidelines to the same sentence later imposed on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">. Jean failed to object below to the facts contained in the PSR, thus rendering this court\u2019s review of his sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b98-13\">. At trial, Green actually testified to amounts of crack attributable to Jean that exceeded even these amounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">. At resentencing, the district court specifically referred to <em>Booker, </em>to the advisory nature of the guidelines, and to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, stating that it specifically considered those factors. It adopted the findings in the presen-tence report, and in addition to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court considered the guidelines range and other relevant guideline factors. The court was familiar with Jean's history and background, having presided over his trial. Also, the court had sentenced Jean originally and was familiar with the details of his case from the initial sentencing hearing. Jean\u2019s presentence report outlined his offense conduct and his criminal history. Finally, both Jean and his attorney took the opportunity to argue about the length of his sentence and application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors during resentencing prior to the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
