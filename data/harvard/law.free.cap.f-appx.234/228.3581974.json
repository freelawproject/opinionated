He contends that the district court denied the Government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure based on substantial assistance because of his criminal history, which convinced the district court that an upward departure would have been appropriate but for his assistance to the Government. Robertson argues that the district court improperly considered his arrest record in denying the Government\u2019s \u00a7 5K1.1 motion to downwardly depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-22\">\u201cThis court will affirm a refusal to depart from the Guidelines unless the refusal was in violation of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Miro, </em>29 F.3d 194, 199 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cA refusal to depart violates law only if the court refuses to depart under the mistaken assumption that it does not have the authority to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Akin, </em>62 F.3d 700, 701 (5th Cir.1995). This court lacks jurisdiction to review a refusal to depart downwardly except \u201cwhere the defendant points to something in the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>indicating that the district court held an erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment because Robertson has failed to point to anything in the record to indicate that the district court was under the erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to downwardly depart based on his substantial assistance. <em>See Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d at 424; <em>Akin, </em>62 F.3d at 701. Moreover, our review of the sentencing transcript convinces us that the district court relied on permissible factors, rather than on Robertson\u2019s arrest record, in reaching its determination that an upward departure would have been justified. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3; <em>United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b258-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
