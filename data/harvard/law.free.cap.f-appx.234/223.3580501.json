He challenges the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of cer-tiorari in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). After the parties filed their briefs in the instant case, the Supreme Court issued its decision, holding that a court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a properly calculated guideline sentence. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2007). <em>Accord United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006) (applying presumption of reasonableness to properly calculated guideline sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Lazaro\u2019s sentence is within a properly calculated advisory guideline range and entitled to great deference. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005). Giving such deference to Lazaro\u2019s sentence, we conclude that Lazaro has failed to rebut the presumption that his sentence is reasonable. <em>Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
