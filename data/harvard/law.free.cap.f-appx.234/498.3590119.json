R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b529-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Manuel Chico-Cabello, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">The evidence Chico-Cabello presented with his motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 601 (holding that if \u201cthe BIA determines that a motion to reopen proceedings in which there has already been an unreviewable discretionary determination concerning a statutory prerequisite to relief does not make out a prima facie case for that relief,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from revisiting the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-17\">Chico-Cabello\u2019s contention that the BIA violated his due process rights by basing its decision on a stale record does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]raditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-18\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision because this petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>315 F.3d 1186, 1188 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b529-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
