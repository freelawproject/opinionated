Wallace received a sentence of 262 months\u2019 imprisonment and Manns received a sentence of 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. We affirm both convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">Counsel for Wallace and Manns filed briefs in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal. Wallace\u2019s counsel requested this court\u2019s review of the validity of an appellate waiver provision in Wallace\u2019s plea agreement and whether Wallace had received ineffective assistance of counsel. Wallace also filed a pro se supplemental brief. Manns\u2019 counsel requested this court\u2019s consideration of whether the district court erred in failing to grant a hearing regarding the Government\u2019s refusal to file a motion for downward departure pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (2004). Although informed of his right to file a supplemental brief, Manns did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-16\">With respect to Wallace\u2019s appeal, No. 05-5426, this court reviews the validity of a waiver of appellate rights de novo. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000). If the waiver is valid and the issue appealed is covered by the waiver, and, as here, the Government relies upon the waiver, the court will uphold it. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168-69 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 731-33 (4th Cir.1994). A waiver is valid if the defendant\u2019s agreement to the waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir.1991). Generally, if a district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of appellate rights during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>waiver is valid. <em>Wessells, </em>936 F.2d at 167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Here, the district court conducted a thorough Rule 11 colloquy. The court also specifically discussed the appeal waiver provision, and Wallace indicated he understood it. Wallace agreed to waive appellate review of his sentence \u201cand any issues that relate to the establishment of the advisory guidelines range.\u201d The issue Wallace raised in his supplemental brief relates to the establishment of his sentence, and is accordingly precluded by the appellate waiver. The issues raised by Wallace\u2019s counsel, however, fall outside the scope of this waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Because the district court conducted a proper Rule 11 colloquy, Wallace\u2019s challenges to the appellate waiver and the district court\u2019s acceptance of his guilty plea fail on the merits. With respect to his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Wallace must show conclusively from the face of the record that counsel provided ineffective representation. <em>See United States v. James, </em>337 F.3d 387, 391 (4th Cir.2003). Here, the record does not conclusively demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Wallace\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Wallace in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Wallace requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Wallace.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">With respect to Manns\u2019 appeal, No. 06-4047, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Manns a hearing on the Government\u2019s determination it would not file a motion for a downward departure. In accordance with <em>An-ders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Manns\u2019 sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Manns in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Manns requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Manns.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">No. <em>05-5246\u2014AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">No. <em>06^047\u2014AFFIRMED.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
