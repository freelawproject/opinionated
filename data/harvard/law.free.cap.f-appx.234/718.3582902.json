Magbaleta was convicted following a one-day bench trial before a magistrate judge and the district court denied his appeal from the conviction. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">A conviction is supported by sufficient evidence if, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>421 F.3d 1044, 1049 (9th Cir.2005). This test applies to jury and bench trials. <em>United States v. Magallon-Jimenez, </em>219 F.3d 1109, 1112 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Magbaleta first contends that the district court did not properly apply the proportionality requirement of the self-defense doctrine. There is no indication in the record that the magistrate judge applied an improper standard to the self-defense claim, and the photographs of the victim\u2019s injuries and the testimony at trial support the district court\u2019s determination that Magbaleta\u2019s use of force was not reasonable under the circumstances. Despite inconsistent testimony among witnesses, a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support Magbaleta\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Magbaleta also challenges his conviction on the grounds that the district court improperly admitted into evidence a National Park Service medical screening form. We review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>358 F.3d 1194, 1205 (9th Cir.2004). The medical screening form was properly authenticated because the government presented \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). Further, the medical screening form signed by Magbaleta is not hearsay because he manifested an adoption or belief in its truth. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(B). Finally, admission of the medical screening form did not violate Magbaleta\u2019s rights to confrontation and cross-examination because the government\u2019s witness was, in fact, cross-examined at trial. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the medical screening form.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b749-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
