The BIA issued a final order of removal on September 14, 2004, and Benyamin Shalaby filed his petition for review on October 15, 2004, one day beyond the thirty-day filing deadline. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Because the record contains no sworn verification by counsel that he actually faxed a copy of the petition one day before the deadline and no such copy is on file, we must dismiss the petition for review as untimely. <em>See Sheviakov v. INS, </em>237 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cTh[e] deadline for filing [a petition for review] is jurisdictional, and so there is nothing we can do about it if the filing came one day late.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-23\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
