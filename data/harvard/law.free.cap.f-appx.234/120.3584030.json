He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Although it is unclear from the materials before this court whether the district court disposed of Neal\u2019s motion for reconsideration filed on February 15, 2005, the district court\u2019s docket sheet indicates the court has subsequently entered judgment dismissing or denying relief on four motions filed by Neal challenging his convictions or sentence. Because there has been recent significant action in this case, we find there has been no undue delay in the district court. Accordingly, we deny <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the mandamus petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
