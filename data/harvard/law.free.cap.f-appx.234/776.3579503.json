We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the evidence compels such a result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of asylum because petitioners failed to show that any mistreatment occurred on account of an enumerated ground. <em>See id. </em>at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-18\">Because petitioners failed to demonstrate that they were eligible for asylum, it follows that they did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that petitioners failed to show that it was more likely than not that they will be tortured if returned to Egypt. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A9i-\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
