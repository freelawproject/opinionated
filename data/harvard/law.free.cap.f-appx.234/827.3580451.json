HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b858-10\">Stacey Brackens appeals from the district court\u2019s order dismissing his complaint because it is frivolous and fails to state a claim. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). Mr. Brackens proceeded pro se and <em>informa pauperis </em>in the district court and does so on appeal. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\">Mr. Brackens brought suit against Best Cab, Inc., in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, claiming that Best Cab had discriminated against him on the basis of his race and \u201cinflict[ed] Terror which caused depression that brought on mental anguish.\u201d R. Vol. I Doc. 1 at 2. As to his racial-discrimination claim, he alleges that Best Cab\u2019s attorney (apparently during a prior unsuccessful suit of his against the company) told him that if he were not representing himself the case would have settled; he interprets that statement to say \u201cthat they would have settled if I had a white lawyer, or even if I myself were white.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The allegations supporting his terror claim are similarly bizarre. He alleges: (1) \u201cOn two occasion [sic] [the son of Best Cab\u2019s owner] made threats to do bodily harm to myself, once he even came to my home with another gentleman and went to retrieved [sic] a weapon out of the back trunk of his car\u201d (although there is no allegation regarding what was done with that weapon); and (2) one of Best Cab\u2019s drivers loosened \u201cthe lugs on my wife\u2019s van causing our last son to be born prematurely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The sentence immediately following these allegations, however, states that he is \u201cnot suing for those things but because of and in light of those incidents I can show cause to fear, and based on that fear I had no other recourse but to flee the State of Kansas.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\">We review a dismissal for frivolousness under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Fogle v. Pierson, </em>435 F.3d 1252, 1259 (10th Cir.2006). We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim, accepting the allegations as true and viewing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>See Tal v. Hogan, </em>453 F.3d 1244, 1252 (10th Cir.2006). Because Mr. Brackens filed his complaint pro se, we construe his plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ings liberally. <em>See Mann v. Boatwright, 477 </em>F.3d 1140, 1148 n. 4 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the racial-discrimination claim frivolous. That claim is predicated on Mr. Brackens\u2019s belief that the statement by Best Cabs\u2019 lawyer that the case would have settled if Mr. Brackens had a lawyer meant that Best Cabs would have settled if Mr. Brackens were white. The district court could properly decide that Mr. Brackens\u2019s belief was gross speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">And we affirm dismissal of the infliction-of-terror claim for failure to state a claim. Mr. Brackens alleges no facts that could support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b858-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
