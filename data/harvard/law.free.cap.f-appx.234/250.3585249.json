The district court dismissed the suit pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b) for want of prosecution. Minix argues that he did his best to comply with the district court\u2019s orders and the dismissal was not warranted. Minix also moves this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>for copies of records and an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal, which operates as one with prejudice due to the pertinent statute of limitations, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Long v. Simmons, </em>77 F.3d 878, 880 (5th Cir.1996); <em>McNeal v. Papasan, </em>842 F.2d 787, 789-90 (5th Cir. 1988). When reviewing a dismissal with prejudice under Rule 41(b), we will conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion unless there is a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff and the district court has expressly determined that milder sanctions would not encourage diligent prosecution, or the record shows that the district court employed lesser sanctions that proved to be futile. <em>Berry v. CIGNA/RSI-CIGNA </em>975 F.2d 1188, 1191 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The dismissal was based on Minix\u2019s failure to follow a court order. The district court did not consider lesser sanctions before dismissing Minix\u2019s suit. The district court abused its discretion in dismissing Minix\u2019s suit. <em>See Berry, </em>975 F.2d at 1191 &amp; n. 6. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
