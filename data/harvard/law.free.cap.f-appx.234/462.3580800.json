We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Mouhanna\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely because it was not filed until more than one year after the BIA issued its final order of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (generally requiring that motions to reopen be filed within 90 days of the entry of a final administrative order of removal). Moreover, Mouhanna did not show he was entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897. Finally, Mouhanna failed to present new and material evidence of changed conditions in Lebanon. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii) (no time limit on motion to reopen to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-25\">Mouhanna\u2019s contention concerning his eligibility for adjustment of status under <em>Bona v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 663 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>2005) is unpersuasive because he failed to timely file his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b492-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
