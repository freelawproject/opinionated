We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>see Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 529 (9th Cir.1999), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence they submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d); <em>cf. Guzman v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 911, 913 (9th Cir. 2003) (a motion to remand filed after the final order of removal is properly treated as a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>It follows that the BIA did not violate due process by denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (to prevail on a due process challenge, a petitioner must show error).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"Az5\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
