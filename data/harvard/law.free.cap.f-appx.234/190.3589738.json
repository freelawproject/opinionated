SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">National Union Fire Insurance Company (\u201cNational Union\u201d) sued Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cLiberty Mutual\u201d), seeking coverage under a policy. The district court granted summary judgment for Liberty Mutual, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">This case arises out of a dispute between Rubicon, Inc. (\u201cRubicon\u201d), and S &amp; B Engineers and Constructors, Ltd. (\u201cS <em>&amp; </em>B\u201d), which Rubicon hired to provide engineering contract services for an expansion project. As part of this project, S &amp; B obtained weld shop fabricated pipes from American Pipe Fabricating, Inc. (\u201cAmerican Pipe\u201d). In the middle of the project, Rubicon terminated S &amp; B\u2019s involvement, litigation ensued, and Rubicon sued S &amp; B for breach of contract, negligence in performing its duties, and negligent misrepresentation, among other causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-18\">S &amp; B and Rubicon settled the suit, and S <em>&amp; </em>B sought payment from its insurer, National Union, for the costs of the suit. National Union and S <em>&amp; </em>B settled that claim, and S &amp; B assigned its rights against any third parties to National Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In the instant case, National Union sues Liberty Mutual, American Pipe\u2019s insurer, to recover the amount of the settlement to Rubicon that resulted from American Pipe\u2019s defective work, based on two theories. First, National Union argues that S &amp; B was an additional insured under Liberty Mutual\u2019s insurance policy for American Pipe. Liberty Mutual admits that S &amp; B was an additional insured but asserts that S &amp; B cannot recover in this case because of the \u201cyour work\u201d and \u201cyour product\u201d exclusions in the policy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> National Union argues that S <em>&amp; </em>B was not excluded under these provisions, because S &amp; B was not \u201cyou\u201d as defined by the contract,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so the exclusions applying to \u201cyou\u201d did not apply to S &amp; B. Moreover, National Union contends that the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion is inapplicable here because of the subcontractor exception: American Pipe acted as a subcontractor to S &amp; B, so the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion does not apply.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">Second, National Union urges that Liberty Mutual was obligated to fulfill American Pipe\u2019s promise to indemnify S &amp; B for losses resulting from American Pipe\u2019s services. As part of the purchase order between S <em>&amp; </em>B and American Pipe, American Pipe promised to carry insurance<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and indemnify S &amp; B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As American Pipe\u2019s insurer, Liberty Mutual would be obligated to fulfill this promise. Liberty Mutual, however, contends that American Pipe\u2019s obligation to indemnify S &amp; B was excluded from Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy with American Pipe by the contractual liability exclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> National Union retorts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the purchase order qualifies as an insured contract, obviating that exclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Liberty Mutual reasons that American Pipe and S &amp; B\u2019s contract is not an insured contract because S &amp; B was an engineer, and Liberty Mutual\u2019s insurance policy with American Pipe excludes engineering services from the definition of insured contracts.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u201cThis Court reviews grants of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-movant.\u201d <em>Fruge ex rel. Fruge v. Parker Drilling Co., </em>337 F.3d 558, 560 (5th Cir. 2003). \u201cIf the court finds no ambiguity [in an insurance policy], the court\u2019s duty is to enforce the policy according to its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Valmont Energy Steel, Inc. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>359 F.3d 770, 773 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">National Union seeks coverage as an additional insured, arguing the \u201cyour work\u201d and \u201cyour product\u201d exceptions do not apply to S &amp; B because \u201cyou\u201d was defined in the contract as American Pipe, not additional insureds such as S &amp; B. We take as a given that \u201cyou\u201d in this policy only means American Pipe, according to the policy\u2019s definition of that word. Read with that definition, the policy excludes claims based on American Pipe\u2019s work or product, because American Pipe is substituted for you in those exclusions. With that substitution, the policy excludes (1) \u201c \u2018Property damage\u2019 to \u2018[American Pipe\u2019s] work\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it and included in the \u2018products-completed operations hazard.\u2019 and (2) \u201c \u2018Property damage\u2019 to \u2018[American Pipe\u2019s] product\u2019 arising out of it or any part of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">S &amp; B\u2019s claim as an additional insured is based on American Pipe\u2019s work or product. S &amp; B is correct that if S &amp; B\u2019s work or product had been the basis of the suit, these exclusions would not apply, but they do apply in this case because American Pipe\u2019s work or product is the cause of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">National Union points us to <em>Chevron Chemical Co. v. Factory Compressor Parts, Inc., </em>1993 WL 329999 (E.D.La. Aug. 23, 1993), to support its position. Instead of bolstering National Union\u2019s argument, however, <em>Chevron Chemical </em>confirms the effect we have given to the terms of the policy here. In that case, an insurance policy excluded \u201cbodily injury or property damage arising out of the alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, release or escape of pollutants ... at or from premises you own, rent or occupy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2 (internal quotations omitted). The \u201cyou\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>was defined in the policy as the named insured in the declaration, and the named insured was Factory Compressor Parts. <em>Id. </em>at *3. Because the damage from pollutants occurred on Chevron\u2019s and not Factory Compressor Parts\u2019s premises, the exclusion did not apply on those facts: \u201c[T]he pollution exclusion only applies to claims for bodily injury which arise from the discharge, dispersal, release or escape of pollutants from premises owned by Factory (the only insured included in the policy\u2019s definition of \u2018you\u2019).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The instant case has different facts, but our reading of the insurance policy comports entirely with <em>Chevron Chemical\u2019s </em>reading of the policy in that case. In both cases, the named insured is substituted for \u201cyou\u201d in the policy. Though the substitution in that case meant that the exclusion did not apply because the premises were not owned by \u201cyou,\u201d in this case the exclusion does apply, because the work or product serving as the basis of the claim was \u201cyours\u201d\u2014American Pipe\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Substituting \u201cAmerican Pipe\u201d for \u201cyou\u201d in the subcontractor exception similarly reveals that S <em>&amp; </em>B is not entitled to relief under that exception. The policy says that the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion does not apply \u201cif the damaged work or the work out of which the damages arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.\u201d Because the contract defines \u201cyou\u201d as American Pipe, the exception applies when someone else does work as American Pipe\u2019s subcontractor, not when American Pipe is a subcontractor. \u201c[0]n your behalf\u2019 becomes \u201con American Pipe\u2019s behalf,\u201d so S &amp; B cannot obtain the benefit of this exception, because no one worked on American Pipe\u2019s behalf. S &amp; B was excluded from coverage because American Pipe\u2019s work or product was the basis of the claim, and American Pipe did not hire a subcontractor to work on its behalf, so the district court correctly determined that S &amp; B\u2019s claim was excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">National Union seeks coverage pursuant to the purchase order between S &amp; B and American Pipe in which American Pipe agreed to defend and indemnify S &amp; B. National Union asserts that Liberty Mutual, as American Pipe\u2019s insurer, is liable to S &amp; B for this obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Because the basis of S &amp; B\u2019s claim is American Pipe\u2019s work or product, the indemnity provision in the purchase order does not provide a way for S &amp; B to be covered by Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy. The indemnity provision was never triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">American Pipe promised to indemnify S &amp; B for claims \u201carising out of injury to, disease or death of, or damage to or loss of property of, persons (except for Seller\u2019s property, employees, agents or subcontractors)____\u201d This provision excludes damage to property of American Pipe, as the \u201cSeller.\u201d Without damages beyond damages to American Pipe\u2019s own work or product, the indemnity provision was never triggered, and Liberty Mutual is not obligated to pay National Union on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
