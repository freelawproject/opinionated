Owens, Texas prisoner # 851492, moves this court for a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion. The Rule 60(b) motion was taken from the dismissal as time-barred of Owens\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application challenging his convictions for indecency with a child and attempted aggravated sexual assault of a child under the age of fourteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-23\">A COA is required for an appeal from \u201cthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). The denial of Owens\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion is not such an order. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>Dunn v. Cockrell, </em>302 F.3d 491, 492 (5th Cir.2002). The motion for a COA is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-24\">A district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Warfield v. Byron, </em>436 F.3d 551, 555 (5th Cir.2006). Owens argues that the district court erred by failing to find that he was prevented from filing his \u00a7 2254 application by a state-created impediment as in <em>Egerton v. Cockrell, </em>334 F.3d 433, 437-39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>(5th Cir.2003). Rule 60(b) may not be used as a substitute for an appeal. <em>See Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981). As Owens has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Rule 60(b) motion, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">MOTION FOR COA DENIED AS UNNECESSARY; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
