We grant the petition and remand for an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-23\">Because the facts are familiar to the parties, we do not repeat them here except as necessary to explain our reasoning. The sole question presented on review is whether, for purposes of compensation for a December 17, 1999 injury, Jarrett should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>be considered a land-based \u201cemployee\u201d covered by the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3), or a \u201cseaman\u201d covered by the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104(a) (formerly 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The BRB \u201caccept[s] the ALJ\u2019s findings unless they are contrary to the law, irrational, or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Alcala v. Dir., OWCP, </em>141 F.3d 942, 944 (9th Cir.1998). We in turn \u201creview the [BRB\u2019s] decision for errors of law and adherence to the substantial evidence standard.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The LHWCA provides no-fault workers\u2019 compensation to \u201cemployee[s]\u201d \u201cengaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and any harbor-worker including a ship repairman, shipbuilder, and ship-breaker.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3). The LHWCA expressly excludes recovery by \u201ca master or member of a crew of any vessel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 902(3)(G). Such individuals are instead covered under the Jones Act, which provides no-fault workers\u2019 compensation to injured \u201cseam[e]n.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104(a); <em>see also McDermott Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Wilander, </em>498 U.S. 337, 353-55, 111 S.Ct. 807, 112 L.Ed.2d 866 (1991) (explaining relationship between LHWCA and Jones Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The Supreme Court has formulated a two-part test to determine whether a worker is excluded from LHWCA coverage as \u201ca master or member of a crew of any vessel.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 347, 111 S.Ct. 807; <em>Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, </em>515 U.S. 347, 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172, 132 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995). First, \u201can employee\u2019s duties must contribut[e] to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.\u201d <em>Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (quoting <em>Wilander, </em>498 U.S. at 355, 111 S.Ct. 807) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). Second, \u201cand most important,\u201d the employee \u201cmust have a connection to a vessel in navigation (or to an identifiable group of such vessels) that is substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Because Jarrett does not dispute that his work contributed to the function of a vessel, we move to the second part of the test. It is undisputed that during the time he worked for Navatek, Ltd., between 1996 and 2000, as a ship maintenance person\u2014a job specifically enumerated in the LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3)\u2014Jarrett spent only a few months, directly prior to his accident, working on board a vessel. Although during those few months Jarrett spent a large percentage of his time at sea, the overall pattern of his work simply does not show that he had a connection to a vessel in navigation sufficiently substantial in duration and nature to take him outside the coverage of the LHWCA. <em>See Chandris, </em>515 U.S. at 370-71, 115 S.Ct. 2172.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The Supreme Court has recognized that a formerly land-based worker may be considered \u201ca master or member of a crew\u201d based upon only a short duration at sea if his or her \u201cbasic assignment [has] change[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 115 S.Ct. 2172. Although there is some evidence that Jarrett, and Navatek, hoped he would eventually transition to a position as a deck hand or assistant engineer on board a vessel, the LHWCA does not exclude \u201cprobable or expectant seamen but seamen in being.\u201d <em>Heise v. Fishing Co. of Alaska, Inc., </em>79 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Desper v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., </em>342 U.S. 187, 191, 72 S.Ct. 216, 96 L.Ed. 205 (1952)). Given the absence of substantial evidence showing that Jarrett\u2019s job fundamentally changed in the months directly prior to his accident, we must conclude that he continued to be covered by the LHWCA. Therefore, we grant the petition and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>mand for an award of benefits under that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b744-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
