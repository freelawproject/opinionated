California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising one issue: whether the sentence is plainly unreasonable. Jackson was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">We find that Jackson\u2019s sentence, imposed within his properly-calculated advisory sentencing range, is not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006) (providing review standard), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1813, 167 L.Ed.2d 325 (2007); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000); <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a), p.s. (2006) (revocation table).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b199-15\"> The court also sentenced him to two years of supervised release thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
