We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-21\">The BIA acted within its discretion in denying as untimely Chand\u2019s motion to reopen because it was filed over four years after the BIA\u2019s final removal order, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i) (motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days of final administrative removal order), and Chand failed to present new and material evidence of changed conditions in Fiji, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (no time limit on motion to reopen to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions). Chand also did not show that she was entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 898 (9th Cir.2003) (stating that the court recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines on motions to reopen when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>due diligence in discovering the deception, fraud, or error) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"ACi\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
