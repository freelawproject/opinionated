McClure appeals his sentence, challenging this court\u2019s decision to accord a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within a correctly calculated guideline range as a return to mandatory guideline sentencing. He also argues that his sentence, which is in the middle of the advisory guideline range, is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-21\">McClure\u2019s first issue is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness standard). Moreover, our review of the record discloses that McClure has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-23\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
