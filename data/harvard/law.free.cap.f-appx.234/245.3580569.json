Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">Yount\u2019s office complex was damaged by Hurricane Katrina, and she sued Lafayette in state court to recover insurance proceeds allegedly due under the business interruption provisions of her policy. Lafayette removed to federal district court, arguing that jurisdiction was proper pursuant to the Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1369. That court granted Yount\u2019s motion to remand, finding that Hurricane Katrina was not an \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1369. Yount requested attorney\u2019s fees on the ground that Lafayette\u2019s removal had been untimely and in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-23\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-24\">We review the denial of a request for attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>Avitts v. Amoco Prod. Co., 111 F.3d 30, 32 </em>(5th Cir.1997). \u201cAbsent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney\u2019s fees under [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal. Conversely, when an objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be denied.\u201d <em>Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., </em>546 U.S. 132, 141, 126 S.Ct. 704, 163 L.Ed.2d 547 (2005) (citing <em>Hornbuckle v. State Farm Lloyds, </em>385 F.3d 538, 541 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Valdes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>199 F.3d 290, 293 (5th Cir.2000)). We do not consider Lafayette\u2019s motive in removing; we look only to whether it had an objectively reasonable basis for the removal. <em>Valdes, </em>199 F.3d at 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-25\">Yount claims there is no objectively reasonable basis on which Lafayette\u2019s motion to remove could be considered timely. Lafayette alleged in its notice of removal that it was also a defendant in another case pending in the Eastern District of Louisiana, <em>Abadie v. Aegis Sec. Ins. Co., </em>that arose out of Hurricane Katrina and that could have been brought pursuant to \u00a7 1369. Lafayette based its motion to remove on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(e)(1)(B), which provides for removal if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7d\">the defendant is a party to an action which is or could have been brought, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>whole or in part, under section 1369 in a United States district court and arises from the same accident as the action in State court, even if the action to be removed could not have been brought in a district court as an original matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Lafayette claimed that <em>Abadie </em>could have been brought pursuant to \u00a7 1369 and that it arose out of the same accident (Hurricane Katrina) as Yount\u2019s lawsuit, so removal was appropriate. In her request for attorney\u2019s fees Yount pointed to the time limit provision of \u00a7 1441(e)(1), which states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-5\">a notice of removal may also be filed before trial of the action in State court within 30 days after the date on which the defendant first becomes a party to an action under section 1369 in a United States district court that arises from the same accident as the action in State court, or at a later time with leave of the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It is not disputed that Lafayette\u2019s removal claim was within this time frame in reference to <em>Abadie. </em>Yount alleges, however, that approximately three months earlier Lafayette had been named as a defendant in another suit arising out of Hurricane Katrina that could have been brought under \u00a7 1369, <em>Berthelot v. Boh Bros. Constr. Co., L.L.C. </em>Yount\u2019s suit was pending at the time that Lafayette was a defendant in <em>Berthelot, </em>and thus she claims that the thirty-day time period during which Lafayette could remove her suit pursuant to \u00a7 1441(e)(1) had expired at the time that Lafayette removed and that there was no objectively reasonable basis for asserting that the removal was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Our review turns entirely on an objective consideration of the merits of Lafayette\u2019s case at the time of removal. <em>Valdes, </em>199 F.3d at 292. The question is the interpretation of the limitations period of \u00a7 1441(e)(1) if the defendant has been named in multiple \u00a7 1369 suits. Both parties concede that no court has addressed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Lafayette correctly points out that under the language of the statute, viewed in isolation, its removal was timely\u2014it removed within thirty days of first becoming a defendant in <em>Abadie, </em>which could have been brought under \u00a7 1369. Yount points to the word \u201cfirst,\u201d arguing that the thirty-day limitation period was tied to <em>Berthelot, </em>the first of the two \u00a7 1369 cases at issue, and that it would make no sense to permit the limitations period to start anew if a second \u00a7 1369 suit is brought against a defendant after the initial limitations period has expired. We need not, and do not, express an opinion about which of these interpretations is correct except to say that Lafayette could conclude from the language of the statute that its position was reasonable, especially in light of the lack of any judicial precedent. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b275-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
