R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b461-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">Plaintiff-Appellant Mavis Davis (\u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s decision granting Defendant-Appellee United Parcel Service, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cUPS\u201d) motion for summary judgment on her Title VII and state law retaliation, state law intentional infliction of emotional distress (\u201cIIED\u201d), and common law negligent supervision, training, and retention claims. The facts and procedural history are familiar to the parties, and we do not repeat them here. We review a district court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment de novo. <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). Applying that standard, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision granting UPS\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all three claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">First, even assuming Appellant\u2019s view of the facts, her retaliation claims fail because she has not presented evidence that she engaged in a protected activity; indeed, \u201c[n]o reasonable person could have believed that the [original or later incidents she complained about] violated Title VII\u2019s standard.\u201d <em>Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 270-71, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001) (per curiam) (holding that no reasonable person could believe a Title VII violation occurred where a supervisor and another male employee\u2014in the female plaintiffs presence\u2014\u201cchuckled\u201d and discussed a statement that a job applicant had once told a co-worker that \u201cI hear making love to you is like making love to the Grand Canyon\u201d); <em>see also Manatt v. Bank of Am., </em>339 F.3d 792, 800 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that to make a prima facie showing of retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), a plaintiff must present evidence that: (1) \u201cshe engaged in a protected activity\u201d; 2) her em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ployer \u201csubjected her to an adverse employment action\u201d; and 3) \u201ca causal link exists between the protected activity and the adverse action\u201d); <em>see also Pope v. Motel 6, </em>121 Nev. 307, 114 P.3d 277, 281-82 (2005) (noting similarities between Nev. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 613.340 and Title VII and relying on Title VII precedents to interpret \u00a7 613.340).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Second, Appellant\u2019s IIED claim fails as a matter of law because she did not present evidence that UPS or any of its employees engaged in \u201cextreme and outrageous conduct with either the intention of, or reckless disregard for, causing emotional distress.\u201d <em>Star v. Rabello, </em>97 Nev. 124, 625 P.2d 90, 91-92 (1981). At most, Appellant has merely presented evidence of \u201coccasional acts that are [ ] inconsiderate and unkind.\u201d <em>Maduike v. Agency Rent-A-Car, </em>114 Nev. 1, 953 P.2d 24, 26 (1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Third, Appellant\u2019s claims for negligent training, supervision, and retention also fail as a matter of law because the only evidence in the record indicates that UPS\u2019 employees were reasonably trained and supervised and that UPS did not act unreasonably in retaining the employees Appellant claims harassed her. <em>See Vinci v. Las Vegas Sands, Inc., </em>115 Nev. 243, 984 P.2d 750, 751-52 (1999) (per curiam) (addressing the standard for judging negligent training, supervision, and hiring claims); <em>Hall v. SSF, Inc., </em>112 Nev. 1384, 930 P.2d 94, 99 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of UPS is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b461-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
