We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum relief because petitioner failed to demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 967 (9th Cir. 1998) (explaining that \u201cmere generalized lawlessness and violence between diverse populations\u201d is insufficient to grant asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Because petitioner failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See id. </em>at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under CAT. <em>See Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1122-23 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Finally, the IJ granted voluntary departure for a 62-day period and the BIA streamlined and changed the voluntary departure period to 30 days. In <em>Padilla-Padilla v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 972, 981 (9th Cir.2006), we held \u201cthat because the BIA issued a streamlined order, it was required to affirm the entirety of the IJ\u2019s decision, including the length of the voluntary departure period.\u201d We therefore remand to the BIA to reinstate the 62-day voluntary departure period.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b623-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
