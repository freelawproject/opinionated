The guidelines sentence was enhanced for obstruction of justice because Beery fled after he was indicted and continued his criminal conduct. The district court also ordered Beery to pay $576,643.47 in restitution and a $200 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Beery\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that the district court reversibly erred in denying a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility. A district court\u2019s ruling that a defendant is not entitled to a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility \u201cshould not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>340 F.3d 222, 227 (5th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A defendant who receives an enhancement for obstruction of justice will not be eligible to receive a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, except in \u201cextraordinary cases.\u201d U.S.S.G \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Beery did not timely withdraw from criminal activity or voluntarily surrender. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(b) &amp; (d)). Rather, Beery remained a fugitive for almost a year and continued selling stolen property online during this time. Beery has not demonstrated that his case is extraordinary or that the district court\u2019s denial of acceptance of responsibility was \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>340 F.3d at 227. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
