We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(f). <em>See Guzman-Andrade v. Gonzales, </em>407 F.3d 1073, 1076 (9th Cir.2005). We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(f)(4)(B), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Mendez-Leon does not dispute that he has been convicted of three misdemeanors. The LAU did not, therefore, abuse its discretion in concluding that he is ineligible for the benefit of temporary resident status. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245a.2(c)(1) (stating that an alien convicted of any felony or three or more misdemeanors is ineligible for temporary resident status).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Mendez-Leon\u2019s contention that Congress intended to exclude illegal entry convictions in determining whether an alien is eligible for legalization is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b610-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
