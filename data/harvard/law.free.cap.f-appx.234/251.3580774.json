Garcia first challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. However, his sole argument is that this court\u2019s jurisprudence applying a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence falling within a properly calculated guideline range is inconsistent with <em>United States v. Booker,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Garda concedes that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, but he raises the issue here solely to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Garcia also argues that \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Garcia contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Garcia properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
