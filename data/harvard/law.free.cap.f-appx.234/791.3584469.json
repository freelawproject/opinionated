As the parties are familiar with the facts, procedural history, and arguments, we will not recount them here. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate the portion of the Judgment and Probation/Commitment Order that provides that Defendant\u2019s payment of restitution is suspended, and we remand for entry of an order requiring payment of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-18\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (MVRA) eliminates the district court\u2019s discretion with respect to restitution by defendants convicted of certain crimes. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1). The statutory directive is clear: the \u201c[sentencing] court shall order ... that the defendant make restitution to the victim[s]\u201d for \u201can offense against property under this title ... including any offense committed by fraud or deceit.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(1), (c)(1)(A)(ii). We have held that \u201cif the MVRA applies, a restitution order is mandatory regardless of the defendant\u2019s ability to pay.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Fuente, </em>353 F.3d 766, 769 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see United States v. Grice, </em>319 F.3d 1174, 1177 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 U.S. 950, 123 S.Ct. 2625, 156 L.Ed.2d 641 (2003); <em>see also United States v. Bussell, </em>414 F.3d 1048, 1060-61 (9th Cir.2005) (explaining that orders of restitution are unaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>fected by sentencing guideline changes worked by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Defendant Silver was convicted of mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The district court is required to order restitution unless one of the two statutory exceptions applies. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(3). Neither of them does. The victims of the defendant\u2019s fraud and the amounts of their losses have been identified. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(3)(A). Nor does this case involve any complex issues related to the cause or amount of the victims\u2019 losses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(3)(B). The losses are already determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">VACATED in part and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b822-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
