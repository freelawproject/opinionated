David was also convicted of three counts of violating the Travel Act to promote state bribery. They challenge their convictions on the grounds that (1) the record on appeal is incomplete, and (2) the admission of the recorded conversations between an alleged unindicted co-conspirator and an undercover agent violated their Sixth Amendment confrontation rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-16\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b341-17\">David was the superintendent of schools for Santa Rosa Independent School District (\u201cS.R.ISD\u201d), and Guadalupe was a member of the S.R. ISD board. Daniel Rodriguez worked as a frontman at Conceptual Reality, Inc., (\u201cCRI\u201d), an architectural firm, that had entered into illegal contracts with the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-18\">As part of an investigation of corruption in the awarding of municipal contracts in the Rio Grande Valley, Special Agent Oz-valdo Alaniz (\u201cAgent Alaniz\u201d), working undercover, became acquainted with Rodriguez. Agent Alaniz represented himself to be a vendor of school supplies and furniture. Rodriguez introduced Agent Alaniz to city, school, and other elected officials in the Rio Grande Valley, including the defendants. Rodriguez told Agent Alaniz that he had payed bribes to local officials to convince them to award contracts to CRI. Specifically, Rodriguez indicated that he had bribed the Vasquez brothers in the past, giving them cash and paying for vacations.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-19\">Through Rodriguez, Agent Alaniz attempted to enter into a contract with S.R. ISD. David informed Agent Alaniz that the only supplies the schools needed were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>tires. Agent Alaniz asked if there were any personal items that David needed; David indicated that he needed new tires for his truck. Agent Alaniz delivered the tires to the school district, but David had already purchased his own tires. David agreed with Agent Alaniz that Guadalupe should receive the tires. In the end, Agent Alaniz purchased tires for Guadalupe\u2019s daughter and son-in-law.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Rodriguez purchased airline tickets to Las Vegas and paid for meals and a hotel room in Las Vegas for the defendants. David told federal officers that he believed that Rodriguez had paid for the trip to thank David for helping Rodriguez obtain a school contract. David further admitted asking Rodriguez to pay for another brother, Danny Vasquez, to fly to Washington, D.C. David also acknowledged that A1 Cardenas, who had been pursuing a large construction contract with the school district, obtained a female escort service for David. And, the construction contract was awarded to Cardenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The Vasquez brothers were convicted by a jury on the above named counts. David also was convicted of violating the Travel Act to promote state bribery. David was sentenced to a 48-month term of imprisonment to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. He was ordered to pay a $75,000 f\u00edne and a special assessment fee. Guadalupe was sentenced to a 54-month term of imprisonment to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. He was ordered to pay a $60,000 f\u00edne and a special assessment fee. The defendants timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We extended the briefing deadline at the request of the defendants\u2019 appellate counsel, who had not represented them at trial, based on her report that there were large portions of the record missing and that the transcript of the trial was incomplete. Missing from the record were thirty-two recordings, including the conversations recorded by Agent Alaniz that were admitted at trial, as well as government exhibits. Appellate counsel had contacted the Clerk of Court for the Southern District of Texas, but the clerk had neither any record of the exhibits introduced at trial by the government nor any transcripts of the tape recordings admitted at trial. In her brief, counsel asserted that the gaps in the record require that the defendants\u2019 convictions be reversed and a new trial granted. After the defendants\u2019 brief was filed, however, the tape recordings were sent to us by the district court. In addition, the government submitted transcripts of excerpts of those tape recordings when it filed its brief. Thus, the record before us, to which counsel had access, is now complete. Although we allowed the defendants\u2019 counsel time to file a supplemental brief, she has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">II. Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">A. Right to a Complete Record on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">\u201c[A] criminal defendant has a right to a record on appeal which includes a complete transcript of the proceedings at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similarly, the Court Reporter Act requires that a court reporter \u201cshall record! ] verbatim by short hand ... or any other method ... all proceedings in criminal cases had in open court.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When, as here, \u201ca criminal defendant is represented on appeal by counsel other than the attorney at trial, the absence of a substantial and significant portion of the record, even absent any showing of specific prejudice or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>error, is sufficient to mandate reversal.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ordinarily in such a case, we remand to the district court for a determination whether the record can be reconstructed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, however, remand is not necessary, as the record before us is now complete.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">B. Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"A6T\">The Vasquez brothers also contend that the admission of Rodriguez\u2019s statements violated their rights under the Confrontation Clause. \u201cThe Confrontation Clause prohibits the admission of an out-of-court testimonial statement unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cThis prohibition is \u2018irrespective of whether the statement falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bears particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cConfrontation Clause objections that were properly raised at trial are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>subject to harmless error analysis.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Although the Vasquez brothers objected to the admission of Rodriguez\u2019s statements on both hearsay (the denial of which has not been appealed) and Confrontation Clause grounds, the government contends that the Vasquez brothers have not preserved this objection on appeal, as, it asserts, they did not state the specific ground of objection, <em>i.e., </em>that Rodriguez\u2019s statements were testimonial. The government therefore urges us to apply plain error review. This argument fails. When a criminal defendant objects on Confrontation Clause grounds, he is implicitly contending that the challenged statement is testimonial. After all, a statement that is not testimonial cannot violate the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we review the defendants\u2019 Confrontation Clause challenge <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-15\">The Vasquez brothers contend that, because the \u201cjig [was] up\u201d for Rodriguez by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the time the FBI started investigating the Vasquez brothers, Rodriguez\u2019s statements were testimonial. There is nothing in the record, however, to suggest that Rodriguez was aware that his conversations with Agent Alaniz were being recorded. Instead, it appears that Rodriguez made the statements at issue unwittingly to an undercover officer. Thus, the statements are not testimonial and their admission does not violate the Vasquez brothers\u2019 Confrontation Clause rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Finding no error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">. <em>United States v.

To the extent the government argues that we have rejected the Vasquez brothers' assertion that the fact that a statement is excluded from the hearsay definition by Rule 801(d)(2)(E) does not dispose of the confrontation clause issue, it is clearly incorrect. <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>401 F.3d 290, 299 (5th Cir.2005), cited by the government, is not to the contrary. In <em>Delgado, the </em>court noted that the statements at issue were both non-testimonial and admissible hearsay. The court did not hold that the statements were non-testimonial <em>because </em>they were admissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-17\">The government argues at length that the statements at issue fall within Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
