We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-23\">Hill contends that his constitutional rights were violated by the use of a stun-belt during trial. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the use of the restraint was necessary. <em>See Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). Furthermore, HOI has not shown that he was prejudiced by wearing the restraint. <em>See Gonzalez v. Pliler, </em>341 F.3d 897, 903 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-24\">We construe HOl\u2019s briefing of uncertified issues as a request to broaden the certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-1(e). So construed, the request is denied. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-03 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b620-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
