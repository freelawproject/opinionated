He filed an unsuccessful 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition, and he now appeals the denial of that petition. He argues that he is actually innocent of the drug quantity used to determine his sentence and that counsel rendered ineffective assistance for not challenging the district court\u2019s drug quan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>tity findings. He contends that he should be permitted to proceed under \u00a7 2241 because these claims have not been properly addressed and because a miscarriage of justice will occur if these claims are not considered. King has not shown that his claims arise under \u00a7 2241, nor has he shown that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
