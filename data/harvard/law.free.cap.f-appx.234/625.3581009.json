We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>see McQuillion v. Duncan, </em>306 F.3d 895, 899 (9th Cir.2002), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Appellees contend that we lack jurisdiction because there is no federally protected interest in parole release in California, and thus, Cass has failed to state a federal claim. As appellees acknowledge, this contention is foreclosed by <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1127-28 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Cass contends that the California Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (the \u201cBoard\u201d) decision to deny him parole violated his due process rights. We disagree. We conclude that there was no due process violation because some evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision. <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Irons v. Carey, </em>479 F.3d 658, 664-65 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1128-29. Accordingly, Cass has failed to demonstrate that the state court\u2019s decision \u201cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\u201d or \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We further conclude that Cass waived his contention regarding breach of his guilty plea because he failed to raise it in the district court. <em>See Majoy v. Roe, </em>296 F.3d 770, 777 n. 3 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b655-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
