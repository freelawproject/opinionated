R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b732-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Petitioner Varuzh Abrahamyan, an Iranian native and Armenian citizen, seeks review of the decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA dismissed Abrahamyan\u2019s appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) denial of an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">The BIA\u2019s decision relied on the IJ\u2019s reasoning and reviewed the IJ\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3). We look to the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cas a guide to what lay behind the BIA\u2019s conclusion,\u201d <em>Kozulin v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1115 (9th Cir.2000), and review the IJ\u2019s findings for substantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). We will grant the petition for review only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Abrahamyan fails to show that a different method of translation \u201cwould have made a difference in the outcome of the hearing.\u201d <em>Kotasz v. INS, </em>31 F.3d 847, 850 n. 2 (9th Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record demonstrates that Abrahamyan received \u201ca fair opportunity to relate [his] version of events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We cannot conclude that \u201cfaulty translation influenced the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">The inconsistencies upon which the IJ based his adverse credibility finding cannot be blamed on inadequate translation. Because these discrepancies relate to the basis for Abrahamyan\u2019s alleged fear of persecution, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1259 (9th Cir.2003). Abrahamyan has not met his burden to show that \u201cno reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 484, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">Because Abrahamyan is ineligible for asylum, he necessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-14\">Abrahamyan\u2019s claim for CAT relief fails because he has not provided credible evidence that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Armenia. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1221 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b732-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b732-10\">. Abrahamyan\u2019s pending motion to file a late reply brief is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b732-17\">. We reject the government\u2019s contention that Abrahamyan waived his due process argument by failing to raise the matter in his appeal to the BIA. <em>See Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
