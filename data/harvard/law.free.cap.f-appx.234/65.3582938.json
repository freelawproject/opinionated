We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Kotmair, </em>No. 1:05-cv-01297-WMN (D.Md. Nov. 29, 2006; Feb. 7, 2007). We deny Save-A-Patriot\u2019s motion to strike portions of the brief filed by the United States, and we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
