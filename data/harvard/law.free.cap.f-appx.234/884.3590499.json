This case, originally filed by Palmer in state court, was removed by the defendants to federal district court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) on the basis of complete preemption. Palmer unsuccessfully attempted to have the case remanded to state court, arguing that her claims presented no federal questions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the district court retained the case and ultimately disposed of all claims in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-17\">Palmer is an employee of Meadowcraft, Inc. (\u201cMeadowcraft\u201d) and a member of the local unit of the United Steel Workers of America (the \u201cLocal Union\u201d), the collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>bargaining representative for many Mead-owcraft employees. The collective bargaining agreement between Meadowcraft and the Local Union relevant to this lawsuit (the \u201cCBA\u201d) was entered into on July 1,1998 and remained in effect until July 1, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Zen Pearson is also an employee of Meadowcraft and a member of the Local Union. Prior to October 1999 there had never been a Local Union newsletter, but union members had expressed a desire for one. Therefore, at the request of the Local Union president, Pearson authored and printed four editions of a union newsletter between October 1999 and March 2000. Pearson used her home computer to produce the newsletters, and determined the content contained in them on her own. She distributed the newsletters at the Meadowcraft plant before work began, and left copies for employees to pick up at her work booth.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Pearson\u2019s March 2000 newsletter featured the following article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">D P What is a D P?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-7\">1. Always into someone else\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">2. Loud Mouthed and arrogant for no apparent reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-9\">3. Get chaos and confusion started among members, then sits back to see what becomes of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-10\">4. Rude in every aspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-11\">5. Shows bad bathroom manners by taking up stalls, that someone may really need to make use of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-12\">Okay. Now that you\u2019ve got the idea members. Please!! Don\u2019t be a D P and try your best not to have a D P day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-14\">The above article does not reflect any particular person all similarities are just coincidental.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-15\">In addition to Pearson handing out the March edition at the plant and leaving copies at her booth, this newsletter was also posted on a Meadowcraft bulletin board.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-16\">In response to Pearson\u2019s article, Palmer filed the instant lawsuit against Meadow-craft, the Local Union, and Pearson (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cDefendants\u201d) in Alabama state court. Defendants removed the action to federal district court, contending that at least some of Palmer\u2019s claims were completely preempted by federal labor law and therefore presented a case over which the federal district court had original subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Once in federal court, Meadowcraft filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), and Palmer filed a motion to remand to state court, which was denied. The motion to dismiss was granted as to Palmer\u2019s outrage and infliction of emotional distress claims, but denied as to her defamation and negligent supervision claims. Defendants then filed motions for summary judgment on the remaining two claims. Palmer renewed her motion to remand. The district court, reaffirming its finding that it possessed jurisdiction over Palmer\u2019s claims, granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. Palmer appealed the district court\u2019s denial of her motion to remand this case to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">During the pendency of the appeal, Meadowcraft filed for bankruptcy protection and we stayed the appeal. Meadow-craft\u2019s bankruptcy plan was confirmed and Meadowcraft moved to dismiss the appeal as moot. After Palmer failed to respond to the motion to dismiss, this court granted the motion, lifted the stay, and dismissed the appeal as to Meadowcraft. We now consider the claims as to the remaining parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">We review de novo whether a district court may exercise jurisdiction over a case based on complete preemption, or instead must remand to state court. Anderson <em>v. H &amp; R Block, Inc., </em>287 F.3d 1038, 1041 (11th Cir.2002). In determining whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction, we must look to the facts as they existed at the time the action was filed. <em>Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 200, 207, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993); <em>Leonard v. Enter. Rent A Car, </em>279 F.3d 967, 972 (11th Cir.2002). For purposes of this challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court, the critical time is the date of removal. <em>Leonard, </em>279 F.3d at 972 (addressing diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332); <em>see also Poore v. American-Amicable Life Ins. Co. of Tex., </em>218 F.3d 1287, 1289-91 (11th Cir.2000). If jurisdiction was proper at that date, subsequent events will not operate to divest the court of jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a) allows for removal to federal court of any civil action brought in state court over which the federal court has original jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). Removal based on federal question jurisdiction, as in the instant case, is generally governed by the well-pleaded complaint rule. <em>See Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, </em>211 U.S. 149, 152, 29 S.Ct. 42, 53 L.Ed. 126 (1908). Following this rule, a court looks to the face of the plaintiffs properly pleaded complaint in order to determine whether a state law claim presents a federal question. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">The doctrine of complete preemption, however, exists as an exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule. <em>See Caterpillar, Inc. </em>V. <em>Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 393, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987). Under this doctrine, certain state law claims brought in state court may be removed to federal court under \u00a7 1441(a) as containing a federal question even where the face of the plaintiffs properly pleaded complaint makes no reference to any issues of federal law. The reasoning behind the doctrine is that the preemptive force of certain federal statutes is so strong that their implication in a case can convert an ordinary state claim into a statutory federal claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">The Supreme Court has held that \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (\u201cLMRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, has such extraordinary preemptive force as to be an appropriate federal statute under which to find complete preemption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See e.g. Allis-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number><em>Chalmers v. Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 211, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985). For complete preemption to apply, resolution of the state law claim must \u201crequire[ ] the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Lingle v. Norge Div. Of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 399, 405-06, 413, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410 (1988); <em>see also United Steelworkers of Am. v. Rawson, </em>495 U.S. 362, 369, 110 S.Ct. 1904, 109 L.Ed.2d 362 (1990); <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 394, 107 S.Ct. 2425; <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>471 U.S. at 213, 105 S.Ct. 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">In deciding whether a state tort law claim requires the interpretation of collective bargaining agreement, we must look to the elements of the state law claim, <em>see Lightning v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>60 F.3d 1551, 1557 (11th Cir.1995), to determine \u201cwhether evaluation of the tort claim is inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract.\u201d <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>471 U.S. at 213, 105 S.Ct. 1904. Under Alabama law, a plaintiff asserting a claim for negligent supervision must, as in all negligence cases, show that the defendant owed her a duty, and establish the scope of that duty. <em>See Ledbetter v. United Am. Ins. Co., </em>624 So.2d 1371, 1373 (Ala.1993). For Palmer to have prevailed on her claim of negligent supervision against Meadowcraft, she would be required to demonstrate that the company owed a duty to her to supervise and train Pearson in regard to Pearson\u2019s role as editor of the Local Union newsletter. Because we find no such duty existing in the eommon law, if Meadowcraft did undertake this duty, its source must be the CBA. Thus, in order to determine the extent to which, if at all, such a duty exists, the CBA will have to be examined and interpreted. We therefore hold that \u00a7 301 of the LMRA completely preempted Palmer\u2019s negligent supervision claim against Meadowcraft, and that the district court properly exercised its subject matter jurisdiction as to that claim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Because Palmer\u2019s claim of negligent supervision against Meadowcraft was completely preempted, it follows that the district court properly maintained subject matter jurisdiction over the entire case pursuant to its supplemental jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a). We therefore do not consider whether complete preemption, pursuant to \u00a7 301 or any other federal statute, appropriately applied to any of Palmer\u2019s other claims or even her claim of negligent supervision against the Local Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Based on the foregoing, we AFFIRM the jurisdiction of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-10\">. According to her notice of appeal, Palmer also intended to challenge the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on two of her claims, the other two earlier having been dismissed for failure to state a claim. Because she did not address the district court\u2019s rulings on the merits of her claims in her initial brief, however, we deem Palmer to have waived these arguments on appeal. <em>See Lind v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>254 F.3d 1281, 1283 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001). We therefore consider only the jurisdictional issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b916-13\">. For a case brought in state court to be removable to federal court, the case must be one over which the federal court has original jurisdiction. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). Here, the purported jurisdiction of the district court was based on the suit presenting a federal question under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. State law claims that do not, on their face, reference any issue of federal law may nonetheless involve a federal question sufficient to confer original federal question jurisdiction on a district court under the doctrine of complete preemption, as explained in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b917-7\">. See <em>supra </em>note 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b917-8\">. Section 301(a) of the LMRA provides for federal jurisdiction over \u2018\u2018[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization____\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). Although the language of the statute speaks only to suits for violation of contracts, the Supreme Court has held that the preemptive force of \u00a7 301 extends to state law tort actions as well. <em>See Allis-Chalmers v. Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 211, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985)(\u201c[Q]uestions relating to what the parties to a labor agreement agreed, and what legal consequences were intended to flow from breaches of that agreement, must be resolved by reference to uniform federal law, whether such questions arise in the context of a suit for breach of contract or in a suit alleging liability in tort.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b918-5\">. Although the CBA did not contain any explicit terms regarding a duty on the part of Meadowcraft to supervise the content and production of Local Union newsletters, a collective bargaining agreement can create duties and conditions of employment not \"expressly recited in the agreement.\u201d <em>Allis-Chalmers, </em>471 U.S. at 214, 105 S.Ct. 1904. Besides, Palmer alleged as part of her failure to supervise claim that the article was posted on a bulletin board maintained and controlled by Meadowcraft, and the CBA contained explicit references regarding the use of the company bulletin board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
