We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b), and we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-21\">Acuna-Gamez argues that the IJ\u2019s finding that he had engaged in human smuggling\u2014and thus that he did not exhibit good moral character\u2014is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). We need not reach that issue, however, because in any event the alleged smuggling incident transpired more than ten years prior to the issuance of the BIA\u2019s final decision on March 9, 2004. After the BIA made its decision in this case, it decided <em>In re Ortega^Cabrera, </em>which held that \u201cthe relevant period for determining good moral character for purposes [of] establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal must include the time during which the respondent is in proceedings, i.e., until the issuance of an administratively final decision on the application.\u201d 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 793, 797 (BIA 2005); <em>see also In re Bautista Gomez, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 893, 894 (BIA 2006) (\u201c[A]n application for relief from removal is a continuing one ... [G]ood moral character for cancellation of removal purposes continues to accrue up to the time we decide an alien\u2019s appeal.\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>We remand this petition to the BIA for reconsideration in light of its recent decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Petition GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Cir.
