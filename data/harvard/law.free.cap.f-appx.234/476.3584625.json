To the extent we have jurisdiction it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>821 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Chacon Padilla failed to demonstrate that she was prejudiced by her first attorney\u2019s failure to call her husband as a witness or by her second attorney\u2019s handling of her first two motions to reopen. <em>See id. </em>at 899-900 (to establish a valid due process claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, an alien must show that she was prejudiced by the attorney\u2019s deficient performance).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Chacon Padilla\u2019s contention that the BIA should have applied equitable tolling is unavailing because the BIA\u2019s prejudice determination is dispositive. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">We lack jurisdiction to reinstate Chacon Padilla\u2019s voluntary departure period. <em>See Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1157, 1159 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Chacon Padilla\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b507-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
