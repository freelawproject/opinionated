We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-23\">When, as here, the BIA affirms without an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003). We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2000), and we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-24\">Substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that persecution was not on account of a protected ground. Esago-lian testified that government officials referenced his Armenian ethnicity while they were beating him, and that officials referenced his religion prior to his arrest. <em>See Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1077 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-25\">Furthermore, substantial evidence does not support the IJ\u2019s finding that the beating and detention which Esagolian experienced failed to rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Chand, </em>222 F.3d at 1073-74 (stating that \u201c[p]hysical harm has consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tently been treated as persecution,\u201d and holding that the cumulative impact of harm, including economic injury, compelled a finding of past persecution).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand the case to the BIA for further proceedings. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b491-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
