FLETCHER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b503-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">Hoang Kim Vo appeals the 90-month sentence imposed following her guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to import ecstasy in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952(a), 960(b)(3), and 963. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-17\">First, there was no impropriety in the Government\u2019s decision not to file a motion for a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SEl.Rb).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vo\u2019s written plea agreement required no such motion and expressly permitted the Government to reassess Vo\u2019s acceptance of responsibility at sentencing based on her post-plea conduct. The Government\u2019s decision not to file the motion based on Vo\u2019s false statements in her proffers to the Government and in her testimony during her husband\u2019s trials was not arbitrary, made in bad faith, or based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See United States v. Espinoza-Cano, </em>456 F.3d 1126, 1136 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>65 F.3d 758, 762 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">Second, given the district court\u2019s detailed analysis of Vo\u2019s relevant conduct, we find no clear error in the finding that Vo was more than a \u201cminor\u201d participant for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>purposes of denying a two-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Nor do the district court\u2019s findings contain any inherent contradictions or reveal any erroneous narrowing of the relevant class of comparable participants, unlike <em>United States v. Rojas-Millan, </em>234 F.3d 464, 472 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Third, the district court\u2019s findings that Vo testified falsely during her proffers to the government and her testimony at her husband\u2019s trials were sufficient to disqualify Vo for the safety valve under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5) and, consequently, to deny a two-level reduction under \u00a7 201.1(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Finally, even assuming the district court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 because it formally addressed only one of the three elements of perjury, <em>see United States v. Jimenez, </em>300 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir.2002), we affirm nonetheless. Despite this lone error in determining the applicable Guidelines range, on remand the district court undoubtedly would again exercise its discretion by imposing the same 90-month sentence, which is still far below the applicable range. The claimed error is therefore harmless and immaterial. <em>See United States v. Menyweather, </em>447 F.3d 625, 634 (9th Cir.2006)(as amended); <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1280 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
