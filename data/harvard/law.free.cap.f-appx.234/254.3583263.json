Rebollar argues that the district court erred in characterizing his state conviction for transporting cocaine as an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, but he states that his argument is moot in light of his release from imprisonment. He also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), but acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-22\">The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance, arguing that Rebol-lar\u2019s appeal is moot and foreclosed. Both parties have informed this court that Re-bollar has been released from prison and has been deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-23\">In <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007), we held that an appellant\u2019s challenge to the characterization of a state offense as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 2L1.2 was moot when the appellant had completed his term of imprisonment and had been deported. Accordingly, Rebollar\u2019s argument in this regard is moot. <em>See Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d at 383. As such, the Government\u2019s motion is denied in part, and Rebollar\u2019s appeal is dismissed in part as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-24\">Additionally, Rebollar\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>The Government\u2019s motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>for summary affirmance is granted in part, and the judgment of the district court is affirmed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">MOTION GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b284-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
