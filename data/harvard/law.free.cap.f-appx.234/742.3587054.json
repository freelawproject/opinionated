He appeals his mandatory 15 year sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), challenging the sentencing court\u2019s determination that he has three prior convictions that qualify as violent felonies. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-21\">One of the convictions was for spousal abuse. The relevant California statute required \u201cwilful conduct\u201d that results in a \u201ctraumatic condition,\u201d which is defined to include external or internal injuries caused by physical force. CaLPenal Code \u00a7 273.5(a), (c). Given \u00a7 273.5\u2019s clear requirement that the use of force be established to convict, this conviction categorically qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-22\">A second conviction was for shooting at an occupied vehicle. Here the appellant contends that he was not the shooter. This amounts to a collateral attack on the validity of the state conviction which is not appropriate as a part of federal sentencing. <em>See Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 487, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-23\">The third conviction was for battery on a peace officer under CahPenal Code \u00a7 243(c). In the California state court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>according to a transcript of the plea colloquy, Ceja stipulated that the police report would provide a factual basis for his guilty plea to battery on a police officer. Ceja contends that the federal sentencing court, in determining that his battery conviction was a violent felony, improperly considered the police report. The Supreme Court, however, has held that sentencing courts may properly consider documents that a defendant adopts as the factual basis for his plea. <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 20-21, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Espinoza-Cano, </em>456 F.3d 1126, 1132 (9th Cir.2006). The stipulation therefore constituted a sufficient factual basis for the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Ceja also contends that the facts contained in the report do not establish that he committed a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA. The facts, however, show that he endeavored to escape from police officers\u2019 attempts to arrest him in his bedroom. He thus resisted the arrest, and when the police officers blocked his exit from the room by physically tackling him, a fight ensued that resulted in actual injury to three of the officers. Although the government is incorrect in contending that the California statute is categorically a violent felony, under the modified categorical approach, the matters to which the defendant stipulated in state court are sufficient to establish that Ceja was convicted for conduct that involves the \u201cuse of force\u201d and hence amounted to a violent felony within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Hernandez, 431 </em>F.3d 1212, 1218 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that facts showing that the defendant attempted to \u201cforcibly\u201d extract the victim from her van established the \u201cuse of force\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Savage, </em>488 F.3d 1232, 1236-37 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that escape from a jail type facility established a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d and thus established a crime of violence). The sentence therefore is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b772-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
