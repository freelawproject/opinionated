We previously affirmed his sentence. <em>United States v. Mortera, </em>169 Fed.Appx. 203 (5th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court has vacated and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). <em>Gutierrez-Tovar et al. v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 828, 166 L.Ed.2d 662 (2006). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s remand, we requested and received supplemental letter briefs from both parties regarding the impact of <em>Lopez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-26\">Mr. Mortera has since completed his term of imprisonment; counsel concedes his removal. His appeal is therefore moot, according to binding circuit precedent. <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cBecause the defendant has been deported ... and is legally unable, without permission of the Attorney General, to reenter the United States to be present for a resentencing proceeding as required by Rule 43, there is no relief we are able to grant him and his appeal is moot.\u201d). We therefore DISMISS the appeal as to the judgment of sentence. We AFFIRM the judgment of conviction; Mr. Mortera\u2019s arguments in that regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>remain foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b252-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
