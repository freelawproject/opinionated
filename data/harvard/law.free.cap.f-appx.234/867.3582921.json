SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">William R. Turner, a state prisoner appearing <em>pro se,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>seeks a certificate of ap-pealability (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1), we see no basis for appeal and deny his application for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-15\">Mr. Turner was convicted in Kansas state court of two counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, one count of criminal sodomy, and two counts of indecent liberties with a child. He appealed directly to the Kansas Court of Appeals, contending <em>inter alia </em>that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury it had to agree unanimously on a particular underlying act of taking indecent liberties and in admitting evidence of his prior crimes and gang affiliation. The court of appeals affirmed Mr. Turner\u2019s convictions for aggravated indecent liberties with a child and criminal sodomy but reversed his two convictions for indecent liberties with a child. <em>State v. Turner, </em>32 P.3d 1241 (Kan.Ct.App.2001) (unpublished). The Kansas Supreme Court denied review. The state chose to dismiss the reversed charges rather than retry them.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-16\">Mr. Turner then unsuccessfully collaterally challenged his conviction. The state trial court determined he was not entitled to relief stemming from improper admission of evidence of prior crimes, drug use, or gang affiliations because these issues had been decided on direct appeal. It held Mr. Turner\u2019s claims of speedy trial violations, judicial misconduct, prosecutorial misconduct, and sufficiency of the evidence were procedurally barred because they could have been raised on direct appeal but were not. The court denied Mr. Turner\u2019s ineffectiveness of counsel claim on the merits. The decision was affirmed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>the Kansas Court of Appeals, and the Kansas Supreme Court denied review.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Mr. Turner sought relief in federal court asserting five issues. The district court held Mr. Turner\u2019s claims of improper admission of prior crimes, prosecutorial misconduct, and insufficiency of the evidence were procedurally barred. It nevertheless addressed the issues on the merits and denied them along with his claims regarding the trial court\u2019s failure to give a unanimity instruction and his counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance. In his application to this court, Mr. Turner asserts a denial of due process arising from admission of pri- or crimes evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, insufficiency of the evidence, and ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Mr. Turner\u2019s convictions are based on the following facts in the record. In the summer of 1998, he and his wife, Marsha Williamson-Turner, resided with his wife\u2019s mother. During that time, the Turners\u2019 fourteen year-old niece, H.W., frequently visited the home and sometimes spent the night. During June 1998, Mr. Turner fondled H.W. Shortly thereafter, the Turners moved into their own home. H.W. frequented the new residence and often babysat for the Turners\u2019 young daughter while her aunt was at work. During this time, Mr. Turner touched and fondled H.W. on an almost daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">In 1999, H.W. was sleeping in the Turners\u2019 bedroom. H.W. laid down in the bedroom while Mr. Turner remained in the living room watching television with his wife and his daughter. After his wife and child fell asleep in the living room, Mr. Turner went into the bedroom where H.W. was asleep, removed all of his clothing, and laid on the bed next to H.W. Mr. Turner positioned himself so that his penis was touching H.W.\u2019s buttocks. He then fondled her breasts and removed her clothing. Mr. Turner proceeded to insert his fingers in H.W.\u2019s vagina and perform oral sex on her. At some point during the incident, Mr. Turner masturbated. He ejaculated on H.W.\u2019s buttocks. Throughout the event, H.W. asked Mr. Turner to stop. Mr. Turner responded by telling H.W. to be quiet or she would wake up his wife. H.W. took a shower, then awakened her aunt and told her to go and sleep in the bedroom with Mr. Turner. H.W. dozed on the couch until morning. The next day, H.W. told a friend and her friend\u2019s grandmother about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">K.C., a fourteen year-old friend of H.W., also fell victim to Mr. Turner. In July 1998, Mr. Turner, H.W., and K.C. were at a local swimming pool. While there, Mr. Turner fondled K.C. atop her swimming suit. K.C. requested that Mr. Turner stop. He did not and proceeded to put his hand inside K.C.\u2019s swimming suit and insert his fingers into her vagina. The next day, the three returned to the pool, and Mr. Turner fondled K.C. as he had done the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a state habe-as petitioner \u201chas no absolute entitlement to appeal a district court\u2019s denial of his petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). To vest the court of appeals with jurisdiction, he first must obtain a COA. <em>See id. </em>at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029. A COA will issue only if petitioner makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2)). To do so, petitioner must show \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>ther.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In determining whether the petitioner has made the required showing, we review the claims presented in his \u00a7 2254 petition and generally assess their merit. <em>See Miller-El, </em>537 U.S. at 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029. In doing so, we \u201clook to the District Court\u2019s application of AEDPA to petitioner\u2019s constitutional claims and ask whether that resolution was debatable among jurists of reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, where petitioner\u2019s federal habeas claims were adjudicated on the merits in state court, we will grant an application for a COA only where the state court decision was debatably \u201c \u2018contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court ... \u2019 or was \u2018based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d <em>Dockins v. Hines, </em>374 F.3d 935, 936-37 (10th Cir.2004). \u201cIf the claim was not heard on the merits by the state courts, and the federal district court made its own determination in the first instance, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact, if any, for clear error.\u201d <em>LaFevers v. Gibson, </em>182 F.3d 705, 711 (10th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Federal courts need not review habeas corpus issues that were defaulted in state courts if the default constitutes an independent and adequate state ground unless cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice can be shown. <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). Mr. Turner contends the state procedural rule barring presentation of the issues of prosecutorial misconduct and insufficiency of the evidence is not firmly established and regularly applied. We decline to address whether Kansas Supreme Court Rule 183(c) is an independent and adequate state procedural ground to bar Mr. Turner\u2019s claims. Rather, like the district court, we reach the merits of his claims. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>43 F.3d 491, 496 (10th Cir.1994) (declining to address whether a claim was procedurally barred when claim would fad on the merits). We first address those claims decided on the merits for the first time in the federal habeas proceedings, and follow with a discussion of the claims decided on the merits in the state proceedings, applying the appropriate standards in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">We review a sufficiency of the evidence claim in a habeas corpus proceeding to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Kelly v. Roberts, </em>998 F.2d 802, 807, 808 (10th Cir. 1993). We accept the jury\u2019s resolution of the evidence as long as it is within the bounds of reason. <em>Id. </em>at 808. \u201cThis standard of review respects the jury\u2019s responsibility to weigh the evidence and draw reasonable inferences from the testimony presented at trial.\u201d <em>Dockins, </em>374 F.3d at 939. Here, the testimony of the victims and third-parties provided substantial and credible evidence from which the jury could easily and rationally conclude that Mr. Turner was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes charged. Mr. Turner points to no evidence that discredits the victim and witness accounts of the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">Mr. Turner\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct must also fail. He alleges \u201c[t]he prosecutorial misconduct during the trial was egregious and designed to keep the scales of justice tipped in favor of the prosecution. The prosecutions [sic] delays and attempts to elicit testimony that it knew or should have known to be false rose to the level of constitutional concern.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>Aplt. Br., Arguments and Authorities at 116. To succeed on this issue, Mr. Turner must show the prosecutor\u2019s conduct rendered his trial fundamentally unfair. <em>Short v. Sirmons, </em>472 F.3d 1177, 1195 (10th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Donnelly v. De-Christoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 645, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). Mr. Turner complains that the prosecutor purposely delayed his trial and continuously referred to Mr. Turner as a \u201cdrug dealing gang member who beats his wife.\u201d Reply to State\u2019s Resp. to Def.\u2019s Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus at 3, <em>Turner v. Roberts, </em>No. 05-3103, 2006 WL 749580 (D.Kan. Mar. 23, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The facts regarding the delay of Mr. Turner\u2019s trial are these. The state moved to continue the original trial date of November 8, 1999 until January 3, 2000. On December 21, 1999, the state filed a motion to allow evidence of prior crimes. Because Mr. Turner did not obtain evidence regarding those prior crimes until December 30, 1999, he requested a continuance to properly prepare for trial. The continuance was granted and the trial reset for March 6, 2000. Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss at 1-2, <em>State v. Turner, </em>No. 99-CR-2287. Mr. Turner offers no evidence showing that the prosecution moved for the admission of prior crimes for the purpose of delaying the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">We have reviewed the trial transcript and find no instances of name-calling; instead, there are factual statements elicited from witnesses as to Mr. Turner\u2019s involvement in matters such as use and possession of narcotics, gang membership, and domestic violence. Oftentimes, Mr. Turner\u2019s counsel opened the door for the state to pursue such information. <em>See, e.g., </em>Tr. Tran., Vol. II at 93-94 (eliciting information on re-direct about Mr. Turner\u2019s gang affiliation after subject of gang membership introduced on cross-examination); Tr. Tran., Vol. Ill at 71-96 (eliciting information on cross about domestic violence incidents between the Turners after door opened to same on direct examination). Such usual trial practice cannot be considered prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor did not act in a way that rendered Mr. Turner\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">We now turn to Mr. Turner\u2019s claims of improper admission of prior crimes. At trial, the state introduced evidence that Mr. Turner had committed sexual crimes against minor girls on two previous occasions. His counsel objected. The trial court admitted the evidence for the limited purpose of showing intent for the indecent liberty charges and instructed the jury accordingly. Finding the evidence immaterial to the indecent liberties charges and thus improperly admitted, the Kansas Court of Appeals reversed those charges. <em>State v. Turner, </em>No. 85,666 at 12, 32 P.3d 1241 (Kan.Ct.App. Sept. 28, 2001) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">But we disagree with Mr. Turner\u2019s assertion that there is no other credible evidence supporting his remaining convictions for aggravated indecent liberties with a child and criminal sodomy. Aplt. Br. Arguments and Authorities at H 5. A review of the testimony of the victims and of third parties with whom the victims spoke compellingly details the crimes. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that the jury did not adhere to the limiting instruction given by the trial court. \u201cA central assumption of our jurisprudence is that juries follow the instructions they receive.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>140 F.3d 874, 884 (10th Cir.1998). Given that the trial court gave the jury a limiting instruction as to the prior crimes evidence and that the appellate court reversed the very charges that the evidence was intended to support, we cannot conclude that the resolution of this issue is debatable among reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>jurists. <em>Cf. Duvall v. Reynolds, </em>139 F.3d 768, 787-88 (10th Cir.1998) (holding improper admission of prior acts does not rise to the level of constitutional error if the trial judge instructs jury to disregard the evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Finally, we address Mr. Turner\u2019s contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. In making this claim in state court, Mr. Turner alleged several errors, all of which the state court found were either contradicted by the record or concerned strategic and tactical decisions of counsel. <em>See Turner v. State, </em>No. 90,552, 2004 WL 1714945, at *1 (Kan.Ct.App. Oct. 26, 2004). The federal district court gave thorough treatment to Mr. Turner\u2019s numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the resulting denial is not debatable under the AEDPA standard we must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Accordingly, for substantially the reasons stated by the district court, we conclude that reasonable jurists would not disagree with that court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Turner\u2019s claims. Because Mr. Turner has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we DENY his request for a COA. We also deny his request to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b898-12\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-13\">. We liberally construe Mr. Turner\u2019s <em>pro se </em>application. <em>See Cummings v. Evans, </em>161 F.3d 610, 613 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-17\">.
