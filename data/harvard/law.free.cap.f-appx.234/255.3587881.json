She challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that she failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because she failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-21\">The district court concluded, inter alia, that Burton did not did not complete administrative remedies that were available following the incident that formed the basis of her civil rights complaint. Burton does not provide argument challenging this conclusion. She has therefore waived this issue. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-22\">Burton characterizes her claims as tort claims and argues that exhaustion is not required for tort claims. Burton did not indicate in the district court that she was pursuing tort remedies. Rather, she indicated that her complaint was for civil rights violations. To the extent that Burton\u2019s complaint can be construed as raising tort claims, such claims are procedurally governed by federal law, which requires compliance with \u00a7 1997e(a). <em>See Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002). Thus, Burton\u2019s attempt to characterize her claims as tort claims, rather than as civil rights claims, does not indicate that the district court\u2019s conclusion was incorrect. Also, this court has considered and rejected Burton\u2019s argument that a prisoner need not exhaust if money damages are unavailable through the applicable grievance procedure. <em>See Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
