We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>see Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination based upon inconsistencies in Barse-ghyan\u2019s testimony and between his testimony and his asylum application regarding whether he faced a criminal indictment in Armenia. The finding goes to the heart of Barseghyan\u2019s asylum claim. <em>Sec id. </em>at 963. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the determination that Barse-ghyan failed to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Because Barseghyan failed to meet his burden for asylum, he necessarily did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1255 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">We reject Barseghyan\u2019s contention that the BIA violated due process by faffing to consider his claim for relief pursuant to the CAT, because the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s finding that Barseghyan failed to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returns to Armenia. See <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>351 F.3d 435, 443 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b592-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
