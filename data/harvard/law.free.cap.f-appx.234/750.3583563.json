The district court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion for summary judgment and Wright appeals. We review de <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 521 (9th Cir.1996). The decision of the Commissioner will, however, be affirmed if free of legal error and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1996). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Appellant argues that the ALJ failed to provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting his subjective claims of impairments. The ALJ found Wright \u201cnot totally credible for reasons set forth in the body of the decision\u201d but the body of the decision did not actually discuss Wright\u2019s credibility. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201c[T]he ALJ must identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines claimant\u2019s complaints.\u201d). Similarly, the ALJ should have pointed out whether he accepted or discounted the grandfather\u2019s testimony or point out which aspects of Wright\u2019s claims would be discounted. The district court erred in \u201caffirming] the ALJ\u2019s credibility decision based on evidence that the ALJ did not discuss.\u201d Connett <em>v. Barnhart, </em>340 F.3d 871, 874 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also Pinto v. Massanari, </em>249 F.3d 840, 847-48 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>S.E.C. v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The Appellant also argues that hypothetical questions asked of the vocational expert were flawed because they did not \u201cset out <em>all </em>the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant.\u201d <em>Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 422 (9th Cir.1988) (emphasis in original). Wright\u2019s reviewing doctor stated that he could not handle \u201cthe usual stresses encountered in competitive work.\u201d The ALJ instead asked the vocational expert if there were jobs available for someone who could not handle the stresses of \u201chighly competitive\u201d work involving \u201cquotas.\u201d This description goes far beyond what the doctor stated and therefore is not supported by the record. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Accordingly, the judgment is REVERSED and REMANDED to the district court with instructions to remand to the Social Security Administration for further administrative proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b780-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent, except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
