To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The evidence Salinas Mendieta presented with his motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence was insufficient to establish a prima facie case of hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 601 (holding that if \u201cthe BIA determines that a motion to reopen proceedings in which there has already been an unreviewable discretionary determination concerning a statutory prerequisite to relief does not make out a prima facie case for that relief,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court <em>from </em>revisiting the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Salinas Mendieta contends that the BIA violated due process by finding that he engaged in \u201cdilatory\u201d tactics. Contrary to Salmas Mendieta\u2019s contention, he was not \u201cprevented from reasonably presenting his case.\u201d <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, Salinas Mendieta failed to demonstrate that the BIA\u2019s finding prejudiced him because his failure to establish a pri-ma facie case of hardship is dispositive. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b508-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
