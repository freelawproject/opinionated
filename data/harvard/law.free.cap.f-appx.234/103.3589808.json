Citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1) (2000), Grace sought to remove his criminal prosecution to federal district court. In his memorandum supporting removal, Grace contended the arresting officer stopped him pretextually on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>account of his race, thus violating his civil rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (2000). Grace further contended the officer had a history of conducting pretextual stops of minorities, the solicitor\u2019s office showed no interest in vindicating his civil right to racial equality, and under the authority given solicitors under South Carolina law to control the criminal docket, he could not be assured of a fair trial in state court. The district court denied Grace\u2019s removal request and remanded the case to state court, and Grace appealed. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">Under \u00a7 1443(1), a civil action or criminal prosecution commenced in state court may be removed by the defendant to federal district court when the defendant \u201cis denied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d Removal is limited to rare situations in which a defendant has been denied or cannot enforce the right to racial equality in the state courts. <em>See Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 788, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966). After a thorough review of the materials before us on appeal, including the transcript of the removal hearing, we conclude removal is inappropriate in this case. <em>See City of Greenwood v. Peacock, </em>384 U.S. 808, 828, 86 S.Ct. 1800, 16 L.Ed.2d 944 (1966) (vindication of defendant\u2019s federal rights left to state courts \u201cexcept in the rare situations where it can be clearly predicted by reason of the operation of a pervasive and explicit state or federal law that those rights will inevitably be denied by the very act of bringing the defendant to trial\u201d in state court); <em>South Carolina v. Moore, </em>447 F.2d 1067, 1070 (4th Cir.1971) (holding right of removal under \u00a7 1443(1) limited to cases in which charged conduct enjoys federal protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
