JONES, Chief Judge:<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">Appellee City of Donna, Texas (\u201cCity\u201d), having spawned costly, time-consuming, and dubious procedural complexity in the extended course of litigation between these parties, moves to dismiss this appeal for lack of our appellate jurisdiction. We review <em>de novo, </em>and are constrained to agree for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-25\">The City contends that it timely removed a case against it filed by Victoria Palms into federal district court in the Southern District of Texas. Notably, when the City filed its removal petition, the litigation between the City and Victoria Palms was pending on appeal in the Texas state courts. Further, Victoria Palms contended that the City\u2019s removal was untimely under the federal removal statute. The district court, however, denied Victoria Palms\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-26\">After receiving briefing from the parties concerning the consequences of removal of a case pending on appeal in state court, the district court entered an order transferring the removed case to this court. For authority supporting its transfer, the district court cited <em>Meyerland Co. v. F.D.I.C., </em>848 S.W.2d 82, 83 (Tex.1993), and <em>Granny Goose Foods v. Brotherhood of Teamsters &amp; Auto Truck Drivers Local No. 70 of Alameda County, </em>415 U.S. 423, 94 S.Ct. 1113, 39 L.Ed.2d 435 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The district court\u2019s order has prompted further briefing in this court by both parties. Contrary to the district court\u2019s decision, Fifth Circuit case law allowing removal of state cases on appeal in state court applies only to removal of cases in which a specific federal statute, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819(b)(2), afforded particular removal jurisdiction to federal courts in cases under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819 <em>et seq. See F.D.I.C. v. Meyerland Co., </em>960 F.2d 512 (5th Cir.1992) (en banc). <em>Meyerland </em>furnishes no support for the theory that this court can exercise jurisdiction over a case removed in an appellate posture from the state courts. For that matter, <em>Meyerland </em>furnishes no support for removal of <em>any </em>non-FIRREA cases to federal district courts while still on appeal in the state court system. <em>See id. </em>at 515 n. 5. The statute interpreted in <em>Granny Goose Foods </em>governs only the post-removal status of state court orders in federal courts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1450. That provision does not confer initial jurisdiction. This court lacks a basis for exercising either final judgment or interlocutory jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">It is evident from the record that the City has contrived to confound and confuse the litigation in the state court system and now in this court. We trust the district court will try to prevent further erroneous manipulation of the litigation process, an effort that might commence with a reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order denying remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The district court\u2019s \u201cOrder of Transfer\u201d to this court does not confer appellate jurisdiction. Motion to dismiss \u201cappeal\u201d GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b209-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
