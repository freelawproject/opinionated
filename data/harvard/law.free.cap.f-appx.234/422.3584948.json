Christensen, M.D. P.C. (\u201cChristensen\u201d), an Arizona corporation, filed suit alleging that the Internal Revenue Service failed to provide it due process prior to determining that Christensen owed the United States for unpaid income taxes. The government filed a motion for summary judgment and, in the alternative, a motion to dismiss Christensen\u2019s complaint. After Christensen failed to oppose either motion, the district court granted summary judgment and denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss as moot. Christensen moved the district court to reconsider its summary judgment order, and the court denied the motion. Christensen appeals from the summary judgment and the denial of its motion for reconsideration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">As a preliminary matter, we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s underlying summary judgment order. Under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B), a notice of appeal from a case in which the United States is a party must be made within sixty days of the judgment being entered, unless the deadline is tolled by the timely filing of a post-judgment motion. Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(4)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Summary judgment was entered on December 14, 2004, but Christensen did not file its notice of appeal until March 28, 2005, well after the sixty-day window had closed. Moreover, Christensen\u2019s motion to reconsider did not toll the sixty-day clock because it was filed more than ten days after the judgment was entered. Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(4)(A). We have recognized that \u201c[a]n untimely motion for reconsideration does not suspend the time to appeal from the judgment.\u201d <em>Fiester v. Turner, </em>783 F.2d 1474, 1475 (9th Cir.1986) (citing Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)). Therefore, we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">We do retain jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Christensen\u2019s motion for reconsideration, but we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>Smith v. Pac. Prop. &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>358 F.3d 1097, 1100 (9th Cir.2004) (recognizing that we review decisions on motions to reconsider for abuse of discretion). Although Rule 56(c) contains a ten-day notice requirement, it requires only that the non-moving party be served with the motion papers ten days prior to a hearing or disposition on the motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ten-day requirement is meant to ensure that the non-moving party has received \u201creasonable notice that the sufficiency of his or her claim will be in issue,\u201d and that the party has been afforded \u201cadequate time to develop the facts on which the litigant will depend to oppose summary judgment.\u201d <em>Portsmouth Square Inc. v. Shareholders Protective Committee, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>770 F.2d 866, 869 (9th Cir.1985) (internal citations omitted); <em>see also In re Rothery, </em>143 F.3d 546, 549 (9th Cir.1998) (stating that the requirement ensures the non-moving party is fairly apprised that the court will in fact be deciding a summary judgment motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Moreover, under the district court\u2019s local rules, Christensen was afforded \u201cthirty days after service within which to serve and file a responsive memorandum in opposition,\u201d but it chose not to do so. U.S. Dist. Ct., D. Ariz., Rule 56.1(b). Christensen cannot blame the district court for Christensen\u2019s own failure in responding to the government\u2019s motion. <em>See Jacobsen v. Filler, </em>790 F.2d 1362, 1364-67 (9th Cir.1986) (explaining that it is not the obligation of the district court to advise litigants what measures are necessary to oppose summary judgment motions). Furthermore, a non-moving party cannot rest upon its complaint to overcome a motion for summary judgment; rather, it must respond by setting forth specific facts \u201cshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The government filed and served its motion for summary judgment on October 25, 2004. After Christensen failed to respond, the district court granted the government\u2019s motion on December 14, finding no genuine issue as to any material fact. The seven weeks that passed between service and judgment afforded Christensen more than sufficient time to develop facts upon which to mount an opposition, as it had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to ventilate the issues involved\u201d in the summary judgment motion. <em>Rothery, </em>143 F.3d at 549. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Christensen\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\"> This panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-15\">. Rule 56(c) states in pertinent part: \"The [summary judgment] motion shall be served at least 10 days before the time fixing for the hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b454-7\">WALLACE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AcB\">concurring in part and dissenting in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">I agree that we do not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s summary judgment. However, because I conclude that Christensen does not appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider, I would dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Christensen\u2019s notice of appeal states that he \u201cappeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the Judgment entered on January 27, 2005.\u201d The date of judgment was December 13, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">Arguably, there is some ambiguity because the district court denied Christensen\u2019s motion to reconsider on January 27, 2005. This ambiguity is resolved, however, by Christensen\u2019s opening brief. The brief states that we need only decide one issue: \u201c[wjhether the District Court erred in granting the United State\u2019s [sic] unopposed motion for summary judgment.\u201d In addition, the brief requests as relief only that we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment. I am therefore satisfied that Christensen does not appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to reconsider.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
