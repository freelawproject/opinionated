Rose appeals <em>pro se </em>from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review <em>de novo, Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">We reject as foreclosed the State\u2019s contention that the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain this appeal because Rose did not obtain a certificate of appealability. <em>See Rosas v. Nielsen, </em>428 F.3d 1229, 1231-32 (9th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Rose contends that the California Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (the \u201cBoard\u201d) decision to deny him parole violates his due process right under the Fourteenth Amendment. Rose concedes that he has incurred disciplinary violations while in prison. Furthermore, the record of the 2002 parole suitability hearing conducted by the Board both substantiates this concession and provides other evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision to deny Rose parole. We therefore conclude that \u201csome evidence\u201d supports the Board\u2019s decision, and hence that there was no due process violation. <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Irons v. Carey, </em>479 F.3d 658, 662 (9th Cir.2007); <em>Sass, </em>461 F.3d at 1128-29. Accordingly, we decline Rose\u2019s invitation to revisit <em>Sass\u2019s </em>application of the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard in this context. <em>See Miller v. Gammie, </em>335 F.3d 889, 899 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) (\u201c[A] three-judge panel may not overrule a prior decision of this court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Rose also contends that the Board\u2019s actions amount to cruel and unusual punishment. We may only grant relief on this claim if Rose can show that the Board\u2019s actions have resulted in punishment that is grossly disproportional to the crime, for the gross disproportionality principle is the only \u201cclearly established Federal law\u201d in this context. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 72, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003). Rose is serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole\u2014a sentence he does not contend is itself grossly disproportional to his crime. Because the Board\u2019s actions have not increased the length of his sentence beyond the maximum authorized term, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">Both Rose\u2019s briefs and his separate filing received by the court on February 15, 2007, raise arguments for the first time on appeal. Because he did not raise these arguments in the district court, we decline to consider them now. <em>See Allen v. Ornoski, </em>435 F.3d 946, 960-61 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1140, 163 L.Ed.2d 944 (2006). To the extent these documents contain uncertified issues, we construe Rose\u2019s presentation of such issues as a motion to expand the certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 22-1(e). So construed, we deny the motion. <em>See Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1104-05 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">We deny Rose\u2019s request for appointment of counsel. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(a)(2)(B); <em>Weygandt v. Look, </em>718 F.2d 952, 954 (9th Cir.1983) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The Clerk shall serve on Rose a copy of this court\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b608-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
