We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Cornwell v. Electra Cent. Credit Union, </em>439 F.3d 1018, 1028 n. 4 (9th Cir. 2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-24\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Nguyen\u2019s hostile work environment claim because Nguyen did not present sufficient evidence of mistreatment to raise a triable issue. <em>See Manatt v. Bank of America, NA, </em>339 F.3d 792, 798-99 (9th Cir.2003) (concluding that the conduct of plaintiffs co-workers \u201cwas neither severe nor pervasive enough to alter the conditions of [his] employment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-25\">Furthermore, it is undisputed that Nguyen never reported to his employer any feelings of racial discrimination against him. <em>See Brooks v. City of San Mateo, </em>229 F.3d 917, 924 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that where an employer has no notice of unlawful conduct, the employer cannot have sanctioned the conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-26\">The district court properly granted summary judgment as to Nguyen\u2019s disparate treatment claim because Nguyen did not produce sufficient evidence to create a triable issue as to whether defendants discharged him because he is of Vietnamese <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>descent. <em>See Cornwell, </em>439 F.3d at 1028-32 (discussing <em>McDonnell Douglas\u2019s </em>burden-shifting framework for purposes of summary judgment). Defendants offered evidence that they discharged Nguyen for performance reasons, and Nguyen presented no evidence of pretext. <em>See id. </em>at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Nguyen did not file a motion requesting that the district court judge recuse himself, and the district court judge had no obligation to recuse himself merely because he was a member of the same ethnic group as potential witnesses. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) (requiring recusal where judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Nguyen\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b556-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
