We have carefully reviewed the record on appeal, including the district court\u2019s exhaustive Memorandum and Order and Final Judgment, both filed December 6, 2006, as well as the law and facts as set forth in the briefs of the parties. For the same reasons and reasoning explicated by the district court in said Memorandum and Order, the district court\u2019s judgment and all post-judgment orders are, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b315-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
