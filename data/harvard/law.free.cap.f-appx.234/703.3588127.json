The BIA dismissed Toro-syan\u2019s appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">The BIA reviewed de novo the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Torosyan failed to establish that he was persecuted on one of the five protected statutory grounds. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3)(iii). \u201c[O]ur review is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision, except to the extent that the IJ\u2019s opinion is expressly adopted.\u201d <em>Lin v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 1131, 1133 (9th Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted). We will grant the petition only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-22\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Torosyan failed to establish by direct or circumstantial evidence that his persecutors were or would be motivated by one of the five protected statutory grounds. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). Whatever abuses Torosyan suffered, he testified that the corrupt government agents were motivated solely by greed and that Armenian businesses were subjected to these \u201ctaxes\u201d without regard to the owners\u2019 politics. \u201cEconomic persecution on account of a protected ground is distinct from persecution solely on account of an economic motive, for which our precedent precludes relief.\u201d <em>Baballah v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1067, 1075 n. 7 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">Because Torosyan is ineligible for asylum, he necessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number><em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
