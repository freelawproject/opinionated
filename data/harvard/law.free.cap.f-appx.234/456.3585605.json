We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 529 (9th Cir.1999). We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-24\">Rodas-Escobar\u2019s deportation proceedings were administratively closed in 1991 because he received Temporary Protected Status. When Rodas-Escobar moved to reopen to apply for benefits under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, his notary wrote the wrong address on the motion to reopen and, as a result, Rodas-Escobar did not receive notice of his hearing and was ordered deported <em>in absentia. </em>The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>of record shows reasonable cause for Ro-das-Escobar\u2019s failure to appear, and the agency abused its discretion in concluding otherwise. <em>See Urbina-Osejo v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 1314, 1316 (9th Cir.1997) (observing that reasonable cause can exist if petitioner does not receive adequate notice of hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings in light of a showing of reasonable cause for failure to attend the hearing. <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b486-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
