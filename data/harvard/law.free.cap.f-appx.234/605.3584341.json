We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-25\">Appellant contends that he is entitled to a sentence reduction based on Sentencing Guideline Amendment 484, which clarified the definition of \u201cmixture or substance\u201d in determining drug quantities. Because Amendment 484 was in effect prior to appellant\u2019s sentencing, the district court properly found that it lacked authority to grant relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Sprague, </em>135 F.3d 1301, 1303 (9th Cir.1998) (explaining that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) provides redress if the Sentencing Guidelines were changed <em>subsequent </em>to defendant\u2019s sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-26\">Appellant also contends that Amendment 591 should reduce his sentence. Amendment 591 does not apply because the district court did not use uncharged conduct in the selection of the applicable guideline, and appellant\u2019s sentence was not enhanced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2. <em>See U.S.S.G., </em>App. C, Amendment 591 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-27\">Appellant\u2019s claim under the Ex Post Facto Clause is waived by his failure to present it to the district court. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number><em>States v. Flores-Payon, </em>942 F.2d 556, 558 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b635-28\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
