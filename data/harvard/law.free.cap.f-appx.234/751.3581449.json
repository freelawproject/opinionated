He also petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise its authority to reopen sua sponte which Singh sought in connection with claimed irregularities in the underlying IJ removal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">We recently held in <em>Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735 (9th Cir.2007) that polygraph evidence does not constitute evidence that was \u201cnot available\u201d within the meaning of the regulation that governs motions to reopen. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Thus, the BIA properly denied reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">We do not have jurisdiction to review a BIA denial of reopening under its sua sponte authority because that is within the unfettered discretion of the BIA. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, Singh does not explain how the alleged irregularities in the IJ hearing adversely affected his ability to present his case. <em>See Halaim v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 1128, 1136 (9th Cir.2004). Finally, the IJ was not required to provide Singh with a complete translation. <em>El Rescate Legal Services, Inc. v. EOIR, </em>959 F.2d 742, 752 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">The petitions for review are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b782-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
