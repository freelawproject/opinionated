We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Clouser v. </em>Espy, 42 F.3d 1522, 1527 (9th Cir. 1994), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the United States on the Sauers\u2019 APA claim, because the final agency decision shows a thorough consideration of evidence regarding the nature of the Sauers\u2019 occupancy of the property, and does not betray a clear error in judgment. <em>See id. </em>at 1537 (describing the arbitrary and capricious standard applicable to the review of Forest Service determinations). Moreover, the record shows that at the time of the agency determination, the Sauers had not obtained agency approval of a Plan of Operations required for residential occupancy of a mining claim under Forest Service Regulations. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 261.10(b), 228.4; <em>see also United States v. Brunskill, </em>792 F.2d 938, 941 (9th Cir.1986) (affirming district court\u2019s order requiring removal of unauthorized structures where residents on Forest Service land lacked an approved operating plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Contrary to the Sauers\u2019 contentions, they were not denied due process during either agency or district court proceedings, because they received notice and hearings before their alleged property interest was affected. <em>See United States v. Bagwell, </em>961 F.2d 1450, 1454 n. 1 (9th Cir.1992); <em>see also Clouser, </em>42 F.3d at 1540-41 (Forest Service\u2019s \u201cdetailed administrative procedures-which include provisions for administrative appellate review\u201d do not violate due process; evidentiary hearings are not required at each stage).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">The Sauers\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b618-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
