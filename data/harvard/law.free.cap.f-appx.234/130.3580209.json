Keselica seeks to appeal the magistrate judge\u2019s orders denying his Fed. R. Civ.P. 60(b) motions for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his motion to reopen his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) proceeding and the order denying the first Rule 60(b) motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The orders are not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000); <em>Reid v. Angelone, </em>369 F.3d 363, 369 (4th Cir.2004). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). A prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find that any assessment of the constitutional claims by the district court is debatable or wrong and that any dispositive procedural ruling by the district court is likewise debatable. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336-38, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003); <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S. Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000); <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 683-84 (4th Cir.2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Keselica has not made the requisite showing. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-25\"> The parties consented to jurisdiction of the magistrate judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
