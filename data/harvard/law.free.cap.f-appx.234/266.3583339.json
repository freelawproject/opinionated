Lee argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had harbored, concealed, or shielded from detection illegal aliens or that he had substantially facilitated their remaining in the United States illegally. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational juror could have found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Lee provided illegal aliens with false identities and illegal income, thereby shielding them from detection and substantially facilitating their continued unlawful presence in the United States. <em>See United States v. Rubio-Gon-zalez, </em>674 F.2d 1067, 1072 (5th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Cantu, </em>557 F.2d 1173, 1180 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
