Because the parties are aware of the facts of the case, we do not recount them here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">Hernandez argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for possession with intent to distribute 1,776 grams of methamphetamine. Where, as here, the defendant fails to move for acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s presentation of its case at trial, this court \u201cwill review a claim of insufficiency of the evidence only for plain error.\u201d <em>United States v. Tavakkoly, </em>238 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>95 F.3d 773, 775 (9th Cir.1996)). To determine whether the district court erred in this respect we \u201creview the sufficiency of the evidence supporting [the] conviction by examining whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Willard, </em>230 F.3d 1093, 1095 (9th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">Ample evidence supported Hernandez\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute 1,776 grams of methamphetamine. When the officers executed the search warrant on the home where Hernandez lived, they found a total of $15,275 in cash, a .357 caliber handgun, a digital scale, two 200-gram calibration weights, and, most importantly, 1,776 grams of actual methamphetamine buried in the yard. Hernandez told officers that a supplier had \u201cfronted\u201d the 1,776 grams to him, and stated that he owed his supplier $7,300 per pound for the methamphetamine. Hernandez then explained to the officers how he arranged for his supplier in Mexico to deliver new shipments of methamphetamine to Long Beach, California, where Hernandez would pick up the drugs himself or have them brought from Long Beach to Las Vegas. Therefore, there was no error because sufficient evidence supported Hernandez\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute 1,776 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Hernandez also argues that the district court erred by imposing sentence without granting an acceptance of responsibility reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Because Hernandez did not contest the guideline calculations made in the PSR or detailed during the sentencing hearing, we review this issue for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Lara, </em>421 F.3d 932, 948-49 (9th Cir.2005). Hernandez\u2019s confession at sentencing of having made \u201ca wrong choice\u201d is insufficient to satisfy his burden of proving acceptance of responsibility after having denied his guilt throughout the litigation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, app. n. 2; <em>United States v. </em>Wei<em>land, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1080 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b766-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
