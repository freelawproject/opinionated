Alpert moved to set aside the default judgment solely under Rule 60(b)(4), claiming that he had not been validly served with process because the person who received the summons and complaint, his housekeeper, did not five at his residence at the time of service. The district court held an evidentiary hearing and determined that the testimony of Alpert and his housekeeper were not credible and that the housekeeper was residing at the house at the time of service. The court concluded that service of process was adequate. Alpert subsequently filed a motion for new trial and a second motion to set aside the default judgment, this time alleging excusable neglect, which were both denied by the district court. Alpert appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Whether there was sufficient service of process upon a defendant is an issue of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>Maiz v. Virani, </em>311 F.3d 334, 338, 340 (5th Cir. 2002). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s findings of fact underlying its disposition of a rule 60(b)(4) motion for clear error.\u201d <em>Goetz v. Synthesys Technologies, Inc., </em>415 F.3d 481, 483 (5th Cir.2005). The issue of whether or not service was proper in this case turns on the factual determination of whether Alpert\u2019s housekeeper was residing at his home at the time of service. After review of the record, we do not find that the court clearly erred in determining that Alpert\u2019s housekeeper was a \u201cperson of suitable age and discretion then residing\u201d in Alpert\u2019s home, thus satisfying the requirements for service of process under Rule 4(e)(2). In addition, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s Memorandum and Opinion entered on October 25, 2006, we agree that Alpert has failed to make the requisite showing that the judgment should be set aside under either Rule 59(e) or 60(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b277-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
