Because Spencer had prior drug convictions, he was sentenced to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for count three and to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 210 months for counts one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-25\">On appeal, Spencer contends that the Government impermissibly manipulated his sentence by delaying his arrest until after a second controlled purchase so that the aggregate quantity of cocaine exceeded 50 grams. Sentencing factor manipulation \u201coccurs when a defendant, although predisposed to commit a minor or lesser offense, is entrapped in committing a greater offense subject to greater punishment.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>44 F.3d 1271, 1280 n. 29 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). There is nothing in the record suggesting that the Government\u2019s conduct was outrageous. Spencer\u2019s participation in the two drug transactions constituted conduct properly considered in determining Spencer\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-26\">Spencer also asserts that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on his prior drug convictions. Spencer cannot challenge his prior 1987, 1989, and 1990 state convictions that were alleged in the information filed by the Government because the prior convictions occurred more than five years before the date of the information filed by the Government. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>After briefs had been filed, Spencer filed motions requesting this court to appoint new counsel and strike Spencer\u2019s current appeal brief. Attorneys appointed by the district court under the Criminal Justice Act \u201cshall continue to provide representation on appeal unless relieved by court order.\u201d Fifth Circuit Plan Under the Criminal Justice Act, \u00a7 5(B). \u201cCounsel may be relieved upon a showing that there is a conflict of interest or other most pressing circumstances or that the interests of justice otherwise require relief of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Spencer has not made the required showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
