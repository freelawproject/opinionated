We review the dismissal de novo. <em>Manufactured Home Communities Inc. v. City of San Jose, </em>420 F.3d 1022, 1025 (9th Cir.2005). We may affirm on any proper ground supported by the record regardless of whether the district court reached the issue or relied on alternative grounds. <em>Wright v. Riveland, </em>219 F.3d 905, 912 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-21\">Res judicata applies whenever three elements are satisfied: (1) an identity of claims, (2) a final judgment on the merits, and (3) privity between the parties. <em>Tahoe Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg\u2019l Planning Agency, </em>322 F.3d 1064, 1077 (9th Cir.2003). Bauerle\u2019s previous action<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was dismissed with prejudice and thus constituted a final judgment on the merits. <em>See Stewart v. U.S. Bancorp, </em>297 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir.2002). Because Bauerle is the sole plaintiff in both suits, \u201c[t]here can be no question that [she] already had a complete opportunity to litigate [her] claims.\u201d <em>See Tahoe Sierra Pres. Council, </em>322 F.3d at 1081. However, the identity of claims element is not satisfied as to all of Bauerle\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-22\">\u201cIdentity of claims exists when two suits arise from \u2018the same transactional nucleus of facts.\u2019\u201d <em>Stratosphere Litig. L.L.C. v. Grand Casinos, Inc., </em>298 F.3d 1137, 1142 n. 3 (9th Cir.2002). The majority of Bauerle\u2019s claims arise out of her being prosecuted for and convicted of two misdemeanors in Tucson City Court and are identical to those raised in her prior federal suit. This includes her claims that Arizona\u2019s misdemeanor statutes violate the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, since her previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>ous complaint included identical\u2014though less detailed\u2014allegations. <em>See Tahoe Sierra Pres. Council, </em>322 F.3d at 1078. Since all three elements of res judicata are satisfied for these claims, they were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Identity of claims is not satisfied for Bauerle\u2019s claims regarding three issues: (1) the adjudication of her previous federal action by Judge Jorgenson; (2) her unsuccessful state appeal and the alleged inadequacy of the state appeals process; and (3) her arrest for trespassing and subsequent proceedings. Claims regarding each of these issues arise out of separate transactional nuclei of facts that did not exist at the time Bauerle filed her amended complaint in the prior suit. Application of res judicata to these claims was therefore error. <em>See id. </em>at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The claims against Judge Jorgenson are barred by judicial immunity, as they involve only her rulings. <em>See Meek v. County of Riverside, </em>183 F.3d 962, 965-66 (9th Cir.1999). Dismissal of these claims was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">All but one of Bauerle\u2019s claims related to her failed state appeal and the trespassing charge are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, which prohibits claims \u201cbrought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). We affirm the dismissal of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine does not, however, prohibit district court review of claims alleging the unconstitutionality of a statute or rule since such claims \u201cdo not require review of a judicial decision.\u201d <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 487, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>see also id. </em>at 483-84, 103 S.Ct. 1303. Bauerle\u2019s claim that Arizona\u2019s service rules are unconstitutional thus falls outside the scope of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">However, with respect to this claim, the complaint specifically names only the State of Arizona as defendant. States are not \u201cpersons\u201d subject to suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, <em>Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), and the State of Arizona has not consented to this suit. Dismissal of this claim was therefore proper. <em>See Powelson v. United States, </em>150 F.3d 1103, 1105 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b637-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-23\">. This is Bauerle\u2019s third action arising out of her conviction on two misdemeanors in Tucson City Court. Prior to this suit, Bauerle filed nearly identical suits in both state and federal court. Our analysis focuses on the res judicata effect of the previous federal action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
