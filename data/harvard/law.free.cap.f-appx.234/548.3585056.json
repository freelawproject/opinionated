So construed, the motion is granted. The Clerk shall file petitioner\u2019s response, received on May 8, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-27\">Respondent\u2019s opposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied reopening where petitioner failed to demonstrate that the notice of petitioner\u2019s removal hearing was improper. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that BIA denials of motions to reopen or reconsider are reviewed for abuse of discretion); <em>Farhoud v. INS, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>122 F.3d 794, 796 (9th Cir.1997). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
