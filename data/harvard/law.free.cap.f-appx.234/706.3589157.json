The IJ pretermitted Petitioners\u2019 applications, concluding that they lacked any qualifying relatives for purposes of the hardship determination and rejecting Petitioners\u2019 contention that their United States citizen grandchildren should qualify in light of their legal guardianship and custody and the de facto parent-child relationship between them. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AAqa\">Petitioners\u2019 grandchildren do not meet the statutory definition of \u201cchild\u201d set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(b)(1) and therefore cannot be considered qualifying relatives for purposes of cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(1)(D). Petitioners\u2019 argument that their grandchildren qualify as orphans under \u00a7 1101(b)(1)(F)(i) is unavailing. <em>Moreno-Morante v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 F.3d -, No. 05-75376, 2007 WL 1775209 (9th Cir., 2007) (filed concurrently with this disposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">Petitioners\u2019 alternative argument that their grandchildren should be considered qualifying relatives in light of the de facto parent-child relationship between them is also unsupported by the law. <em>Id.; see INS v. Hector, </em>479 U.S. 85, 90,107 S.Ct. 379, 93 L.Ed.2d 326 (1986) (per curiam) (\u201cCongress, through the plain language of the statute, [has] precluded this functional approach to defining the term \u2018child.\u2019 \u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-14\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b737-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
