Musyoki sought a continuance of his removal proceeding pending an appeal by his wife of the denial of an 1-130 petition filed on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-17\">Musyoki argues that he was unfairly surprised by the denial of the 1-130 petition. He contends that his wife did not have an opportunity to respond to the denial or to lodge an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-22\">The grant of a motion to continue lies within the sound discretion of the IJ, who may grant the motion for good cause shown. <em>Witter v. INS, </em>113 F.3d 549, 555-56 (5th Cir.1997); <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. An \u201cimmigration judge\u2019s decision denying a motion for a continuance will not be reversed unless the alien establishes that [the] denial caused him actual prejudice and harm and materially affected the outcome of his case.\u201d <em>In re Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 356-57 (BIA 1983). To show prejudice, \u201cthe alien must specifically articulate the particular facts involved or the evidence which he would have presented, and otherwise fully explain how the denial of his motion fundamentally changed the result reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-23\">Given that the 1-130 petition filed by his wife had been denied, the petition was not \u201cprima facie approvable.\u201d <em>In re Garcia, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 653, 656 (BIA 1978). Musyoki did not show good cause for the grant of a continuance before the IJ. <em>See Witter, </em>113 F.3d at 555-56. On his appeal to the BIA, Musyoki failed to show that the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance prejudiced him or that it had a material affect on the outcome of his case. <em>See In re Sibrun, 18 I. &amp; N. </em>Dec. at 356-57. Musyoki has not shown that the BIA abused its discretion in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion a continuance. <em>See Witter, 113 </em>F.3d at 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-24\">Musyoki also contends that the denial of a continuance violated his right to due process given that his wife is entitled to appeal the denial of the 1-130 petition. Musyoki has not specified facts or evidence that would suggest that the 1-130 petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>filed on his behalf by his spouse was improperly denied or that the outcome would be different on appeal. Musyoki\u2019s due process claim fails because he has not made \u201can initial showing of substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b269-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
