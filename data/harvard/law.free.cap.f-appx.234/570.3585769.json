We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Buono v. Norton, </em>371 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>F.3d 543, 545 (9th Cir.2004), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Ray\u2019s First Amendment claims because the prison\u2019s regulation of books containing material that threatens or is detrimental to the security, safety, and discipline of the facility, was reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. <em>See Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 92-93, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Ray\u2019s claim that prison staff violated his due process rights by failing to follow its rules for mail rejection, because Ray received notice of the rejection of the books, and administrative review of the rejections. <em>See Sorrels v. McKee, </em>290 F.3d 965, 972 (9th Cir.2002) (prisoners have a Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest in receiving notice that their incoming mail is being withheld by prison authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Because the district court properly dismissed Ray\u2019s federal claims, the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. <em>See Warren v. Fox Family Worldwide, Inc., </em>328 F.3d 1136, 1143 n. 7 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Ray\u2019s remaining contentions are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
