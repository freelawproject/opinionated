Flores-Meras was sentenced to thirty-nine months of imprisonment, and he now appeals his sentence. We vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-24\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b337-25\">Border patrol agents discovered Flores-Meras, a Mexican national, during a border patrol checkpoint inspection. Flores-Meras had previously been deported from the United States and had not applied for or received permission to re-enter from the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security. Flores-Meras pleaded guilty to violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-26\">The district court determined that Flores-Meras\u2019s base offense level was eight, increased the offense level by twelve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>because it found that Flores-Meras had a prior conviction for a \u201cfelony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was thirteen months or less,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) (2005), and then reduced the offense level by three for acceptance of responsibility. This calculation resulted in an offense level of seventeen. Given Flores-Meras\u2019s criminal history category of IV, the guidelines sentencing range was thirty-seven to forty-six months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Flores-Meras raised two objections to this sentencing guidelines range. First, he argued that the way in which 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 treats prior convictions is unconstitutional.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, he objected to the twelve level enhancement for having committed a prior felony drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The district court rejected both of these arguments and sentenced Flores-Meras to thirty-nine months of imprisonment. Flores-Meras timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">This court will \u201creview a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 682 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Flores-Meras argues that the district court erred in applying a twelve level enhancement for having a conviction for a prior \u201cfelony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) (2005). He asserts that the statute under which he was convicted punishes conduct that is broader than that covered by the sentencing guidelines definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d The guidelines define a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlW\">an offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0Z\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. (l)(B)(iv) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">The Colorado statute under which Flores-Meras pleaded guilty permitted conviction for possession of drugs with the intent to either sell or distribute them. Col.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-18-405(1)(a). The relevant Colorado statutory definition of \u201csale\u201d includes \u201ca barter, an exchange, or a gift, or an offer therefor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 18-18-403(1). As such, Flores-Meras asserts that one way in which someone could violate this statute would be by possessing drugs with the intent to <em>offer </em>to barter, exchange, or give them as a gift, but without the intent to actually sell or otherwise distribute them.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">This court has previously held that a statute permitting conviction for merely making an offer to sell drugs encompasses conduct outside of the guidelines definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 274 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Because it permits punishment for possession of drugs with the intent to offer to sell or give them away, but without the intent to actually sell or give them away, we conclude that a defendant can violate Col. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18\u201418\u2014405(l)(a) without committing a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">This conclusion does not end our inquiry, however. Even if the statutory definition of a crime includes conduct that does not fall within the guidelines definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d the court may look to certain other pieces of evidence in seeking to ascertain whether the defendant\u2019s conviction was for conduct covered under the guidelines definition. These documents include the charging document, plea agreement, plea colloquy transcript, and other judicial records regarding the factual basis of the plea. <em>Gonzales v. Due-nas-Alvarez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 815, 819, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The charging document, an information, is not in the record. The record does include a statement supporting Flores-Meras\u2019s plea of guilty (\u201cguilty plea statement\u201d), which he signed. Contained in this statement is the following sentence: \u201cI wish to plead guilty to the offense of Possession With Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance\u2014Schedule II, a Class III Felony, as set out in Count One of the Information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Following this statement, Flores-Meras continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">The elements of the offense of Possession With Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance\u2014Schedule II to which I am pleading guilty are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">1. That the defendant, Ricardo Flores-Meraz [sic],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">2. in the State of Colorado, County of Garfield, on or about December 7, 2004,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">3. knowingly possessed or attempted to possess,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-15\">4. with intent to sell or distribute</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-16\">5. methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">On the same page of the guilty plea statement is the following definition of \u201csale\u201d: \u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 means a barter, an exchange, or a gift, <em>or an offer therefor, </em>and each such transaction made by any person, whether as the principal, proprietor, agent, servant, or employee.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">The district court concluded, and the government urges on appeal, that Flores-Meras\u2019s statement that he wished to plead guilty to drug possession \u2018With Intent to Distribute\u201d constituted an admission that he possessed the drugs with an intent to distribute them, not sell them. On the government\u2019s view, this admission places his conviction within the guidelines definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d and thereby justifies the twelve level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-19\">Flores-Meras responds that this declaration in the guilty plea statement was merely a recitation of the title of the offense, rather than an assertion that he was pleading to a particular version of the statutory language. The government correctly points out that the statutory title of Col.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 18-18^405 is \u201cUnlawful distribution, manufacturing, dispensing, sale, or possession,\u201d not \u201cPossession With Intent to Distribute a Controlled Substance\u2014Schedule II.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">Flores-Meras also indicates that his purported \u201cadmission\u201d is followed by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>recitation of the elements of the crime, including \u201cintent to sell or distribute\u201d as well as a definition of \u201csale,\u201d which would be superfluous if Flores-Meras was specifically pleading to the possession with intent to distribute sub-species of the statute, rather than the statute as a whole. He argues that these inclusions rebut the notion that the previous sentence was a description of a narrower set of offense characteristics to which he was admitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We agree. Accordingly, we hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that Flores-Meras, in his guilty plea statement, specifically admitted to possession with intent to distribute. The Supreme Court has stated that \u201conce the court of appeals has decided that the district court misapplied the Guidelines, a remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes, on the record as a whole, that the error was harmless, <em>i.e., </em>that the error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992); <em>see also United States v. Davis, </em>478 F.3d 266 (5th Cir.2007) (relying on <em>Williams post-Booker </em>). This error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Flores-Meras\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED for resen-tencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\">. While raising this issue on appeal, FloresMeras concedes that relief is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). We reject this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b338-17\">. More recently, in <em>United States v. </em>Ford, - F.3d -, 2007 WL 1501745 (5th Cir. May 24, 2007) (petition for panel rehearing pending), this court examined a statutory provision that (1) permitted punishment for drug possession with the intent to deliver the drugs and (2) defined \"delivery\u201d of drugs to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>merely making an offer to sell drugs. The court vacated the defendant's sentence, holding that the statute of conviction was broader than the guidelines definition of a \"controlled substance offense,\u201d which for relevant purposes is the same as the guidelines definition of a \"drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 2007 WL 1501745 *4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
