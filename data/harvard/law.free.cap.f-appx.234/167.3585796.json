Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court fully complied with the requirements of Fed. R.Crim.P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Because Gambrell did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court fully complied with the mandate of Rule 11 in accepting Gambrell\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Gambrell has filed a supplemental pro se brief asserting, first, that the district court failed to comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(a) because it did not give him a sufficient opportunity for allocution. We find that this claim is belied by the transcript of the sentencing hearing. Gambrell also claims that the district court incorrectly calculated his criminal history score and failed to give him credit for time served on a related state sentence. Because Gambrell did not file objections to the presentence report and did not object at sentencing, we review these claims for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Our review of the record discloses no error, let alone plain error, in the district court\u2019s calculation of Gambrell\u2019s advisory sentencing guideline range.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b198-7\"> To the extent Gambrell asserts a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we decline to review this issue on direct appeal as counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness is not apparent from the record. <em>See United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1203, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
