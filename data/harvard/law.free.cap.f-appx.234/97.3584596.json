Anderson appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint as barred by the applicable two-year statute of limitations. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Anderson v. Humphres, </em>No. 1:06-cv-00653 (E.D.Va. Dec. 7, 2006). We deny Anderson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
