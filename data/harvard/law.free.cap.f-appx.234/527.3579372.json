Marcum appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction his action alleging constitutional violations and common law tort claims in connection with numerous state court proceedings in which he was a party. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Noel v. Hall, </em>341 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.2003), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-27\">The district court properly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because Marcum\u2019s action amounted to a forbidden \u201cde facto appeal\u201d of state court judgments and raised claims that are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with those state court decisions. <em>See Noel, </em>341 F.3d at 1163-65; <em>see also Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005) <em>(Rooker-Feldman </em>bars \u201cstate-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced\u201d from asking district courts to review and reject those judgments.).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Contrary to Marcum\u2019s contention, sua sponte dismissal was appropriate. <em>See Scholastic Entm\u2019t, Inc. v. Fox Entm\u2019t Group, Inc., </em>336 F.3d 982, 985 (9th Cir. 2003) (\u201cWhile a party is entitled to notice and an opportunity to respond when a court contemplates dismissing a claim on the merits ... it is not so when the dismissal is for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3) (\u201cWhenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The district court\u2019s dismissal should have been without prejudice, however. <em>See Frigard v. United States, </em>862 F.2d 201, 204 (9th Cir.1988) (per curiam) (dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be \u201cwithout prejudice so that a plaintiff may reassert his claims in a competent court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Marcum\u2019s remaining contentions are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">We therefore remand with instructions for the district court to amend its judgment to reflect that dismissal was without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b557-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
