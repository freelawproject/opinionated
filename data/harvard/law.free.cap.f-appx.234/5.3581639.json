Fed\u2019n Employment &amp; Guidance Serv., </em>409 F.3d 565, 569 (2d Cir.2005). On appeal, Gelin raises only his retaliation claims, arguing that (1) he was retaliated against when his performance appraisal was \u201cdowngraded,\u201d and (2) his September 2001 suspension was a retaliatory act.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">First, Gelin cannot make out a prima facie case of retaliation with respect to the 2001 performance appraisal, because he cannot show that he has suffered an adverse employment action. <em>See Galabya v. N.Y. City Bd. of Educ., 202 F.3d 636, </em>640 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cA plaintiff sustains an adverse employment action if he or she endures a \u2018materially adverse change\u2019 in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d); <em>see also Jute v. Hamilton Sundstrand Corp., </em>420 F.3d 166, 173 (2d Cir.2005) (explaining that an adverse employment action is one of the elements of a plaintiffs prima facie case). Even assuming that an appraisal alone could be sufficient to constitute an adverse employment action, <em>but see Sanders v. N.Y. City Human Res. Admin., </em>361 F.3d 749, 756 (2d Cir.2004) (rejecting claim based on a negative performance evaluation where the plaintiff \u201coffered no proof that th[e] evaluation had any effect on the terms and conditions of her employment\u201d), Gelin\u2019s appraisal does not suffice because it is overwhelmingly positive: Gelin was given the highest overall rating\u2014\u201coutstanding.\u201d Moreover, Gelin\u2019s subjective belief that he was \u201cdowngraded\u201d is irrelevant. <em>See Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe. Ry. Co. v. White, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (\u2018We refer to reactions of a <em>reasonable </em>employee because we believe that the provision\u2019s standard for judging harm must be objective.\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>Williams v. R.H. Donnelley, Corp., </em>368 F.3d 123, 128 (2d Cir.2004) (noting that an employee\u2019s \u201csubjective, personal disappointments do not meet the objective indicia of an adverse employment action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">With respect to the retaliatory suspension claim, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Gelin can make out a prima facie claim of retaliation, because defendant has articulated a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the suspension, Gelin still bears the burden of showing that \u201cretaliation was a substantial reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>See Jute, </em>420 F.3d at 173. As Gelin has not provided sufficient evidence on which to base an inference that his supervisors suspended him in order to retaliate for his protected activity, we conclude that Gelin cannot prevail on his retaliatory suspension claim. <em>Cf. Bickerstaff v. Vassar Coll, </em>196 F.3d 435, 448 (2d Cir.1999) (noting that we must \u201ccarefully distinguish between evidence that allows for a reasonable inference of [retaliatory animus] and evidence that gives rise to mere speculation and conjecture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-11\">For the reasons set forth above, the decision of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
