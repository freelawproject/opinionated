We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition. We review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-23\">Petitioner did not challenge the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) adverse credibility finding before the BIA. Accordingly, we will not consider that issue now. <em>Rodas-Mendoza v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1237, 1240 (9th Cir.2001) (per curiam) (holding that failure to raise issue before administrative body amounts to waiver). With the adverse credibility decision intact, Petitioner cannot establish eligibility for asylum, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (burden of proof for asylum claims), or for relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). <em>See Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922-23 (9th Cir.2006) (affirming where only the discredited testimony of the petitioner and general country conditions reports supported his claim under CAT). Thus, this case is distinguished from <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Petitioner\u2019s second motion based on the belatedly-presented argument that he did not receive the first BIA decision. Petitioner did not satisfy his obligation of notifying the <em>BIA </em>of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>change of address, though he was repeatedly informed that he must do so. <em>See Sequeirara-Solano v. INS, </em>104 F.3d 278, 279 (9th Cir.1997). Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it attributed the alleged failure of delivery to Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b626-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
