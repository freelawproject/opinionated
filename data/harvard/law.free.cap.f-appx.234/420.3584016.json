We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-17\">We review the denial of a motion to recuse for abuse of discretion. <em>In re Focus Media, Inc., </em>378 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir.2004). Although the Metcalfs have identified several ex parte contacts between the bankruptcy judge, his law clerk and counsel for appellees, those communications related to purely procedural matters. The Metcalfs have adduced no evidence that those communications affected the bankruptcy judge\u2019s rulings. There was therefore no factual basis on which the bankruptcy judge\u2019s \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 929 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a)), and the district court properly affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-19\">The Metcalfs\u2019 cross claims are all based upon the allegation that the appellees entered into an agreement to transfer Adbox\u2019s assets to Accenta with the \u201cactual intent to avoid paying the attorneys\u2019 fee award and to hinder, delay, or defraud Metcalf as a secured creditor of Adbox, with a secured interest in all of the stock of Adbox, and without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer.\u201d Because fraudulent transfer of assets out of the bankruptcy estate harms all creditors to the estate, and not just the Metcalfs individually, only the bankruptcy trustee has standing to bring claims based on the allegedly fraudulent transfer. <em>Estate of Spirtos v. One San Bernardino County Superior Court Case, </em>443 F.3d 1172, 1176 (9th Cir.2006); <em>accord Nat\u2019l </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Am. Ins. Co. v. Ruppert Landscaping Co., Inc., </em>187 F.3d 439, 441-42 (4th Cir.1999). Even if, as the Metcalfs assert, they are the only creditors with a security interest in Adbox\u2019s stock, that fact makes no difference because the bankruptcy code creates no exception for such a circumstance. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 323. Thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
