We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-21\">Where the BIA adopts and affirms the decision of the IJ, we review the decision of the IJ as the final agency determination. <em>See Smolniakova v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1037, 1044 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-22\">We review an adverse credibility finding under the substantial evidence standard and may reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-23\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Kumar testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>fied that his declaration was in his own words, but the declaration contains descriptions that are almost identical to a public source news article about the events leading up to Kumar\u2019s asserted arrest. This issue goes to the heart of Kumar\u2019s claim and supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962, 964 (9th Cir.2004). Kumar has not shown that the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Malhi v. I.N.S., </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">In the absence of credible testimony, Kumar did not establish eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review Kumar\u2019s arguments concerning procedural due process violations and ineffective assistance of counsel. Kumar failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as to these issues because he did not raise them before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b826-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
