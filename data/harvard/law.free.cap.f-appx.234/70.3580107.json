Although Haste concedes he has two predicate offenses for armed career criminal status under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000), he asserts that a third conviction for felonious possession of a weapon of mass destruction under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 14-288.8 (2005) should not have been considered a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. Haste asks the case be remanded to the district court for re-sentencing without an ACCA enhancement. We affirm Haste\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-19\">As acknowledged by Haste, this court held in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>246 F.3d 330 (4th Cir.2001), that possession of a sawed-off shotgun is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 4B1.1 (2006). The language of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2 (a)(2) the court construed in <em>Johnson </em>(\u201cor otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d) is identical to the language of the ACCA\u2019s definition of violent felony at issue in this case. <em>See Johnson, </em>246 F.3d at 334 n. 5; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-20\">Based on our holding in <em>Johnson, </em>we conclude that a conviction under that provision constitutes a predicate \u201cviolent felony\u201d conviction under the ACCA. Accordingly, we affirm Haste\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
