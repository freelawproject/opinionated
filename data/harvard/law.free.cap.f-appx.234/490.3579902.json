Arcand\u2019s fraud involved the telemarketing sale of bogus \u201ccredit card protection\u201d packages to credit cardholders. On Arcand\u2019s first appeal, we affirmed his conviction, but remanded his case to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Arcand, </em>139 Fed.Appx. 912, 913 (9th Cir.2005). At resentencing, the district court found that Arcand\u2019s mail fraud caused about $12.9 million in losses and enhanced Arcand\u2019s sentence by fifteen levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1(b)(P) (2000). The district court sentenced Arcand to 120 months imprisonment with three years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-24\">Arcand argues that his sentence violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. We disagree. The judicial finding of loss amount did not violate the Constitution because the judicial fact-finding took place under a guidelines scheme rendered advisory by <em>Booker. United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The government did not need <em>to </em>allege the loss amount in the indictment because Ar-cand\u2019s sentence did not exceed the maximum sentence prescribed by Congress for the crime of which he was convicted. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 243 n. 6, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). Finally, the district court was not required to find that the government established the loss amount beyond a reasonable doubt and could permissibly apply the clear and convincing evidence standard. <em>See United States v. Staten, </em>466 F.3d 708, 717-18 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Kilby, </em>443 F.3d 1135, 1140 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Arcand also argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that the loss amount was approximately $12.9 million. We disagree. The Sentencing Guidelines provide that, for the purpose of calculating the loss attributable to the defendant,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANa\">the loss need not be determined with precision. The court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information. This estimate, for example, may be based on the approximate number of victims and an estimate of the average loss to each victim, or on more general factors, such as the nature and duration of the fraud and the revenues generated by similar operations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 cmt. n. 9; <em>see United States v. Robinson, </em>94 F.3d 1325, 1327 (9th Cir.1996). Because the district court conservatively and reasonably estimated the substantial loss caused by Arcand to thousands of cardholders, the district court did not clearly err in calculating the loss amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Finally, we hold that Arcand\u2019s sentence resulted from a reasonable application of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the sentencing range established by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b520-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
