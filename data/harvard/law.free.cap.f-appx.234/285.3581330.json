Neira contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knowingly participated in the conspiracy and that he knowingly possessed cocaine. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-21\">We conduct our sufficiency review under the familiar rational jury standard, <em>see United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir.2003), and in light of the elements required to prove the offenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>See United States v. Dean, </em>59 F.3d 1479, 1485 (5th Cir.1995) (conspiracy elements); <em>United States v. Onick, </em>889 F.2d 1425, 1429 (5th Cir.1990) (possession elements). Mere presence at a crime scene or close association with conspirators is insufficient to support an inference of knowing participation in a conspiracy. <em>United States v. Tenorio, </em>360 F.3d 491, 495 (5th Cir.2004). Here, however, there was ample other evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict showed the following: on April 27, 2004, David Silva and Monica Canch\u00f3la were arrested with a one-kilogram package of cocaine supplied by Alejandro Rios. The intended recipients, Natanael Montoya, Oscar DeLeon, and Jos\u00e9 Ruiz, were arrested at the same time. Silva had delivered drugs for Rios to all three men on prior occasions. Neira\u2019s telephone number was on a piece of paper taken from Montoya and in the directory of one of the telephones retrieved from Montoya\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Law enforcement set up a controlled delivery, instructing Silva to contact Rios. As Rios was unable to reach Montoya, he instructed Silva to call Neira and gave him Neira\u2019s telephone number. Silva told Neira that he was calling on behalf of Rios, and Neira never questioned Silva. Ultimately, Silva met Neira in a McDonald\u2019s parking lot, at Neira\u2019s instruction. Neira signaled his presence by turning on his ignition. Neira insisted that Silva follow him to a house owned by Robert Ramirez, where Neira was arrested. Throughout the hours and minutes leading up to the arrest, there were numerous telephone calls between Rios, Silva, and Neira.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">A search of Ramirez\u2019s house revealed large quantities of cocaine, firearms, scales, bar coded plastic bags, and other paraphernalia consistent with drug distribution. Neira\u2019s truck likewise contained bar coded plastic bags similar to those found in Ramirez\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">After the arrest, Rios repeatedly attempted to reach Neira by telephone. During the two months prior to the arrest, there were 102 telephone contacts between telephones associated with Rios and Neira\u2019s telephone, although both Neira and his wife denied knowing Rios.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Neira argues that the evidence is consistent with innocence, pointing to the testimony of his wife that cash found in Neira\u2019s house came from sales of cars and a rodeo, that Neira used the plastic bags for goat vitamins and hypodermic needles, that Neira was going to see Ramirez regarding some concrete work, that Montoya had been referred to Neira for some car rims, and that Neira received calls from persons in Mexico regarding car sales. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of all the evidence considered in context amply supports the jury\u2019s finding that Neira was a knowing participant in a drug conspiracy. <em>See Dean, </em>59 F.3d at 1485-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">For similar reasons, a rational jury could have found that Neira knew of the cocaine and had constructive possession of it. The evidence regarding the arrangements made by Rios and Silva for the cocaine\u2019s delivery, the numerous telephone calls between Rios, Silva, and Neira in the hours leading up to the arrest, and the instructions by Neira to Silva to meet him at a McDonald\u2019s and then to follow him to Ramirez\u2019s house, all support the jury\u2019s possession verdict. <em>See United States v. Brito, </em>136 F.3d 397, 410 (5th Cir.1998) (defining constructive possession); <em>see also Gonzalez v. United States, </em>372 F.2d 127, 127-28 (5th Cir.1967) (defendant who directed delivery of drugs had constructive possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
