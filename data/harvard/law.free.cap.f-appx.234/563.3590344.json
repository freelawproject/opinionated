We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also Ramirez-Alejandre v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 365, 382 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cUnder BIA procedure, a motion to remand must meet all the requirements of a motion to reopen and the two are treated the same.\u201d). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petitions for review in No. 05-73355. We deny the petition for review in No. 06-71584.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Garcia-Vargas failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Garcia-Vargas\u2019 contention that the agency misapplied the law and disregarded the evidence of hardship is not supported by the record and does not amount to a colorable due process claim. See <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Traditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute color-able constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Garcia-Vargas\u2019 motion to remand because he failed to demonstrate that the evidence he submitted was previously unavailable. <em>See Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Garcia-Vargas\u2019 motion to reopen as untimely because it was filed more than eight months after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i) (motion to reopen must be filed within ninety days of final order of removal), and Garcia-Vargas did not demonstrate that he was entitled to equitable tolling, <em>see Iturribarria, </em>321 F.3d at 897 (deadline for filing motion to reopen can be equitably tolled \u201cwhen a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception, fraud, or error, as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Garcia-Vargas\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">No. 05-73355: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">No. 06-71584: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b593-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
