We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-25\">Trujillo does not dispute that section 212(i) applies to his case. We are not persuaded that the IJ used an incorrect standard in applying that statutory provision. As a result, we are without jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary denial of relief. <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997) (\u201cThe plain language of [the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), as amended by Pub.L. No. 104-302, 110 Stat. 3656 (1996) (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) ] precludes our direct review of the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary decisions.\u201d); <em>Sotelo v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 968, 970 (9th Cir.2005) (treating petitions formerly brought under the IIRI-RA\u2019s transitional rules as being filed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the permanent provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 as required by \u00a7 106(d) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, 311 (2005) (\u201cRIDA\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Athough RIDA restored jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we still lack jurisdiction over discretionary decisions such as whether to grant relief under section 212(i). <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 654 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201cSection 106 [of RIDA] does not restore jurisdiction over discretionary determinations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Similarly, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s exercise of its discretionary authority to reopen sua sponte under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1156-60 (9th Cir.2002). The IJ was exercising his discretion in determining whether to reopen proceedings to consider possible \u00a7 212(i) relief to a new qualifying relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We are not persuaded that a colorable due process violation has been raised merely because, in denying the motion to reopen, the BIA failed to mention or consider the prior IJ\u2019s comment that \u201c[i]f [Petitioner\u2019s wife] becomes a lawful permanent resident ... it might be possible to revisit [Petitioner\u2019s] waiver case at that time since he would have another qualifying relative to whom he might be able to show the requisite hardship.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (rejecting attempt to recast an unreviewable discretionary decision as a reviewable due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"****\">\n<p id=\"b627-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
