The district court found that Robinson\u2019s criminal history qualified him for sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), and sentenced Robinson to 235 months of imprisonment under the then-mandatory federal sentencing guidelines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>We previously affirmed Robinson\u2019s conviction, but vacated his sentence, and remanded for resentencing in accordance with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At resentencing, the district court sentenced Robinson to 220 months\u2019 imprisonment, fifteen months below the advisory guidelines range. Robinson again appeals, contending that the district court misapplied <em>Booker, </em>that the prosecutor improperly \u201cvouched\u201d to the court during sentencing regarding prior charged conduct, and that the district court erred in sentencing Robinson under the ACCA, on the basis that the district court faded to properly apply 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Robinson first asserts that the district judge misapplied the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker, </em>noting that the error was predicated on \u201cimproper vouching\u201d by the prosecutor during sentencing. He contends that by calling attention to the facts underlying the instigation of the federal charges against him, the prosecutor influenced the district court to give Robinson a harsher sentence. The statements to which Robinson objects were made at both the original sentencing hearing, as well as the resentencing hearing, and related to Robinson\u2019s prior arrest and trial for attempted murder in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which trial ended in a hung jury. Robinson alleges that the Government erred in asking the district court to consider a charge for which Robinson had never been convicted, and asserts the district court gave improper consideration to facts that were collateral to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Robinson\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">As Robinson did not challenge the prosecutor\u2019s statements at the sentencing hearing, we review his claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). \u201cVouching occurs when the prosecutor indicates a personal belief in the credibility or honesty of a witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>455 F.3d 248, 259 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1997)). In this case, the prosecuting attorney\u2019s comments did not convey, either implicitly or explicitly, an expression of the prosecutor\u2019s or the Government\u2019s opinion as to the veracity of any witness. <em>See Sanchez, </em>118 F.3d at 198 (prosecutor\u2019s comment not an expression of opinion). Rather, the remarks in this case were made to the judge at sentencing, and had nothing to do with any witness. As such, we find that the comments were not vouching at all, as alleged by Robinson. In addition, the statements were not improper, as the prosecutor simply was stating the procedural posture of the case in the state system and asserting that Robinson would have been retried but for the federal conviction. None of the statements to which Robinson objects were of the prosecutor\u2019s personal beliefs regarding any witness, about the merits of the dismissed charges, nor about the outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>a second state trial had one occurred. Moreover, it has been established even before <em>Booker </em>was decided that courts are free to consider dismissed or even acquitted conduct when formulating a sentence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Martinez, </em>136 F.3d 972, 979 (4th Cir.1998).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a)(1), Robinson\u2019s criminal history and characteristics properly are subject to the district court\u2019s consideration when formulating a sentence. Accordingly, we find that Robinson failed to demonstrate error with regard to the prosecutor\u2019s statements relative to the state court charges, and, as discussed more fully below, we further find that the district court fully complied with <em>Booker </em>in resentencing Robinson under an advisory guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Robinson again asserts district court error in enhancing his sentence under the ACCA, basing his challenge on the district court\u2019s alleged failure to consider all the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in determining his sentence. Specifically, he claims the district court failed to consider a series of exhibits he presented to it, including letters from his parents, his high school diploma, and evaluations and certificates of completion from various drug rehabilitation programs and educational and vocational classes, challenges the district court\u2019s failure to grant his requested departure due to the alleged over representation of the seriousness of his criminal history, his young age, and his drug and alcohol abuse history, and he claims the district court failed to \u201cadequately\u201d factor in the need to provide him with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">In imposing a sentence after <em>Booker, </em>the district court must engage in a multi-step process. First, the court must correctly determine, after making appropriate findings of fact, the applicable guideline range. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). Next, the court must \u201cdetermine whether a sentence within that range ... serves the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and, if not, select a sentence [within statutory limits] that does serve those factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). The district court must articulate the reasons for the sentence imposed, particularly explaining any departure or variance from the guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c) (West Supp.2006); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 &amp; n. 5. The explanation of a variance sentence must be tied to the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and must be accompanied by findings of fact as necessary. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 455-56. The district court need not discuss each factor set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) \u201cin checklist fashion\u201d; \u201cit is enough to calculate the range accurately and explain why (if the sentence lies outside it) this defendant deserves more or less.\u201d <em>United States v. Dean, </em>414 F.3d 725, 729 (7th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). This court reviews the sentence for reasonableness, considering \u201cthe extent to which the sentence ... comports with the various, and sometimes competing, goals of \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432-33 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Here, the district court sentenced Robinson below his properly calculated Guideline sentencing range. Despite Robinson\u2019s arguments, the record reveals that the district court considered the record, the presentence report, defense counsel\u2019s memorandum and argument in support of various departures, and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). The district court enunciated each \u00a7 3553(a) factor it considered prior to imposing sentence on Robinson, and specifically referred to <em>Booker </em>at the re-sentencing hearing. The court stated that while it had considered Robinson and his family, the important factors it needed to consider were to protect the community, to show the seriousness of the offense, and to deter future criminal activity by Robinson. It rejected Robinson\u2019s requests for further departure. The district court noted that Robinson demonstrated much anger during the sentencing hearing, and recommended that Robinson be admitted to a mental health treatment program, as the Bureau of Prisons determined to be appropriate. It further included in its sentencing ruling that Robinson participate in a vocational/educational program, as well as a substance abuse program.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The record reveals that the district court was familiar with Robinson\u2019s history and background, it had sentenced Robinson originally, and it was familiar with the details of Robinson\u2019s case from the initial sentencing hearing. Robinson\u2019s presen-tence report outlined his offense conduct and his criminal history. Finally, Robinson and his attorney took the opportunity to argue at length at resentencing in support of a shorter sentence and about the strength of the evidence against Robinson, providing additional information about the nature and circumstances of his circumstances and his offense prior to the district court\u2019s imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We find that the district court here considered all the appropriate statutory and constitutionally mandated factors, as well as the information and arguments presented to it in the course of sentencing, and it explained its reasons for imposing a sentence below the Guidelines range in deciding Robinson\u2019s sentence. The district court fully complied with the mandates of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes, </em>and find that Robinson\u2019s sentence was reasonable and not in violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. <em>See Green, </em>436 F.3d at 456-58 (discussing standards to determine whether sentence is reasonable). <em>See generally United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324-25 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Robinson\u2019s sentence. Given that Robinson is represented by counsel, we deny his motion to file a supplemental <em>pro se </em>brief, and further deny his motion to relieve his attorney. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-20\">. The probation officer assigned Robinson a base offense level of twenty-four based <em>U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\"USSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2004), because Robinson had at least two prior felony convictions for controlled substance crimes, and then applied an enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B1.4, bringing his total offense level to thirty-three, with an attendant guidelines range of 235 to 293 months\u2019 imprisonment. The probation officer also assigned Robinson a criminal history category of VI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\">. We also found to be without merit Robinson\u2019s claim that the district court erred under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it found him eligible for sentencing under the ACCA based on predicate convictions that had neither been found by a jury nor admitted by him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\">. Robinson\u2019s contention that by calling attention to the facts underlying the instigation of the federal charges against him, the prosecutor influenced the district court to give Robinson a harsher sentence, is directly contradicted by the district court\u2019s statement at sentencing that its reason for sentencing Robinson to fifteen fewer months than it had when it originally sentenced Robinson was because it wanted to give him credit for the time he served in the State institution while awaiting trial on the attempted murder case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
