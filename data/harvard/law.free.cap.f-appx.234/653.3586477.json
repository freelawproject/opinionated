We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to deny a \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>Sass v. Cal. Bd. of Prison Terms, </em>461 F.3d 1123, 1126 (9th Cir.2006), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-22\">The State contends that we lack jurisdiction because there is no federally protected interest in parole release in California, and thus, Wyatt has failed to state a federal claim. This contention is foreclosed. <em>See id. </em>at 1127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-23\">Wyatt contends that the California Board of Prison Terms\u2019 (the \u201cBoard\u201d) decision to deny him parole violated his due process rights. We conclude that the Board based its decision on several findings which were \u201csupported by some evidence in the record\u201d with some indicia of reliability, and that the Board\u2019s decision was not otherwise arbitrary. <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985); <em>Irons v. Carey, </em>479 F.3d 658, 662 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, and did not involve an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
