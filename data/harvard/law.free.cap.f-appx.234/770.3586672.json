We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-25\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Because petitioner contended that she was persecuted based on her Pentecostal faith, but demonstrated during her asylum interview that she was unfamiliar with a basic practice of her faith, i.e., the practice of speaking in tongues, her asylum claim fails. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>Because petitioner failed to demonstrate that she is eligible for asylum, it follows that she did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">Substantial evidence also supports denial of petitioner\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b800-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
