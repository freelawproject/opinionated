The immigration judge (IJ) rejected their application based on a finding that Teoudeo and Ngambo were not credible. The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">In their petition for review, Teoudeo and Ngambo assert that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not supported by the record and that the IJ and BIA failed to consider probative evidence in support of their claims. However, Teoudeo and Ngambo have not specified how the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not supported by the record or what evidence the IJ and BIA failed to consider. Because Teoudeo and Ngambo have failed to properly brief the issue of the district court\u2019s credibility determination, they have abandoned the only relevant issue for review. <em>See Brinkmann v.
