We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-22\">We review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s credibility determination for substantial evidence, upholding it unless the evidence compels reversal. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006). The BIA concluded after a careful review that the IJ had not clearly erred in finding Ghazar-yan\u2019s testimony not credible. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3) (limiting to clear error BIA\u2019s review of factual findings such as credibility determinations). The IJ identified specific and cogent reasons for disbelief, which were substantial and related to the heart of Ghazaryan\u2019s asylum claim, and after giving Ghazaryan a chance to explain the inconsistencies, addressed the explanations and found them wanting. <em>See id. </em>The IJ\u2019s reasons are supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>record, and substantial evidence supports the credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Because we deny the petition for review of the denial of asylum, we necessarily affirm the denial of withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Ghazaryan\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence that the IJ and BIA found was not credible, and therefore we deny the petition for review on that ground as well. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
