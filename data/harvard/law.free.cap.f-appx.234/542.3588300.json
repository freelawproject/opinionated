The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) did not abuse its discretion when it denied petitioner\u2019s motion, concluding that the motion was numerically barred if the BIA construed it as a motion for reconsideration, and that the motion was insufficient if the BIA construed it as a motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), (b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(2). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-22\">The motion for stay of voluntary departure, filed after the expiration of the voluntary departure period, is denied. <em>Garcia v.
