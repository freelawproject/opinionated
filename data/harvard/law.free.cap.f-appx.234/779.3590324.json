We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-23\">Coss-Vasquez contends that the district court plainly erred by concluding that his prior California conviction for throwing a substance at a vehicle was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4B1.2. Because we conclude that Cal.Veh.Code \u00a7 23110(b) contains as one of its elements the use of physical force against another, <em>we </em>reject this contention. See <em>United States v. Grajeda-Ramirez, </em>348 F.3d 1123, 1125 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-24\">Coss-Vasquez also contends that the district court erred by failing to depart downward based on over-representation of his criminal history and cultural assimilation. Because Coss-Vasquez failed to raise the issue of over-representation of criminal history before the district court, it is deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Quesada, </em>972 F.2d 281, 283-84 (9th Cir. 1992). A review of the record establishes that the district court took into account the appropriate sentencing factors, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>cultural assimilation, and that the sentence imposed is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1131 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2314, 164 L.Ed.2d 832 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AWE\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
