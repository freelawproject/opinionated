R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b668-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Vardan Serob Daghbashyan, a native and citizen of Armenia, petitions for review of the denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Where the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">We review for substantial evidence the determination that a petitioner is ineligible for relief and will grant the petition only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Daghbashyan has not shown past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. The single detention and beating that Daghbashyan suffered in 1996 does not compel the conclusion that he suffered past persecution. <em>See Gu v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1014, 1019\u201420 (9th Cir.2006) (three-day detention and beating did not compel finding of past persecution). As to fear of future persecution, Daghbashyan failed to provide direct and specific evidence that the Armenian government ever became aware of his political activities in the United States. <em>See Sanchez-Trujillo v. I.N.S., </em>801 F.2d 1571, 1580 (9th Cir.1986). The acts against Daghbashyan\u2019s family members were not based on a pattern closely tied to petitioner. <em>See Arriaga-Barrientos v. I.N.S., </em>937 F.2d 411, 414 (9th Cir.1991). Moreover, the evidence offered by Daghbashyan fails to establish a pattern and practice of persecution against individuals similarly situated to Daghbashyan. <em>Cf. Sanchez-Trujillo, </em>801 F.2d at 1577-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Because Daghbashyan\u2019s asylum petition fails, his petition for withholding of removal also fails. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-12\">Daghbashyan\u2019s claim for protection under the CAT fails because he has not shown that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be tortured if he returns to Armenia. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>see also Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1221 (9th Cir .2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b668-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
