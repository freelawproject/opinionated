Selna, United States District Judge for the Central District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b750-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-25\">Defendant-Appellant Mark William Hamilton timely appeals his conviction following a jury trial for one count of aggravated sexual abuse, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(a) and 2241(c). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-26\">The district court properly excluded testimony from a police officer who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>would have testified that the defendant\u2019s brother told the officer that the victim, a minor, had recanted her allegation that the defendant inappropriately touched her. The brother\u2019s statements to the officer were hearsay and did not fall under any enumerated hearsay exception. Hamilton\u2019s contention that the statements were admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 807 because they had \u201ccircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d equivalent to those of the enumerated hearsay exceptions is meritless. Likewise, Hamilton\u2019s Confrontation Clause contention is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Even if the district court improperly applied Federal Rule of Evidence 412 to exclude the victim\u2019s statement to her doctor, its exclusion did not violate the Confrontation Clause because the statement\u2019s exclusion was neither \u201carbitrary\u201d nor \u201cdisproportionate to the purposes [Rule 412 is] designed to serve,\u201d particularly as there was no evidence that the victim\u2019s prior accusation was false. <em>See United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998) (quoting <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 56, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987)); <em>see also Hughes v. Raines, </em>641 F.2d 790, 792-93 (9th Cir.1981) (holding that exclusion of prior false accusations of rape did not violate the Confrontation Clause because the purposes justifying exclusion outweighed the evidence\u2019s probative worth). In light of the overwhelming evidence against Hamilton, if there was error, it was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Finally, the district court did not err by refusing a lesser included instruction for abusive sexual contact in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)(5). To establish that Hamilton committed aggravated sexual abuse, the government had to prove an element\u2014contact \u201cnot through the clothing\u201d\u2014that the government would not have to prove to establish that Hamilton committed the lesser offense of abusive sexual contact. <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(2)(D) (requiring that any touching occur \u201cnot through the clothing\u201d) <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246(3) (requiring that any touching occur either \u201cdirectly\u201d <em>or </em>\u201cthrough the clothing\u201d). Hamilton, however, has not presented evidence that any touching occurred through clothing. Thus, the jury could not rationally find that he committed the lesser offense without also finding that he committed the greater offense, aggravated sexual abuse under \u00a7 2241(c). <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>937 F.2d 1469, 1476 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b750-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
