Ezra of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-16\">1. Sufficient evidence existed to support the jury\u2019s determination that Harris committed the bank robbery. While identification of the defendant as the perpetrator is always an essential element that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, in-court identification by an eyewitness is not necessarily required, and identity may be inferred from the facts and circumstances in evidence. <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>48 F.3d 1477, 1490 (9th Cir.1995). Here, the direct and circumstantial evidence\u2014which included positive photo-identification by two eyewitnesses, an in-court identification as the person depicted in the photos selected as representing the perpetrator, Harris\u2019s possession of a bandana identified as that worn by the robber, testimony that Harris twice asked whether a bank teller would hand over money if presented with a demand note, testimony that Harris was not detected when he left the work furlough facility through a fire escape, the close proximity of the facility to the bank, and Harris\u2019s alteration of his appearance four days after the robbery\u2014more than sufficed to support the jury\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">2. Harris failed to adduce any evidence that the absence of African Ameri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>cans from the venire was the result of a systematic exclusion in the jury selection process by the Hawaii district court. Therefore, he failed to establish a prima facie case of a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury consisting of a representative cross-section of his peers. <em>See Duren v. Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S.Ct. 664, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979) (establishing a three-part test to establish a pri-ma facie violation of the right to a jury venire which is representative of a cross-section of the community); <em>Randolph v. California, </em>380 F.3d 1133, 1141 (9th Cir. 2004) (\u201cA showing that a jury venire un-derrepresents an identifiable group is, without more, an insufficient showing of systematic exclusion under the third prong of the <em>Duren </em>test.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">3. The district court expressly considered Harris\u2019s history and characteristics and the need for the sentence imposed. <em>See United, States v. Mix, </em>457 F.3d 906, 912 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that a judge need not delineate on the record all of the considerations listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) so long as he accurately calculates the Guidelines range and explains the sentence). Harris\u2019s sentence\u2014which falls within the Guidelines range\u2014was reasonable in light of his extensive criminal history and the circumstances surrounding his offense, including the fact that he committed the crime while assigned to a residential work furlough program ostensibly preparing to reenter the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b706-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
