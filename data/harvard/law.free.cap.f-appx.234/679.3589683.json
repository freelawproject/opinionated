We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review an adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence, and will uphold the IJ\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Huang\u2019s testimony was both internally inconsistent and inconsistent with his asylum application. Because the inconsistencies went to the heart of Huang\u2019s asylum claim\u2014persecution based on his opposition to China\u2019s family planning policies\u2014substantial evidence supports the denial of asylum. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962-64 (9th Cir.2004). Since the IJ had a basis to doubt Huang\u2019s credibility, the IJ could properly consider the lack of documentary evidence to corroborate Huang\u2019s claim. <em>See id. </em>at 964.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Because Huang failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Pursuant to <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 749-50 (9th Cir.2004), Huang\u2019s motion for stapy of removal included a timely request to stay voluntary departure. Because the stay of removal was continued based on the government\u2019s filing of a notice of non-opposition, the voluntary departure period was also stayed, nunc pro tunc, as of the filing of the motion for stay of removal and this stay will expire upon issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>by 9th Cir.
