The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied on all but Gregg-Wilson\u2019s First Amendment claim and advised Gregg-Wilson that failure to file specific objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Gregg-Wilson failed to object specifically to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-20\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequences of noncompliance. <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Gregg-Wilson has waived appellate review by failing to file specific objections after receiving proper notice. <em>See Page v. Lee, </em>337 F.3d 411, 416 n. 3 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-21\">With regard to the First Amendment claim, the district court entered a subsequent order granting summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>ment in favor of Defendants on the ground that Defendants\u2019 interest in ensuring the efficient operation of the vocational school outweighed Gregg-Wilson\u2019s right to free speech. Because Gregg-Wilson did not challenge this finding in his informal brief filed in this court, he has waived appellate review of that issue. <em>See </em>4th Cir. R. 34(b) (\u201cThe Court will limit its review to the issues raised in the informal brief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">For these reasons, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
