We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>court\u2019s dismissal for failure to state a claim, <em>Steckman v. Hart Brewing, Inc., </em>143 F.3d 1293, 1295 (9th Cir.1998), and we review for abuse of discretion its denial of a motion to amend the complaint, <em>Ward v. Circus Circus Casinos, Inc., </em>473 F.3d 994, 1000 (9th Cir.2007). We may affirm on any ground supported by the record. <em>Steckman, </em>143 F.3d at 1295. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The district court properly dismissed the Wassons\u2019 claim under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. <em>See Aldabe v. Aldabe, </em>616 F.2d 1089, 1092 (9th Cir.1980) (holding that criminal statutes do not give rise to civil liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The Wassons\u2019 remaining claims were barred under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971) because a criminal prosecution against the Wassons is pending in state court, the criminal prosecution implicates important state interests in prosecuting felony child abuse, and the state court proceedings afford the Wassons an adequate opportunity to raise federal claims. <em>Fresh Int\u2019l Corp. v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., </em>805 F.2d 1353, 1357-58 (9th Cir.1986); <em>H. C. ex rel. Gordon v. Koppel, </em>203 F.3d 610, 613 (9th Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cYounger </em>abstention may be raised sua sponte at any point in the appellate process.\u201d). Moreover, the record does not support any exceptions to the application of <em>Younger </em>abstention. <em>See Baffert v. Cal. Horse Racing Bd., </em>332 F.3d 613, 621 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the district court should have abstained under Younger and dismissed the Wassons\u2019 action without prejudice. <em>See Beltran v. State of California, </em>871 F.2d 777, 782-83 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Because the Wassons\u2019 action is barred by <em>Younger, </em>amendment of their complaint would have been futile. <em>See Saul v. United States, </em>928 F.2d 829, 843 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Appellants\u2019 remaining contentions are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of the Hobbs Act claim, vacate the district court\u2019s judgment as to the remaining claims, and remand with instructions to dismiss the remaining claims without prejudice pursuant to <em>Younger v. Harris.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-12\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b559-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
