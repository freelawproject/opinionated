Anderson\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the MJ\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. </em>Taylor; 117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-18\">This court lacks jurisdiction over the interlocutory orders denying Anderson\u2019s request for a temporary restraining orders, denying his request to issue subpoenas, to terminate parties, and to consolidate cases. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; <em>Faulder v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 741, 742 (5th Cir.1999). Anderson\u2019s argument that the MJ abused his discretion by denying his request for injunctive relief fails because he does not show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d which would compel a reversal of the MJ\u2019s ruling. <em>White v. Carlucci </em>862 F.2d 1209, 1211 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">Anderson does not address the MJ\u2019s analysis that he was able to adequately represent himself. Anderson argues only that counsel should be appointed to bring claims of medical malpractice. Because he fails to identify any error in the MJ\u2019s analysis, the argument is abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-20\">Anderson has not shown that he -will present a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number><em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1988). Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24; 5th Cir. 42.2. Anderson\u2019s motion for a transcript at the expense of the Government is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The dismissal of this appeal counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Anderson is CAUTIONED that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR TRANSCRIPT DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
