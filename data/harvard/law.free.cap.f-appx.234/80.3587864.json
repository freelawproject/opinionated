For the following reasons, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s April 19, 2006 judgment remitting Sullivan\u2019s victim restitution and remand with instructions that the district court reinstate its original order of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-17\">On March 13, 2003, the district court entered a criminal judgment sentencing Sullivan to three years probation on each single count of \u201c[ejonspiracy to commit bank fraud, mail theft <em>&amp; </em>embezzlement,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, and \u201c[t]heft of U.S. mail &amp; aiding &amp; abetting,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, 1708, to run concurrently. (J.A. 53). Of relevance on appeal, the criminal judgment also ordered Sullivan to pay $110,764.79 in victim restitution pursuant to the MVRA in minimum monthly installments of $50. Sullivan subsequently violated certain conditions of her probationary sentence. As a result, on April 19, 2006, the district court entered a criminal judgment revoking Sullivan\u2019s probation and sentencing her to three months\u2019 imprisonment. Of relevance on appeal, the criminal judgment also ordered that \u201cALL OUTSTANDING MONETARY PENALTIES RESULTING FROM THE INITIAL ENTRY OF JUDGMENT ENTERED IN THIS CASE ARE ORDERED REMITTED.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (J.A. 24). The district court commented at Sullivan\u2019s probation-revocation hearing that it ordered such total remittance \u201ccon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>sidering [Sullivan\u2019s] inability to make even minor payments along with assisting her children on the amount of restitution ordered, ... it would be a hardship to require her to pay any ... further payments on restitution.\u201d (J.A. 19).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The government noted a timely appeal from the district court\u2019s April 19, 2006 criminal judgment. On appeal, the government challenges the district court\u2019s re-mittitur of the total outstanding victim restitution Sullivan had been ordered to pay pursuant to the MYRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The government argues that, because the district court imposed the victim restitution order pursuant to the MYRA, the district court lacked the authority to remit it on the ground of Sullivan\u2019s dire financial situation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Our recent decision in <em>United States v. Roper, </em>462 F.3d 336 (4th Cir.2006), is dis-positive. <em>Roper </em>was a consolidated appeal of two separate appeals by the government concerning two unrelated criminal defendants, Carlton Roper and George Butler, who had violated the terms of their supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 337. Following the district court\u2019s respective revocations of their supervised release, the district court, on the ground of impossibility to pay, respectively remitted the total amount of the victim restitution previously imposed pursuant to the MVRA. <em>Id. </em>As in the instant appeal, the government argued that, under the MYRA, district courts lack the authority to remit victim restitution previously ordered pursuant to the MVRA unless such remittitur is ordered to offset \u201cany amount later recovered as compensatory damages for the same loss by the victim\u201d in a civil proceeding, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(j)(2). <em>Roper, </em>462 F.3d at 337-38. We agreed with the government, holding that the plain language and structure of the MVRA, as well as our case law, compelled the conclusion that the district court erred in remitting Roper\u2019s and Butler\u2019s victim restitution orders. <em>Id. </em>at 337-340. Accordingly, we reversed the district court\u2019s remittitur orders and remanded with instructions to reinstate the victim restitution orders. <em>Id. </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Like <em>Roper, </em>the district court in the instant appeal remitted Sullivan\u2019s victim restitution order because of her dire financial situation. Under <em>Roper, </em>such remitti-tur constituted error. Moreover, we have reviewed Sullivan\u2019s remaining arguments in defense of the district court\u2019s remittitur and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s April 19, 2006 judgment remitting Sullivan\u2019s victim restitution order and remand with instructions that the district court reinstate its original restitution order under the MVRA. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b111-13\"> The parties agree that Sullivan\u2019s outstanding balance of victim restitution was $109,589.79.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
