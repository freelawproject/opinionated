Under the terms of his plea agreement, Contee stipulated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>was a career offender, and waived \u201cany right to appeal from any sentence within or below the advisory guidelines range resulting from an adjusted offense level of 84 .At sentencing, the district court determined that the adjusted offense level was 34, then departed downward to offense level 30 for substantial assistance on the government\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The resulting guideline range was 168-210 months. Our review of the record discloses that Contee was advised about the waiver provision at the guilty plea hearing, and that his waiver was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 402 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We therefore dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b89-14\"> The court declined to depart downward further because of mitigating factors argued by defense counsel or on the ground that criminal history category VI over-represented Con-tee\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
