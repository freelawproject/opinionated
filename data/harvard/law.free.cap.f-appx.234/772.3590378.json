We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">The BIA\u2019s decision relied on the IJ\u2019s reasoning and reviewed the IJ\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(3). We look to the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cas a guide to what lay behind the BIA\u2019s conclusion,\u201d <em>Kozulin v. INS, </em>218 F.3d 1112, 1115 (9th Cir.2000), and review the IJ\u2019s findings for substantial evidence, <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245 (9th Cir.2000). We will grant the petition for review only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">The BIA and IJ identified \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d to support an adverse credibility determination that \u201cgo to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004). The record supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Chinaryan submitted a fraudulent letter, purportedly from her Armenian pastor, regarding her membership in the Pentecostal church. She also made inconsistent statements about whether she had been baptized. In addition, the IJ justifiably found that Chinaryan was unable to recall straightforward facts in her testimony, notably including the name of the pastor in the United States at whose church she claimed to have been attending for three and a half years. Finally, Chinaryan failed to present corroborating evidence to support her testimony, such as documentation from her hospital stay or records of her alleged correspondence with members of the National Assembly. <em>Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1090 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[If] the trier <em>of </em>fact either does not believe the applicant or does not know what to believe, the applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony can be fatal to his asylum application.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Because Chinaryan is ineligible for asylum, she necessarily fails to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir .2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">Because Chinaryan\u2019s claim under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) is based on the same evidence as her asylum claim, we affirm the denial of CAT relief as well. <em>Id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
