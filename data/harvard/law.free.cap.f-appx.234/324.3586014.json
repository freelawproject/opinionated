He contends that the 50-month sentence he received is unreasonable and that the presumption of correctness given to sentences within the guideline sentencing range effectively has reinstated a mandatory guideline sentencing scheme, undermining the decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He further argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court gave undue weight to his criminal history while not giving enough weight to his personal history and family situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">The evidence presented to the district court by Silva-Veliz related to the nature and circumstances of his crime and his personal history and characteristics. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The district court acknowledged the arguments made in mitigation but found that Silva-Veliz\u2019s criminal history justified the sentence imposed. Thus, the district court\u2019s comments reflect concerns regarding recidivism. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">A sentence within the guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The district court was not required to explicitly address the sentencing factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) in Silva-Veliz\u2019s case because the sentence imposed was within a properly calculated guidelines range, and the record reflects a reasoned basis for the sentence imposed. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014 - \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Silva-Veliz has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable or that this court should not defer to the district court\u2019s determinations at sentencing. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">Silva-Veliz argues next that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face and as applied in his case in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Silva-Veliz\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Silva-Veliz contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.2005). Silva\u2014Veliz properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
