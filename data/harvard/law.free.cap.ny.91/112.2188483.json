S. \u201c seven-thirty notes,\u201d which were sold by plaintiffs, on the same day, to various parties; in December, 1867, plaintiffs were notified that they were forgeries, and, on the same day, notified defendants, and demanded back the money paid. Defendants\u2019 reply was -that if plaintiffs \u201c had to pay for those notes, or brought them evidence that they were counterfeit, they would pay.\u201d In January, 1868, plaintiffs were sued for the money received by them for three of the notes ; they gave notice to defendants, and requested them to defend: this they did not do. Judgment was obtained against plaintiffs in March, 1878; after the verdict therein they notified defendants of the result. Plaintiffs paid the judgment and also paid back the money received for the other note. <em>Held, </em>that defendants having been afforded an opportunity to take back the paper, or establish its value, and not having done either, could not be heard to say that it was unreasonable for the plaintiffs to await the result of a judicial determination as to the character of the paper, or, that having done so, they were not entitled to recover back the money this determination showed they had paid without consideration.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b138-8\">(Argued Deceember 11, 1882;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ao2\">decided January 16, 1883.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-9\">Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the Supreme Court, in the first judicial department, entered upon an order made the first Monday of May, 1881, which affirmed a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, entered upon a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-10\">This action was brought to recover of the defendants, who composed the firm of Winslow, Lanier &amp; Co., the value of four instruments purporting to be treasury notes of the United States, commonly known as seven-thirty notes, alleged to have been sold by the'defendants to the plaintiffs on or about the 22d of September, 1867, which notes were afterward discovered to be counterfeits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>At the close of the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs, which, so far as material, is set forth in the opinion, the defendants called a single witness, who proved that they received the notes in question from the First National Bank of Indianapolis, and sold them for the account of that bank, and shortly after the sale of the notes paid over the proceeds to the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">At the close of the evid\u00e9nce the defendants\u2019 counsel moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds: First, that the evi-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">dence was insufficient to identify the notes. Second, that there was not sufficient proof that the notes were forged or spurious. Third, that the plaintiffs were negligent in discovering the spuriousness of the notes. Fourth, that in respect of three notes the plaintiffs adopted them byrefusing to redeem when notified of their spuriousness by parties to whom they had sold them. Fifth. The defendants were discharged and released from all' liability to the plaintiffs by reason of plaintiffs\u2019 long negligence and delay in making returns of said notes to defendants after discovery or notice of their spuriousness. Sixth, that there being no evidence of any fraud on the part of the defendants, or express warranty of the genuineness of said notes, the plaintiffs utterly failed to make out any cause of action against the defendants. Seventh, that the defendants were discharged from all liability to the plaintiffs by reason of the' plaintiffs\u2019 failure and neglect to make return or offer to make return of the said notes until after the defendants had remitted the proceeds thereof to their principal, the First National Bank of Indianapolis. The motion to dismiss the complaint on these grounds was denied and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-8\">The court directed the jury to render a verdict for the plaintiffs of $8,464.41, in which was included the costs in the judgment obtained against plaintiffs by Budge, Shiff &amp; Co., and the defendants\u2019 counsel duly excepted. The General Term ordered a reversal of the judgment, unless plaintiffs stipulated to deduct the said costs, in which case it was affirmed.

The rules laid down in relation to the payment by a debtor of an existing indebtedness in counterfeit bank bills, or other spurious paper, are applicable to cases of sales of public securities or bonds like that now before us. <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>6 Hill, 340 ; <em>Bank of U. S. </em>v. <em>Bank of Georgia, </em>10 Wheat. 333; <em>Kenny </em>v. <em>First Nat.

In the case of the sale of real or personal property under an implied warranty of title, the rule is well settled that the vendee may <em>\u201c </em>voluntarily yield possession to a claimant, and recover against the vendor on the implied warranty of title, upon showing that the claimant had title paramount.\u201d <em>(Sweetman </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>26 N. Y. 224; <em>Bordwell </em>v. <em>Collie, </em>45 id. 495 ; <em>Gillmault </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>4 Hill, 643 ; <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>5 id. 599 ; <em>Drew </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>30 N. H. 537.) The right of a vendee purchasing goods' or chattels with a warranty of quality, express or implied, to 'rescind the sale and return the goods, on account of a breach of the warranty, may -be lost by failure of the vendee to return the goods within a reasonable time. <em>(Grimaldi </em>v. <em>White, </em>4 Esp. 95; <em>Groning </em>v. <em>Mendham, </em>1 Stark. 257; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Appleby, </em>id. 477; <em>Milner </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>1 C. <em>&amp; </em>P. 15 ; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>29 N. Y. 258; <em>Smith </em>v. Mercer, 6 Taunt. 76; <em>Cocks </em>v. <em>Masterton, </em>9 B. &amp; C. 908.) A waiver to be- operative must be supported by an agreement founded on a valuable consideration, or the act relied on as a waiver must he such as to estop a party from insisting on performance of the contract, or forfeiture of the amount. <em>(Ripley </em>v. <em>\u00c6tna Ins. Co., </em>30 N. Y. 136.) Estoppels are not favored by the law and they <em>\u201c </em>must be certain to every intent, and not to be taken by argument or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>inference.\u201d (Co. Litt. 352; <em>Dezell </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>3 Hill, 215.) The promise ought to be explicit, and made out by clear and unequivocal evidence. <em>(Miller </em>v. Hackley, 5 Johns. 375.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-6\"><em>John E. Burrill </em>for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9W\">The judgment record in the case of Budge, Shiff <em>&amp; </em>Co. against the plaintiffs was binding on the defendants in respect to the question of counterfeit character. <em>(Heiser </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>Ct. of Appeals.) There was no negligence or unreasonable delay in the discovery of the spurious character of the notes, nor in the communication of that fact to the defendants, nor in the off\u00e9r to return the notes to them. <em>(Burrell </em>v. <em>Watertown Co., </em>51 Barb. 112-113; <em>Merkle </em>v. <em>Hatfield, </em>2 Johns. 455; <em>Canal B\u2019k </em>v. <em>B\u2019k of Albany, </em>1 Hill, 287; 2 Parsons on Notes, 601; 2 Daniel on Neg.

S. B\u2019k </em>v. <em>Georgia B\u2019k, </em>10 Wheat. 333.) There is in all sales of money securities an implied warranty of genuineness. <em>(Ross </em>v. <em>Terry, </em>63 N. Y. 613; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Judah, </em>6 Cow. 484; <em>Otis </em>v. <em>Cullum, </em>92 U. S. 447; <em>Littauer </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>72 N. Y. 506; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>45 id. 303; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Dagg, </em>2 T. &amp; C. 623.) An action for breach of warranty where the contract of sale has been executed may be maintained without any return or offer to return the subject of the contract. <em>(Rust </em>v. <em>Eckler, </em>41 N. Y. 488; <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>44 id. 156.) The fact that the defendants acted as the agents of the Indianapolis Bank in the' transaction is not material. <em>(Canal B\u2019k </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>1 Hill, 293; <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Buff. Co., </em>37 N. Y. 297; 1 Wait\u2019s Actions and Defences, 272-3; <em>Stover </em>v. <em>Flack, </em>41 Barb. 162; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Andrus, </em>6 Cow. 225.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b141-7\">Danforth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Apj\">Upon the pleadings, the questions were,, whether certain written instruments purporting to be obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tions of the United States, known as \u201c seventy-thirty \u201d notes, numbered respectively 16074, 160436, 68573, 140133, were in fact sold by the defendants to the plaintiffs, and if so, were they forgeries ? At the trial evidence was given by the plaintiffs upon these points, but the defendants controverted none of it, and we agree with the two courts by whom the facts in issue have been examined, that the testimony established the identity of the notes as those sold by the defendants, and it being unanswered, that there was no question upon which the opinion of the jury was necessary. The appellants, however, claim that the plaintiffs were negligent in not sooner detecting the forgery, and also in failing to return the notes. Bo authority is cited to the effect that one who sells as genuine, a forged note, can avoid his liability to refund because of delay by his vendee in detecting the forgery, or in giving notice of it. The duty of the vendee to make such examination, cannot be greater than was the duty of the vendor to make it, before he parted with the paper and received its price, nor will the mere lapse of time confirm his title to the pnrchase-money if the purchaser exercised reasonable diligence in giving notice after the forgery was ascertained. ( <em>Weiser </em>v. Denison, 10 N. Y. 68; <em>Bank of Commerce </em>v. <em>Union Bank, </em>3 id. 230; <em>Kingston Bank </em>v. <em>Eltinge, </em>40 id. 391; <em>Heiser </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>86 id. 614, opinion by Folgker, J.) This was done. The notes were purchased on the 24th of September, 1867, and sold by the plaintiffs on the same day\u2014the note Bo. 160-174 to Hatch, Foote <em>&amp; </em>Co., the others to Budge, Shiff <em>&amp; </em>Co. The first was redeemed at the treasury department, but after-wards found to be a forgery, and judgment recovered by the United States against Hatch, Foot <em>&amp; </em>Co. The others had again changed ow\u00faers, and on the 20th of December, 1867, the plaintiffs were notified that the coupons which became due in that month, were rejected by the government on the same ground. On that day the plaintiffs gave this information to the defendants, and demanded back the money paid. The reply was that if the plaintiffs <em>\u201c </em>had to pay for those notes, or brought them evidence that they were counterfeit, they would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>pay.\u201d Outhe30thof January, 1868, Budge, Shiff &amp; Go. sued these plaintiffs for money paid by them for the three notes and they gave notice to the defendants herein of that action, and requested them to defend. They did not do so. Budge, Shiff &amp; Co. obtained judgment in their suit March 26,1878. After the verdict and before entry of judgment plaintiffs notified defendants of the decision against them. The plaintiffs were also sued for like cause by Hatch, Foote <em>&amp; </em>Co., to recover the money paid for note Ho. 160174, and the plaintiffs after the entry of said judgment paid them and also the holders of the other notes. This was sufficient. The defendants were afforded an immediate opportunity either to take back the paper, or establish its value. Failing to do either, they cannot be heard to say that it was unreasonable for their vendees, to await the result of a judicial determination as to the character of the paper, before taking it back, or that having done so, they are not now entitled to the money which that determination shows was obtained from them without consideration. As we concur with the General Term upon these propositions \u2014decisive of the case\u2014it is unnecessary to add more.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">All concur except Rapallo, J., absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
