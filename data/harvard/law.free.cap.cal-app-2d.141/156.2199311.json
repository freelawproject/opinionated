No error in these proceedings is indicated or claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">He now appeals from this judgment and attempts to have an entire review of his former claims on appeal. This is not authorized under the form of the reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">In addition, he claims that under section 1262 of the Penal Code a further trial was not authorized since the reversal did not direct a new trial. We see no merit to this claim. Section 1262 of the Penal Code was amended in 1951 [Stats. 1951, ch. 1674, \u00a7 137] and now a reversal shall be deemed an order for new trial unless the appellate court shall otherwise direct. Any right to a new trial was particularly limited to arraignment for and pronouncement of judgment. This was rightfully accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-14\">Barnard, P. J., and Mussell, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
