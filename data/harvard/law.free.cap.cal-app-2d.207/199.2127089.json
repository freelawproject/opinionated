The first is from a judgment after the trial court sustained a demurrer to appellant\u2019s complaint without leave to amend. The second is from an order denying appellant\u2019s motion for payment of its creditor\u2019s claim, with interest from April 17, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The background of the litigation between the parties is this: Appellant sold lumber to Homer E. Adams and, upon the death of the latter in 1951, appellant presented its creditor\u2019s claim to the executrix of the estate of Adams. The executrix allowed the claim on March 24, 1952, and the probate judge approved the claim on April 17, 1952. The executrix was later relieved of her duties, and in connection with those proceedings she filed an account showing appellant\u2019s claim as a debt due from the estate. On March 4, 1954, the probate court entered its order settling the account of the executrix. The court made no order, however, for the payment of the claims of any creditors. In 1957, its claim still being unpaid, appellant filed a petition asking for an allowance of interest on the unpaid claim. This petition was opposed by the successor executor, Crocker-Anglo National Bank, but the court nevertheless entered its order awarding interest on appellant\u2019s claim \u201cat the rate of 7% per annum commencing thirty days after date of each invoice.\u201d The executor appealed and the order was reversed. (See <em>Estate of Adams, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 505 [345 P.2d 106].) Appellant then filed a complaint against the executor and the executor\u2019s attorney, in which it was alleged that on March 27, 1952, the executor\u2019s attorney orally represented and agreed that appellant\u2019s claim would bear interest at the rate of 7 per cent per annum from the date of approval of the claim. The complaint further alleged that this oral agreement was repudiated by the attorney for the executor \u201cjust prior to July 29, 1957.\u201d A second cause of action is alleged on an account stated, in which appellant prays for interest on its allowed claim from April 17, 1952. A third cause of action is stated against the executor\u2019s attorney for a claimed breach of warranty of authority, but no service of summons appears to have been made upon that defendant and the judgment here appealed from is in favor of the executor, Crocker-Anglo National Bank only. The defendant\u2019s general and special demurrer to the complaint was sustained without leave to amend, but \u201cwithout prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right to make a motion . . . for payment of the allowed and approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>claim ... in the principal sum of $9,422.04 or such portion thereof as the circumstances of the estate permit.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">We consider first the claimed oral representations of the executor\u2019s attorney to the effect that interest would be paid on appellant\u2019s claim. Even if such representations were made, they could not prevent the executor from asserting as a defense that by law no interest on the appellant\u2019s claim is due or payable. This is so because the probate court itself is the guardian of the estates of deceased persons, and neither the executor nor his attorney, as officers of the court, has any authority to make or agree to make any payment to a creditor not authorized by law.  It is presumed that a person dealing with an executor, as appellant claims to have done here, is aware of the limits of the executor\u2019s authority. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>Sanson, </em>24 Cal.App. 515 [141 P. 1060].)  Moreover, an executor may not be estopped to assert any legal defense available to him to protect the estate from an unauthorized claim. (Hurli<em>mann </em>v. <em>Bank of America, </em>141 Cal.App.2d 801 [297 P.2d 682]; <em>Fontana Land Co. </em>v. <em>Laughlin, </em>199 Cal. 625-626 [250 P. 669, 48 A.L.R. 1308]; <em>Estate of Lucas, </em>23 Cal.2d 454 [144 P.2d 340].)  It follows, therefore, that if under the law no interest is due on appellant\u2019s claim, none will arise, regardless of the claimed oral representation of the executor\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The decisive issue presented by the appeal from the judgment of dismissal is whether a creditor of an estate with an allowed and approved non-interest-bearing claim on file, is entitled to interest on the claim from <em>any </em>date prior to an order of the court directing the executor to pay the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The appellant\u2019s principal contention on this appeal is that the court settled the account of the executrix on March 4,1954, and approved its claim contained in that account; that the approval of the account gave appellant\u2019s claim the status of a judgment and hence the claim bears interest at 7 per cent from the date of the court\u2019s order. We find no statutory authority for the proposition that an order settling and allowing an interim or a final account of an executrix or an administrator constitutes a judgment upon any claim reported in such an account as an allowed and approved claim, or that such an order automatically starts the accrual of interest on such a claim.  It is the rule, affirmed in many cases, that if the creditor\u2019s claim is based on a non-interest-bearing debt, as it is here, interest arises only from the date when the court orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>payment of the claim to be made pursuant to Probate Code section 952. <em>(Estate of Adams, supra, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 505; <em>Estate of Girard, </em>110 Cal.App.2d 203 [242 P.2d 669]; <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>McNitt, </em>49 Cal.2d 79 [315 P.2d <em>1]; Estate of Bell, </em>168 Cal. 253 [141 P. 1179].) In <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>McNitt, supra, </em>49 Cal.2d 79 at 83 the court said: \u201cSection 730 of the Probate Code provides that a judgment against an executor conclusively establishes the validity of the claim for the amount of the judgment and that the executor must pay the amount ascertained to be due. Judgments ordinarily bear interest at the statutory rate. However, only after an order for payment is the executor obliged to pay any general claim against the estate (Prob. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 951, 952). This court said in <em>Estate of Bell, </em>168 Cal. 253, 258, 259 [141 P. 1179], '[I]t is settled by our decisions that the allowance of a claim against a solvent estate is not equivalent to an ordinary judgment. It is a judgment only in a qualified sense, and does not attain the force and dignity of an absolute judgment until an order of court is made directing the executor or administrator to pay it. Until then it is simply an acknowledged debt of the estate, bearing interest at the contract rate. It is only after such an order is made that it bears interest at the statutory rate. \u2019 And in <em>Estate of Girard, </em>110 Cal.App.2d 203, 204 [242 P.2d 669], the court stated that \u2018The only question presented to us is whether a non-interest-bearing debt of a decedent bears interest at the statutory rate from the date of the allowance and approval of the creditor\u2019s claim. We have concluded that under the existing statutory law it does not.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The fact that an allowed claim is reported to the court and approved by the court in its order settling the account of an executrix does not convert a non-interest-bearing claim into an interest-bearing one, for this can only be done, as the decided eases clearly establish, by an order for payment of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The appellant also complains that the trial court did not grant permission to amend its complaint. The complaint demanded interest from April 17, 1952, the date of the allowance of the claim by the judge. The appellant has argued on this appeal that it has a valid claim for interest from March 4, 1954, the date of the approval of the account of the executrix by the probate court. Since the decided eases clearly establish that interest arises on a non-interest-bearing claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>only from the date of an order for payment, and no order for payment has ever been made here, the proposed amendment could add no substance to the complaint. The appellant\u2019s demand was for interest on its claim, and since under the substantive law no liability to pay interest arises, no amendment to the complaint could change the result, and the court\u2019s order sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend was therefore proper. <em>(Routh </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>20 Cal.2d 488 [127 P.2d 1, 149 A.L.R. 215]; <em>Preder </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., </em>116 Cal.App. 17 [2 P.2d 223]; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach, </em>19 Cal.App.2d 676 [66 P.2d 167]; <em>Saint </em>v. <em>Saint, </em>120 Cal.App. 15 [7 P.2d 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Appellant\u2019s final complaint is against the order of the probate court denying its motion for payment of its claim, together with interest from March 4, 1954. There is no merit in this portion of the appeal. Appellant\u2019s claim to interest has been disposed of by our ruling on the appeal from the judgment herein. It follows, therefore, that the probate court was correct in its refusal to make any order for the payment of interest on appellant\u2019s claim.  Nor is there any substance in the appeal from that portion of the order denying payment of the principal of appellant\u2019s claim. Section 952 of the Probate Code provides in part that upon settlement of an executor\u2019s account, and after the time to file or present claims has expired, the court shall order the payment of debts \u201cas the circumstances of the estate permit.\u201d Section 950 of the Probate Code establishes the order of priority for payment of debts and charges against a decedent\u2019s estate. Appellant\u2019s claim falls within the very last class of debts to be paid. There is no showing in the record before us that the \"circumstances of the estate\u201d permit the payment of any claims, or that there are sufficient funds in the hands of the executor to pay the claims and charges of all creditors who by law are entitled to receive payment of their claims before appellant is entitled to be paid. We must presume that the evidence presented at the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion was adequate to support the court\u2019s determination that the circumstances of the estate did not then warrant any order for the payment of claims, and in the absence of some showing that the condition of the estate permits the payment of all claims having priority over appellant\u2019s claim, the order appealed from must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The judgment of dismissal is affirmed; the order denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>appellant\u2019s motion for payment of its creditor\u2019s claim with interest from April 17, 1952 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Draper, P. J., and Devine, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 24, 1962. Tobriner, J., did not participate therein. Schauer, J., and White, J., were of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
