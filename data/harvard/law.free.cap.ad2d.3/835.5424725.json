The appeal is from a judgment entered after trial, before an Official Referee, dismissing the complaint on the merits. The Official Referee found that appellant was not a creditor at the time of the transfers, there then being no arrears in the payment of rent under the lease. Judgment unanimously affirmed, with costs. No opinion. Present \u2014 Wenzel, Acting P. J., Murphy, Ughetta, Hallinan and Kleinfeld, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
