Memorandum: The evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to defendant\u2019s participation in the crimes charged. The testimony of the People\u2019s witnesses to the effect that defendant stood across the street from the scene of the crime, looking from side to side, was discredited on cross-examination. The only other testimony involving defendant as a \u201c lookout \u201d came from an admitted participant in the crime in replying \u201c yes \u201d to a question by the court which contained three distinct propositions. This witness immediately corrected his testimony in this regard and repeatedly asserted defendant\u2019s innocence, notwithstanding extensive cross-examination. The opinion of the court, as displayed in its colloquy with counsel for the defendant, may well have given the impression that the court felt defendant was guilty. Furthermore, the charge of the court, relating to the possibility that the defendant was a \u201clook-out\u201d, the question of defendant\u2019s asserted intoxication and the right of defendant to remain silent, was prejudicial and furnishes additional grounds for reversal. In charging defendant\u2019s right not to testify the court said: \u201cIf he did not choose to take the stand, that is his business.\u201d Such a statement impaired the rule that no presumption is created against the accused by his failure to testify in his own behalf. It has been said that \u201cthe force of the proposition should not be weakened and destroyed with the jury by qualifying words.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>156 N. Y. 253, 266; see, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Forte, </em>277 N. Y. 440.) All concur. (Appeal from a judgment of Erie Trial Term, convicting defendant of the crimes of burglary, third degree, and grand larceny, second degree.) Present\u2014 Vaughan, J.
