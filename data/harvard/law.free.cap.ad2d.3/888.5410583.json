Certain findings of fact disapproved and reversed and new findings made. Memorandum: This is a consolidated action for a separation sought by the respondent husband on the ground of abandonment, and by the appellant wife on the ground of cruel and inhuman treatment. We agree with the learned Official Referee that no such conduct on the part of the husband was shown as would entitle appellant to a separation. \u201cThat the parties are not mated is no ground for separation. Occasional strife, lack of domestic harmony or even mutual aversion between husband and wife are not enough. There must be proof that the acts complained of fall within the statute.\u201d <em>(Avdoyan </em>v <em>Avdoyan. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>265 App. Div. 763, 766; <em>Straub v. Straub, </em>208 App. Div. 663.) \u201c The fact that incompatibility exists and that a husband and wife find it impossible to live in harmony, while no doubt furnishing justifiable reasons as between themselves for separating, does not meet the requirements for a judicial separation fixed by the statute and the policy of the State. A spouse may be unfit to live with as such, because of habits, character or temperament, but unless [one of the grounds enumerated in Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1161 is established] * * the court has no power to decree separation\u201d. <em>(Averett </em>v. <em>Averett, </em>189 App. Div. 250, 252.) We are satisfied that the cruel and inhuman treatment of appellant by respondent was not established. It does not follow, however, that the latter is entitled to a separation on the ground of unjustifiable abandonment. \u201c Cruel and inhuman treatment is not the only <em>\u2018 </em>justification \u2019 which may be pleaded in defense to an action for separation predicated upon allegations of abandonment \u201d. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>296 N. Y. 168, 171.) We believe that the relations which existed between the parties for a substantial period of time, and respondent\u2019s attitude toward his wife, were such that she was justified in leaving him and establishing her own home. In other words, we find that the defendant sustained her defense of justification within the provisions of section 1163 of the Civil Practice Act. However, in our opinion the quantum of proof was such that it did not rise to the necessary level to justify the granting of a judgment of separation based upon cruel and inhuman treatment as set forth in defendant\u2019s counterclaim and in our opinion this phase of the ease was correctly decided by the Official Referee. Neither party having established the right to a decree, they must be left as they were <em>(Bohmert </em>v. <em>Bohmert, </em>241 N. Y. 446; <em>Thiele </em>v. <em>Thiele, </em>277 App. Div. 1025). The custody and maintenance of their infant daughter may nevertheless be determined (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 1170-a). Under all the circumstances disclosed by this record, we believe that the sum which respondent is directed to contribute towards the infant\u2019s support should be increased to $500 per month effective as of the date of service of an amended judgment. All concur. (Appeal by defendant from part of judgment of Ontario Supreme Court, awarding separation to the plaintiff husband and dismissing the wife\u2019s counterclaim, and awarding custody of the infant daughter to the wife, and directing payment for the support of the child.)
