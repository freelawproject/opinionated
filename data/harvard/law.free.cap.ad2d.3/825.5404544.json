Counsel\u2019s explanation of the two and one-half years\u2019 delay in bringing the case on for trial, due to moving his office and misplacing the file, does not satisfy the requirements of reasonableness called for by section 181 of the Civil Practice Act and rule 156 of the Rules of Civil Practice. Further, plaintiffs fail to present facts indicating a meritorious cause of action. Concur \u2014 Peek, P. J., Breitel, Frank, Yalente and McNally, JJ.
