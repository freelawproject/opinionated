Proc., \u00a7 1021.5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when it confesses error in response to a petition for writ of mandate challenging the municipality\u2019s action. In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that a municipality may be considered an opposing party under such circumstances and that the trial court did not err in concluding that the municipality in this case was an opposing party and awarding private attorney general fees to respondents. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding respondents attorney fees for certain work performed prior to the filing of the petition in this case, that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>court erred in awarding respondents costs in light of their failure to file a memorandum of costs as required under the California Rules of Court, and that respondents are entitled to appellate attorney fees in an amount to be determined on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">A. <em>Respondents\u2019 petition for writ of mandate and appellants\u2019 confession of error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In November 2012, respondents Animal Protection and Rescue League, Friends of the Seals, Ellen Shively, Deborah Saracini, Shannon Player, Robb Meade, Marilies Schoepflin, Dorota Valli, and Jerry Homa (collectively APRL) brought a petition for writ of mandate against appellants City of San Diego and its planning commission (the City),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> coupled with a request for injunctive and declaratory relief. In its petition, APRL noted that the present litigation was related to a long-running dispute concerning whether the City should maintain a year-round guideline rope at the La Jolla Children\u2019s Pool for the purpose of protecting harbor seals from humans. APRL sought an order requiring the City to vacate and set aside the planning commission\u2019s denial of a permit for the guideline rope and to reinstate the findings of a hearing officer in support of the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Approximately three months later, the City filed an answer in which it confessed error and conceded that the \u201cPlanning Commission erred when it denied the Site Development Permit for an annual rope barrier.\u201d The City stated that it did \u201cnot oppose lawful writ relief, including a Court order directing that the denial of a Site Development Permit be set aside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">B. <em>Friends of the Children\u2019s Pool\u2019s participation in the case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">On March 12, 2013, APRL filed an ex parte application for an order to show cause seeking entry of judgment in the case. In the application, APRL stated that \u201c[bjecause related case <em>Friends of Children\u2019s Pool </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, </em>case number 37-2013-0003894-CU-WM-CTL will be made moot by APRL\u2019s writ petition being granted, this party [(Friends of the Children\u2019s Pool)] will likely wish to be heard as well.\u201d The following day, the trial court held a hearing on APRL\u2019s application and granted Friends of the Children\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Pool (FOCP) the right to file an opposition to APRL\u2019s anticipated filing of a motion for entry of judgment on the writ petition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">APRL filed a motion for entry of judgment on its writ petition on March 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">FOCP filed an opposition to APRL\u2019s motion for entry of judgment on March 29. That same day, the City filed a nonopposition to APRL\u2019s motion for entry of judgment in which it noted its confession of error, and stated, \u201cCity therefore does not oppose [APRL\u2019s] motion for entry of judgment granting writ relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">A few days later, FOCP filed an ex parte application for leave to file a complaint in intervention. APRL filed an opposition and the trial court held a hearing on the application. At the hearing, the City orally opposed FOCP\u2019s application to intervene. The trial court denied FOCP\u2019s request to intervene in the case as a party, but indicated that it would consider FOCP\u2019s opposition to the motion for entry of judgment as an amicus curiae brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The City filed a reply to FOCP\u2019s amicus curiae brief in which it further explained the basis for its confession of error, and APRL filed a reply brief in support of its motion for entry of judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">C. <em>The trial court\u2019s order and judgment granting the writ of mandate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The trial court held a hearing on APRL\u2019s motion for entry of judgment at which APRL, FOCP, and the City appeared. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court entered an order granting APRL\u2019s petition for writ of mandate. The trial court then entered a judgment granting APRL\u2019s petition for writ of mandate and issued a corresponding peremptory writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">D. <em>APRL\u2019s motion for attorney fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">APRL filed a motion requesting an award of private attorney general fees in the amount of $123,243.75<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against the City pursuant to section 1021.5, which provides that \u201ca court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more <em>opposing parties </em>in any action which has resulted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest . . . ,\u201d under certain specified circumstances. (Italics added.) APRL sought fees for work performed during and prior to the filing of the litigation in this case, as well as for work performed in services rendered in a related case <em>(Animal Protection &amp; Rescue League </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>(Super. Ct. San Diego County, 2012, No. 37-2012-00103629-CU-MC-CTL) <em>(APRL v. </em>Sanders)) in which APRL had sought a preliminary injunction requiring installation of the guideline rope at issue in this case. Among other documents, APRL lodged declarations from its attorneys and detailed time records in support of its motion. APRL also requested that the court award it $555 in costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The City opposed the motion for attorney fees on the ground that the City was \u201cnever an opposing party\u201d because it had \u201cconfessed error at the inception of [the] case.\u201d The City also argued that APRL was not entitled to any fees for 58.8 hours of work that the City claimed APRL\u2019s attorneys had performed in <em>APRL v. Sanders </em>because, it claimed, that work was \u201cnot useful or necessary to . . . success in the present action.\u201d The City maintained that APRL\u2019s request for costs was improper because APRL had failed to file a memorandum of costs, as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">APRL filed a reply in which it clarified the basis for its request of an award of attorney fees for the 58.8 hours of work performed prior to the filing of the petition in this case to which the City had raised an objection. APRL contended that 35.05 of the 58.8 hours were spent exclusively on preparation and research for the current writ action and 23.75 were spent on tasks performed in <em>APRL v. Sanders </em>that were inextricably intertwined with the present action. APRL presented a chart demonstrating 14 time entries detailing the tasks performed in the <em>APRL </em>v. <em>Sanders </em>case that it contended were related to this case, and argued that it was not seeking fees for \u201cother outside issues also raised in <em>APRL v. </em>Sanders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">E. <em>The trial court\u2019s attorney fee and cost order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">After a hearing, the trial court entered an order on November 13 awarding APRL $82,717.50, including $82,162.50 in attorney fees and $555 in costs. The court reasoned in part: \u201cAlthough the City filed a non-opposition to [APRL\u2019s] motion for entry of judgment in their favor, the City\u2019s action via the Planning Commission, caused [APRL] to bring the current action. This coupled with the opposition from . . . Amicus [FOCP] is enough to warrant [APRL\u2019s] reasonable expenses in preparing and bringing the current action. Therefore, [APRL is] entitled to a total of $82,717.50 under [section] 1021.5, reflecting a costs award of $555 and a total of 234.75 billable hours at a rate of $350 per hour. This includes $61,582.50 for the current action, reflecting 175.95 billable hours, and $20,580 for pre-litigation hours, reflecting 35.05 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>billable hours spen[t] on preparation and research and 23.75 billable hours on tasks intertwined with the current case.\u201d The trial court denied APRL\u2019s request that the court apply a multiplier to the lodestar amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">That same day, the court amended the judgment to reflect the award of attorney fees and costs in the amount of $82,717.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">F. <em>The appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The City appeals from the attorney fee order and the amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">A. <em>The trial court properly concluded that the City was an opposing party for purposes of awarding attorney fees pursuant to section 1021.5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The City contends that the trial court erred in concluding that it was an \u201copposing part[y]\u201d for purposes of awarding attorney fees pursuant to section 1021.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">1. <em>Standard of review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-12\">In <em>Connerly v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1169, 1173 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 788, 129 P.3d 1] <em>(Connerly), </em>the Supreme Court considered whether an entity called the California Business Council, whose role in the underlying case shared attributes of both an amicus curiae and a real party in interest, was an \u201copposing part[y]\u201d within the meaning of section 1021.5. The <em>Connerly </em>court began its analysis by describing the standard of review to be applied in making such a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-13\">\u201cThe proper standard of review was set forth in <em>Carver v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 132, 142 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 569]: \u2018On review of an award of attorney fees after trial, the normal standard of review is abuse of discretion. However, de novo review of such a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">\u201cHere, the question is whether the California Business Council can be assessed attorney fees under section 1021.5 as an \u2018opposing part[y]\u2019 within the meaning of that statute. Under some circumstances, this may be a mixed question of law and fact and, if factual questions predominate, may warrant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>deferential standard of review. [Citation.] As will become clear below, however, the material facts in the present case are largely undisputed. The controversy is over whether a litigant in the California Business Council\u2019s somewhat unusual position can be considered an \u2018opposing party.\u2019 This is a question of law and is reviewed by us de novo. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 1175-1176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In this case, as in <em>Connerly, </em>the issue on appeal is whether an entity may be assessed attorney fees under section 1021.5 as an \u201copposing part[y]\u201d within the meaning of that statute, and the material facts relevant to this determination are undisputed. (See <em>Connerly, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 1175-1176.) Accordingly, we apply the de novo standard of review to the City\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">2. <em>Governing law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Section 1021.5 provides in relevant part: \u201cUpon motion, a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more <em>opposing parties </em>in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity, are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In <em>Connerly, </em>the Supreme Court outlined the meaning of the terms \u201copposing parties\u201d in section 1021.5:</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">\u201cBecause the term \u2018opposing parties\u2019 is not defined, it can be assumed that the Legislature was referring to the conventional definition of that term. As we have recognized, the edition of Black\u2019s Law Dictionary current at the time that section 1021.5 was drafted states that \u2018 \u201c[p]arty\u201d is a technical term having a precise meaning in legal parlance; it refers to \u201cthose by or against whom a suit is brought... , the party plaintiff or defendant....\u201d\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">\u201cGenerally speaking, the opposing party liable for attorney fees under section 1021.5 has been the defendant person or agency sued, which is responsible for initiating and maintaining actions or policies that are deemed harmful to the public interest and that gave rise to the litigation. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 1176-1177.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>3. <em>Application</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">Applying the definition of opposing parties provided in <em>Connerly, </em>the City is the named respondent to APRL\u2019s writ petition, and, as such, is the entity \u201cagainst whom [the] suit is brought.\u201d (See <em>Connerly, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1176.) Further, the City, via its planning commission, was the entity \u201cresponsible for initiating and maintaining actions or policies . . . that gave rise to the litigation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1177.) Thus, the City fits squarely within the definition of \u201copposing party\u201d provided in <em>Connerly. (Id. </em>at p. 1176.)</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The City contends that it may not be considered an opposing party because, \u201cat no point <em>in the litigation </em>did the City take a position adverse to [APRL].\u201d (Italics added.) However, as <em>Connerly </em>makes clear, it is generally the entity responsible for the actions \u201cthat <em>gave rise </em>to the litigation\u201d that is an opposing party under section 1021.5. <em>(Connerly, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1177, italics added.) There can be no question that the City, through its planning commission, fits this definition. APRL sought and obtained a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the City to vacate and set aside the planning commission\u2019s denial of a permit for the year-round guideline rope. The fact that the City confessed its error and agreed to have a judgment entered against it does not provide a reasonable basis for concluding that the City may not be subject to an attorney fee award under section 1021.5. (See <em>Planned Parenthood </em>v. <em>Aakhus </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 162, 174 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 510] [rejecting party\u2019s contention that stipulated nature of judgment prevented the awarding of attorney fees and stating \u201c[a]n opposing party\u2019s admission or nonadmission of liability is irrelevant for purposes of an award pursuant to section 1021.5\u201d].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Indeed, to hold that an entity may avoid being required to pay an award of attorney fees under section 1021.5 merely by confessing error after being sued would be, as APRL correctly points out, wholly inconsistent with the well-established catalyst theory of recovery. \u201cUnder the catalyst theory, attorney fees may be awarded even when litigation does <em>not </em>result in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>judicial resolution if the defendant changes its behavior substantially because of, and in the manner sought by, the litigation.\u201d <em>(Graham </em>v. <em>DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 560 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 331, 101 P.3d 140].) We can conceive of no reason why section 1021.5 should be interpreted to <em>permit </em>an award of attorney fees pursuant to a catalyst theory of recovery where a defendant changes its behavior <em>without </em>judicial resolution, but to <em>deny </em>recovery where an entity confesses error <em>in response to </em>ligation. Such a holding would have the effect of encouraging entities to refuse to change their behavior until a suit is filed and error could be confessed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">This court\u2019s decisions in <em>Nestande v. Watson </em>(2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 232 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 18] (Nestande) and <em>McGuigan </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 610 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 554] <em>(McGuigan), </em>on which the City relies, do not support the City\u2019s contention that it was not an \u201copposing part[y]\u201d under section 1021.5. In <em>Nestande, </em>this court interpreted the term \u201copposing parties\u201d as follows: \u201cSection 1021.5 does not specifically define \u2018opposing parties.\u2019 In construing the statute, however, we must give the words their \u2018usual and ordinary meaning.\u2019 [Citation.] The dictionary definition of \u2018opposing\u2019 is \u2018opposite in position\u2019 or \u2018active in or offering opposition.\u2019 [Citation.] An \u2018opposite party\u2019 means \u2018[a]n adversary in litigation.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, we construe the term \u2018opposing party\u2019 as used in section 1021.5 to mean a party whose position in the litigation was adverse to that of the prevailing party. Simply put, an \u2018opposing party\u2019 within the meaning of section 1021.5 is a losing party.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Nestande, supra, </em>at pp. 240-241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Applying this definition, the <em>Nestande </em>court concluded that one respondent (Songstad) was not entitled to recover attorney fees from two governmental actors (Lever and Watson) who also had been named as respondents in a lawsuit brought by a third party (Nestande). <em>(Nestande, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th at pp. 240-241.) The <em>Nestande </em>court reasoned in part, \u201c. . . Lever and Watson were prevailing parties on the same side of the litigation as Songstad, and they were not opposing parties to Songstad.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 241.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">In contrast to <em>Nestande, </em>in this case, the City\u2019s position <em>was </em>\u201cadverse to\u201d APRL. <em>(Nestande, supra, </em>111 Cal.App.4th at p. 241.) Further, unlike in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Nestande, </em>the City was also clearly the \u201closing party,\u201d since APRL obtained a judgment against the City. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Finally, unlike the governmental actors in <em>Nestande, </em>the City was not on the same side of the litigation as the party seeking fees. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">In <em>McGuigan, </em>this court applied <em>Nestande, </em>among other decisions, in considering whether a municipality, as one of two settling parties defending a settlement in an appeal pursued by third party objectors, could be assessed <em>appellate </em>attorney fees under section 1021.5 in favor of the other settling party (McGuigan). <em>(McGuigan, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at p. 618.) This court concluded that McGuigan could not recover appellate attorney fees against the municipality since, in the appeal, the municipality \u201cwas simply not an \u2018opposing party\u2019 to [McGuigan] when these fees were incurred; rather, these parties were allied in interest in defending the settlement . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">This case does not present the \u201cunique procedural context\u201d <em>(McGuigan, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at p. 618) presented in <em>McGuigan </em>in which one respondent seeks appellate attorney fees from a \u201cfellow respondent\u201d in an appeal brought by a third party. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 629.) In addition, unlike in <em>McGuigan, </em>the City and APRL were not aligned by a settlement that was being attacked in an appeal brought by a third party. Further, we reject the City\u2019s argument that, viewing the record \u201c \u2018realistically,\u2019 \u201d as <em>McGuigan </em>instructs, \u201cthe \u2018real dispute\u2019 in our case was between [FOCP] and [APRL], with the City indisputably allied with [APRL].\u201d On the contrary, in this case, APRL sued the <em>City </em>seeking an order directing the <em>City </em>to take action, and, after the <em>City </em>confessed error, APRL obtained a judgment against the <em>City. </em>In addition, FOCP is not similarly situated to the objectors in <em>McGuigan, </em>who were parties to the case and who had taken the appeal at issue. In this case, the trial court denied FOCP\u2019s motion to intervene and FOCP merely had \u201can ideological or policy interest [in the case] typical of an amicus curiae . . . .\u201d <em>Connerly, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1181.)</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the City was an opposing party for purposes of awarding attorney fees pursuant to section 1021.5.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>B.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> *</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The award of $555 in costs in the November 13, 2013 order and amended judgment is stricken, thereby reducing the total award from $82,717.50 to $82,162.50.

It is well established that we need not consider claims raised for the first time at oral argument. (See, e.g., <em>Palp, Inc. v. Williamsburg National Ins. Co. </em>(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 282, 291, fn. 2 [132 Cal.Rptr.3d 592] [\u201c \u2018We do not consider arguments that are raised for the first time at oral argument.\u2019 \u201d].) Therefore, we need not consider whether the trial court abused its discretion under section 1021.5 in failing to make such an apportionment. In so stating, we emphasize that we express no opinion as to the legality of any such apportionment. (See <em>Connerly, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1182 [\u201cGiven the existence of state defendants, and their uncontroverted liability for attorney fees, making the [amicus curiad] also liable for those fees is not necessary to fulfill [the] purpose [of section 1021.5].\u201d].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\"> In its reply brief, the City contends that APRL \u201cwaived the \u2018catalyst theory\u2019 \u201d of recovery. The City misunderstands APRL\u2019s argument. APRL is not contending that it is entitled to recover attorney fees pursuant to the catalyst theory of recovery. Rather, APRL is contending that to adopt the argument advanced by the City on appeal would defeat the purpose of section 1021.5 and be inconsistent with the catalyst theory. APRL made this same argument in the trial court, noting, \u201cLike the Petitioners in all catalyst cases, the fact that the agency (or respondent) was willing to comply after litigation was filed, does not preclude the award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b130-10\"> <em>Nestande </em>was decided more than two years prior to <em>Connerly, </em>and thus, the <em>Nestande </em>court did not apply the definition of the term \u201copposing parties]\u201d later adopted in <em>Connerly.
