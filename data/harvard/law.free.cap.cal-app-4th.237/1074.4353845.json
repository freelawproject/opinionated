In the present case, a jury convicted Forrest of (1) dissuading a witness (Smith) from testifying (count 1; Pen. Code, \u00a7 136.1, subd. (a)(1); all further undesignated statutory references will be to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified) and (2) making a criminal threat (count 2; \u00a7 422). As to count 1 the jury found to be true an allegation that Forrest committed and attempted to commit that offense through the use of force and an express and implied threat of force (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (c)(1)). The court sentenced Forrest to three years\u2019 formal probation, conditioned on her serving 365 days in jail with credit for time already served.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">On appeal Forrest challenges her convictions, contending (1) the court prejudicially erred by allowing an investigator to testify for the prosecution that he had conducted a threat assessment for the district attorney\u2019s office and had determined that Smith should be placed in a witness protection program, (2) the prosecutor committed misconduct by prejudicially engaging in impermissible vouching in violation of Forrest\u2019s federal constitutional right to due process, and (3) the court prejudicially erred by failing to instruct the jury sua sponte on the lesser included offense of attempting to make a criminal threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>Forrest also contends that three conditions of her probation (conditions 6.d., 12.f., and 12.g.) are unconstitutionally vague and/or overbroad and must be either stricken or modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Last, Forrest contends that both the October 28, 2013<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> minute order and the October 28 probation order must be corrected to reflect the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence that she serve 365 days (not 372 days) in local custody as a condition of her probation. The Attorney General acknowledges the minute order and probation order should be corrected to conform to the oral pronouncement of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">For reasons we shall explain, we modify condition 12.g. of Forrest\u2019s probation in order to avoid unconstitutional overbreadth, and we affirm the judgment as so modified. However, we remand the matter to the superior court with directions to correct the October 28 minute order and the October 28 probation order to reflect the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence that she serve 365 days in local custody as a condition of her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">On April 12 the victim in this case, Smith, testified as a prosecution witness at the San Diego County Superior Court\u2019s courthouse in Chula Vista in a criminal case in which Smith\u2019s husband, Lukmond Muhammad, and Anthony Bolden were on trial for committing a robbery. Smith was also charged in connection with the robbery because she had participated as the getaway driver. After she pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact, she entered into an agreement with the district attorney\u2019s office under which she would testify truthfully against her husband and Bolden, and in exchange she would be sentenced to custody for the length of time she had already served.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">Forrest is Smith\u2019s sister-in-law because Smith is married to her brother. Forrest and her sister, Fatima Muhammad,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were in the courtroom on April 12, the day Smith testified against Lukmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">In the present case, Smith testified for the prosecution that while she was testifying at Lukmond\u2019s trial, Forrest made noises, whispered, and twice stood up and left the courtroom in \u201ca loud, rude[] manner.\u201d Later, after the court announced a recess during Smith\u2019s testimony, Smith and her godmother, Veronica Hall, stepped out of the courtroom and took the elevator to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>the second floor to use the restroom. When they found the women\u2019s restroom was closed, they headed for the escalator. Before they reached the escalator, Forrest and her sister, Fatima, approached Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Smith also testified that Forrest was angry when she approached Smith, and Forrest \u201cgot in [her] face\u201d while \u201ctalking a lot of verbal abuse.\u201d Smith further testified that Forrest spoke to her in a \u201cmean manner\u201d and angrily kept yelling, \u201cYou\u2019re going to get it. You\u2019re going to get it. Do you think you are going to live? You are going to get it after court.\u201d Smith testified that Fatima was \u201cholding [Forrest] back\u201d while Forrest was yelling at Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">In similar testimony, Hall stated that Forrest \u201ccalled [Smith] some names\u201d and said to Smith, \u201cYou think you will live through this? We will get you. We will get you when you get out of here. Wait until we get out of here outside.\u201d Hall also testified that Forrest told Smith she did not understand why Smith was testifying against Forrest\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Smith testified that she \u201casked [Forrest] what was the problem,\u201d and then Hall pulled Smith away and they (Smith and Hall) \u201cjust walked away\u201d toward the escalators while Forrest continued to angrily yell across the room. Before Smith and Hall reached the escalators, Forrest approached Smith and hit her in the face. Smith described the blow as \u201ca hard impact\u201d and testified she believed Forrest had been holding an object in the hand she had used in hitting her. Smith\u2019s injuries included a swollen lip and scratches on her cheek near her nose. The force of the impact broke Smith\u2019s glasses and caused them to fall to the floor in pieces.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Hall yelled for help and a sheriff\u2019s deputy responded. Smith recounted the incident to the deputy district attorney and eventually she was taken to a jury room.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Julio Barrios, a supervising investigator for the district attorney\u2019s office, testified that when he arrived at the courthouse and met with Smith in the jury room after the incident, she appeared \u201cshaken up\u201d and \u201cupset,\u201d and she had \u201ctears on her face.\u201d Barrios also testified that Smith told him she did not want to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">Smith testified that, as a result of Forrest\u2019s actions outside the courtroom, she did not want to continue testifying at Lukmond\u2019s trial because she \u201cfelt as if [her] life was in danger, and [she] was scared of . . . [the] possibility of what could happen afterwards.\u201d Smith was not able to finish testifying that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">Smith also testified she met with an investigator for the district attorney\u2019s office (Barrios) after the April 12 incident for the purpose of assessing whether she would need to relocate, and she did have to relocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>Deputy Cesar Castillo of the San Diego County Sheriff\u2019s Department testified that on April 12 he interviewed Fatima and Forrest at the courthouse regarding the incident. He testified that Fatima told him that Forrest had argued with Smith over Smith\u2019s testifying at trial. He also testified that Fatima did not indicate Forrest had been attacked or spat upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Sheriff\u2019s deputies later arrested Forrest based on an outstanding felony warrant. A courthouse surveillance video recording of the April 12 incident showing Forrest hitting Smith was played for the jury and admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Forrest testified in her own defense. She testified that she had learned from Smith that Smith was going to testify at her (Forrest\u2019s) brother\u2019s trial. Defense counsel asked Forrest whether, when she came to court on April 12 to attend Lukmond\u2019s trial, \u201cit bother[ed] [her] at all [that Smith] was testifying in [her] brother\u2019s case.\u201d Forrest replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">Forrest admitted on cross-examination that she angrily slapped Smith in the face and left a scratch because \u201c[her] nails [were] long.\u201d She testified that she slapped Smith because Smith had \u201ctalk[ed] S-H-I-T to [her]\u201d and spat in her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">I. \u2014 III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">IV. <em>PROBATION CONDITIONS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">Forrest next contends that conditions 6.d., 12.f., and 12.g. of her probation are unconstitutionally vague and/or overbroad and must be either stricken or modified. We uphold conditions 6.d. and 12.f:, but we modify condition 12.g. in order to avoid unconstitutional overbreadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">A. <em>Applicable Legal Principles</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">A trial court has broad discretion in selecting the conditions of a defendant\u2019s probation. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Olguin </em>(2008) 45 Cal.4th 375, 379 [87 Cal.Rptr.3d 199, 198 P.3d 1] <em>(Olguin).) </em>Generally, a probation condition that regulates noncriminal conduct will be upheld if it is reasonably related to (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>the crime of which the defendant was convicted or (2) the goal of preventing future criminality. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 379-380.)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Although challenges to the constitutionality of probation conditions on the grounds of vagueness and overbreadth are frequently made together, the concepts are distinct. \u201c[T]he underpinning of a vagueness challenge is the due process concept of \u2018fair warning.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Sheena K. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 875, 890 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 716, 153 P.3d 282] <em>(Sheena K.); </em>see U.S. Const., 5th, 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7.) A probation condition is unconstitutionally vague if it is not \u201c \u2018sufficiently precise for the probationer to know what is required of him [or her], and for the court to determine whether the condition has been violated.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sheena K., </em>at p. 890.) \u201cA probation condition should be given \u2018the meaning that would appear to a reasonable, objective reader.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Olguin, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 382.) Also, the probation condition should be evaluated in its context, and only reasonable specificity is required. <em>(People v. Lopez </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 615, 630 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 66] <em>(Lopez).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">In contrast, a probation condition is unconstitutionally overbroad if it imposes limitations on the probationer\u2019s constitutional rights and it is not closely or narrowly tailored and reasonably related to the compelling state interest in reformation and rehabilitation. <em>(Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 890; <em>In re Victor L. </em>(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 902, 910 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 584].) \u201cThe essential question in an overbreadth challenge is the closeness of the fit between the legitimate purpose of the restriction and the burden it imposes on the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights \u2014 bearing in mind, of course, that perfection in such matters is impossible, and that practical necessity will justify some infringement.\u201d <em>(In re E.O. </em>(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1153 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 869].) In an appropriate case, a probation condition that is not \u201c \u2018sufficiently narrowly drawn\u2019 \u201d may be modified and affirmed as modified. <em>(Lopez, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.4th at p. 629; see <em>In re E.O., supra, </em>188 Cal.App.4th at p. 1158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">A defendant who did not object to a probation condition at sentencing may do so on appeal if the appellate claim \u201camount[s] to a \u2018facial challenge\u2019 \u201d that challenges the condition on the ground its \u201cphrasing or language ... is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad\u201d and the determination whether the condition is constitutionally defective \u201cdoes not require scrutiny of individual facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>(Sheena K., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 885-886.)</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">On appeal we independently review constitutional challenges to a probation condition. <em>(In re Shaun R. </em>(2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 1129, 1143 [116 Cal.Rptr.3d 84].)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">The three probation conditions that Forrest challenges \u2014 conditions 6.d., 12.f., and 12.g. \u2014 are set forth in the completed standardized probation order form (\u201cOrder Granting Formal Probation,\u201d hereafter the probation order) filed in this matter on October 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">1. <em>Condition 12.f: restriction on possessing weapons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">Condition 12.f. states: \u201cDo not knowingly own, transport, sell, or possess any weapon, firearm, <em>replica </em>firearm or weapon, ammunition, or <em>any instrument used as a </em>weapon.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Claiming condition 12.f. is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and must be stricken or modified, Forrest asserts (1) the word \u201creplica\u201d is vague, (2) the phrase \u201cany instrument used as a weapon\u201d is vague, and (3) the condition is overbroad because it lacks an exception for temporary possession of a weapon in lawful self-defense. We reject her facial challenges to condition 12.f.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">a. <em>\u201cReplica\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">In support of her claim that the word \u201creplica\u201d is unconstitutionally vague, Forrest cites two dictionary definitions, stating that \u201creplica\u201d is defined (1) in the Collins English Dictionary as \u201c \u2018an exact copy or reproduction, especially on a smaller scale\u2019 \u201d and (2) in the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary as \u201c \u2018an exact or very close copy of something.\u2019 \u201d Forrest contends that, based on these definitional differences, the term \u201creplica firearm\u201d in condition 12.f. lacks sufficient precision to place her on notice of what conduct is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">Forrest\u2019s claim of constitutional vagueness is unavailing. The fact that one definition requires an exact copy of an item and references smaller scale reproductions, and the other makes no reference to size, does not render the word unconstitutionally vague. Taken in context, the word is reasonably specific. (See <em>Lopez, supra, 66 </em>Cal.App.4th at pp. 629-630 [a probation condition should be evaluated in its context and only reasonable specificity is required].) The purpose of condition 12.f. is to protect the public from violence or threats of violence and to prevent future criminality. To effectuate this purpose, Forrest is on fair notice she is prohibited from using or possessing actual firearms or weapons and she is also prohibited from confronting others with devices those individuals could reasonably perceive to be a weapon or firearm. The term \u201creplica firearm or weapon\u201d adequately conveys this prohibition. (See \u00a7 417.4 [preventing drawing or exhibiting an imitation firearm in a manner that causes a reasonable person apprehension or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>fear of bodily harm]; see also \u00a7 16700 [defining an imitation firearm to include a replica of a firearm that is \u201cso substantially similar in coloration and overall appearance ... as to lead a reasonable person to perceive that the device is a firearm\u201d].) No reasonable person would construe condition 12.f. as applying to a small-scale object that did not look like a real weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">b. <em>\u201c[A\\ny instrument used as a weapon\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Forrest next contends the use of the word \u201cused\u201d in the phrase \u201cany instrument used as a weapon\u201d renders condition 12.f. unconstitutionally vague because it is unclear whether the phrase prohibits (1) the possession of any instrument where she intends to use the instrument as a weapon or (2) the possession of any instrument which is sometimes capable of being used as a weapon. She requests that condition 12.f. be modified to state \u201cany instrument used by the probationer as a weapon.\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">We conclude there is no need to modify condition 12.f. because, again, this condition is clearly directed at prohibiting weapon possession and, when it is read in context, reasonable persons would understand that \u201cany instrument used as a weapon\u201d refers to an item that is being used, or is intended to be used, as a weapon, and does not refer to any object that might conceivably be used as a weapon. The phrase \u201cused as a weapon\u201d on its face excludes objects that are merely capable of being used as a weapon but are not actually being used as such. Also, because a violation of condition 12.f. requires Forrest to have had knowledge that the object instrument is used as a weapon, she will not be subjected to a probation violation unless she knows the instrument she possesses is intended for use as a weapon. For example, a probationer convicted of a violent crime would not be in violation of condition 12.f. by carrying a bat to baseball practice, but would be in violation of that condition if she or she possessed a baseball bat in the context being a member of a gang on the way to a gang-related confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">c. <em>Possession for self-defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Forrest also contends condition 12.f. is unconstitutionally overbroad \u201cto the extent that it does not contain an exception for the temporary possession of a weapon in lawful self-defense.\u201d She asserts that \u201cshould [s]he find [herself] in a real emergency where [her] life is under immediate threat, [she] should not be prohibited from defending [herself] from that threat even where doing so requires the use of a weapon or an improvised weapon.\u201d Forrest maintains that condition 12.f. should be modified by appending to the end of this probation condition the phrase \u201cexcept when such possession is justified because the firearm or weapon is used in accordance with the law of self-defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>We reject Forrest\u2019s claim that condition 12.f. is unconstitutionally over-broad. When a probationer has been convicted of a violent crime, imposition of a strict condition of probation prohibiting ownership or possession of weapons is essential to promote public safety. Here, given the importance of clearly communicating to Forrest that she is prohibited from owning or possessing weapons, it is reasonable to exclude from condition 12.f. a reference to self-defense to ensure she does not believe she is permitted to knowingly own or possess a weapon in some circumstances in anticipation of the possible need for self-defense. We are satisfied that no reasonable law enforcement official or court will interpret the prohibition of weapon possession to extend to a fleeting possession of a weapon in the event, for example, that Forrest is assaulted and she temporarily seizes an object to use as a weapon in self-defense. The omission of a reference to self-defense does not render condition 12.f. constitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">2. <em>Condition 6.d.: restriction on possessing weapons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Condition 6.d., which is also set forth in the October 28 probation order, provides: \u201cTHE DEFENDANT SHALL: [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Not knowingly possess a firearm, ammunition, or deadly weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">Forrest claims condition 6.d. is unconstitutional and must be stricken or modified because \u201c[tjhis condition\u2019s lack of an exception for the temporary possession of a weapon in lawful self-defense renders it unconstitutionally overbroad.\u201d The Attorney General argues that Forrest\u2019s proposed modification of condition 6.d. is \u201cantithetical to the rehabilitative purposes and public safety concerns under [that condition].\u201d We agree. We reject Forrest\u2019s facial challenge to condition 6.d. for the reasons we explained, <em>ante, </em>in rejecting her contention that condition 12.f. of her probation is unconstitutionally over-broad to the extent it does not contain an exception for the temporary possession of a weapon in lawful self-defense. The omission of a reference to self-defense does not render condition 6.d. constitutionally overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">3. <em>Condition 12.g.: restriction on being in the presence of weapons</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-9\">Condition 12.g., as set forth in the probation order, states: \u201cDo not remain in any building, vehicle or in the presence of any person where you know a firearm, deadly weapon, or ammunition exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">Forrest contends this condition is unconstitutionally overbroad and should be stricken or modified because (she asserts) it prohibits her \u201cfrom entering state and federal courthouses, police stations, military installations, federal and state office buildings and any other building with armed security personnel since each of these buildings contain armed individuals.\u201d She further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>contends this condition improperly impinges on her constitutional rights of association and to access the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">We agree condition 12.g. must be modified in order to address Forrest\u2019s well-founded concerns. Given the widespread presence of armed security personnel in buildings and other locales, we conclude condition 12.g. is unconstitutionally overbroad because it unduly restricts Forrest\u2019s constitutionally guaranteed freedom of travel and association and her right to access the courts, and because it is not narrowly tailored to safeguard these fundamental rights while restricting her conduct in a manner reasonably designed to promote her rehabilitation and to protect public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">In her appellant\u2019s opening brief, Forrest argued that condition 12.g. should be modified to restrict her presence at locations where weapons are <em>illegally </em>present. Specifically, she proposed that condition 12.g. be modified to read as follows; \u201cDo not remain in the presence of those you know illegally possess firearms, deadly weapons or ammunition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">The Attorney General responded by objecting to Forrest\u2019s proposed modification, asserting it \u201cwould allow [her] to remain in the presence' of anyone who <em>legally </em>possesses deadly weapons\u201d and, thus, it \u201cwould wholly undermine the purposes underlying the probation condition\u201d by \u201callow[ing] [her], for example, to knowingly visit a stash house stocked with .22-caliber rifles or to live in a house of armed bank robbers, so long as [she] does not know that the weapons are illegal or otherwise <em>unlawfully </em>possessed.\u201d The Attorney General proposed that, in order to remedy the unconstitutional overbreadth while continuing to keep Forrest from knowingly having ready access to prohibited weapons, condition 12.g. should be modified to read as follows; \u201cDo not remain in the presence of any person whom you know illegally possesses a firearm, deadly weapon, or ammunition. Also, do not remain in a building, vehicle or in the presence of any person when you knowingly have ready access to a firearm, deadly weapon, or ammunition, regardless of whether it was lawfully possessed or acquired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">In her reply brief Forrest does not object to the first sentence of the foregoing modification proposed by the Attorney General, which states: \u201cDo not remain in the presence of any person whom you know illegally possesses a firearm, deadly weapon, or ammunition.\u201d She asserts this first sentence \u201cessentially mirrors [her] suggestion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">With respect to the second sentence of the modification proposed by the Attorney General \u2014 which (as noted) states, \u201cAlso, do not remain in a building, vehicle or in the presence of any person when you knowingly have ready access to a firearm, deadly weapon, or ammunition, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>whether it was lawfully possessed or acquired\u201d \u2014 Forrest asserts she \u201cwould be happy with this second sentence if it was limited to firearms.\u201d She argues this sentence should be limited to firearms because \u201c[a] probationer will have ready access to \u2018deadly weapons\u2019 and \u2018ammunition\u2019 any time she enters either a sporting goods store or a general store such as Walmart as these items are generally placed on store shelves and may be seen as readily accessible.\u201d Forrest proposes the following \u201chybrid\u201d modification of condition 12.g.: \u201cDo not remain in the presence of any person whom you know illegally possesses a firearm, deadly weapon, or ammunition. Also, do not remain in a building, vehicle or in the presence of any person when you knowingly have ready access to a <em>firearm </em>regardless of whether it was lawfully possessed or acquired.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">Forrest argues that, under her proposed modification of condition 12.g., \u201c[she] would not be unreasonably restricted in her movements and the state\u2019s interest in preventing [her] presence in weapon store houses or [her] living with \u2018armed bank robbers\u2019 would be maintained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">We agree. Such a modification will remedy the unconstitutional over-breadth of probation condition 12.g. while safeguarding the state\u2019s interests in maintaining public safety, preventing future criminality, and rehabilitating Forrest by deterring her from knowingly having ready access to firearms. Accordingly, we shall order that condition 12.g. be modified to read as follows: \u201cDo not remain in the presence of any person who you know illegally possesses a firearm, deadly weapon, or ammunition. Also, do not remain in a building, in a vehicle, or in the presence of any person when you knowingly have ready access to a firearm, regardless of whether it is lawfully possessed or was lawfully acquired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">V. <em>CORRECTION OF THE OCTOBER 28 MINUTE ORDER AND PROBATION ORDER</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b971-9\">Probation condition 12.g. is modified to read: \u201cDo not remain in the presence of any person who you know illegally possesses a firearm, deadly weapon, or ammunition. Also, do not remain in a building, in a vehicle, or in the presence of any person when you knowingly have ready access to a firearm, regardless of whether it is lawfully possessed or was lawfully acquired.\u201d As so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>The matter is remanded to the superior court with directions to (1) correct probation condition 12.g., which is set forth in the October 28, 2013 order granting formal probation, and forward a copy of the corrected condition to the probation authorities and (2) correct both the October 28, 2013 minute order and the October 28, 2013 probation order to reflect the court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence that she serve 365 days in local custody as a condition of her probation and forward a copy of the corrected probation order to the probation authorities.</p>\n<judges id=\"b972-4\">McConnell, P.
