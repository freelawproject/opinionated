Chapman, William O.

Chaffee in Wilbraham, so as to widen and straighten the old road at certain places, and passing round the north side of Shrub hill, which report was accepted and the alterations mentioned therein adjudged to be of common convenience and necessity, and ordered to be laid out ; that on August 18, 1829, Rice, Norcross and Boies, the commissioners, proceeded to lay out the road, and assessed damages, and made a report thereof at a meeting held by them on the fourth Tuesday of September 1829 ; and the same was then accepted and ordered to be recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-11\">This petition further sets forth, that at the same meeting of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the commissioners, held on the fourth Tuesday of April 1829, Amos Pease and others presented their petition for an alteration of part of another road, leading from Amos Norcross\u2019s house in Monson, to Chaffee\u2019s inn in Wilbraham ; that Rice, Norcross and Boies, the commissioners, ordered that they would meet at Chaffee\u2019s on June 12, 1829, to view the route, and directed notice ; that afterwards, on the same 12th day of June, Rice and Boies, and Robert Emery, one of the special county commissioners, proceeded to view the route, and made their report that common convenience and necessity required that the road should be altered by being laid out southerly of the old road,\u2014which report was signed by Rice and Boies, and by Emery, who stated that he did the same as special commissioner in the room of Joel Norcross, who did not act, at the request of certain remonstrants ; that at the regular meeting of the commissioners, held by Rice, Norcross and Boies on the fourth Tuesday of June 1829, it was ordered that the commissioners would meet at Chaffee\u2019s on the 20th of August, to locate the same, and that on that day, Rice, Norcross and Boies laid out the road and assessed damages, and estimated the whole expense thereof, and made a report at a regular meeting held by Rice, Norcross and Boies on the fourth Tuesday of September 1829, and the same was then accepted and ordered to be recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-8\">This petition then alleges, that in the records and proceedings upon the petition of Chapman and others, manifest errors have intervened, to the damage of the inhabitants of Wilbra ham, and among other errors the following : \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-9\">1.

R. 468. Under the statute of 1786, c. 67, \u00a7 4, respecting highways, he could not have been on a locating committee, not being a disinterested freeholder. Norcross had a direct personal interest in selecting the northern route in preference to the intermediate one ; and although there was no petition for the intermediate one, and therefore the commissioners could not lay it out, yet if they saw that it was the better route, this would have been a sufficient reason for refusing to lay out the road prayed for. The interest of this commissioner disqualified him to decide on the proportion of the expense to be paid by the' town of Mon-son and by the county. Nor was there any necessity in the case, for one of the special commissioners might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>summoned to act in his place. <em>St. </em>1827, c. 77, \u00a7 9; <em>Pearce </em>v.

Several questions of considerable practical importance, are raised in the present case ; but by far the most important is, whether the circumstance that a county commissioner is a taxable inhabitant of a town through which a contemplated road is to pass, constitutes such an interest as to disqualify such commissioner from acting, upon the question of the common convenience and necessity of laying out the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">This petition embraces two distinct proceedings of the commissioners, founded upon distinct petitions, considered and decided upon their own respective merits ; and part of the confusion and difficulty suggested in the petition for a certiorari <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>and in the argument, has arisen from considering these two proceedings together. The principal question consideied, however, whether Joel Norcross, one of the commissioners, could act, applies equally to both proceedings, as they both related to the location of roads partly within the town of Mon-son, of which town he was a taxable inhabitant.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">We most cheerfully accede to the position taken in behalf of the petitioners, that every person exercising any judicial function or any discretionary authority, ought to be impartial and disinterested. This principle is\" well expressed in the declaration of rights. \u201c It is essential to the pres ervati\u00f3n of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty; property and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and administration of justice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial and independent as the lot of humanity will admit.\u201d Declaration of Rights, <em>art. 29.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">The last clause intimates the necessary qualification of the general principle ; that there may be cases, in which there are small collateral and contingent interests, necessarily incident to the condition of human affairs, and to organized society, so general in their nature as not to be avoided, and therefore not to be considered as opposed to the general rule. The constitution intends to declare a great fundamental principle, leaving it to the judgment and conscience of the legislature so to apply it as to secure the great result, of substantial impartiality in all judges and functionaries exercising public authority, as far as practicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">It has therefore been held, that it is competent for the legislature to provide by law, that a small contingent interest which a juror or judge has in common with his fellow citizens of the state, county or town, shall not disqualify him from acting as a judge or juror. Therefore where a penalty upon the conviction of the offender was given to a town, but where from the constitution of the court the offence must be prosecuted and tried before a court and jury composed of citizens of such town, the interest of such judge and jury could not be urged as an objection to the jurisdiction of the court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Ryan, 5 Mass. R. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Were it otherwise, there are many cases in which there would be a failure of justice, both in the civil and criminal department. All cases in which the rights and interests of the commonwealth are drawn in question, as where penalties ipon conviction are given to the commonwealth, or where its civil rights are in controversy, must be tried by judges and jurors who are citizens, and of course who are interested. One consideration which may be urged in justification of such proceeding is, that the interest which every citizen has in maintaining an impartial administration of justice, and having right and justice done to others, may be supposed to counter act and balance the minute and very remote personal interest which he may have as a member of the commonwealth. But another and perhaps more decisive consideration is, that otherwise the wheels of justice must stop ; that such a proceeding is necessary to the attainment of right; and a tribunal so constituted as to be under the influence of no other than such minute interest, is as impartial and independent as the lot of humanity will admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">Then the question recurs, in the particular case, whether the interest which the citizen of a town has, in the laying out of a highway, is such as to disqualify him from acting as a county commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">This depends upon the nature and powers of the office oi county commissioners, and the statute under which it is constituted. If it was intended by the legislature, that such an interest should not disqualify, it appears from the case already cited and the true construction of the declaration of rights, that it was competent for them so to do. The office of county commissioner is a new one, created by a recent statute, an office not known to the common law, or the early history of the commonwealth, and therefore we must seek for its description and powers in the statute, (St. 1827, c. 77,) and in the powers of those officers who formerly exercised like functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Their powers, though involving to a great degree the exercise of judgment and discretion, are yet rather administrative than judicial. They have no direct jurisdiction to decide upon contested rights between party and party, though their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>decisions do collaterally and incidentally affect the rights of counties, towns and individuals, to a considerable extent, That they were not regarded as \u201cjudicial officers\u201d by the legislature, is manifest, from the provision that they are appointed for a limited term of years ; whereas by the constitution, \u201cjudicial officers\u201d are to hold their offices during good behaviour. They are expressly invested with power to order and direct, that part of the expense of laying out a new highway may be charged upon the county, and yet the statute expressly provides, that they shall be residents of the county. By necessary implication, the interest they must have, as contributors to the county expenses, was declared by the legislature, not to disqualify them. The interest they have as citizens of a town, is of precisely the same nature ; it may under some circumstances be different in degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The question then is, whether the latter interest is so distinguishable from the other, in degree or otherwise, as to constitute an exception by necessary implication. The interest is incidental, not direct; contingent, not certain. The laying out of a new highway, may be a benefit instead of a charge upon the town through which it is laid out, not merely in the accommodation obtained, but in <em>the </em>saving of expense. The petitions in this very case, set forth, that in consequence of the great expenses of repairing the present road, and the comparative cheapness of maintaining and repairing the new road, by its better and more favorable location, the new road would be a saving of expense to the town. This may or may not be true, but it serves to illustrate the position, that laying out a new highway may be a saving instead of a charge to the town, and therefore the pecuniary interest of the inhabitants in the question is remote and contingent.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">But then it is urged, that the interest of a commissioner, as a member of the county, is necessary, and therefore was contemplated by the statute ; whereas that of a citizen of a town might be obviated by taking commissioners, standing or special, belonging to other towns. But this may not always be possible ; the contemplated county road may extend through several towns and affect every town in which the commissioners reside. As such a case may occur, and in some counties was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>like! / to occur, and as the statute makes no provision foi excepting such a case, it seems to be a necessary inference, that the circumstance of being an inhabitant of one of the towns through which the highway was to pass, was not regarded as a disqualification of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">We are not aware, that when the jurisdiction of laying out highways was vested in the old court of sessions, consisting of all the commissioned justices of the peace for the county, any one was disqualified who was the resident of a town through which the highway was contemplated to pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Considering the nature of the duties to be performed by these officers, that, by the necessary construction of the statute, their interest as residents of the county was not considered a disqualification, that the remote and contingent interest which they might have as inhabitants of a town, is such as has been often overlooked and disregarded in like cases, both by statute provision and judicial decision, and that it is not of such a nature as to constitute, by necessary implication an exception to the general authority conferred on the commissioners by the statute, we think that the commissioner, in the present case, was not disqualified in consequence of his being a citizen of Monson.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The exception that one or both of the petitions was signed by the brother and son of one of the commissioners, we think, cannot be sustained. Nothing appears to show any other than a public interest in these petitioners ; they joined with others in setting forth that such a highway would be of common convenience and necessity. It does not appear that they had any private interest as landholders or otherwise, to be affected by the decision of the question. The objection therefore cannot prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Whether evidence <em>aliunde </em>could be received upon the return of the certiorari, to show errors or irregularities not apparent upon the record, we give no opinion ; the evidence given <em>de bene esse, </em>upon the application to the discretion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>the Court has not been such as to sustain the allegations in point of fact. Upon the substantial merits of these proceedings, there is no error requiring the interposition of the Court, and therefore the petition for a- certiorari must be dismissed <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-14-pl-split\"> See <em>Rutland </em>v. <em>County Commissioners of </em>Worcester, 20 Pick. 71</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\"> See Rev.
