Because nothing but the income of certain real estate was devised for the use and benefit of Susannah Davison, and that only for her life, and the appellees were not authorized or required by the will to pay over to her any thing but the annual income, and that only during her life, the whole of the real estate devised for her life being devised in remainder to the appellants and others, from and after her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-12\">2. Because the rents and income of the real estate which was devised for the support of Susannah Davison, and which rents and income the appellees received from the death of the testator to the death of Susannah, a period of about twenty years, and which were more than enough to support Susannah, have not been credited to the estate of the testator, but only a small part of the same has been accounted for by the appellees.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-13\"><em>Dwight </em>and <em>Byington, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A10X\">cited <em>Stevens </em>v.

Jacobs, 4 Mass. R. 634 ; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>2 Pick. 619. The testator intended not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>only to give a legacy to tiis mother, but likewise to make a provision for his wife ; and under the first part of the second clause in the will she took a fee simple in the twenty acres, and therefore was not obliged to account for the rents and profits of this parcel. The charge upon her to support the mother gives her the fee. <em>Baddeley </em>v. Leppingwell, 3 Burr. 1541, 1542 ; 4 Kent\u2019s Comm. 524. The latter part of the clause restricting her to an estate for life, is repugnant to the former and void; as is likewise the third clause, so far as it charges the twenty acres previously devised to the wife. All the specific devises are equally liable with the twenty acres to contribute to the legacy to the mother. <em>Hays </em>v. Jackson, 6 Mass. R. 149. The will gives the. wife a fee in the sixty acres in case it should be necessary for her reimbursement, and the limitation over after the devise of the fee, is void. Or supposing the remainder over to be good, it was nevertheless contingent and capable of being defeated by the tenant for life. 2 Bl. Com. c. 11. The sixty acres therefore may be sold to reimburse the executrix.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b262-7\">\n<em>Sept. 17th</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-9\">Wilde J.</author>\n<p id=\"AeK\">delivered the opinion of the Court. It appears from the decree of the judge of probate upon the account presented by the appellees, that a balance of $ 664'50 was allowed in their favor ; and the appellants contended that according to the true construction of the will of Zephaniah Davison, no balance in favor of the appellees should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">By the second clause in the will a tract of land of about twenty acres is devised to the executrix for life, together with all the testator\u2019s personal property. The third clause directs that the testator\u2019s mother \u201c should be comfortably clothed, fed, maintained and supported, in sickness and in health, out of the before bequeathed and devised premises to the said executrix.\u201d And by the seventh clause in the will the testator directs that all the residue of his real estate, being about sixty acres of land, should be committed to the care, management and disposal of his wife, the said executrix, (if necessary) for the maintenance and support of his mother during her life, and for other purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">These are all the clauses in the will, which it is material to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>consider, and the construction of them appears to be very clear. By the second clause a life estate is expressly given to the executrix, which by the third clause is charged with the support and maintenance of the testator\u2019s mother. The charge, however, is on the income and profits of the twenty acres, and of the personal estate. There is no personal charge on the executrix, and therefore there is no reason for supposing that a fee simple was intended. We think, therefore, the appellees are bound to account for the rents and profits of the twenty acres, and for the income of the personal property, after deducting the amount of debts paid, expenses, &amp;c. ; and if this should not be sufficient (as probably it will not be) to reimburse the expenses incurred for the support and maintenance of the mother, the income of the sixty acres is to be applied to make good the deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">It has been said that the second and third clauses are repugnant, as the expenses of supporting the mother exceed the income of the twenty acres, and of the personal property. But construing the two clauses together, they are sufficiently intelligible and consistent. The continuance of the mother\u2019s life was uncertain, and the amount of benefit to be derived by the executrix from the devise and bequest depended on the duration of the life of the mother. But as the event has happened, still the devise and bequest are beneficial, as the charge upon them ceased on the death of the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">It has been said also, that the expense of supporting and maintaining the mother should be charged exclusively on the sixty acres, but the language of the will is such as very clearly will admit of no such construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The decree of the judge of probate, for these reasons, must be reversed, and a new account is to be taken conformably to th( principles above stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
