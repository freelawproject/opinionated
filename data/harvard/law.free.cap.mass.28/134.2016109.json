Plea, a former conviction of pilfering, on a complaint before the Police Court, with averments that the articles and the stealing mentioned in the indictment are the same articles and the same stealing mentioned in the complaint, and that the Police Court had jurisdiction of the offence. Replication, that the stealing charged in the complaint was a larceny in the dwellinghouse, which is a high and aggravated crime, and that the Police Court had no jurisdiction of the same. Rejoinder, that the stealing charged in the complaint was not a stealing in the dwellinghouse, and was not a high and aggravated crime of which the Police Court had no jurisdiction.

The plea presents the question, whether a conviction in the Police Court, of the crime of being a common pilferer, is a bar to an indictment for an aggravated or compound larceny. In order to sustain the plea of <em>auterfois convict, </em>the crime must be the same for which the defendant was before convicted, and the conviction must have been lawful, and on a sufficient indictment. 1 Chit. Crim. Law, 462 ; 2 Hale\u2019s P. C. 253; 2 Hawk. c. 36, \u00a7 10. It is manifest that the defendant has never been charged or convicted of the felony set forth in this indictment. The whole proceeding before the Police Court was <em>coram non judice, </em>and void, so far as if respects this charge. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Potter, </em>17 Johns. R. 145. The former conviction is void, upon tl.e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>ground that the complaint is radically defective, inasmuch as it alleges the pilfering of \u201c divers articles of property,\u201d without naming them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-9\">The plea is bad, because the offences therein set forth as the ground of the conviction, are not the same as the offence charged in the indictment; nor does the averment in the plea cure the defect. The averment is, that tire goods mentioned in the former conviction and those mentioned in the indictment, are the same, and that the stealing is the same ; but there is no averment that the goods mentioned in the former conviction were stolen in the dwellinghouse of Fenno. The averment that the Police Court had jurisdiction, is unavailing ; the Court perceive from the record that that court had no jurisdiction of the crime alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-10\">The rejoinder is had, for the causes assigned in the demur rer. But whether it is good or bad, is immaterial, if the plea is not good. The most correct course would have been, to demur to the plea ; but its insufficiency is not cured by the subsequent pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-11\">A position taken by the defendant\u2019s counsel is, that if the evidence upon a second indictment would have supported the former one, the conviction is a bar. But this general princi pie is not applicable to the present case. Evidence of a larceny in the dwellinghouse of Fenno, so far from supporting the complaint for pilfering, would have been fatal to it, as it would have shown that the Police Court had no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-12\">1 Stark.

It is believed, that in every case in the books, where a former conviction has been allowed to be a bar to a second indictment, the court in which the former conviction was obtained, had competent jurisdiction of the crime alleged in the second indictment, as well as of the one alleged in the former conviction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-13\">S. <em>I). </em>Parker, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS7\">cited <em>Commonwealth </em>v.

The indictment charges the defendant with larceny in the dwellinghouse of one William Fenno. To this charge the defendant pleads a conviction of the larceny in the Police Court on the complaint of Fenno, and avers that the stealing, taking and carrying away mentioned in the indictment, is the same stealing, taking and carrying away mentioned in the complaint, and no other or different; and that the Police Court had jurisdiction of the offence. The attorney for the commonwealth replies, that the offence charged was a larceny in Fenno\u2019s dwelling-house, which was a high and aggravated crime, and that the Police Court had no jurisdiction of the same. These averments in the replication are traversed in the rejoinder, and to this rejoinder the attorney for the commonwealth demurs specially, assigning several causes, none of which appears to us to be well assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">In the first place, it is alleged that the rejoinder is a departure from the plea, because the plea avers that the goods and chattels mentioned in the indictment, and in the record set forth in the plea, are the same ; which is denied in the rejoinder. But on looking into the rejoinder we find no such denial ; it denies that the larceny was committed in the dwelling-house ; and this is not inconsistent with any averment in the plea. On the contrary, we think the plea does virtually, though not expressly, deny that the larceny was committed in the dwellinghouse ; for it avers that the offence was within the jurisdiction of the Police Court; which could not be true if it was attended by the aggravating circumstance charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Nor is the rejoinder double. It traverses the averments in the replication which go to show that the offence was not within the jurisdiction of the Police Court. These are connected averments asserting a single proposition, namely, that the offence was not within the jurisdiction of the Police Court, because it was an aggravated larceny, being committed in a dwellinghouse. This is traversed' in the rejoinder, and the only fact put in issue was the stealing in the dwelling-house. So that neither the replication nor the rejoinder can be charged with the fault of duplicity. We think, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>that the rejoinder is very clearly a sufficient answer to the replication.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The objection to the plea is apparently more weighty. In point of form the plea is certainly defective. It does not directly traverse the charge of larceny in the dwellinghouse. The defendant should have pleaded <em>auterfois convict </em>as to the larceny, and not guilty as to the residue of the charge ; and if the attorney for the Commonwealth had demurred to the plea, assigning the formal defect as a cause for demurrer, the plea must have been adjudged bad. But though the aggravating part of the charge is not expressly traversed, it is impliedly denied by the averment that the offence was within the jurisdiction of the Police Court. The plea, therefore, is not bad in substance, and the formal defect is cured by the subsequent pleadings. If the issue tendered by the rejoinder had been joined by the attorney for the Commonwealth and had been found for the defendant, there could have been no question but that she would have been entitled to a discharge ; and by the demurrer she is put on the same footing. By the replication all formal objections to the plea are waived, and the rejoinder, being good in point of form and substance, is admitted to be true by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">\n<em>Rejoinder adjudged good.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
