Tyler <em>et al. versus </em>Samuel Hammond.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-4\">Where a deed of a parcel of land, after describing it by bounds and admeasurements in feet and inches, contained the words\u2014\u201c or however otherwise the same is bounded or reputed to be bounded, being the mansion-house and land thereto belonging,\u201d \u2014 it was <em>held, </em>that this sweeping clause did not enlarge the grant; although if these general words had stood alone, they would have carried the mansion-house and land belonging to it not embraced by the particular description.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-5\">Where a deed of land de'scribes it as bounding on a road, but sets forth metes and bounds which plainly exclude the road, no part of the soil and freehold of the road passes by the grant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-6\">The lessee of an easement may disseise the lessor during the continuance of the term, by taking exclusive possession of the land against the will of the lessor. Thus, the lessee of an easement in a dock, may disseise the lessor by converting the dock into a wharf.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-7\">A deed duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, is always admissible evidence to prove a grant, whether the grant is a valid grant or not.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-8\">Where two persons claiming the same parcel of land, do not derive their titles from the same grantor, the last purchaser cannot object that the deed to the former was not on record at the time of the last purchase.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-9\">Thus, where the demandant who claimed under an ancient deed not recorded, bad not been in the visible possession of the land for more than forty years, the same having been used as a highway during that period, and the tenant, upon the discontinuance of the way, purchased without notice of such deed, from a stranger to the demandant\u2019s title, it was held, that such deed, which had been subsequently put upon record, was admissible evidence in support of the demandant\u2019s title; though if the demandant and the tenant had derived their titles from the same grantor, the deed would not have availed the demandant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Ag6\">Where a grantor, for a consideration named, conveyed in fee a parcel of land, the grantee \u201cyielding and paying thereout a quitrent for the same,\u201d annually forever to the town of Boston; and likewise, \u201c for the consideration aforesaid,\u201d quitclaimed all his right in a parcel of land adjoining the first; both of which parcels originally belonged to the town; it was <em>held, </em>that the quitrent had reference to the first parcel only, and that the payment of it by the grantee did.not estop him to allege a disseisin by him of the town, of the other parcel.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-12\">Where a dock, of which the owner of an adjoining wharf claimed to be seised, was filled up by the town, and being so filled up, was used together with the wharf, ns a highway, and afterwards the whole was paved by the town, though it did not appear that the way had been laid out according to the statutes, it was <em>held, </em>that the acts of the town amounted to a disseisin of the dock, but that they were equivocal in respect to the wharf, and it was a question for the jury to determine whether such acts were done with intent to disseise.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-13\">In ascertaining the value pursuant to the <em>Betterment </em>act, of land recovered in a real action, with and without the improvements made by the tenant, the land is to be estimated with all its privileges and appurtenances and subject to all its incum brances existing previously to the making of the improvements.\u2014 So that if the tenant, by erecting a building, extinguishes ao easement to which as owner oi other land he is entitled, the land in controversy is to be valued in the same man ner as if there had been no such extinguishment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b204-14\">Where a tenant holds land by a defective title and an easement in it by a valid title the easement is not extinguished by unity of possession. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>If in a writ of entry the tenant pleads the general issue, whereby he claims the fee, . but fails to support his plea, he is not thereby estopped from setting up a claim to an easement in the land.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">This was a writ of entry, commenced on September 12, 1827, in which the demandants counted on a seisin of their father, Royal Tyler, within thirty years, and a disseisin in his lifetime by the tenant, of a parcel of land in Boston, bounded northerly on land of Hammond, (the tenant,) 28 feet 6 inches, easterly on the west line of Conduit alley extended over and across an ancient dock to the highway called Dock Square, 50 feet, southerly on the above mentioned dock, 30 feet, and westerly on land late of Joseph Tyler, 50 feet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-8\">.The tenant pleaded the general issue, which was joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-9\">He pleaded further, that he and those under whom he claimed, had been in the actual possession of the land with the appurtenances, for the space of six years and more next before the commencement of the action, and had greatly increased the value thereof, &amp;c. and he therefore prayed, that the jury, if they should find a verdict for the demandants, might also ascertain the increased value of the land by reason of the buildings and improvements made thereon by the tenant and those under whom he claimed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-10\">And the demandants also required that the jury should ascertain what the value of the demanded premises would have been had no buildings or improvements been made by the tenant, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-11\">The cause was tried before the late chief justice <em>Parker.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-12\">The demandants introduced a deed from the town of Boston to Valentine Hill and his associates (one of whom was Edward Bendall) of November 29, 1641, of all the waste ground from the point of the marsh between William Tyng\u2019s pale and John Lowe\u2019s house, to the uppermost corner of Edward Tyng\u2019s propriety near the key already staked out, and so round by Edward Bendall\u2019s to the point before mentioned, for building wharves, &amp;c. for a term of years : which in 1649 was fixed at eighty years from the year 1646.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-13\">Also a deed of August 29, 1645, from Bendall to John Lowe, of a parcel of land 60 feet in length, east and west, and 40 feet in breadth at the east end and 44 feet in breadth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>at the west end, bounded south by the cove, east and west by land of Bendall, and north by the highway, [Ann Street,] to hold for the term granted by the town (as before mentioned), provided that Lowe should leave 6 feet next the water side to pass and repass and to land goods upon, and should maintain the wharf, and that it should be lawful for Bendall to take wharfage for all goods except Lowe\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-6\">Also a deed of February 28, 1649, from the town of Boston to Lowe, of the reversion of a lot 90 feet long on Ann Street northward, and 72 feet on the dock southward, bound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ed on Nehemiah Bourne\u2019s warehouse on the west, and by Bendall\u2019s dock on the east, with the right of wharfage, dock-age and moorage ; in consideration whereof Lowe binds himself, his heirs, &amp;c. to pay the town the sum of 18 shillings per annum from the date of the deed forever ; and he engages the land for security of payment of that sum, so that if it be not paid in ten days after the expiration of each year, the same being lawfully demanded, then it shall be lawful for the town to distrain &amp;c. for the use and benefit of the free school of Boston, to which end it is appointed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The parallelogram

trees, oyster shells and rubbish, and no appearance of a wharf; that he occupied a part of the mansion-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>house, and that the land in

of Dock square in 1796, and that he paved close up to the houses ; that it was previously a mud hole, and they covered it three or four feet deep with gravel and then paved it; that trucks used to stand there ; that he also paved the vegetable market (in 1808.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-5\">The demandants then called other witnesses and introduced votes and proceedings of the town, of different times, from 1725 to 1784 ; and particularly the report, dated June 10, 1783, made by James Sullivan, Joseph Waters junior, and Thomas Dawes junior, a committee appointed by the town, \u201cto examine the claims of the abutters on the town dock.\u201d The committee report, that the claims of the abutters, as well as the claims of the town, in and to the dock, are exceedingly numerous, ancient and perplexed, and they conclude as follows :\u2014 \u201cUpon the whole, the committee, having considered the long, uninterrupted possession of the abutters and their predecessors, and having looked into a large number of deeds and town records, are of opinion, that the town has but little more than a right in common to that part of the dock-meant to be filled up, and that it is most convenient, in the choice of difficulties, to make some composition with the abutters and to make them some offer for a -release of their right, be that right more or less.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-6\">The jury were instructed as follows : \u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-7\">The demandants must prove a seisin in their ancestor within thirty years, and as they have proved no actual possession for forty-four or forty-five years past, this claim would come within the statute of limitations, if the possession of the town for that period had been unqualified ; but there being some question whether the town\u2019s possession was by virtue of the power to lay out streets, or as claiming the land by adverse title, an investigation of the title became necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b213-8\">The demandants claim title under Royal Tyler, who claim ed under William ; and *here is no evidence that the wharf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>had been extended subsequently to the deed of John Dyer to William Tyler in 1726.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-4\">The inquiry would then be, what were the nature and extent of John Dyer\u2019s title. The deed of Dyer to Tyler, so far as related to the <em>locus in quo, </em>was equivocal, and might pass either a fee or an easement, according as his title might turn out to be. As the deed itself does not grant a fee in the wharf, it is necessary to go back to the predecessors of John Dyer, the most prominent of whom is John Lowe. Whatever title Lowe had, passed to Dyer. Lowe\u2019s title was derived from two deeds, the first from Edward Bendall, which was a lease expiring in 1726, the second, from the town, granting the reversion of the leasehold premises. The lease from the town to Bendall asserts the title of the town in the dock, and as both parties claim under it, it must be taken to be established.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-5\">From the deed of Bendall to Lowe it is clear that the lot granted by him was then 40 feet deep at the east end and 44 feet deep at the west end, including the wharf and reserving a way of 6 feet wide next the cove. By this deed Lowe acquired no other right \u00edntiie dock than to land goods. He did not acquire an inch beyond the wharf, and could not extend it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeaS\">The deed of the town to Lowe does not give any land outside of the wharf, which would come into the town\u2019s possession at a future time, but only grants the easements and privileges that would fall in at the expiration of Bendall\u2019s lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-8\">The dimensions of the east and west boundaries are not specified, but the lot is bounded northerly 90 feet on Ann street, 72 feet on the dock southerly, westerly by Bourne\u2019s warehouse, and easterly by Bendall\u2019s dock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b214-9\">It is agreed for the demandants, that this shows that the vharf had been extended so as to make the eastern boundary <em>on the dock ; </em>but there would be difficulty in this construction, for the dock did not probably run up to Ann Street; the deed may have meant, partly on the dock and partly on the land. In the former deed the boundary is said to be on Bendall\u2019s <em>land, </em>and the jury would judge therefore whether the word <em>dork </em>was not used by mistake for the word <em>land.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>It is also observable, that this eastern boundary is from 50 to 60 feet below the <em>locus in quo. </em>It is not likely that the wharves at that time projected far from the upland ; for in 1675 the town compelled Taylor, Wharton and Saffin to take the wharf which they had built, back to within 8 feet of their warehouses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-4\">It might be difficult, though important, to ascertain where the wharf was. It is said that it was extended as far out in 1726 as it was in 1784. When Dyer made his deed it was extended. The witnesses show that there was a space between the house and the dock. Pierce saw it measured in front of Joseph Tyler\u2019s and it was exactly 22 feet. If he is correct, the utmost limit would be 22 feet ; and this may have been acquired by disseisin, and there may have been a general enlargement by the tenants against the town, and it may have been done before the time of Dyer, and if it was done, the demandants might have become seised of the 22 feet.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">The tenant\u2019s counsel argued, that all the interest of Royal Tyler in the premises, passed by his deed to Scollay ; but for the purposes of the trial the judge ruled otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-6\">The demandants contended, that if they did not acquire title by Dyer\u2019s deed, they had acquired a title by disseisin, and had exercised acts of ownership over the wharf and dock; but the jury were instructed, that all the acts relied upon were as consistent with the right of easement in the soil, as with a fee ; they were all equivocal, and not much could be drawn from them.. Likewise, that very little could be drawn from the votes of the town, on either side ; the abutters had a right to resist the filling up, whether they had a fee or an easement in the dock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">It was contended by the tenant, that the town had acquired a perfect title by disseisin more than 40 years ago, by filling up the dock and destroying all beneficial use of it and the wharf, and paving the land up to the line of the house, without process of law. Upon this the jury were instructed, that but for the use made of it by the towrn, it was clear it would be an entire disseisin of the proprietors ; it was done in open day and in presence of the party resisting. It was said this was qualified by the use the town meant to make of it, and the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>is, whether it was a street. There is no evidence that it was laid out originally as a street according to the law of the land. no notice nor acceptance by the town; there had been disputes respecting the dock. If the jury were satisfied the act of the town was merely to make a street, it was not a disseisin. It depended on the view the jury should take of the intention with which it was done. The demandants\u2019 ancestor would have had a right of action for the disturbance of his easement, if he had any, or for the land itself, if he owned it.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b216-7\"><em>March </em>15<em>th. </em>1830.</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-9\">The jury returned a verdict, that the tenant did disseise the father of the demandants of two undivided third parts of a parcel of the demanded premises, beginning at a point 48 feet southward from Ann street and in the boundary line between an estate formerly of Joseph Tyler, now of N.

G. Laringe </em>for the tenant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASa\">In considering the. question of the admissibility of Dyer\u2019s deed to Tyler, it is material to ascertain what was the extent of the grant of the town to Lowe in-1645 ; and it is demonstrable that this grant did not embrace the <em>locus in quo. </em>Such being the fact, the deed of Dyer was inadmissible, because the town being the original owner of the fee, and there being no record of any conveyance from the town, and no evidence of possession by the demandants\u2019 ancestor, within forty years preceding the grant from the town to the tenant, the tenant cannot, be prejudiced by the production of a deed of this description, of which he never had notice until after his purchase.' To admit it is to make void the statute for the registry of deeds, and the statute of limitations. The only exception to the statute for the registry of deeds, is that of notice to the purchaser ; and the only case in which an ancient deed not recorded is ever admissible, is where it has been accompanied and followed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>possession ; which is considered as constructive notice to all the world. Here notice is attempted to be shown by evidence of mere possession by the demandants\u2019 ancestor, more than forty-four years before the bringing of this suit, and forty-two before the conveyance under which the tenant claims. It is to be observed that this is the only case in which this question could arise ; had any other person been in possession during that time, or had the town used the land in a different manner, the statute of limitations would have been a bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-4\">If the deed, on being admitted, would show a good title, still it is inadmissible because it was not seasonably recorded, and the tenant was not bound to look back further than forty years, for other notice of adverse title. That is the legal limit, and any thing anterior to forty years is not legal notice. The statute for the registry of deeds prescribes that deeds not recorded shall not avail against subsequent purchasers. To this rule the Court have made an exception in the case of notice to the purchaser, of a prior title. But another statute has provided that possession, to give title, must be within forty years ; and by parity of reasoning-, it must be so, to constitute notice of title. The foundation of the statute of limitations is the consideration, that if a party suffers his land to lie unclaimed for forty years, he shall be presumed to have granted or abandoned it; and a purchaser cannot be required to look further back. To permit the demandants, who had no recorded title when the tenant purchased, to come now and make out one by introducing a deed to be rendered admissible by parol testimony of possession more than forty year\u2019s ago, and thus to destroy the title of the tenant which was perfect' on the records, seems monstrous ; and yet such is the doctrine contended for. The tenant found that the town was the original owner of the fee ; that it had made no conveyance ; and that for forty years past it had used the <em>locus </em>as a public highway, without having obtained it by the forms of law prescribed' where the land of individuals is taken for such purposes ; and that no one, during that time, had had or claimed adverse possession ; and what better title could he expect or wish to find ? This is a new question, as to what constitutes legal notice of prior title, and it is for the Court to decida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>whether the time within which such notice shall be given, is or *s not material; and if it is, whether a better rule can be established than the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">It is said in answer, that as the town only used the <em>locus </em>as a street, which might be in pursuance of an easement only, and therefore did not imply ownership of the fee, the possession of the demandants\u2019 ancestor must be presumed to have continued as to the fee, and not to have been lost by such user by the town, and therefore that the tenant was bound to see who was the owner, and not to trust to this possession of the town. But this answer does not meet the difficulty ; for the true question is, not whether the demandants\u2019 ancestor had title, but whether, if he had, the tenant was duly notified of it before he purchased. If a grant from the town to the demandants\u2019 ancestor had been recorded, the answer would be entire, because the tenant would thereby have had due notice of ownership of the fee, and which would not have been incon sistent with such enjoyment by the town. But if the ancestor\u2019s title was acquired by deed not recorded, then as there was not any possession within forty years, there was no means foi the tenant to obtain notice ; and if acquired by disseisin, to permit a disseisor to show title by evidence of possession further back than forty years, would be to make a title by disseisin, in this respect, more available than one by deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-8\">But this answer is unsatisfactory for another reason, namely, that the <em>locus </em>was never laid out as a street, and the demandants therefore voluntarily relinquished that possession and those badges of ownership, which alone could have constituted notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-9-pl-split\">The only three sources of legal inquiry would show title in the town. Thus, in the registry of deeds, the town would be found the original proprietor, with no recorded grant from it, and in tracing up the title from the death of the demandants\u2019 ancestor, no specific conveyance to him or his predecessors would appear : \u2014 relying on the statute of limitations, it would be found that the town had had exclusive enjoyment for more than forty years : \u2014 and upon recurring to the legal proceedings required by law for laying out streets, it would appear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that none were ever adopted here. The inference therefore of ownership of the fee by the town, would seem irresistible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-3\">But a further objection to the deed is, that it shows no title. \u25a0 ft purports to be from Dyer, but there is no evidence that he ever had any title. For aught that appears, his title commenced with that act as a disseisin, and if it did, he never acquired a valid title, for the statute of limitations then required sixty years\u2019 possession to constitute a bar ; but this deed was made in 1726, and the town filled up the dock and converted the wharf into a street in 1783, thus obtaining possession ; and the- title not being perfect, it may be that he was evicted by writ of right or surrendered his title. The case shows an enjoyment by the demandants\u2019 predecessors, of easements merely, in the <em>locus in quo, </em>and not a seisin in fee. The evidence shows no acts necessarily presupposing ownership of the fee ; but on the contrary, all of them are entirely reconcilable with the easements intended to be granted in the original lease; and it is an established principle, that every presumption is in favor of the position, that the possession is- in subordination to the title of the true owner. The jury should have been instructed, that as these acts were equivocal, the demandants\u2019 predecessors should be considered as in the enjoyment of easements only. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>9 Johns. R. 163 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>12 Johns. R. 365 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>16 Johns. R. 293.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">We contend further, that in fact there was no act done which under any circumstances should be construed to be a disseisin of the town, considering the nature of the property and the interests of both parties. The lease to Bendall contained express permission to build wharves, the erection of them being one of the considerations of the grant; and all acts done, therefore, during its continuance, were in pursuance of the title acquired under that lease, and not adverse to it. But we rely on the principle of law, that there could not have ccurred a disseisin before this deed was made, because the lease of the <em>locus </em>from the town had not then expired; and during that tenancy there could be no disseisin of the town. But if the lease was forfeited, the town was not bound to \"enter for the forfeiture. And as the deed of D^er to Tyler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>was made before the expiration of the lease, the quitclaim C0UW pass only what title Dyer had, which was to easements under the grants of the town, and not a feeby disseisin ; and the demandants claiming under that deed, they cannot set up a better title than Dyer, their grantor, had. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Parker, 3 </em>Johns.

Nor was any entry necessary after the termination of the lease, for the town was then in the enjoyment of the <em>locus </em>as a highway.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfZC\">The introduction of the quitrent in the deed of Dyer to Tyler, is an acknowledgment by the grantor and grantee of the origin of their title, and of the rights of the town. And the payment of the rent in 1774 by the representatives of Royal Tyler, is also an acknowledgment of the town\u2019s title, and his descendants are estopped thereby from affirming that their ancestors were disseisors. It may be said that the deed of Dyer contains no admission of the town\u2019s title in relation to the soil on which the wharf was erected, the quitrent being limited to that part of the granted premises which lay north of the wharf. To this we answer, that as this deed was a secret transaction between Dyer and Tyler, not recorded, the town and those claiming under it could have no knowledge of Tyler\u2019s intention (if he had any such) to limit his payments of the rent to the north part of the land, but the treasurer must have received it as applicable to the whole estate, upland and flats, in one of which Tyler had a fee, and in the other, easements. If the deed had been recorded, it might possibly have been considered a disseisin of the town, and the acceptance of the rent of Tyler, under such a grant, he holding under it notoriously, might have been considered as an acquiescence on the part of the town, which after a lapse of time would bind the town ; but no such consequence can be legally predicated a deed not recorded. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>5 Cowen, 123.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Next, we contend that the acts of the town amount to a egal disseisin, as distinguished from a trespass or temporary injury. The law has provided \"the mode for the town\u2019s quiring a right of way on another\u2019s land, and when the way is assumed without recurrence to that mode, the legal presumption is that it is claimed as matter of right. The acts of the town were not equivocal. They had all the characteristics of a disseisin ; they were under a claim of right and in defiance of resistance ; were destructive of the usufructuary enjoyment by the demandants\u2019 ancestor ; were possessory and of continued possession ; were followed up by acts of ownership, such as raising, paving, widening, &amp;c. ; and constituted an entire alteration of the nature and character of the estate, converting it from a wharf into a street. As to the nature of disseisin, see Lit. \u00a7 279 ; Bracton, 161 ; 4 Dane\u2019s Abr. 721; <em>Fishar </em>v. <em>Prosser, </em>Cowp. 217 ; <em>Boston Mill Carp. </em>v. <em>Bulfinch, </em>6 Mass.

This is a writ of entry in which the demandants count on the seisin of Royal Tyler, their ancestor, and a disseisin in his lifetime by the tenant. As the tenant claims to hold under a conveyance from Royal Tyler, I shall first consider whether any part of the demanded premises passed by that conveyance. The land conveyed is bounded northwesterly on Ann street, there measuring thirty-one feet six inches, northeasterly on Conduit alley, there measuring fifty feet two inches, southeasterly on Dock square, there measuring twenty-eight feet six inches, and northwesterly on the estate of the late Joseph Tyler, there measuring forty-eight feet. This is a very particular description of the land intended to be conveyed, in respect to which there can be no doubt or uncertainty. The lines are short, and were measured, no doubt, with great exactness ; and therefore a mistake in the side lines of twenty or thirty feet cannot be supposed; and besides, I do not understand that any error appears by reference to the boundaries, at least not so as to affect the present question. The demanded premises at the time of the conveyance, were wholly within the limits of Dock square, and consequently were excluded by the terms of the description. The particular description, therefore, taken by itself is perfectly clear ; the only doubt, if there is any, arises from a sweeping clause which follows, and which it is contended enlarges the extent of the grant. The words are \u201c or however otherwise the same are bounded, or reputed to be butted and bounded, (being the mansion-house and land thereto belonging improved by the late Royal Tyler esquire at the time of his decease.)\u201d That these general words, if they stood\" alone in the deed, would be sufficient to pass the demanded premises as part and parcel of the mansion\u25a0nouse estate, cannot I think be controverted ; but the whole description is to be taken together, and is to be so construed that its rarious parts may, if possible, be consistent with each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>other ; and if this cannot be done, then the p irticular description is to be taken as expressing the intention of the parties, rather than general words or those sweeping clauses which are frequently inserted by the conveyancer, and which are passed over by the parties with little notice.* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The first part of the clause is very common in deeds of land, but is rarely of any importance. It is useful only when there is some inaccuracy or deficiency in the particular description ; but in cases like the present where the boundaries are certain, and the measure exactly ascertained, a reference to reputed bounds, or bounds not named, cannot vary the construction of a deed. As to the latter part of the clause, that is not inconsistent with the particular description. The land described was land belonging to the mansion-house ; but it does not follow that all the land so belonging was intended to be conveyed. I admit it would be otherwise, if this clause stood alone ; but taken with the other words of description, the intention of the parties appears sufficiently clear. There is a strong case in Cowper, (too strong perhaps) to show the effect of a sweeping clause in a deed, after a particular description. In that case, <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Magrath, </em>Cowp. 9,) lands had been conveyed for the purpose of making a family settlement, and two pieces of land were particularly described in the deed, after which description this clause was added, \u2014 <em>\u201c </em>together with all other his lands in Ireland.\u201d The grantor owned other lands in Ireland not described ; but the court held, that as the land sparticularly described were alone mentioned in the preamble as the lands intended to be conveyed, those lands only passed, and that nothing passed by the sweeping clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">In the present case, however, the general words, giving them a reasonable construction, are not inconsistent with the particular description, which is perfectly clear and definite.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">But it has been contended, that the soil and freehold in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>public square <em>may </em>pass as appurtenant, or that it will be presumed to be part and parcel of the granted premises, and the opinion of Chancellor <em>Kent, </em>as expressed in his Commentaries, is relied on in support of this position. \u201cThe idea,\u201d says Chancellor <em>Kent, </em>\u201cof an intention in a grantor to withhold his interest in a road to the middle of it, after parting with all his right and title to the adjoining land, is never to be pre sumed ; it would require an express declaration to sustain such an inference.\u201d 3 Kent, 349.</p>\n<p id=\"AoOb\">This may be substantially correct, especially if the description be loose ; but w'hen the lot conveyed is described by metes and bounds, and they clearly exclude the road, I apprehend it cannot be maintained that any part of the soil and freehold of the road will pass. If by the terms of the description the road is necessarily excluded, it is equivalent to an express declaration that no part of the road is intended to be conveyed ; and it is perfectly clear that the fee in the road cannot pass as appurtenant to the land adjoining. Much, therefore, as we respect the opinion of Chancellor <em>Kent, </em>we cannot agree with him when he adds, that if land is conveyed bounded by a highway, the soil and freehold to the centre of the highway will pass. The law here, and in England, and in New York \u2022and other states, is clearly settled, I apprehend, to the contrary. I am therefore inclined to think, that this remark was intended to be qualified by the previous observations as to presumptions in doubtful descriptions. If not so qualified, the remark is certainly opposed to the current of the authorities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only case referred to by Chancellor <em>Kent, </em>is the case of <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Connect. R. 103. In that case some novel principles are advanced, which I shall not stop to discuss. The case was decided by a bare majority, and among the judges who decided it there was a great diversity of opinion as to the grounds of the decision. Some of them held that the public had a fee in every public highway, and that the abutters had a defeasible freehold estate in it. Others were of opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>that the abutters had the fee, the public having omy an easement. No general principle, therefore, as to this point, appears to have been established by that case and the <em>obiter dicta </em>of the judges, conflicting as they are with each other, cannot be considered of much weight; and besides, we consider the law to be well settled in Massachusetts, however doubtful it may be thought to be in Connecticut.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is a well established principle here, that the public does not acquire the fee in the land, by the location of a public way over it, but an easement only. <em>Perley </em>v. Chandler, 6 Mass. R. 454 ; <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>4 Mass. R. 427 ; <em>Tippets </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>ibid. 595; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Emerson, </em>6 Pick. 57. And to the same effect are all the English and New York authorities. <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Alker, </em>1 Burr. 143 ; Com. Big. <em>Chimin, A </em>2 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. Hathaway, 15 Johns. R. 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">It is equally well settled, that land cannot pass as appurtenant to land, though a right of way may ; and it follows conclusively, we think, that no part of the demanded premises passed by the conveyance from Tyler to the tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The case therefore depends on the validity of the demand-ants\u2019 title. They rely on an ancient title derived from the town, made in the year 1648, and they set up another title commencing by disseisin. As to the ancient title, it is difficult to ascertain with certainty the extent. and limits of the land granted by the town. I am however inclined to the opinion, that the weight of the evidence as to this part of the case is against the demandants.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">But it is not necessary to decide this point, because we are all of opinion that the verdict may be well sustained on the title by disseisin, unless indeed it has been lost or barred by a new disseisin on the part of the town. There is sufficient evidence to warrant the jury in believing that the town had been disseised before the conveyance from Dyer to Tyler in the year 1726, unless the relation between the town and Dyer and those under whom he claimed was such as to disable him or them to set up any title by disseisin. That the wharf had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>been extended before the conveyance, beyond the limits of the land granted in 1648, if the tenant\u2019s argument is well founded as to the extent of that grant, is apparent from the language of the deed ; for the tenant\u2019s counsel contend, that the land sold with warranty was the whole of the land granted and demised by the town ; and it is a strong circumstance in favor of this position, that the wharf is sold without warranty ; which is a circumstance difficult to explain, if the house and wharf were held by the same title. Another circumstance is, that the quitrent is payable for the house-lot only. If then the wharf was beyond the limits of the lease and grant from the town, the erection of the wharf by Dyer would have been a disseisin of the town, unless it can be maintained that a lessee having a right of way or other easement over the land of the lessor, cannot disseise the lessor. It is quite clear that a lessee cannot, during the continuance of the term, disseise the lessor of the land demised, but the reason is, not because he cannot dispute the lessor\u2019s title, but because by the lease he is entitled to exclusive possession, so that he can do no act which can by possibility amount to a disseisin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The'case is quite different when he has only an easement in land adjoining the land demised ; for having only an easement, if he usurps the dominion over the whole estate and retains the exclusive possession of it against the will of the owner, this is a wrongful act amounting to a disseisin. So a joint tenant or tenant in common, although he has a lawful right to the possession of the land in common, yet if he ousts his co-tenant, it is a disseisin. Suppose a lot of land is leased with a right of way over an adjoining lot, and the lessee, instead of using the way, erects a building on it and occupies it for twenty years with the knowledge of the lessor ; can it be doubted that the lessor would lose his right of entry ? We think it is exceedingly clear, that upon the well established principles of the law of disseisin, such must be the legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The evidence therefore is sufficient to show a disseisin by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Dyer, and his right passed by his deed to William Tyler; \u25a0 and the instruction to the jury on this point was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">An objection has been made to the admission of this deed as evidence, which is acknowledged to be new, and which is very clearly without any foundation to support it. A deed duly executed, acknowledged and recorded, is always admissible evidence to prove a grant, whether the grant is a valid grant or not. Its operation is not to be examined before it is introduced, and therefore, if the tenant claimed under Dyer by a subsequent grant, it would be no objection to the introduction of the prior grant in evidence. It would not avail, it is true, if the subsequent deed was first recorded and the grantee had no knowledge, actual or constructive, of the former grant. But the tenant does not claim under Dyer, and it is exceedingly clear that this objection cannot prevail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The evidence of the exclusive possession of the Tylers from 1726 to 1783, when the dock was filled, and indeed several years later, is as full and as satisfactory as could be expected to be produced, after such a lapse of time. Pierce goes back in his recollec-. tion, as early as 1757, when the wharf was in the possession of William Tyler, extending then so far out as to include the land described in the verdict. This wharf was occupied as all other wharves were, and there is sufficient evidence to show that wharfage and dockage were paid to the Tylers. It was also proved, that Royal Tyler, the demandants\u2019 grandfather, repaired the wharf, gravelling it at times, and at one time supplying a new capsill ; so that the uninterrupted possession of the Tyler family for the whole time from 1726 to 1783, seems to have been satisfactorily proved, and there is no proof of claim to this part of the demanded premises on the part of tire town, during the whole period. Now it is clear, I think, that the demandants went much further than was necessary to establish their title by disseisin. It would have been sufficient to have begun with the possession of William Tyler in 1757. Pierce testifies that Tyler was then in possession; and he and his descendants certainly continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>in possession, without any interruption or claim hv the town, until 1783. The town then had lost their right of entry, and could not by an actual entry become re-seised of their former estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">But it is objected, that Dyer, holding under the lease to Bendall, could not disseise the town during the continuance of the lease, and that Tyler, claiming under the grant from Dyer, labored under the same disability. This disability however was removed in 1726, when the lease expired, and cannot be material. From that time until 1783, Tyler and his descendants continued in the open undisputed possession of the premises, claiming title, and such a possession certainly amounted to a disseisin.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">Then it was contended, that by the introduction of the quitrent in the deed from Dyer to Tyler, and by the payment of rent in 1774, he and bis heirs were estopped to deny the title of the town. This might be so if the w'harf had been included in the lot charged with the quitrent; but it was not; the house-lot alone was thus charged, and this objection also fails. It is not strengthened by the consideration, that the town had no knowledge of the deed from Dyer to Tyler. They had a right to demand an exhibition of his title ; their ignorance therefore, being the consequence of their own omission, cannot affect the demandants\u2019 legal rights. To constitute a disseisin, it is not necessary that the owner should have actual knowledge of the disseisin ; if the possession of the disseisor is open and adverse, and the owner has the means of knowing the fact, it is sufficient. But the town must have known that the quitrent was not paid on account of the demanded premises, for it was charged on the land granted ; which, according to their construction of the grant, included no part of the land now demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">The next question to be considered is, whether the tenant, on his part, can establish a title by disseisin. It is said that the entry of the town in 1783 or 1784, and filling up the dock, amounted to a disseisin of Tyler ; and we are of opinion that it did, if Tyler was then seised of the dock. Whether he was so seised or not, is immaterial, because if he were, the disseisin was only of the part filled up. The town claimed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>more at that time <em>] </em>and it appears by the votes of the town from 1757 to 1783, that there was no dispute with the abutters on the dock as to their title to their wharves, but the abutters claimed title to the dock ; and the committee appointed by the town to examine this claim, thus conclude their report : \u2014 \u201c Upon the whole, the committee having considered the long uninterrupted possession of the abutters and their predecessors, and having looked into a large number of deeds and town records, are of opinion, that the town has but little more than a right in common to that part of the dock meant to be filled up, and that it is most convenient, in the choice of difficulties, to make some composition with the abutters and to make them some offer for a release of their right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">So in the votes and proceedings of the town, the proprietors of the wharves are described as abutters on the dock, and their titles are not questioned, but impliedly admitted ; and although the use of the wharves was thereby destroyed, that might authorize the owners to maintain an action to recover damages for the injury, but it did not amount to a disseisin.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The subsequent 'proceedings of the selectmen, such as paving the square, were equivocal acts, which were properly submitted to the jury to determine with what intention they were done ; and they decided, we think, correctly. There was no evidence that the selectmen were authorized to assert the right of the town to the wharves; but as they were used as a public square or passage way, together with the dock when filled up, the selectmen were authorized to pave the whole for the public accommodation, and the act itself indicates the intent. The use of a way is not such exclusive possession as can amount to disseisin.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The last objection to the demandants\u2019 claim involves the construction of the deed from John S. Tyler to Royal Tyler. This is not very important, for if well founded, it would only give rise to another action. We think, however, that the objection is not well founded, and that there is a plain distinction between this deed, and the deed from R. Tyler to Seollay. In the deed to Scollay there is a particular description of the land intended to be conveyed ; whereas, in the deed from Tyler to Tyler, the words of description <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>are general. The mansion-house and appurtenances are conveyed, however they may be bounded, or any part thereof, or which at any time had been held and occupied or enjoyed as part or parcel of the same. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<otherdate id=\"b230-7\"><em>March </em>31st, 1831.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The case was afterwards referred by consent of parties, to assessors, to ascertain the betterments on the land described in the verdict, and the value of the land without the present buildings thereon ; and it was agreed that judgment should be rendered upon their report in the same manner as if the value of the land and of the improvements had been found by the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">The assessors reported, that the value of the betterments was $.2400 ; that the value of the land at the time of the verdict without any betterments, and considering it to be open southerly on a way or street, or to have a right of passage from the southern boundary thereof to North Market street was $ 3600 ; that considering it not to be so open nor to have such right of passage, the value was $2500 ; and that considering it to be subject to the easements of light, air and passage or way under the deed of Royal Tyler to Scollay, or any other title to such easements, the value was $ 1000. They further reported, that the demandants\u2019 counsel denied their right to inquire into any easements or incumbrances to which the land was liable, and to estimate the value of the land as being subject to such incumbrances ; and also denied their right to estimate the value of the land as not being open southerly on any way or street, or as having no right of passage or way from the southern boundary of the land to North Market street.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-11\"><em>Curtis </em>and <em>C.

No question has been made as to the value of the buildings and improvements, but the parties disagree as to the value of the premises. Three estimates have been reported by the assessors ; and it is submitted to the Court to determine which of these is most conformable to the legal rights of the parties. It is clear, that the land recovered must be estimated with all its privileges and appurtenances, and subject also to all existing incumbrances. It is admitted that the tenant, as owner of the mansion-house estate, had a right of passage over the premises, and that it still exists, unless it has been forfeited or extinguished ; so that the main question is, whether any thing appears which in law amounts to a forfeiture or extinguishment of this easement. It has been argued, that by the purchase of the tenant from the town, his right of passage merged in the fee ; and such would have been the legal effect, if both rights had been derived from the same title. But the tenant had the fee and the easement by different titles, the one legal and the other defective ; there was, therefore, .no merger.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nor can the tortious entry of the tenant under a defective title, claiming the fee, work a forfeiture of his legal rights, nor is he estopped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>to assert these rights by his having set up this defective title \u2122 defence. He had the right to try the validity of that title, without prejudice to his other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AFL\">It has, however, been objected, that if the tenant\u2019s right of passage did not merge in the fee, it was destroyed by his own act in erecting his buildings. This is true, but it does not affect the principles by which the value of the premises is to be estimated. This estimate was to be made without regard to the buildings and improvements. The assessors were directed to inquire and ascertain what would have been the value of the estate recovered, if no buildings and improvements had been made by the tenant. And this is conformable to the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The demandants set up a claim to a right of passage from the premises to North Market street, as appurtenant to the land recovered, but nothing appeared at the trial which can sustain this claim. The demandants\u2019 title commenced by disseisin and they could not claim a right of way by necessity, and no user was proved sufficient to establish a right. If there was ever a right of passage to the extent claimed, it was appurtenant to the mansion-house estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The result is, that the last and lowest estimate reported by the assessors is to be considered as fixing the value of the premises recovered ; and judgment is to be made up in conformity to that estimate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-6\"> See Anon.
