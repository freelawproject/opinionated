Browning is still living, and expenses are constantly arising for his support, for which the plaintiff is chargeable. The testator died insolvent, and his estate was so represented by the defendant; and commissioners were appointed, whose commission expired October 5, 1830, but they did not make any return of their doings, into the probate office, until December 22, 1830. The plaintiff laid before them his claim under the bond, on which they allowed the sum of 443 dollars ; which was in full for the expenses about Tristram\u2019s support up to the close of their commission, and no longer. The plaintiff, claiming a further allowance, gave notice of his objections to their report, pursuant to the statute, and duly commenced this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-7\">The case had been referred to an auditor, who had made a report, and the parties agreed that the Court should render such judgment in the suit as the law required.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-8\"><em>Merrick </em>said,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH3J\">that unless the plaintiff could have an allowance for expenses accruing subsequently to the return of the commissioners, he must continue to support Browning during his life, without any indemnity on the testator\u2019s bond ; that the agreement of the plaintiff to support Browning was in the nature of an annuity, and the amount which would be required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>might be rendered certain (and had been by the auditor) by a reference to tables of annuities.

This is an action of debt on an obligation made to the plaintiff by the defendant\u2019s testator, the condition of which was to pay a certain portion of the expenses of supporting one Tristram Browning, for whose support the parties to the obligation were to a certain extent liable. The testator\u2019s estate has been represented insolvent, and it is admitted that it is actually insolvent. The plaintiff laid his claim for expenses incurred for the support of Browning, before the commissioners of insolvency, which was allowed up to the close of their commission ; and he claiming further allowance, objected to their report, and thereupon gave notice of his objections, and commenced the present action in pursuance of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">The only question now is, whether any further allowance can by law be made on account of the plaintiff\u2019s liability for future expenses, Browning being still living ; and we are of opinion that no such allowance can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">That demands payable at a future day certain may be allowed by commissioners on insolvent estates, was decided in <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>6 Pick. 465. Such demands are considered due, although payable <em>in futuro, </em>and so are within the meaning, and indeed the words of the statute ; tmt the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s claim for Browning\u2019s future support is m no sense now \u201c due and owing,\u201d for it depends on contingencies whether it ever may become due. The bond is substantially a bond of indemnity, and if the plaintiff should fail to incur any expense for the support in question, either by reason of unwillingness or inability, he can have no claim for indemnity or contribution. So the amount of the expenses for the support of Browning depends on a contingency, both in respect to the continuance of his life, and the state of his health, which might render his support more or less expensive. If the testator\u2019s estate was not insolvent, it would be quite clear that the plaintiff could not recover beyond the amount due at the time of the rendition of judgment. By the <em>St. </em>1798, <em>c. </em>77, \u00a7 6, the Court is directed in such case <em>\u201c </em>to enter up judgment for the whole forfeiture, and to award execution only for so much of the debt or damage as is due and sustained at the time of the judgment.\u201d For future damages the plaintiff\u2019s remedy would be by <em>scire </em>facias, which is substantially a new action. It is true that he cannot have this remedy, the estate being insolvent, but no provision is made in the statute of insolvency to supply this defect, and it is for the legislature alone to consider whether the defect is such as to require their interposition. As the law now is, we think it clear that no claim can be allowed unless it is <em>debitum in prcesenti. </em>This was considered to be the law in <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>although the point was not discussed nor decided ; and so the law was held to be, in <em>Wilby v. Phinney, </em>15 Mass. R. 116, which in principle cannot be distinguished from the present case. The plaintiff and James Harrison, upon whose estate the defendant administered, were partners in trade and the firm was insolvent. The principal question was, whether the plaintiff could recover the balance due him from his deceased partner, there being outstanding claims against the firm, so that a final balance could not be ascertained. It was decided, that the plaintiff should recover the balance due at the time of the judgment, but not for any outstanding debts. \u201c We are aware,\u201d it is said, \u201c of another difficulty also, for which, however, there is no remedy. The plaintiff may hereafter be compelled to pay he outstanding debts, which have been represented as of con <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>siderable amount, and after f;he distribution of Harrison\u2019s es-late, he can have no relief.\u201d Now it was highly probable, and almost certain, that Wilby would have to pay the outstanding debts so far as he might be able, \u2014 and it did not appear that he was insolvent, \u2014 yet until actual payment he could claim no indemnity or contribution. And so in the present case, there is no reason to doubt that the plaintiff will continue to support Browning, he being liable for his support ; but nothing is due and owing to him from the testator\u2019s estate, by force of the obligation, except for expenses actually incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Judgment therefore, will be entered according to the audit or\u2019s report, excepting as to future expenses, which are disallowed for the reasons stated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\"> See Rev.
