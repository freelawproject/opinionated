The declaration alleges, that at Pelham, on April 3, 1829, Luther Henry and James Henry, the defendants, assaulted the plaintiff and with a deadly weapon struck him many heavy and dangerous blows, and terrified and affrighted him, by means of all which he has been put to great expense, has suffered great pain in body and mind, and his life been put in great hazard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-11\">Luther Henry pleads,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-12\">1.

That Luther, at the time when, &amp;c was lawfully seised m fee of a messuage and a dwellinghouse thereon, situate in Pelham, and then of right ought to have been in the quiet and peaceable possession thereof, and that the plaintiff was unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>fully in possession of the dwellinghouse and unlawfully withheld possession thereof from Luther, and though then and there requested by Luther to deliver him possession and permit him to enter, refused so to do, and forcibly detained the dwellinghouse from Luther, and with pitchforks and axes assaulted Luther and attempted to prevent him from entering into the dwelling-house ; whereupon Luther, in order to enter into the dwelling-house, did a little beat the plaintiff, exerting no more force than was necessary to enable Luther to enter into the dwelling-house, against the forcible and unlawful resistance of the plaintiff, as Luther lawfully might do for the cause aforesaid, which are the supposed trespasses, &amp;c. without this, that Luther was guilty of the supposed trespasses or either of them, elsewhere than in the dwellinghouse, <em>et hoc paratus, tyc.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-4\">3.

which laying of the hands upon Luther in the manner, &amp;c. was the same supposed assault in the plea mentioned to have been committed by the plaintiff; and thereupon Luther, aided and abetted' by James, of his own wrong committed the trespasses &amp;c. and without any such cause as in the plea is alleged ;

Luther sued out a writ upon this note, and on April 3, 1829, employed Z. Cook, a constable, to serve it by attaching property in the house above mentioned. The plaintiff was more than ninety years old. He had been one of Lyscom\u2019s family for ten years. Lyscom remained in possession of the house, and shut and fastened the door against Luther and the officer ; but there was a pane of glass wanting in the window, through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>which opening the officer put his hand and touched a wheel which was in the house, and Luther told him that that gave him a right to go in. Request was made of Lyscom to permit them to go in which was refused. Lyscom\u2019s wife was then in travail, of which fact notice was given to Luther. Lyscom told Luther that he would defend by force against the entry of Luther and the officer, and he and the plaintiff showed that they were armed with a pitchfork and a flail-staff. Whereupon Luther, James and Brown armed themselves, one with the shaft of a wagon, the two others with hoop-poles, and having broken open the door with a rail, they all entered, with the officer Lyscom and the plaintiff resisted, and Lyscom was knocked down, and the plaintiff received two blows upon the head with one of those weapons, from one of the party ; and this was the assault and battery tried upon the general issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-8\">The plaintiff called Lyscom as a witness ; who testified, that at the time of the assault, his wife was actually in travail and very ill ; and that he informed Luther of the situation and distress of his wife, before the door was broken in. To this evidence the defendants objected, but it was admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-9\">The counsel for the defendants moved the court to charge the jury, that Luther had a right, after request and refusal of admission, to break and enter the house by force and oust Lyscom, as the lease was at an end. And (for the purposes of the trial) the judge instructed the jury, that Luther had such right; and that if -he intended to enter for that cause, it should be taken into consideration in mitigation of damages. The counsel then further contended, that it ought to go in mitigation, although Luther did not intend to enter for-that cause, but to make the attachment on his writ. But the judge instructed the jury, that if he had no intent to enter and regain the possession of the house, but entered merely for the purpose of making the attachment, then the right to enter as landlord should not be considered in mitigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-10\">The j ury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-11\">If the last instruction was wrong, or if the above testimony of Lyscom ought to have been rejected, a new trial was to be granted.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"AbSq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Sept. </em>28th</otherdate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-2\"><em>Billings, </em>and <em>J.

PI. 578 ; <em>Oystead </em>v. <em>Shed, </em>13 Mass. R. 520 ; <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Lull, </em>Yelv. (Metcalf\u2019s edit.) 151 ; 1 Wms\u2019s Saund. 209, note 8 ; 2 Wms\u2019s Saund. 5, note 3. The plaintiff puts in issue the defendant\u2019s title, which cannot properly be <em>done </em>by a replication of <em>de injuria fyc. Jones </em>v. <em>Kitchin, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 76 ; <em>Crogate\u2019s case, </em>8 Co. 67.

But if the whole of the new matter is irrelevant, as we suppose it to be, and may be rejected as surplusage, then nothing remains but the genera traverse, and it ought to have concluded to the country. 1 Chit. Pl. 585.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-9\">As to the points reserved at the trial, they insisted that the intention with which the defendants entered was immaterial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-10\">If they had a right to <em>enter, </em>that was admissible in evidence to mitigate the damages. 3 Dane\u2019s Abr. 351.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-11\">The plaintiff\u2019s son has already recovered aggravated damages in consequence of the situation of his wife, and the evidence of her situation is therefore inadmissible in this action ; and besides, the declaration does not set forth her Situation in aggravation of damages. 3 Stark.

Bates, </em>and <em>Wells, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKFz\">The replication to the second plea contains an inducement which is in substance a sufficient answer to the allegations in the plea, but it does not confess and avoid, nor directly deny them, and it concludes as it ought to do, with a special traverse and verification, and not, as the defendants contend, with a general traverse.

The owner of a dwellinghouse cannot justify an entry upon a tenant at will or by sufferance, and repossessing himself by a strong hand and without notice to quit. 3 Bl. Com. 4, 5, 174 , Co.

R. 299.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-6\">To show that the evidence relative to the situation of the plaintiff\u2019s daughter-in-law was rightly admitted, they cited 3 Stark. Ev. 1450 ; <em>Merest </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>5 Taunt. 442 ; <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>2 Stark. Rep. 318 ; <em>Woert </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>14 Johns. R. 352 ; <em>Davenport </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>5 Day, 145 ; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>4 Pick. 216.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-9\"><em>Billings,- </em>in reply, contended that the defendant Luther had a right at common law, to enter into his own house unlawfully withheld from him by the plaintiff, who was a trespasser or disseisor, and that he was justified in using the force necessary to accomplish the object; 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 116 ; and he remarked that the <em>St. </em>1825, c. 89, \u00a7 4, saves to landlords all previously existing rights and remedies.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A3d\">Wilde J.</author>\n<p id=\"AL-b\">delivered the opinion of the Court. Several questions arise on the pleadings, and the defendants except also to the decisions of the judge and to his directions to the jury, as they appear in the report of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"Af3\">The case is trespass, in which the plaintiff complains of an aggravated assault and battery committed on his person by the two defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">In addition to the general issue, the defendants pleaded severally divers matters in justification, to which the plaintiff replied ; and to the several replications the defendants demur.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">In the first and second pleas in justification, of Luther Henry, he avers that he was, at the time mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, lawfully seised of a messuage and dwellinghouse situated in Pelharii, of which he ought then to have been in the quiet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>and peaceable possession, but which at the time when, &amp;c. was unlawfully withheld from him by the plaintiff, he then being, and before having been, in the unlawful possession of the same; and that for the purpose of entering his said dwellinghouse, he,</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Luther, did commit the assault and battery complained of, as lawfully he might, using no more force than was necessary to overcome the unlawful resistance of the plaintiff. '</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The plaintiff replies, that he and his son and family had been, for the space of a year before the time when, &amp;c. and at that time was, in the quiet possession of the dwellinghouse as his and their home, when Luther made a violent attack on the plaintiff, and beat and bruised him in manner set forth in the writ, and then and there forcibly broke open the dwelling-house, to the great terror of the family, and other wrongs then and there did.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The replication then concludes with a <em>general traverse </em>of the defendant\u2019s plea, and with a verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">This conclusion of the replication, with a verification, does not appear to be in conformity with the strict rules of pleading. The rule is, that where the whole substance of the last pleading is denied, the conclusion must be to the country ; otherwise the pleadings may be interminable, without coming to a formal issue. And it makes no difference that new matter is introduced by way of inducement to the general traverse, although if the traverse had been special it might be otherwise; for it is said, that where one of several facts alleged in a plea is selected and denied in the replication, the conclusion may be to the country, or with a verification. But this is by no means universally true. Sergeant Williams says, \u201c it may be laid down as a safe rule, that where a defendant cannot take any new or other issue in his rejoinder than the matter he had pleaded before without a departure from his plea; or where the issue in the rejoinder would be the same in substance as on the plea, the plaintiff ought to conclude to the country.\u201d We think this rule of pleading is correct, and it is supported by the modern authorities. 1 Saund. 103, <em>in notis; Robinson </em>v. <em>Bayley, </em>1 Burr. 319 ; <em>Boyce </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>1 Doug. 94. Courts do not and ought not to encourage prolixity of pleading; and therefore when one or more facts, which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>material and decisive of the merits of the case, are affirmed by one party and denied by the other, the conclusion should be to the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We do not, however, consider this objection and the other objections to the replications as material to the decision of the case, because we are of opinion that the pleas in bar are insufficient. These pleas attempt to justify the forcible entry into the plaintiff\u2019s dwellinghouse, on the ground that the defendant was the owner of the property, and that the plaintiff unlawfully withheld the possession thereof from him. The pleas admit that the plaintiff was in possession, and do not deny that he entered peaceably; yet the defendant asserts the right, not only of breaking open the house and entering therein with force and violence, but also of committing an assault and battery on the tenant with a dangerous weapon, for' the purpose of accomplishing his object. The use of the dangerous weapon and the degree of violence charged in the writ, are not denied by the pleas ; it is only averred that no more force was used than was necessary to enable the defendant to enter, and to overcome the plaintiff\u2019s resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"AfJ\">Such is the claim of right set up by these pleas ; a claim manifestly opposed to the fundamental principles of civil government. The law does not allow any one to break the peace and forcibly to redress his private wrongs. He may make use of force to defend his lawful possession, but being dispossessed, he has no right to recover possession by force, and by a breach of the peace. This is no defence in an action for the personal injury. This principle applies to the possession and dispossession of personal property, and ought especially to be rigidly observed in relation to a man\u2019s dwellinghouse, in which <em>he </em>is peculiarly prot&amp;cXyti by the law. 3 Bl. Com. 4, 5 ; <em>Gregory v. </em>Hill, 8 T. R. 299 ; <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>3 Johns. R. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">In the third special plea of Luther Henry, he avers that the assault and battery were committed in defence of the possession of his dwellinghouse, and the plaintiff replies <em>de injuria </em>&amp;c. in common form. We think no good exception can be taken to this replication. It is said that the general traverse puts in issue the defendant\u2019s title, and his seisin of the dwel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>.inghouse, but we do not consider the title as material; the replication only denies the defendant\u2019s possession, and that the assault and battery were committed in defence of his possession. The general traverse only-puts in issue the material facts alleged in the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\">The replication, however, to Luther\u2019s last plea cannot, we think, be sustained. It is bad, we think, for uncertainty, for it is hard to determine whether\u2018the replication was intended as a denial of the plea, or as a confession and avoidance of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The plea avers that the first assault was committed by the plaintiff, and the replication avers that the defendants broke open the dwellinghouse of the plaintiff, and beat, bruised and ill-treated him, and \u201cthat he in defending himself against them, gently laid his hands upon the said Luther, which was the same assault in said last plea mentioned,\u201d &amp;c. Now it is not distinctly averred in the replication, whether the plaintiff or the defendants made the first assault. The inference seems to be, that as the plaintiff avers that he acted in his own defence, the first assault was made by the defendants. If it was so intended, it should have concluded with the general traverse ; if oth erwise, the intention is not expressed with sufficient certainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">If the plaintiff did not intend to deny that he made the first assault, he should have confessed and avoided in direct and unambiguous language ; and it is very clear that nothing contained in this replication amounts to any such confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It is not necessary to notice the pleadings as to the other defendant, as they depend on the same principles and rules of pleading as those we have already considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">As to the exceptions to the proceedings at the trial, we think they cannot be sustained. Evidence showing the situation of the son\u2019s wife and family at the time of the assault and battery, was properly admitted to show the malice of the defendants and the aggravated suffering of the plaintiff. Thus it may be proved that an assault was made at a public place and m presence of many witnesses, although it may not be so alleged to have been done in the declaration. This is considered as matter of aggravation, and not as ground for the recovery of special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">So the circumstance that the defendants entered for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>pose of making an attachment, ought not to go in mitigation damages. It rather ought to aggravate the damages, for the defendants had no legal right to break open a dwellinghouse for such a purpose, and it was an abuse of legal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\n<em>On motion, leave to amend the replications to the defendant's last pleas.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
