It also appeared, that by reason of the overflowing caused by the defendant\u2019s dam, the plaintiff could not make use of his dam.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b468-10\">It was proved that the defendant purchased the land where on he built his dam, on August 30, 1825, and that he began to build his dam in a day or two afterwards ; that it was finished in November, and that the defendant, at a great expense, erected a cotton manufactory, which was put in operation in September 1827. The defendant might have built his dam further down the stream upon his own land, and have had ten or twelve feet head and fall upon his own land, but he supposed, that as the plaintiff had not erected a mill, he (the defendant) might, in virtue of the mill acts, make the dam as far up the stream as his own land extended, and so raise a head of water <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>by overflowing the plaintiff\u2019s dam, hy which he would obtain seventeen or eighteen feet head and fall.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b469-9\">Oct 7th.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-5\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-6\">At April term 1830, the plaintiff moved the Court, that in addition to the common execution for damages and costs, they would issue a warrant to the sheriff or his deputy, to abate and remove the defendant\u2019s mill dam, because it had been duly adjudged a nuisance to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-7\">\u25a0 In March 1831, the defendant filed a proposal to pay the plaintiff for the injury to his dam and mill privilege, such sum as three disinterested men should award.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b469-8\">The defendant mortgaged his estate to Upham and others, by deed dated November 20, 1826, and recorded on the 27th, which was before this action was commenced. Notice of the plaintiff\u2019s motion was given to the.mortgagees, by order of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-10\"><em>J. Davis </em>and Washburn,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABH\">in support of the plaintiff\u2019s motion, referred to <em>St. </em>1828, <em>c. </em>137, \u00a7 6, which provides, that \u201cwhen judgment shall be rendered for the plaintiff in any action on the case for a nuisance, the court may, on motion of the plaintiff, in addition to the common execution for damages and costs, award and issue a warrant to the sheriff or his deputy, to abate and remove the nuisance at the expense of the defendant, in like manner as public and common nuisances are abated and removed.\u201d Where a warrant of abatement would issue for a public nuisance, the court will issue one for a private nuisance under this statute ; and this is such a nuisance as, if public, would be abated. The case is within the reason of the provision, which is, to prevent a repetition of lawsuits and of breaches of the peace. The judgment of the Court has determined the defendant\u2019s mill to be a nuisance, and it must continue to be one until it is abated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-11\">The statute is not retroactive as applied to this case. Our motion is, to do away the nuisance for the future. Besides, the statute creates no new right, but only gives, in a new form, a remedy which the plaintiff had before at common law. <em>Foster v. Essex Bank, </em>16 Mass. R. 245 ; <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Callender, 6 </em>Mass. R. 309 ; <em>Holyoke </em>v. <em>Haskins, </em>9 Pick. 259.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b469-12\"><em>Lee, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkZ\">said the statute was passed after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>action was brought, though before the defendant\u2019s dam was adjudged a nuisance ; and he contended that the statute would be retrospective and unconstitutional, if construed to apply to this case ; and <em>2. </em>that it was discretionary with the Court to grant or refuse the warrant, and under the circumstances, the Court would leave the plaintiff to choose between the proposed arbitration and his remedy at common law.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b470-6\">\n<em>Oct 11th.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b470-8\"><em>Hoar </em>and <em>Newton</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHn\">opposed the plaintiff\u2019s motion, because the mortgagees had had no opportunity of being heard at the trial of the action, and they were not concluded by the judgment against the mortgager. Com. Dig. <em>Fine, I1, </em>cites <em>2 </em>Inst. 516, and <em>I3, </em>cites 1 Vent. <em>82 </em>; 1 Phil. Evid. (New York edit.) <em>223.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b470-9\">Putnam J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqi\">delivered the opinion of the Court. We are satisfied that the <em>St. </em>1828, c. 137, \u00a7 6, does not make it the duty of the Court to grant a warrant for the abatement, unless they should deem it expedient to issue such a warrant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And also, that this statute is remedial and constitutional, and not <em>ex post </em>facto.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">And we all think that it is not expedient to grant the warrant for the abatement of the nuisance, for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">It appeared in evidence upon the trial, and is not denied at this hearing, that Clark had erected very expensive manufac tories below the dam which has been found to be a nuisance, and that comparatively, the dam and mill privilege of the plaintiff are of small value. No action has been brought for the continuance of the nuisance since the verdict was rendered. If one were to be commenced and laid before another jury, they would take great care to give an adequate compensation m damages. In ordinary cases, the Court would not be disposed to interfere in the summary way of abatement, until other remedies should fail of giving complete justice to the party injured. Besides, the remedy given by the statute above cited is cumulative. And the party who sustains an injury from a nuisance may abate it himself, in the manner prescribed oy the law, or have his action for the damages:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>It has been suggested, however, that Clark, against whom the judgment was recovered, is a bankrupt ; and that a suit against him and a judgment upon a recovery of damages, would be wholly unproductive. It is admitted that he has now no interest in the dam which was found to be a nuisance, but that it is held by Upham and others under Clark\u2019s deed, which was made and recorded before the action was brought against Clark. Now an action may be sustained against those who continue the obstruction, and it is not contended but that they are solvent. If they are bound by the former judgment, then the plaintiff will be sure of his damages. If they are not bound by the former judgment, then it would be manifestly unjust to abate the dam before they have been heard upon the lawfulness of its erection. It is said that it can be proved that they had notice and were present (or might have been) at the former trial, and therefore cannot set up this defence. But we cannot know that to be the case judicially. The record of the Court in the case does not give any evidence of the alleged fact. It is true that they are only mortgagees ; but to many most important purposes, the interests of the mortgager and mortgagee are distinct. In the case of <em>Colton </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>at Hampden this circuit, it was held that a partition made by the mortgager was void as against the mortgagee.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\">The result may be, that the plaintiff may find it necessary to bring another action against those who now keep up the dam, and who claimed a title in the premises before the former action was brought; and we cannot help the plaintiff in that respect, much as we desire to prevent litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Upon the whole, we decline at present to grant the warrant. The opinion of the Court is, that the plaintiff shall take nothing by his motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-12\"> See Rev.
