The appeal is from the appraisal or assessment made by the board of street commissioners, which is complete upon the filing of their certificate with the city clerk, and of which the publication of the certificate forms no part. The fact that the appraisal does not become \u201cbinding and conclusive \u201d upon the day of the first publication, does not affect the right of appeal. It does not become \u201c binding and conclusive upon the parties \u201d by the last publication, even if no appeal is taken, nor does it become so until the common council orders the improvement in question to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Again, since the ordinance providing for the publication of notice does not require it to be made on consecutive days in any paper, nor upon the same days in all the papers, and does not limit the number of publications to two, it might become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>not only inconvenient but extremely difficult for one to determine when he might appeal or on what day he should make his appeal returnable, if he were required to ascertain the latest day of publication of the appraisal in any of the several daily papers. In this case the second publication in the <em>Post </em>was probably on the 20 bh and in the other papers on the 21st, so that if the appellee\u2019s claim should be upheld, one taking such an appeal could, safely, neither make it returnable three weeks subsequent to the date of the only publication of the appraisal which he' observed, since that might not be the second publication, nor three weeks subsequent to the date of the second publication in the one paper which he might read, since the second publication in another paper might\u2014as seems to have been the fact in this case\u2014be on a later day, nor even three weeks subsequent to the latest second publication after he had learned that it had been published twice in all the papers, since more than two publications might have been ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">A construction which would make so uncertain the time when an appeal could be taken or made returnable, and so difficult of ascertainment by the persons who by the Act of 1873 are entitled to an appeal from such appraisals, would render the provision fixing such time an unreasonable one. It would tend to defeat rather than subserve the purpose of the amendment of the charter in 1873, that of allowing appeals from such appraisals to a judge of the Court of Common Pleas, by preventing, instead of permitting, the taking of such appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The purpose of requiring the appraisal to be published at least twice in every daily paper, was to give one notice to every party in interest. It was not intended that each person should receive the same notice twice nor that he should receive it from several different papers. One who has read a single publication of the appraisal in any one of the daily papers, ought not, to enable him to appeal, to be compelled to look for other notices, which will furnish him no further information, nor to delay his appeal until he has ascertained that the city has performed its duty by completing the notice prescribed by the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>The time when an appeal may be taken and made returnable is, however, made by the Act of 1873 to date from \u201c the day on which public notice of said appraisal shall have been given,\u201d and not the day on which it was actually received. As the publication is made for the benefit of the property owners, and made on more than one day, anyone of such persons, whether he has read any of the notices on the day of its publication or not, should be permitted for the purposes of an appeal to adopt any one of the several days on which he learns that the certificate of appraisal was in fact published in compliance with the ordinance, as the day on which public notice was given. The appeal in this ease was properly made returnable on March 11th.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The judgment dismissing the appeal was erroneous and is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
