The defendant at the time the agreement was made did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>not have the gray mare in his possession, and did not intend to deliver the same as he had agreed, but falsely and fraudulently represented to the plaintiff that he had such a gray mare and that he would deliver the same as aforesaid, and thereby induced the plaintiff to part with his said horse. 8.

The court overruled said claims and rendered judgment for the plaintiff for $30.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-10\"><em>J.

It alleges that the defendant by certain false and fraudulent representations, which are set forth, induced the plaintiff to part with his horse of the value of $100. It also describes a cause of action for breach of contract. It alleges that the defendant failed to perform his agreement to deliver a certain gray mare in exchange for the horse which he had received from the plaintiff. \u2022 The dealings between the plaintiff and defendant with reference to an exchange of horses was the transaction out of which both the alleged causes of action arose, and a statement of all the claimed facts of the entire transaction therefore involved a statement of both of said causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Under our practice the plaintiff had the right to state in one count the entire transaction, and to submit to the court the question whether, upon the facts, he was entitled to recover the value of the horse which he had delivered to the defendant, upon the ground that he had been induced to part with it by the defendant\u2019s fraud, or only the value of the horse which the defendant had promised to deliver to bim in exchange, upon the ground that his only right of action was for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The court having found that the defendant failed to perform his agreement, but that there was no fraud in the transaction, properly rendered a judgment for damages for breach of contract. <em>Craft Refrigerating Machine Co. </em>v. <em>Quinnipiac Brewing Co., </em>63 Conn. 551; <em>Metropolis Mfg. Co. </em>v. Lynch, 68 Conn. 459, 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
