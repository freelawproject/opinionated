Whereas the Hartford Street Railway Company, a corporation chartered by the State of Connecticut for the purpose of operating street railways in said State, and now operating railways therein, did on September 5th, 1899, present its petition to the mayor and court of common council of said city of Hartford, setting forth its plan of relocation of its tracks and the laying of additional tracks in said city in accordance with the statutes of the State in such cases made and provided, said proposed location of its tracks being stated in said plan as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-8\">\u201c <em>First. </em>Said company proposes to relocate it present existing track and lay one additional track on Farmington Avenue of said city as follows, namely, commencing at and connecting with its present double track on Asylum Street, at the intersection of Asylum and Farmington Avenues, thence running westerly through Farmington Avenue to Prospect Avenue and connecting with the single track at said point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-9\">\u201c <em>Second. </em>The track so proposed to be laid as aforesaid will be a double track.

And whereas the plan of said Hartford Street Railway Company for relocating its tracks and laying additional tracks in Farmington Avenue, as proposed and shown on its said map, was accepted and adopted by said court of common council September 8th, 1899, and approved by the mayor September 9th, 1899.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-8\">\u201c 3. And whereas said Hartford Street Railway Company soon thereafter completed the construction of its double tracks and cross-over switches in accordance with the plan accepted and adopted as aforesaid,- and one of said crossover switches was constructed in and between said double trades located in front of No. 116 Farmington Avenue, which location is about nine hundred and fifty feet east of Sigourney Street, and said railway company, having completed said construction, immediately thereafter commenced to run its cars over said double tracks, and ever since has, and still continues so to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-9\">\u201c 4. And whereas said cross-over having been constructed in front of No. 116, it was found by Charles P. Howard, residing at said number, that the running of the cars on the tracks of said railway company and over the frogs of said cross-over caused so much vibration and noise at his house as to be a great annoyance and discomfort to the occupants thereof. Mr. Howard appeared before the board of street commissioners and remonstrated against the cross-over being continued as located, and a full hearing was had by said board on his complaint, at which hearing said railway company was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>represented by Mr. Crawford, its general manager.

Howard. Mr. Howard has remonstrated against the cross-over being continued as located, as it is the cause of great annoyance to him, in fact the annoyance is so great as to practically become a nuisance. Mr. Howard\u2019s house is situated on about the center of a quicksand bed which covers a large area of this portion of Farmington Avenue. The railway company asked leave to relocate the cross-over near Beach Street, but the proposition met with almost the unanimous opposition of the neighboring residents, and the change was given up. The cross-over was provided for in a plan submitted to and approved by your honorable court, and is a convenience to the railway company in case of accident or the running of special cars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b342-9\">\u201c\u2018In looking for a suitable place to relocate the cross-over we find that no one wants it at any point between Asylum Hill and Sigourney Street, and therefore recommend that your honorable court order the removal of the cross-over, which can be done under the Public Acts of 1893, Chapter 169, \u00a7 3.

Howard called at the office of said Hartford Street Railway Company and personally notified Mr. Crawford, its general manager, of the passage of said order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-6\">\u201c More than thirty days have elapsed since said notice of its passage was served on said railway company, and no appeal having been taken from said order within said thirty days, the same has become operative and binding on said railway company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-7\">\u201c 6.

And whereas said cross-over in front of No. 116 Farmington Avenue has not been removed, and said Hartford Street Railway Company refuses to remove the same as required by said order; as by the application on file of William J. McConville, city attorney for the city of Hartford, and in behalf of the city of Hartford, it is understood.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-17\">44 Now, therefore, that due and speedy justice may be done in this behalf, it is hereby required and enjoined of you, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>said Hartford Street Railway Company, that before the first Tuesday of May, 1900, you remove said cross-over located on Farmington Avenue in front of No. 116, as required by the said order of the mayor and court of common council of said city of Hartford, and in all respects to obey said order and conform to the laws of this State in regard thereto, or signify cause to the contrary thereof to this court to- be holden at Hartford, within and for the county of Hartford, on the first Tuesday of May, 1900, at ten o\u2019clock in the forenoon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">The motion to quash specifies the following reasons: \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-7\">\u201c (1) Because the allegations in said writ and motion contained are insufficient in law to sustain such action. (2) Because \u00a7 3, Chapter 169 of the Public Acts of 1893, permits a municipality to order the removal of street railway tracks, only when such removal is incident to an order for some public improvement in the highway. (3) Because the authority of the city of Hartford over the tracks of the defendant, constructed under authority of the General Assembly, does not include the right to arbitrarily order such tracks taken up. (4) Because, if the city of Hartford has authority to order a switch track removed except as an incident to a public improvement in the highway, such authority requires said city to provide for the relocation of such switch track. (6) Because it does not appear that the court of common council referred the resolution containing the alleged order, for a hearing thereon, or gave this company reasonable notice or any notice whatsoever that such proposed order was pending; and it does not appear that this company was ever heard or given opportunity to be heard upon such proposed order. (6) Because it does not appear that there ever has been any service of notice of the passage of the alleged order upon this company. (7) Because the alleged mailing by the city clerk of a copy of the alleged order addressed to the company, and the alleged notification by word of mouth by one Howard, to this company\u2019s manager of the passage of the alleged order, was not a legal or sufficient service of notice of the passage of such order. (8) Because this company\u2019s right of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>to the Honorable Superior Court from the alleged order, has not terminated, and will not accrue until due and legal service of notice thereof has been made upon this company. (9) Because it does not appear what modifications in the plans of the street railway company named in the alternative writ were made by the mayor and court of common council of the city of Hartford, nor that, in said plan as modified pursuant to law, the power to locate and relocate switches and turnouts was not delegated to the entire and exclusive control of the board of street commissioners of said city. (10) Because it does not appear that the city of Hartford by its board of street commissioners has not since the alleged passage of said order given directions to this company inconsistent therewith.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">The trial court granted the motion to quash, \u201c for the reasons set up in the 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th and 5th paragraphs thereof,\u201d and dismissed the alternative writ with costs to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-9\">The reasons of appeal assign error in these rulings of the trial court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-10\"><em>Edward B. Bennett </em>and <em>William J. MeOonville, </em>for the appellant (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-11\"><em>Imams F. Robinson, </em>with whom was <em>John T.

The cross-over in question was not constructed in accordance with the plan approved by the mayor and court of common council. 2. The council is authorized by \u00a7 3 of the Act of 1893 (Public Acts of 1893, p.-308), to order the removal of a cross-over thus constructed, and such order may be enforced by mandamus. 3. It was not necessary for the council to formally refer the order to the board of street commissioners, and the hearing had before the commissioners was equivalent, for all purposes affecting the order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>to a hearing before the council. 4. The defendant received sufficient notice of the making of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We think each of these propositions is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\"><em>First. </em>It is alleged that the cross-over as approved by the council was one \u201c located about 420 feet east of Sigourney Street\u201d; and that the cross-over constructed by the defendant is \u201cabout 950 feet east of Sigourney Street.\u201d This difference of more than 500 feet is enough to prevent the defendant (certainly as against any order of the council enforcing its power of control over placing the track) from claiming that the track has been constructed in accordance with the plan approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\"><em>Second. </em>Prior to 1893 no street railroad could lay down any rails in the streets of a city except in the manner prescribed by the common council, nor use any new motive power without the permission, subject to revocation, of the mayor and common council. General Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 3595, 3596. Section 1 of the Act of 1893 repealed these sections ; and \u00a7 2 prescribed the mode of proceeding in using the authority given to any company to construct a street railroad within a city, or to lay down additional tracks; or when it desired to change its motive power. It provided that before exercising the authority to lay down additional tracks, the company must present to the mayor and court of common council for its approval, a plan showing, among other things, the location or position of its tracks in the streets; and it forbade the company to lay any tracks except in accordance with a plan so approved. This section, with the Act of 1895 authorizing in certain cases a judicial review (Public Acts of 1895, p. 630), covers the whole subject of obtaining the special municipal authority necessary to the construction of the tracks in pursuance of the general or legislative authority. But it was deemed necessary that after the tracks of a company had been permanently located in the streets by the approval of a plan as provided in \u00a7 2, the mayor and court of common council should not only have direction and control over the placing of tracks in accordance with the plan and over certain matters of detail not specified in the plan, but should have power to revise and change such orders as might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>be involved in the approval of the plan, and such as might be made in the exercise of the power of control over its execution. Sections 3 and 11 of the Act were framed to accomplish these purposes. Section 3, whatever other effect it may have, confers on the mayor and court of common council the power of direction and control over placing the tracks and other structures in accordance with the plan approved, and includes the power of directing their removal when not so placed; and provides that orders necessary to the exercise of such power may be enforced by mandamus at the instance of the city. The application of the defendant for approval of its plan for laying an additional track, and the consequent relocation of its existing track, is governed by \u00a7 2, and the construction of both tracks, including the cross-over, must be in accordance with the plan approved. When, therefore, the defendant departed from that plan in laying the cross-over, an order to remove the track thus laid was authorized by \u00a7 3, and may be enforced by mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>Third. </em>While an order like the one in question is not made dependent for its validity on giving the defendant notice of its pendency (although it may be that in common fairness the defendant should in some way have an opportunity to be heard before its final passage), and while the law does not require the council to refer such an order to the board of street commissioners,\u2014yet that board, in the exercise of powers vested in it, might properly consider a complaint from an adjoining landowner who claimed that the track in front of his premises was unauthorized, or practically a nuisance, and after a hearing in pursuance of such complaint upon the question of the removal of the track, at which the defendant was represented, might properly recommend the council to order its removal. An order passed by the council under such circumstances cannot be treated for any purpose as one passed without reasonable notice to the defendant or opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>The Act of 1893 requires the order to be in writing and recorded in the city records. It does not provide that it shall be served on the railroad company, nor how it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>shall be brought to its notice. <em>We </em>think that a copy of the order sent by the city clerk by mail to the defendant, with actual notice of its passage as alleged in the writ, was notice to the defendant of the passage of the order, within the implied requirements of this section. Assuming, as the defendant claims, that the Act of 1895 should be held, on equitable considerations, to operate as a suspension of the defendant\u2019s obligation to obey the order until thirty days from \u201c service of notice\u201d of its passage shall have elapsed, we think the \u201cservice of notice\u201d in such case should not be held to require any other notice to the defendant than that sufficient to make the order binding on the defendant under \u00a7 3 of the Act of 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">It follows that the trial court erred in sustaining the motion to quash on the grounds stated in the order for judgment; and, in the view we have taken of the law, no one of the other grounds specified in the motion is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">It is urged that the court might, in the exercise of sound discretion, refuse an issue of the peremptory writ; but in this case the court has not reached the question of discretion; it has dismissed the alternative writ solely because it has ruled that the allegations of the writ are insufficient in law. There certainly is nothing in this r\u00e9cord to require a refusal of the writ in the exercise of legal discretion, and we are not called upon to review such action.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">The writ does not in terms allege that the order was recorded. We do not consider the question whether this omission is a defect which might have been taken advantage of, and if so, whether the informality is such as must be regarded as waived when not specifically pointed out. It is hardly reasonable, upon the facts appearing in the record, to doubt that the order was in fact recorded. If the order was not recorded and the defect is one of substance and for that reason fatal, a reversal of the judgment, as erroneous on the grounds stated, cannot foreclose the defendant\u2019s rights. Under these circumstances we ought not\u2014in the exercise of a discretion always to be used with caution\u2014to decide or consider this question, which has not been argued and which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>does not- appear by the record to have been raised at the trial and to have been decided by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">There is error; the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
