When said Jessie B. Seeley (Marshall) arrived at twenty-five years of age, she was a young woman of more than ordinary mental capacity, and in the judgment of said trustees she was then and ever afterwards during her life capable of managing her affairs. Had she then demanded her property, the trustees would have transferred the same to her and thereby executed all the powers and trusts conferred upon them by the will of Phineas T. Barnum, they fully believing that she had the right to have the discretion resting in them, if any, exercised on their part so as to transfer said estate, but she did not at that time and never in her lifetime did demand said transfer, nor was the same ever made, except in part, as hereinafter set forth; and as most of said trust property was in large blocks of real estate which it was difficult to divide, it was with her full acquiescence and consent allowed to remain in the hands of said trustees, but without any intention on her part or the part of the trustees to in any way prejudice her in her rights under the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>visions- of said will. The difficulty of dividing said-property was no other than the difficulty that necessarily inheres to \"the joint-ownership of real estate. The trustees held and still continued to hold said property, and this was substantially the situation when suddenly and unexpectedly said Jessie B. Seeley Marshall died on August 6th, 1897, soon after giving birth to her first and only child, Wilson Marshall, Jr. At the time said Jessie B. reached twenty-five years of age, the improvement of the land on which the Court'Exchange, so-called, now stands, the same being a part of said trust property, was contemplated, but neither of the parties interested could alone carry out the same, as it required an outlay of over $100,000. On October 24th, 1896, said trustees conveyed to her an undivided one-third interest in said Court Exchange, and she joined in a mortgage of. $50,000, given to secure her and the others\u2019 joint note for that amount on said property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">\u201c Soon after said Jessie B. reached twenty-five years of age, 'said trustees transferred and paid over to her out of said trust fund various securities and sums of money aggregating at least $24,430.74. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">Mr. Barnum, the testator, died on the 7th day of April, 1891.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5i\">The three questions which are reserved for the advice of this court may conveniently be considered as one: Did the property bequeathed to Mrs. Marshall, then Jessie B. Seeley, vest in her when she became twenty-five years of age ? Tf it did, then the whole case becomes very simple: it was her estate and must be settled according to law. And upon the facts set forth in the record we are very clearly of the opinion that it did. The beneficial interest vested in her at the death of the testator,, and the entire estate, free from the trust, when she became twenty-five years old. The case of <em>Newbury </em>v. <em>Hinman, </em>49 Conn. 130, is in point, and is decisive of this case. There a testator said: \u201c I give and devise to <em>C </em>in trust for my son <em>L </em>one thousand dollars, the interest to be used for his benefit until of lawful age, then the principal to be his or his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d <em>L </em>survived the testator but died before arriving at lawful age. This court held that the property vested in <em>L </em>at the death of the testator, and that his administrator was entitled to demand and receive it of the trustee. The cases cited in the opinion in that case abundantly sustain the decision. See also <em>Dale </em>v. <em>White, </em>33 Conn. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">But the language of the will really leaves no room for construction. By its terms a certain portion of the testator\u2019s estate is given in trust for the benefit of his granddaughter\u2014 Jessie B. Seeley\u2014the income to be applied for her \u201cuse and benefit . . . until she shall reach twenty-five years of age, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>and then to pay and transfer to her the principal, together with all the accrued income.\u201d When Jessie B. Seeley reached the age of twenty-five years the trust ceased as to her, unless that condition of things in respect to her was found to exist upon which the will provides that the trust should continue: that, \u201c in the judgment of the said trustees or their successors, she should be incapable of managing her affairs.\u201d This provision of the will required, in order to continue the trust, an affirmative act of judgment by the trustees, at the time she became twenty-five years old, to the effect that she was incapable of managing her affairs. <em>Seeley </em>v. Hincks, 65 Conn. 1. In the absence of such an affirmative act of judgment the trust ceased. The facts in the record show not only that there never was any such act of judgment by the trustees, but that on the contrary they by their acts adjudged that she was entirely capable of managing her affairs. In this condition the command of the will to the trustees was to pay over to Jessie B. Seeley the principal of the \u2019fund which they held for her, together with all the accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">It appears that as to a considerable portion of the property in their hands and belonging to said Jessie B. Seeley, the trustees had not done any formal act of passing the title to her. Counsel for the trustees suggest that \u201c she died before receiving the same,\u201d and that therefore the trust continues until her child reaches twenty-five years of age. This suggestion is without force. The words cited from the will evidently refer toothe death of Jessie before she should reach the age when the trust was to cease. Besides, in the common understanding, as well as in the contemplation of the law, Mrs. Marshall, being the devisee of an estate in fee simple absolute, \u201c received \u201d that estate at the moment when she became entitled to receive it. <em>Johnes </em>v. Beers, 57 Conn. 295; <em>Harrison </em>v. Moore, 64 id. 344, 348; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Bolles, </em>65 id. 45; <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Benedict, </em>72 id. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The Superior Court is advised that the portion of Mr. Barnum\u2019s estate named in the clause of his will mentioned in the complaint, vested in Jessie B. Seeley in her lifetime and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>is now her estate, and to make such order in the premises as is necessary and proper to carry the will into legal effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">No costs to be taxed in this court in favor of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
