Tyrrell, now of said Waterbury, being then engaged in the business of selling and delivering milk in said city of Waterbury with force and arms did then and there, as a part of said regular business of selling and delivering milk in said city as aforesaid, unlawfully offer and expose for sale certain milk, without first having obtained from the board of health of said city of Waterbury a license so to do, against- the peace, of evil example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and contrary to the ordinance of said city of Waterbury in such case made and provided.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-6\">The other counts are identical with this one, save that in the second the unlawful act is did \u201c sell certain milk; \u201d in the third, \u201chave in his possession with intent to sell, certain milk;\u201d in the fourth, \u201c deliver for sale certain milk;\u201d and in the fifth, \u201c deliver for consumption certain milk.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-7\">The ordinance of the city is set out in substance in the case of <em>State </em>v. Gallagher, 72 Conn. 604, 605. The defendant demurred to the information; the court sustained the demurrer, and the State has appealed. There is in reality but one assignment of error: that the court erred in sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b420-8\"><em>Nathaniel R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXA\">There is no error. The information is insufficient. Judging the ordinance of the city of Waterbury, referred to in the statement, by its words, we should be led to believe that the purpose of the board of aldermen in passing it was to prevent the sale and consumption in that city of impure or adulterated milk. To accomplish that purpose the ordinance is intelligent, consecutive, and adapted to the end in view. But the charter of the city forbids the board of aldermen to enact any ordinance upon any matter which is or shall hereafter be regulated by any public statute, or the power to regulate which has been or shall be conferred upon any other authority by any public statute. The General Statutes of 1888, \u00a7\u00a7 2658 to 2664 inclusive, together with Chap. 235 of the Public Acts of 1895, provide full regulations in respect to adulteration of milk. If, then, the purpose of the aider-men was to regulate the sale of impure milk in Waterbury, it would appear that the ordinance was in excess of their power to enact. So we must suppose that they had some other purpose in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>What that other purpose was, does not, perhaps, very clearly appear. Nor is it material now to inquire what it was. If all the milk brought into the city for sale was known to be pure, it would seem that the aldermen would have no occasion, even if they had the authority to do so, to pass an ordinance requiring a license fee from the seller, or to subject him to a rigorous and offensive inspection. We have, however, no occasion to decide this.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Granting that the ordinance is not invalid (which we do for the purpose of this case), we think the demurrer was properly sustained. In every criminal information all the facts must be alleged which are necessary to show the defendant\u2019s guilt. If all such facts are not alleged, then the information is insufficient. In testing the sufficiency of any such information, no fact is supposed to exist except such as appear in it, either by direct averment or by necessary implication. In the information before us the defendant is charged with the doing of certain things, \u201c without first having obtained from the board of health of said city of Waterbury a license so to do.\u201d Now upon the facts set forth in the information\u2014and the court is not informed of any others\u2014if the defendant had applied to the board of health of Waterbury for a license, that board could not have issued one to him. The fourth section of the ordinance enacts that the license provided for \u201c shall be issued only in the names of the owners of the vehicles by means of which the business is carried on.\u201d But this defendant was not the owner of any vehicle at all. If he had applied to the board of health for a license that board would have been obliged to refuse him one. This case comes almost literally within the language used by this court in the said case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Gallagher; </em>that is, the complaint does not set forth the conditions which show that it was the duty of the defendant to obtain a license, nor those- conditions which would enable him to obtain one if he applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
