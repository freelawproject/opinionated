That is a writ which does not issue to prevent immaterial injury. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>King, </em>61 Conn. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>This objection, however, does not apply to such claim for damages as is set up on account of the construction of a street railway, without authority of law, on land owned in fee by the plaintiff. It is therefore necessary to inquire, by reference to the legislation under which the defendant claims, and of which the court takes judicial notice (General Statutes, \u00a7 1087), which party is right in regard to its construction and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It was among the franchises granted to the defendant, to purchase or take leases of the property and franchises of any other street railway companies, with which its tracks might connect. 5 Special Laws, 619; 10 id. 69; 11 id. 1082; 12 id. 208, 682. The East Hartford and Glastonbury Horse Railroad Company, being one of these connecting companies, and authorized by its charter to lay tracks on Burnside Avenue at the place in question, leased all its property and franchises to the defendant, for the term of thirty years, shortly before the latter constructed its track there. It was authorized to make such a lease by the charter of the defendant. Power to receive a lease from a connecting railroad corporation implies power, in favor of the latter, to give it. <em>New York &amp; N. E. R. Co. </em>v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>52 Conn. 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The lawful lessee of a franchise to construct and operate a railway has, as such, a right to construct and operate it during the term of the lease; and so the averments as to the power of the East Hartford and Glastonbury railroad company to lay tracks in Burnside Avenue, and as to the lease taken from it, were a sufficient statement that the defendant possessed that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">,The answer therefore shows that the plaintiff has no cause of action for the occupation of his land for the construction of the defendant\u2019s railway.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The only remaining question is as to the threatened injury to the trees upon it. As already stated, it would not be so irreparable as to justify an injunction; nor can it avail to support the claim for damages. A cause of action of a legal (as distinguished from an equitable) nature must be com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>p\u00edete before it can be put in suit. <em>Woodbridge </em>v. Pratt &amp; <em>Whitney Co., </em>69 Conn. 304, 334. Here an injury is only anticipated as the result of a future act.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The Superior Court is advised that the answer is sufficient. Costs in tins court will be taxed in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
