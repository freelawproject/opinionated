If made positively, as an assertion of an existing fact, and if believed and acted upon, they may constitute an actionable fraud, although the vendee might have ascertained their falsity.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b380-16\">Upon the farm in question there was a mortgage for $1,000 which the plaintiff assumed and agreed to pay as part of the purchase price, and some evidence was offered tending to show that the farm was worth only $800. The court instructed the jury that in applying the general rule of damage, which had been given them, they would reach a correct result if they ignored the mortgage altogether, and simply ascertained the difference between the value of the land the plaintiff would have received had it been as represented, and the actual value of that conveyed to her by the deed, and to this amount added interest at six per cent. <em>Held </em>that this was a practical suggestion consistent with the general rule and afforded the defendant no cause of complaint.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b380-17\">Whatever may be its weight, evidence of the value of the property given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>in exchange by a plaintiff who claims to have been defrauded, is relevant upon tbe question as to what would have been the value of the property which he was to receive in return, had it been as represented.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b381-6\">Argued October 23d</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AWJ\">decided December 18th, 1900.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-7\">Action to recover damages for fraud in the exchange of property, broughtto the Superior Court in New Haven County and tried to the jury before <em>Ralph </em>Wheeler, <em>J.; </em>verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for $725, and appeal by the defendant for alleged errors in the rulings and charge of the court.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AI1z\">\n<em>No error.</em>\n</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-8\">In the first count of her amended complaint the plaintiff, a resident of New York, alleged that the defendant represented himself as the owner of thirty acres of good farming land in Hamden, Connecticut, and offered to exchange it for certain personal property of the plaintiff in Yonkers, New York; that believing such representations to be true, she conveyed her property, worth $1,500, to the defendant in exchange for the farm; that the defendant did not then own the land nor had he since acquired title to it; that his representations were false and were willfully and maliciously made with intent to secure the plaintiff\u2019s property and to defraud her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">The second count, which repeated much of the first, alleged that the plaintiff believed the defendant\u2019s representations that the land was \u201c good farming land and contained thirty acres,\u201d and in consequence thereof conveyed her property to him; that such representations were false, and the whole tract of land was unsuitable for farming and contained only eighteen and one quarter acres. The damages were laid at $2,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-10\">Upon the trial of the cause to the jury, the plaintiff claimed to have established the following case: In answer to her advertisement offering to exchange a boat-house, float, sail boat, etc., for a farm, cottage or improved lots, she received the following letter from the defendant: \u201cNew Haven, Ct., April 29th, 1895.

Geo. A.

Your favor reed. Have farm of 30 acres about 1| miles from depot, some 7 miles from this city, fine stream of water, large 2-story frame house, in good condition : large barn. There is a mortgage on this place for $1,500, on which there has been some $500 paid, leaving about $1,000 now due on mortgage, which can remain as long as desired, if interest is kept paid. If you think this would suit you come up and see it. I will try and make a fair deal with you. Take night boat from Peck Slip: will land you here in morning. You can go back at night: excursion ticket, $1.50. You will lose but one day. I will take you out and show the farm; or come by rail: cost $3 round trip. If you are interested come up Wed. night or Friday night. I shall be out of town Friday, but would show you the farm Thurs. or Sat. Let me hear if I shall expect you. Yours truly, Geo. A.

Your favor reed. I think $1025 is the exact amount of the mortgage at present. No other mortgage on the property: 8 or 9 rooms in house: cellar under the house. It is now rented. All kinds of crops could be grown: some fruit trees. Mortgage can be transferred. I have not seen your property: could not say exactly. Would like to have you come up and see it.

Isbell.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-8\">A week later the defendant\u2019s agent inspected the plaintiff\u2019s property in Yonkers and in New York, and represented to her that the farm in Hamden was worth $3,000. Afterwards the plaintiff came to New Haven and drove out to Hamden with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the defendant. She then repeated what his agent had said to her about the farm being worth $3,000, and he replied, \u201c Yes, I guess it is \u201d ; but added that he did not know the value of real estate. The defendant had been in the real estate business for thirty years and made a speciality of farms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-6\">The plaintiff also claimed and offered evidence to prove that the defendant pointed out to her two valuable lots across a stream, which did not in fact belong to him, and represented that they formed a part of the land which she would get. One of them, known as the \u201c Dudley lot,\u201d of about ten acres, was especially suitable as the site for a house, as the defendant suggested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-7\">The farm as subsequently conveyed to her was described in the deed as \u201c thirty acres more or less,\u201d but contained only eighteen and one quarter, and did not embrace the two tracts above mentioned. The deed referred to the existence of a mortgage on the farm for $1,029, \u201cwhich the grantee hereby assumes and agrees to pay.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-8\">The grantor in the deed under which the defendant claimed title was one George W. Thomson, and the name of the grantee was not filled in. This deed was dated March 6th, 1894. The defendant explained that he had acquired the farm from Thomson in a trade, and that the deed had been drawn in blank so that later the defendant might fill in any name he desired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-9\">The defendant offered evidence in contradiction of the material claims of the plaintiff, which also tended to show that the plaintiff consulted a lawyer who advised her that the deed was all right; that she looked at the land records and enquired of the town clerk as to the condition of the title and the value of the farm; and that he, the defendant, had good reason to believe that the farm he sold contained thirty acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-10\">Further facts material to the case are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-11\"><em>JE. P. Arvine </em>and <em>George JE. Beers, </em>for the appellant (defendant).</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-12\"><em>John A.

The ground of the action is deceit practiced by the defendant with intent thereby to induce the plaintiff to transfer her personal property to him, and to defraud her. The deceit alleged consisted in false representations as to the farm, knowingly and fraudulently made by the defendant, and believed and acted on by the plaintiff. The false representations alleged are (1) a representation of title, viz, that the defendant owned, when in fact he did not own, the land conveyed; (2) a representation of quantity, viz, that the farm contained 80 acres when in fact it contained only 18| acres; and (3) representations of quality, viz, that the land conveyed was good farming land, when in fact it was unfit for farming. The damages claimed as the result of this fraud are 12,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The complaint is loosely drawn, but there was no demurrer, and so defects of form were waived and cannot now be taken advantage of by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The rulings of the court upon evidence and in the charge to the jury must be considered in view of such waiver and of the sufficiency of the complaint in substance. There was some confusion in the minds of the counsel and court arising from the wholly unnecessary division of the complaint into two counts. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wilcox, ante, </em>p. 100, 104; <em>Dunnett </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>ibid. 1, 5. Treated, as the complaint must be, as unaffected by such improper division, the confusion has not worked any material injury to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">There is no error in the admission of testimony. The plaintiff, upon her cross-examination, having admitted that the defendant, when charged with having made false representations, offered to trade back, and that she refused, was permitted on her redirect examination to testify that she refused because some portion of her personal property taken by the defendant had been injured in the removal, some had been lost or destroyed, and she did not know the condition of other portions. This evidence tended to show that the offer to trade back was made with the knowledge that the parties could not b\u00e9 put in the same position as before the trade. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>It was also admissible as showing just what the plaintiff had refused to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The plaintiff, having produced in evidence a survey of the 18| acres described in the deed given her by the defendant, was afterwards permitted to testify that while they were standing in front of the farm house on the premises the defendant pointed out to her a piece of land (which piece was not in fact within the boundaries of the deed subsequently given her, nor within the lines of the survey) which he stated was included in the farm he proposed to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">This evidence tended to prove false representation, both as to quantity and quality. The plaintiff and defendant had just inspected the four or five acres about the house, and the plaintiff had said she did not care to trade; things were not as represented. In response the defendant said: \u201c But you haven\u2019t seen it all yet,\u201d and pointed in the direction of the piece of land across the stream (thereby indicating that the stream was the \u201c fine stream of water \u201d stated as included in the farm, instead of being, as it was in fact, the western boundary) and called her attention to this lot of ten acres, high and level and lying on the side of the stream opposite the house. The evidential force of this deceptive representation is not neutralized by the fact the lot was not within the boundaries of the land conveyed, nor within the lines of the survey the plaintiff had introduced in evidence. The testimony also tended to prove that the false representations charged were made knowingly and with fraudulent intent. <em>Gustafson </em>v. <em>Rustemeyer, </em>70 Conn. 125, 139; <em>Morehouse </em>v. <em>Northrop, </em>33 id. 380, 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The plaintiff having introduced evidence to prove that the defendant had pointed out to her and submitted to her inspection the \u201cDudley lot,\u201d as included within the thirty acres he proposed to sell, evidence of the value of that lot and the appearance and character of the land was properly admitted. The defendant had (if the jury believed the testimony) identified that land as representing land the plaintiff would have acquired if thirty acres had been conveyed to her, and evidence of its value and appearance was rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>vant to the question of damage as well as to that of fraudulent intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We have studied the defendant\u2019s requests to charge, the charge, the errors assigned, and the plaintiff\u2019s carefully prepared brief, and are satisfied that there is no error in the charge which entitles the defendant to a new trial. Some of the errors assigned relate to passages in the charge which are really comments on the weight of evidence within the discretion of the court, some are based on implications the language of the court will not fairly support, some relate to matters that could not have affected the result, and some rely on formal defects in pleading which the defendant had waived. It can serve no useful purpose to enumerate all these claimed errors. It is sufficient to refer to those controlling claims that seem to raise some material question of law. They are three, and relate to the false representation of quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The defendant asked the court to charge that \u201c as the complaint contains no allegation of the difference between what the value of the land would have been, if the representations had been true, and what it was at the time of sale, no recovery can be had for that representation, except nominal damages \u201d; and the court did not so charge. This is in effect asking the court to direct the jury to return a verdict for the defendant on this part of the case, because the complaint in stating this false representation alleges no cause of action. In fact the complaint does allege a cause of action. The allegations may not be sufficiently direct and explicit to stand against a demurrer, but they are sufficient after verdict, and are sufficient after the defendant has waived objection to the manner of statement by going to trial upon a denial of each of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations. <em>Morehouse </em>v. Throckmorton, 72 Conn. 449, 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The court declined to charge, as requested by the defendant, that representations made as to the quantity of land, \u201c where both the vendor and the vendee have had an opportunity to examine the premises, are not actionable,\u201d but did charge that \u201c positive and unqualified statements as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>number of acres in a tract of land may well and generally be regarded as representations of fact, though of course statements as to acreage may be made in such a manner and under such circumstances as to be merely matter of opinion, and in that case they would furnish no ground of liability. The letter referred to uses the language, as I have said, \u2018 Have farm of thirty acres.\u2019 You will read the whole letter and consider the whole testimony so far as it relates to quantity of land, and say whether the representations as to quantity of land in the farm, upon which the plaintiff bought, were positive representations of fact, or whether they were made as matters of opinion only. If a positive representation of fact as to the quantity of land is made by the vendor to the vendee, such vendee is under no obligation to make a survey to test the quantity, or to examine the records, or to make further inquiry in regard to it. He is entitled to rely upon it, even if he has opportunity to see the land, and does casually take a look at it, unless upon the view which he had of it the discrepancy was such as that he ought to be found to have known that the representation was not one of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ANi\">Naked statements of value are in their nature statements of opinion rather than fact; they belong to the \u201c trade talk\u201d that accompanies bargains; they may be so made and under such circumstances as to give rise to an action for deceit, but the general rule is that false statements of this kind do not constitute an actionable deceit. Statements of the acreage of a piece of land offered for sale stand on a somewhat different ground; when positively made they are in their nature statements of fact; they may be so made as to constitute mere opinion or \u201c trade talk,\u201d but when found to have been made as a representation of an existing fact, they are subject to the rule governing false and fraudulent representations of existing facts, and if believed and acted on, may constitute an actionable deceit, although the vendee might have ascertained their falsity. <em>Watson </em>v. Atwood, 25 Conn. 313, 320; <em>Beckwith </em>v. Ryan, 66 id. 589, 595; <em>Gustafson </em>v. Rustemeyer, 70 Conn. 125, 134. In view of the condition of evidence and claims, the charge states the law with sufficient clearness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>guide the jury, and fairly leaves to them the facts which may control the application of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Upon the question of damage, the court charged that \u201cthe rule of damage is the difference between what the plaintiff in fact got by the trade and what she would have received had the representations been true.\u201d No exception is taken to this general statement; but the defendant complains of the application made by the court in the following passage of the charge: \u201c There is some testimony in the case tending to show that the farm was worth only $800, a sum less than the mortgage; and it appears from the deed that the plaintiff agreed to assume and pay the mortgage. The mortgage is a fixed quantity, and the jury in seeking to apply the rule will reach the correct result if they simply ascertain the difference between the actual value of the property described in the deed, without any regard to the mortgage, and the value of such land as the plaintiff would have received had it been as represented, without any regard to the mortgage upon it, and to that sum add interest at the rate of six per cent; the amount would represent just compensation.\u201d This is a suggestion in view of the facts of the case that might practically aid the jury in reaching a result consistent with the general rule of damage. No reason was given in argument for exception to this statement, and we do not see how it could have injured the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The court further told the jury that in determining how much the farm in question would have been worth had it been as represented, \u201c the price paid by the plaintiff, that is, the value of the property which she gave in exchange, is relevant to that question, but of course not conclusive evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">Assuming the contention of the plaintiff to have been proved\u2014that the defendant induced her to make the trade on the basis of the truth of his representations\u2014then the property given in exchange represented an estimate made by the plaintiff and by the defendant of the value of the farm on the assumption the defendant\u2019s representations were true, and the actual amount of that estimate is relevant, whatever its weight may be, to the question of how much the farm con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>veyed would have been worth had it been as represented. <em>Gustafson </em>v. Rustemeyer, 70 Conn. 125, 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We do not discuss the errors claimed in that portion of the charge dealing with alleged false representations of title and quality. In the main such passages follow the requests of the defendant. There may have been error in defining what would constitute a valid transfer of title (as claimed by the plaintiff in her bill of exceptions), but if so it was favorable to the defendant. The charge practically instructed the jury against any finding in favor of the plaintiff on the ground of false representation of title or quality and, if erroneous on these points, could not have injured the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The defendant criticises some passages in the charge as misleading the jury in respect to the weight of evidence, especially as bearing on the question of his good faith. The judge did not exceed his discretion in the comments on the weight of evidence. In this, as in the charge as a whole, he was rather favorable to the defendant. There were facts apparent, if not conceded, which indicated a fraudulent intent in the whole transaction; they were dealt with in the charge very tenderly.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">There is no error in the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
