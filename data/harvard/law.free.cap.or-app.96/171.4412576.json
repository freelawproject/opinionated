ORS 475.992. He assigns as error the denial of his motion to suppress. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants. He entered into a diversion agreement pursuant to ORS 813.230. As a condition of diversion, he was to complete a counseling program. He was terminated from the program because he failed to attend. The agency administering the counseling program notified the district court of defendant\u2019s non-compliance. The district attorney\u2019s office submitted a motion requesting that defendant be required to show cause why his diversion should not be terminated. The motion was not supported by an affidavit averring non-compliance. An order was issued citing defendant to appear to show cause. The sheriff returned the citation to the court with the notation \u201cUTL,\u201d meaning that he was unable to serve defendant. The trial court then issued a bench warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. When the warrant was executed, defendant was searched and evidence was discovered which led to his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Defendant argues that his arrest was illegal because the warrant leading to his arrest was issued without a sworn statement to constitute probable cause, and that the evidence upon which his convictions were based should be suppressed as the product of the arrest. He relies on Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In response, the state argues that a bench warrant, by definition,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is not required to be supported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>by a sworn statement constituting probable cause because the subject of the warrant is already before the court on a matter for which probable cause has previously been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">No statute requires that a bench warrant be supported by a sworn statement. The issue then is whether Article I, section 9, or the Fourth Amendment so requires. We consider the issue under the Oregon Constitution first. <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or 260, 666 P2d 1316 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Article I, section 9, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and <em>no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, </em>and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, Article I, section 9, required this bench warrant to be supported by oath or affirmation. Defendant entered into a diversion agreement on September 4, 1986, staying the pending DUII charge. The diversion agreement was due to expire on September 3,1987. A notice of non-compliance with the diversion agreement, dated August 4, 1987, was sent by the Josephine Counsel on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse to the court. On August 5, the court, apparently on its own motion, issued a show cause order that required defendant to appear on August 21. That citation was not served.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>On August 19, the district attorney filed a motion requesting a show cause order. The motion was not supported by a sworn statement alleging non-compliance. On August 21, the court again ordered that a citation to appear issue, but no such citation is in the record. A blank piece of paper marked \u201cUTL\u201d does appear in the record, stapled to both the August 5 citation and a bench warrant dated September 3, 1987. The record is unclear as to whether the \u201cUTL\u201d notation refers to the August 5 citation or the August 21 order. The bench warrant was executed on or about November 10,1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">When the bench warrant was issued, defendant\u2019s criminal proceeding had been stayed, and he had not been adjudicated to be in violation of the diversion agreement. ORS 813.230(2). The agreement was in effect until terminated pursuant to ORS 813.255. The only facts that the court had before it upon which it could base a determination of probable cause to return defendant to the court were contained in unsworn statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">By its express language, Article I, section 9, does not limit its application. It states that <em>\u201cno </em>warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) It applies to arrest warrants as well as to search warrants. <em>State v. Flynn, </em>137 Or 8, 299 P 694, 300 P 1024 (1931). Bench warrants and arrest warrants are \u201cmeant to accomplish the same thing, <em>i.e., </em>the arrest of a person, but for different purposes.\u201d <em>Commentary to Proposed Oregon Criminal Procedure Code </em>2 (1972). The guarantee of Article I, section 9, that no individual\u2019s liberty be deprived by a warrant unless supported by oath or affirmation would be frustrated if a court could issue a warrant unsupported by a sworn statement when a DUII charge has been stayed and the defendant has not been adjudicated to be in violation of the diversion agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Having held that Article I, section 9, was violated, we do not reach the Fourth Amendment issue. We also do not decide whether an oath or affirmation is necessary under Article I, section 9, when the facts giving rise to probable cause occur in the presence of the court. <em>See Higgins v. Redding, </em>34 Or App 1029, 1034, 580 P2d 580, <em>rev den </em>284 Or 80a (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> ORS 131.005(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201c \u2018Bench warrant\u2019 means a process of a court in which a criminal action is pending, directing a peace officer to take into custody a defendant in the action who has previously appeared before the court upon the accusatory instrument by which the action was commenced, and to bring the defendant before the court.
