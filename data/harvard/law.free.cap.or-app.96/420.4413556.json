We consolidate the separate appeals for the purpose of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>In both cases, County filed a complaint in circuit court alleging that <em>claimants </em>had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\">\u201cbeen involved in one or more of the following illegal activities <em>in violation of </em>Multnomah County Code, Section 7.85 <em>et seq:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201c(a) The possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201c(b) The delivery of a controlled substance.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The complaints allege further that the defendant property constitutes profits or proceeds of the illegal activities and, in the case of appellant Wells, a claimant, that defendant 1979 Honda had been used by Wells to facilitate the above-mentioned violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Claimant Wells was served by mail and appeared by answering the complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Joyce Stewart, the owner of the BMW, was personally served and also appeared by filing an answer, but does not appeal. After a trial on stipulated facts, in which Wells admitted that the defendant property was proceeds of illegal activity as defined in MCC Chapter 7.85, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the court entered a judgment that defendant property be forfeited to County.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">County served appellant Dossie, a claimant, personally. He appeared by filing an answer. Rose Dossie and Rosalyn Robertson intervened. After trial, the court found that County had established that Dossie had engaged in racketeering activity and that the defendant bank accounts had been used for illegal activities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It found that some of the bank accounts were exempt from forfeiture under MCC 7.85.025(B) as proceeds of \u201cunlawful acts defined in ORS 166.720(1) and (2).\u201d It found that the rest of the money, $35,000, was not exempt and was subject to forfeiture and entered a judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Wells argues that these forfeiture proceedings are barred by ORS 30.315, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201c(1) An incorporated city or any county may, instead of penal enforcement, maintain civil proceedings in courts of this state against any person to enforce requirements or prohibitions of its ordinances or resolutions when it seeks:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\u201c(a) To collect a fee or charge;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\u201c(b) To enforce a forfeiture;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201c(c) To require or enjoin the performance of an act affecting real property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\u201c(d) To enjoin continuance of a violation that has existed for 10 days or more; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-11\">\u201c(e) To enjoin further commission of a violation that otherwise may result in additional violations of the same or related penal provisions affecting the public morals, health or safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-12\">\u201c(2) The court shall not impose a penal fine in a civil proceeding under subsection (1) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">\u201c(3) The remedies provided by this section shall not be used to enforce any requirement or prohibition of an ordinance or resolution that is also specifically defined as a crime and made punishable under the statutes of this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-14\">\u201c(4) The remedies provided by this section are supplementary and in addition to those described in ORS 30.310.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In <em>Linn County v. 22.16 Acres, </em>95 Or App 59, 767 P2d 473, <em>rev allowed </em>308 Or 158 (1989), we held that, although Linn County had no ordinance expressly prohibiting the conduct defined in its forfeiture ordinance as \u201cillegal,\u201d the ordinance itself implicitly prohibited the conduct giving rise to forfeiture. Because the ordinance incorporated the state definitions of crimes in setting forth what conduct would result in forfeiture, we held that the ordinance prohibited conduct that is defined as a crime under state law. We concluded, therefore, that the forfeiture proceeding brought to enforce the county\u2019s forfeiture ordinance was prohibited by ORS 30.315(3). <em>See also City of Springfield v. $10,000 In U.S. Currency, </em>95 Or App 66, 767 P2d 476, <em>rev allowed </em>308 Or 79 (1989). We conclude that the same result is required here. We write to address several contentions made by County concerning the correctness of our decision in <em>Linn County </em>and its applicability to these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">County\u2019s first argument is that ORS 30.315 is not relevant to a discussion of MCC Chapter 7.85, because these proceedings are not brought to enforce the prohibitions of a county ordinance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We addressed that question in <em>Linn County v. 22.16 Acres, supra, </em>95 Or App at 64, with respect to the Linn County Ordinance, and we adhere to our reasoning in that opinion. We conclude that the same rationale applies to MCC Chapter 7.85. The complaint filed in each case charges that the claimants acted <em>\u201cin violation of </em>Multnomah County Code, Section 7.85.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Although the ordinance does not expressly prohibit the conduct that gives rise to forfeiture, by characterizing certain conduct as \u201cillegal\u201d and imposing sanctions for that conduct, the ordinance implicitly prohibits the activity. <em>See Springfield v. $10,000 In U.S. Currency, supra, </em>95 Or App at 70. These forfeiture proceedings are brought to enforce those prohibitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">County contends that, because these proceedings are <em>in rem </em>and not \u201cagainst a person,\u201d they do not fall within ORS 30.315. County is correct that ORS 30.315 authorizes civil proceedings \u201cagainst any person\u201d when a county seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>enforce a forfeiture and that these proceedings, nominally, are brought against the property sought to be forfeited. The distinction, County urges, is determinative, because, in an <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceeding, the illegal use of the property is the focus of a forfeiture and the culpability of the owner or claimant is incidental to that inquiry. Completing that rationale, County contends that ORS 30.315 is intended to apply only to <em>in personam </em>forfeiture proceedings and that ORS 30.315(3) was enacted to prevent equal protection and double jeopardy problems that might arise in the context of those proceedings against a person. In the case of an <em>in rem </em>civil proceeding, however, the action is not against a person who might previously have been or later be subject to criminal prosecution, and equal protection and double jeopardy concerns are therefore not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">County contends, further, that its authority to enact ordinances providing for <em>in rem </em>civil forfeitures is not derived from ORS 30.315, which deals only with <em>in personam </em>proceedings, but from its general authority under its charter to control matters of local concern that are not addressed by state law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The legislature has not expressed an intention, it contends, to preclude local governments from enacting civil forfeiture ordinances. The state\u2019s involvement in forfeiture in certain circumstances should not, County contends, be understood to preempt county involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The issue, however, does not involve preemption by state law; rather, it is whether state law authorizes these proceedings. In enacting ORS 30.315, the legislature has expressed its intention to grant to counties the authority to bring civil actions against \u201cany person\u201d for the enforcement of its ordinances, provided that the county is not seeking to enforce prohibitions that are defined as a crime under state law. The logical implication of that grant of authority is that the legislature did not intend that cities or counties have it in circumstances other than those described in ORS 30.315. In other words, the only type of civil forfeiture enforcement proceeding that a county is authorized to bring is provided for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ORS 30.315. It <em>may </em>bring civil actions against <em>any person </em>for the enforcement of its ordinances, but <em>may not </em>bring civil forfeiture proceedings <em>in rem </em>and may not bring them <em>in personam </em>in order to enforce prohibitions defined as a crime under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">County would have us conclude that, apart from ORS 30.315, two other statutory provisions manifest an intention by the legislature to authorize counties to bring <em>in rem </em>forfeiture proceedings. County cites ORS 30.310, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cA suit or action may be maintained by the State of Oregon or any county, incorporated city, school district or other public corporation of like character in this state, in its corporate name, upon a cause of suit or action accruing to it in its corporate character, and not otherwise, in the following cases:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201c(1) Upon a contract made with the public corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">\u201c(2) Upon a liability prescribed by law in favor of the public corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201c(3) <em>To recover a penalty or forfeiture given to the public corporation.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">\u201c(4) To recover damages for injury to the corporate rights or property of the public corporation.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">That statute is a general provision concerning a county\u2019s or other public corporation\u2019s authority to bring specific types of proceedings, including forfeiture proceedings, in its corporate name. It authorizes a county to recover a \u201cforfeiture given to\u201d it. It does not specify the source or nature of the forfeiture, whether <em>in rem </em>or <em>in personam, </em>or authorize a county to enact ordinances providing for forfeitures. We conclude that it merely authorizes a county to bring forfeiture proceedings in its own name when state law otherwise makes provision for property to be forfeited to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">County contends that ORS 166.725(12) also provides authority to local governments to enact ordinances authorizing forfeitures. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">\u201cThe application of one civil remedy under any provision of ORS 166.715 to 166.735 [Oregon\u2019s racketeering statutes] shall not preclude the application of any other remedy, civil or criminal, under ORS 166.715 to 166.735 or any other provision of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Similarly, ORS 161.045(3) provides that the state criminal code \u201cdoes not bar, suspend or otherwise affect any right or liability to damages, penalty, forfeiture or other remedy authorized by law to be recovered or enforced in a civil action * * We conclude, once again, that those provisions authorize the enforcement of civil remedies provided elsewhere by <em>state </em>law and do not authorize local governments to enact their own forfeiture provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Because we conclude that County\u2019s ordinance is inconsistent with ORS 30.315, we do not address whether it may also be incompatible with ORS 166.715 <em>et seq </em>and ORS 167.247, or whether it may run afoul of certain state constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-5\"> MCC Chapter 7.85 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">\u201c7.85.005 <em>Title. </em>This chapter shall be known as the forfeiture ordinance of Multnomah County and may be so pleaded and referred to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201c7.85.010 <em>Definitions. </em>As used in this ordinance, unless the context requires otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">\u201c(A) \u2018Controlled substances\u2019 are those defined in ORS 475.005(6) [1983 ed.] except that this shall not include less than one avoirdupois once [st'c] of marijuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">\u201c(B) \u2018Deliver or delivery\u2019 is that defined in ORS 475.005(8) [1983 ed.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">\u201c(C) \u2018Facilitate\u2019 means that the property must have some substantial connection to, or be instrumental in, the commission of the underlying illegal activity which this chapter seeks to prevent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">\u201c(D) \u2018Gambling\u2019 is that defined in ORS 167.117(4) [1983 ed.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">\u201c(E) \u2018Illegal activity\u2019 means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-13\">\u201c(1) Gambling or promotion of gambling; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-14\">\u201c(2) The manufacture or delivery of controlled substances; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">\u201c(3) The possession of controlled substances with the intent to deliver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-16\">\u201c(F) \u2018Manufacture\u2019 is that defined in ORS 475.005(14) [1983 ed.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-17\">\u201c(G) \u2018Marijuana\u2019 is tht [sic] defined in ORS 475.005(15) [1983 ed.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-18\">\u201c(H) \u2018Possession of controlled substances with the intent to distribute\u2019 is that defined in 21 USC \u00a7 841(a)(1) [1976 ed.; published 1981].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-19\">\u201c(I) \u2018Production\u2019 is that defined in ORS 475.005(19) [1983 ed.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-20\">\u201c(J) \u2018Promotion of gambling\u2019 is that defined in ORS 167.117(10) [1983 ed.].

In fact, the federal statute, 21USC \u00a7 841(a)(1), is referred to only with regard to \u201cpossession with intent to <em>distribute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) It does not define that conduct. It merely states that it is unlawful. \u201cDelivery\u201d is defined in the ordinance as in ORS 475.005(8). The conduct charged in these proceedings, \u201cpossession with the intent to deliver,\u201d is punishable in Oregon as simple possession. <em>State v.
