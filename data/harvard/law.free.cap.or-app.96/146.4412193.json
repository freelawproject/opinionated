The orders followed a consolidated hearing held by Bureau and WHC concerning alleged violations of statutes and regulations governing the employment of minors. Bureau\u2019s order imposed civil penalties pursuant to ORS 653.370 that totaled $45,550, while WHC\u2019s order revoked their right to hire minors in the future, pursuant to ORS 653.307(2). Both orders were based on 75 proven violations of the statutes and regulations. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Most of the assignments of error in this case have been addressed in <em>Northwest Advancement v. Bureau of Labor, </em>96 Or App 133, 772 P2d 943 (1989). In that case, we upheld the agencies\u2019 application of the regulations and the issuance of a mandatory injunction requiring petitioners to comply with the regulations. Petitioners argue here that their activities are subject to regulation under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and that Bureau and WHC therefore lacked authority to impose civil penalties or to revoke their right to hire minors. That issue was not raised before either Bureau or WHC, and we will not entertain it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Hughes v. Adult &amp; Family Services, </em>58 Or App 478, 484, 648 P2d 1324 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Petitioners also argue that Bureau erred in finding separate violations for separate offenses involving the same minors. They also assert that it erred in finding separate violations for each day that a regulation was violated. We disagree. ORS 653.370(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u201cIn addition to any other penalty provided by law, [Bureau] may impose upon any person not regulated under [FLSA] who violates ORS 653.305 to 653.370 or any rule adopted by [WHC] thereunder, a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000 <em>for each violation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Criminal sanctions are also available under ORS 653.991, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">\u201cViolation of <em>any </em>provision of this section or ORS 653.010 to 653.545 or of any rule or regulation adopted by the commission under ORS 653.307 shall be punishable as a misdemeanor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>We conclude that the language of the statutes clearly indicates that the legislature intended to allow separate punishment for each violation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-5\"> Petitioners\u2019 remaining assignments of error do not merit discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
