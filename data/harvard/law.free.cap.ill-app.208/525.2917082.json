Death, \u00a7 50b<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sustains findings in action by parent. In an action to recover for the wrongful death of plaintiff\u2019s son, a passenger on defendant\u2019s train, evidence held sufficient to warrant a finding for plaintiff %n the controverted allegations of defendant\u2019s negligence, death of plaintiff\u2019s decedent, and survivorship of his father as heir.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b550-7\" pgmap=\"550\">2.

A motion by plaintiff for a new trial after verdict in his favor for $100, in an action for damages for death of plaintiff's decedent, was erroneously denied, where the main question presented was the wrongful death of a boy 17 years old leaving a nonresident father surviving with such expectation of pecuniary benefit from his, son\u2019s continued life as might reasonably be entertained by a nonresident parent under similar circumstances, plaintiff being entitled on the finding of negligence causing the death of the son and survivorship of the father to a substantial verdict.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AWBM\" pgmap=\"550\">3.

An instruction that the testimony of a witness before a coroner\u2019s jury might be considered, in an action to recover damages for the death of the decedent for other purposes than that of impeaching the testimony of the same witness in such action, was erroneous, where it was not claimed that the evidence was admissible for other purposes.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-3\" pgmap=\"550\">Duncan &amp; O\u2019Conor, for defendant in error.</attorneys> <footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"Axa\" pgmap=\"550\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vols.
