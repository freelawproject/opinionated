Municipal Court of Chicago, \u00a7 13<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what are essentials of statement of claim in fourth-class case. The provision of the Municipal Court Act (section 40, J. &amp; A. f 3352), that a statement of claim need not set forth the cause of action with the particularity-required in a declaration at common law does not obviate the necessity that the statement in a fourth-class case show a legal liability of a defendant to a plaintiff.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b327-4\" pgmap=\"327\">3.
