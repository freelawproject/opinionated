E. McConkey, for whom A. L. McConkey acted as agent and 200 acres in Marion county owned by one Titus Springer; also a certain automobile, a domino factory and the certificates of purchase owned by Shaw of certain lots in Decatur, all of which were to be exchanged for the McConkey lands. Deeds for the lands and the automobile and domino factory were exchanged, and the certificates of purchase were held by complainant to await Shaw\u2019s acceptance of the abstract of the McConkey lands. Across these lands was a 200-foot strip for purposes of a levee, outside of which were several acres subject to overflow, represented by McConkey to Shaw on inspection to be 3, but in fact much more. The decree found the value of the excess land, if same had been as represented, to be $244.16 more than their value as existing, and same, with interest and rent, aggregating $320.66, was decreed as damages. Complainant disclaimed interest, and by agreement was appointed receiver of the property described in the certificates of purchase.</p><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-8\" pgmap=\"109\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b109-9\" pgmap=\"109\">1.
