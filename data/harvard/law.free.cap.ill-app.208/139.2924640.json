Lasman, complainant, against Daisy Hanson Harts, Edwin B. Harts and A. A. Kuhn, defendants, to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment. The property was thereafter sold by the sheriff under the judgment upon condition that complainant pay the purchaser, within 15 days, the amount which the latter paid for the premises, and, in case of complainant\u2019s failure to do so, the bill would be dismissed. After-wards complainant filed a supplemental bill setting up such facts and moved that the sale be set aside. The case was heard before the chancellor and a decree entered setting aside the sale as above stated on the ground that complainant occupied the premises as a homestead and that the sheriff did not comply with the law as to setting off the homestead before making the sale. From the decree setting aside the sale, complainant appeals. The same facts are involved as in Harts v. Lasman, ante, p. 137.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b163-8\" pgmap=\"163\">Q. J. Chott, for appellant; Frank H.
