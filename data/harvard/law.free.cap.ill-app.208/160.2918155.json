In an action by a stockholder in an insurance company against the company to recover money had and received, the evidence showed that plaintiff attended a meeting of the stockholders, officers and directors of defendant, at which the demand of the State insurance department that the impairment of defendant\u2019s capital be remedied was discussed, and gave his check, as did others, receiving therefor a receipt, signed as \u201ctrustee\u201d by one present at the meeting, which acknowledged the receipt of the money in full payment of a certain number of shares of defendant\u2019s stock \u201csame to be issued in case impairment is removed, otherwise money to be returned to him\u201d; that the amounts thus collected were turned over to another; that the latter delivered a check for the amount to defendant; that the impairment was subsequently removed; that plaintiff thereafter demanded from defendant the return of the amount paid by him and such demand was refused, and plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim sets up that defendant received from plaintiff money without consideration and that there is an implied promise to pay it back. Held, that by such evidence plaintiff made out a prima facie case consistent with the declaration.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\" pgmap=\"184\">Error to the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.
