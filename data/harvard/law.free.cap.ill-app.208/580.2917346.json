Bills and notes, \u00a7 327<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what is not legal defense to indorser of note at time of execution by makers. The failure of the payee of a note secured by an unrecorded trust deed to redeem from a sheriff\u2019s sale under a subsequent recorded trust deed is not, as a matter of law, a legal defense to an indorser on the note at the time it was executed by the makers in an action against him as such indorser.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-11\" pgmap=\"605\">2. Bills and notes, \u00a7 333*\u2014when loss of indorser due to failure of payee to record trust deed may be offset in action by payee. Where the payee of a note holding a trust deed as security therefor failed to record the deed and the property involved was sold under a subsequent recorded trust deed, held that in an action against an indorser on the note at the time of its execution by the makers, the indorser might plead in offset the extent of any loss by him due to the payee\u2019s neglect in recording the trust deed held by him.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-12\" pgmap=\"605\">3.
