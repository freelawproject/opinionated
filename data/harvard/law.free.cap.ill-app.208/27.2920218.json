B. Spang, complainant, against Asa W. Sawin, Anna M. Sawin, R. E. Garrett and A. G. Johnson, defendants, to foreclose a mortgage. The bill averred that, subsequently to the execution of the mortgage by defendants Sawin, the property mortgaged was conveyed to defendants Garrett and Johnson, who assumed the mortgage debt. A decree was entered for plaintiff for $1,763.70, defendants Garrett and Johnson having failed to appear or answer. After a sale of the property a judgment for a deficiency of $411.32 was decreed against all the defendants. Defendants Garrett and Johnson, without filing answers, moved to set aside and vacate the motion and judgment, which motion was denied. To reverse the order denying such motion, Garrett and Johnson prosecute this writ of error.</p><attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-12\" pgmap=\"51\">Isaac A.
