McAllister, complainant, against Elmer Robinson and others, defendants, for partition of certain premises owned as tenants in common by complainant and one of the defendants whose husband, the other defendant, occupied the premises as a tenant.

By arbitration the rent for the ensuing year was fixed at the same amount and a new note for $200 was given to complainant for his half of the rent for that year. Bill for partition was filed averring termination of the tenancy March 1, 1917.
