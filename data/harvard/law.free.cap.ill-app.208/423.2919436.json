From a decree giving such liens to the extent of the funds remaining in the defendant\u2019s hands subject to lien, defendant brings error.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\" pgmap=\"447(177) 448(104)\">In ascertaining the total contract price for which the city was liable, the court added to the original contract price $5,500, which the board of local improyements had allowed to the contractors on account of extra excavation of rock. The city contended that this allowance by the board of local improvements was unlawful and should not be charged against the city or added to the contract price, because the contractors were bound to do the work for the contract price. In the instructions to bidders the city stated the rock excavation at 3,500 yards, and stated that these quotations were approximate only and that the board of local improvements reserved the right to increase the same as might be deemed necessary. In the bid of the contractors, and upon which the contract was based, they bid for extra excavation $1.50 per cubic yard. The proof showed that much extra rock was encountered and that it was hard and flinty, and that there were 4,700 cubic yards of rock excavated by the contractors in addition to the 3,500 yards named in the instructions to bidders. The contractors applied to the hoard of local improvements for an allowance therefor, and the city engineer made an estimate of this extra excavation of rock and certified to the board that the contractors were entitled to $5,250 for 3,500 cubic yards of rock at $1.50 per cubic yard, to $150 for change in construction of traps, and to $100 for hauling dirt, a total of $5,500, and a meeting of the board was held and it allowed $5,500 to the contractors for said extras, and the city afterwards paid it.</p><headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b448-7\" pgmap=\"448\">Abstract of the Decision.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b448-8\" pgmap=\"448\">1.
