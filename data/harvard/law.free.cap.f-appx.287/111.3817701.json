(\u201cBrady\u201d) appeals from the . district court\u2019s summary judgment of invalidity. Order, <em>Brady Construction Innovations, Inc. v. California Expanded Metal Products Company, </em>No. 07-217, 2007 WL 3170138 (C.D.Cal. June 13, 2007) <em>(\u201cSummary Judgment Order\u201d). </em>California Expanded Metal Products Company (\u201cCEMCO\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. Order, <em>Brady Construction Innovations, Inc. v. California Expanded Metal Products Company, </em>No. 07-217 (C.D.Cal. Sept. 26, 2007) <em>(\u201cFees OrdeP\u2019). </em>We heard oral argument on July 7, 2008. For the reasons discussed in our opinion in <em>Brady Construction Innovations, Inc. v. Perfect Wall, Inc., </em>Nos.2007-1460, -1486, 2008 WL 3822559, we affirm both the district court\u2019s summary judgment of invalidity and denial of attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b132-13\"> CEMCO also sought attorneys\u2019 fees under Rule 11 on the same basis as it sought fees under Section 285. The district court\u2019s denial of a motion for Rule 11 sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Q-Pharma, Inc. v. Andrew Jergens Co., </em>360 F.3d 1295, 1299 (Fed.Cir.2004). We have reviewed CEMCO\u2019s arguments as to attorneys' fees as well as the correspondence in the record between CEM-CO\u2019s counsel and Brady\u2019s counsel, and we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying attorneys\u2019 fees under Rule 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
