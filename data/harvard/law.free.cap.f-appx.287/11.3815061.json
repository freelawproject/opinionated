We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of motions to reopen. <em>Maravilla Maravilla v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 855, 857 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-18\">Mohammed has waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s determination that he is statutorily ineligible for a 212(h) waiver. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v.

Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 1185, 1188-89 (9th Cir. 2006) (a vacated conviction can serve as the basis for removal if the conviction was vacated for equitable, rehabilitation or immigration hardship reasons); <em>see also Mu</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number><em>rillo-Espinoza v.
