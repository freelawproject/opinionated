Rodriguez, Senior District Judge for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b214-6\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b214-7\">GARTH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Paul and Allison Svindland appeal, individually and as administrator\u2019s of the estate of Ian Svindland, from a jury verdict entered against them in a medical malpractice action filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. For the following reasons, we will vacate the jury\u2019s verdict and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">The parties are fully familiar with the proceedings that have taken place heretofore. Essentially, the Svindlands\u2019 son, Ian, was diagnosed with a developmental heart condition known as Ventricular Septal Defect (\u201cVSD\u201d). A VSD is a hole in the wall separating the two pumping chambers of the heart, allowing blood to pass from the left ventricle to the right ventricle. Dr. William I. Norwood performed heart surgery to correct Ian\u2019s VSD after he was born. The surgery was performed at The Nemours Cardiac Center in Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">To perform the surgery, Dr. Norwood used a procedure known as Deep Hypothermic Circulatory Arrest (\u201cDHCA\u201d). This involved connecting Ian to a heart-lung bypass machine and using an attached refrigeration unit to cool his body. The purpose of this technique was to drain all of the blood from Ian\u2019s body to enable Dr. Norwood to perform the operation in a bloodless field. Cooling was necessary to reduce the amount of oxygen required by Ian\u2019s organs in the absence of blood flow.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">The Svindlands concentrated on two issues at trial. They claimed that Dr. Nor-wood only cooled Ian for six minutes, which was not long enough to protect Ian\u2019s organs, and ultimately caused his death. They also claimed that the information given to them in order to constitute informed consent did not acquaint them with the mortality risks for Ian\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">The jury ruled for the defendants. It found that Dr. Norwood was negligent. However, the jury also found that the Svindlands\u2019 proof was not adequate to establish that Dr. Norwood\u2019s cooling technique proximately caused Ian\u2019s death. The jury also found no lack of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-18\">We have jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s final order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. As to matters of law, we have plenary review. <em>North Penn. Gas Co. v. Corning Natural Gas Corp., </em>897 F.2d 687, 688 (3d Cir.1990). As to trial conduct and the manner of the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, we review for abuse of discretion. <em>See Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., </em>520 F.3d 237, 243 (2008); <em>Stecyk v. Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., </em>295 F.3d 408, 412 (3d Cir. 2002); <em>Oddi v. Ford Motor Co., </em>234 F.3d 136, 146 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Our review of the record has left us with a disquieting uncertainty \u2014 not so much as to the content of the legal rulings made by the District Court, but the manner in which those decisions were made. Thus, we do not address or decide the merits of the legal issues raised on this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> What we do decide is that the District Court judge consistently failed to exercise appropriate discretion by not giving reasons for his rulings and by the manner in which he conducted the trial so that we are hard-pressed to discern the basis on which he dealt with the issues before him and particularly those matters of evidence raised during the pretrial motions and during the trial itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The District Court, during pre-trial proceedings on October 12, 2006, precluded the Svindlands from presenting evidence of Dr. Norwood\u2019s mortality rate for performing VSD surgeries. The District Court also quashed a subpoena issued by the Svindlands to two non-parties seeking raw data used in two scholarly articles, which prevented them from determining, if they could, what percentage of adverse neurological outcomes could be associated with the duration of cooling. At no time did the District Court judge give his reasons for so ruling, and while we express no opinion as to whether the material excluded from both the pretrial and the trial were relevant and material, the record is quite clear that the District Court judge virtually closed the door on allowing the Svindlands to assess the effect of the cooling rate and its duration on infants undergoing VSD surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">The lack of reasons given by the District Court, when combined with the manner in which the District Court dealt with these issues with counsel, has left us with the impression that the District Court interrupted counsel to a point where intelligible argument could not be had. In fact, the District Court was often so impatient and dismissive that the record does not reflect the arguments that the Svindlands sought to make. Of even more importance is that the failure to give reasons for the District Court\u2019s rulings leaves us incapable of reviewing the basis for his actions. We should not be in the position of having to speculate as to the reasons behind each ruling and we should not be in the position of having to rule ourselves in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">We have no intention of instructing the District Court as to how it should deal with arguments, evidence, and counsel, or how it should conduct the \u201cbusiness\u201d of its courtroom. However, when a record such as this one reveals numerous instances of what we can only regard as impatience and precipitous rulings on the part of the District Court judge, to say nothing of countless interruptions of counsel\u2019s arguments, our review function as a Court of Appeals is severely impaired.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, where we cannot determine the rationale of the District Court\u2019s rulings, many of which require explanations as to why particular testimony should be allowed while other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>testimony is excluded, we cannot condone the District Court\u2019s actions nor can we affirm the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Because we are unable to complete the gaps in the Svindlands\u2019 arguments that occurred as a result of the District Court\u2019s interruptions and because we are unable to fathom the reasons why the District Court judge ruled as he did, we are obliged to vacate the judgment of May 11, 2007, and order a new trial. In light of these circumstances, it appears to us that the trial should be conducted by a District Judge other than the one who presided at the initial trial and we will accordingly order that a different judge be assigned. <em>See, e.g., Virgin Islands v. Walker, </em>261 F.3d 370, 376 (3d Cir.2001) (providing that \u201cwe can, in the exercise of our supervisory power, reassign [a] case to a different judge upon remand.... \u2018We must preserve not only the reality but also the appearance of the proper functioning of the judiciary as a neutral, impartial administrator of justice.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Alexander v. Primerica Holdings, </em>10 F.3d 155, 167 (3d Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\n<em>APPENDIX A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\n<em>Cross-Examination of Dr. Norwood:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">Q.

Now, Dr. DuPlessis, is there anything else over the years, or that you have discovered in this article, other than what we\u2019ve already talked about, that\u2019s served to, kind of, mold your opinion over time about cooling and circulatory arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">A. Well, as I said earlier, I think the general message that had come across was that the changes that occurred at our institution was a more concerted effort to avoid brief cooling in order to make sure that we could adequately protect the brain and then to reduce the insult, which was to reduce the amount of time on circulatory arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">And the message in that paper was that the type of neurological complications which we had seen before frequently, to the point that they actually started a cardiac intensive care service that I was on for neurology \u2014 they were that frequent \u2014 that the numbers of consultations dropped down dramatically. And all that paper was doing was making an association between a change in practice, longer cooling, making sure that we didn\u2019t cool too quickly and shorter periods on circulatory arrest, making an association between those changes and a sharp reduction in the types of neurological complications we had seen previously.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-9\"><em>APPENDIX </em>A \u2014 Continued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-11\">Q.
