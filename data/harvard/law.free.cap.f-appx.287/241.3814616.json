He did so by completing the standard form habeas petition (\u201cform petition\u201d) adopted by the Judicial Conference for the United States and provided to him by the district court. One question on the form petition instructs would-be petitioners to provide reasons why the statute of limitations does not bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>their petition if their judgment of conviction became final more than one year prior to the instant filing. Bilal answered simply, \u201cN/A.\u201d Without further notice to Bilal, the district court dismissed the petition sua sponte for untimeliness.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On appeal, Bilal argues that he was not given sufficient notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the dismissal as required by our precedent in <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002). On the specific facts before us, we agree. We therefore vacate and remand for the district court to allow Bilal to clarify or correct his response.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Following a jury trial in North Carolina Superior Court, Bilal was convicted on October 12, 2001 of two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon, two counts of second-degree kidnapping, one count of simple assault, and one count of assault inflicting serious bodily injury. He was later sentenced to 394 months\u2019 imprisonment, and is currently serving out that sentence in a North Carolina prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Since his conviction, Bilal has filed a number of appeals and petitions within the North Carolina state court system, all of which have failed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, on February 23, 2006, he filed this habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 with the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, challenging, inter alia, the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions and alleging that both his trial and appellate counsel provided him with ineffective assistance. He initiated this collateral attack by filling out the form petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">The form petition consists of questions designed to elicit the salient facts underlying a petitioner\u2019s challenge to his confinement. Some of the questions are relatively straightforward, calling for a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer or soliciting easily ascertained facts such as dates and names. Others are more open-ended. The question giving rise to this appeal, question 18, is of the latter variety. Question 18 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-14\">TIMELINESS OF PETITION: If your judgment of conviction became final over one year ago, you must explain why the one-year statute of limitations as contained in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) does not bar your petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">J.A. 26. The questions ends with a footnote setting forth the text of 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>\u00a7 2244(d)(l)-(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bilal wrote only \u201cN/A\u201d on the first of twenty-two lines provided to answer the question. His petition was otherwise complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Upon receipt of the petition, the district court concluded on the face of the filing that Bilal\u2019s \u00a7 2254 claims were barred by the one-year limitations period imposed by \u00a7 2244(d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> dismissing the petition sua sponte without first discussing with Bilal the limitations period or any applicable tolling provisions. In a footnote at the end of the order, the district court acknowledged that, under this court\u2019s holding in <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>it was required to warn Bilal, prior to sua sponte dismissal of the petition, \u201c \u2018that the case is subject to dismissal ... absent a sufficient explanation\u2019 \u201d for its seeming untimeliness. J.A. 62 n. 2 (quoting <em>Hill, </em>277 F.3d at 706). The district court determined, however, that Bilal\u2019s case was distinguishable from <em>Hill </em>because Bilal \u201chad an opportunity in his form petition to address the timeliness of his petition and declined to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court determined that \u201cit need not provide [him] with any additional opportunities to address such matters.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">Bilal filed a pro se notice of appeal, arguing that the district court \u201cdismissed [his] federal habeas corpus [petition] without affording [him] notice or an opportunity to be heard ... [and that] had he been permitted to [respond], he could have demonstrated that either a statutory exception or equitable tolling principles protected his \u00a7 2254 petition from dismissal.\u201d J.A. 65. This court subsequently granted a certificate of appealability and appointed Bilal counsel to assist in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">We review de novo the legal question of whether Bilal was afforded adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the sua sponte dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. <em>See United States v. Hopkins, </em>268 F.3d 222, 224 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">We begin our analysis with a discussion of this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002), and <em>McMillan v. Jarvis, </em>332 F.3d 244 (4th Cir.2003), upon which both parties extensively rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><em>Hill </em>presented the question of whether a federal habeas court had the power to dismiss sua sponte a pro se petition on the ground that it was not filed within the one-year limitations period established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). This court began with the general principle that \u201cthe one-year limitation period contained in \u00a7 2244(d) is an affirmative defense that the state bears the burden of asserting.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>277 F.3d at 705. Nonetheless, this court held that because \u00a7 2254 habeas actions, more so than ordinary civil actions, \u201cimplicate considerations of comity, federalism, and judicial efficiency,\u201d a district court has the authority to raise certain affirmative defenses sua sponte in this context. <em>Id. </em>Such \u201cdiscretion to raise an affirmative defense to a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>sua sponte </em>and then dismiss the petition based on that affirmative defense is not completely unfettered,\u201d this court cautioned, and should not be \u201cautomatic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 706 (internal quotations omitted); <em>cf. Eriline Co. S.A. v. Johnson, </em>440 F.3d 648, 655 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e have recognized that a statute of limitations defense may properly be raised <em>sua sponte </em>by a district court in certain <em>narrow </em>circumstances.\u201d (emphasis added)). Instead, in each instance, a court should balance the federal interests listed above against \u201cthe petitioner\u2019s substantial interest in justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">When balancing those interests in <em>Hill, </em>this court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">Because the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, a habeas petitioner is not likely to plead detailed facts to refute this defense in the initial \u00a7 2254 petition.... Any facts relating to [statutory or equitable tolling] are [therefore] unlikely to be part of the record.... Thus, when a federal habeas court, acting <em>sua sponte, </em>dismisses a \u00a7 2254 action as untimely without notice to or input from the petitioner, the court cannot be certain that there are no circumstances that would cause the petition to be timely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 706-07. This court noted that this problem was compounded because a pro se petitioner like Hill was unlikely to anticipate the affirmative defense of untimeliness, especially because the form petition in use at the time did not direct petitioners to address the issue. <em>See id. </em>at 707 (\u201c[N]otice and an opportunity to respond are particularly appropriate when the prisoner is <em>pro se ... </em>and the long-standing practice is to construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally.\u201d). This court therefore held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC5\">when a federal habeas court, prior to trial, perceives a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition to be untimely and the state has not filed a motion to dismiss based on the one-year limitations period, <em>the court must warn the prisoner </em>that the case is subject to dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 2244(d) absent a sufficient explanation, unless it is indisputably clear from the materials presented to the district court that the petition is untimely and cannot be salvaged by equitable tolling principles or any of the circumstances enumerated in \u00a7 2244(d)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also Day v. McDonough, </em>547 U.S. 198, 210, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 376 (2006) (\u201cOf course, before acting on its own initiative, a court must accord the parties fair notice and an opportunity to present their positions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">The following year, this court issued its decision in <em>McMillan v. Jarvis, </em>332 F.3d 244 (4th Cir.2003), which recognized that the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard extends to <em>counseled </em>habeas petitioners. In <em>McMillan, </em>this court found no reasonable basis for distinguishing be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tween pro se and counseled petitioners, because \u201c[i]n either case, facts supporting a statutory exception to the one-year limitation period ... or equitable tolling, are not likely to be facts included in the habeas record before the district court. <em>And, in neither case will we require the petitioner to anticipate a potential statute of limitations defense.\u201d Id. </em>at 249 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">This court explained that counsel in a habeas case is entitled to the \u201clegitimate strategic option of not pleading facts in anticipation of a statute of limitations defense and [instead] forcing the respondent to bear its own burden of identifying and raising potentially applicable affirmative defenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. Because, counsel could rightfully choose to omit such facts, the primary concern in <em>Hill </em>remained: a district court that dismisses a petition as untimely \u201cbased solely on the petition\u201d and \u201c \u2018without notice to or input from the petitioner ... cannot be certain that there are no circumstances that would cause the petition to be timely.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249-50 (quoting <em>Hill, </em>277 F.3d at 707).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">After <em>Hill </em>and <em>McMillan, </em>and similar decisions by courts in other circuits, <em>see, e.g., Acosta v. Artuz, </em>221 F.3d 117 (2d Cir.2000), the United States Judicial Conference adopted the form petition at issue in this case, which took effect on December 1, 2004. Among other changes, the amended form petition added question 18 which, as noted above, instructs petitioners to explain why the \u00a7 2244(d) limitations period does not bar their petition if their judgment of conviction became final over one year prior to the petition\u2019s filing, setting forth the text of \u00a7 2244(d) in a footnote. It is the interplay between <em>Hill </em>and <em>McMillan </em>on the one hand and the revised form petition on the other, in the context of the facts before us, that forms the crux of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">As a habeas petitioner filing in the Western District of North Carolina, Bilal was required to \u201csubstantially follow\u201d the revised form petition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He claims that question 18 did not provide him with the notice and opportunity to respond required by <em>Hill. </em>He contends that a contrary finding would oblige petitioners to plead facts in anticipation of the affirmative defense of untimeliness, an outcome specifically prohibited by this court in both <em>Hill </em>and <em>McMillan.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The government counters, however, that \u201c[t]he notice contained in the new form \u00a7 2254 petition addresses the concerns\u201d of this court in <em>Hill </em>and <em>McMillan </em>\u2014 a petitioner no longer need \u201canticipate\u201d the statute of limitations defense because the form puts a petitioner on notice that he must address the timeliness of his petition if it is in question. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 5. The government argues that question 18 adequately informs a petitioner that his petition is subject to dismissal for untimeliness and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>that its inclusion of the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) \u2014 the statute that sets forth the one year limitations period applicable to \u00a7 2254 habeas petitions \u2014 makes the statutory bar immediately apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We agree with the government that <em>Hill\u2019s </em>notice requirement is not particularly onerous. <em>See Hill, </em>277 F.3d at 708 (\u201cA particularly detailed notice is not necessary nor is a hearing necessarily required.\u201d). And, in the ordinary scheme of things, the revised form petition probably serves the twin goals of achieving increased efficiency for courts and providing notice of the need to address the statute of limitations issue to petitioners. On these facts, however, the district court prematurely pretermitted an inquiry into the facts the form was designed to elicit on the basis of a response that can only fairly be described as ambiguous. Used in this way, the form seems in some tension with <em>Hill </em>in that Bilal was not provided with any guidance on the timeliness of his <em>particular </em>petition beyond the mere recitation of the statutory text of \u00a7 2244(d). The court\u2019s failure to clarify Bilal\u2019s confused response is especially problematic given the notorious complexity of \u00a7 2244(d). <em>See id. </em>at 708 (citing <em>Roseboro v. Garrison, </em>528 F.2d 309, 310 (4th Cir.1975) (\u201c[B]efore entering summary judgment ..., the District Court, as a bare minimum, should have provided [the pro se party] with fair notice of the requirements of the summary judgment rule. <em>We stress the need for a form of notice sufficiently understandable to one in appellant\u2019s circumstances fairly to appnse him, of what is required.\u201d) </em>(internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added)). Applying the statute to Bilal\u2019s petition illustrates the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The one-year limitations period of \u00a7 2244(d) begins to run from the latest of (a) \u201cthe date on which the [petitioner\u2019s] judgment became final,\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); (b) \u201cthe date on which the impediment to filing an application created by State action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed,\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B); (c) \u201cthe date on which the constitutional right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court,\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C); or (d) \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence,\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). The district court here assumed that \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(C), and \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) were inapplicable to Bilal\u2019s petition; that is, that there was no \u201cState action\u201d that impeded Bilal\u2019s filing, that Bilal asserted only \u201cconstitutional rights\u201d that had long been recognized by the Supreme Court, and that the \u201cfactual predicate\u201d underlying Bilal\u2019s claims was immediately discoverable. Assuming arguendo that the district court rightfully discounted these alternatives,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the limitations period for Bilal\u2019s petition began to run on \u201cthe date on which [his] judgment became final.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">Even this prescription presents a moving target, however, because a judgment is not \u201cfinal\u201d until the later of the date on which direct review of the petitioner\u2019s case concluded or \u201cthe expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The last stage of direct review is the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Harris v. Hutchinson, </em>209 F.3d 325, 328 n. 1 (4th Cir.2000). Because Bilal did not file a petition for writ of certiorari with the Court, his judgment of conviction became final when \u201cthe time for seeking such review\u201d expired. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). According to Supreme Court rules, the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>view period expires ninety days from the denial of a petition for writ of certiorari with the highest court in the state of conviction. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 13(1). Thus, Bilal\u2019s limitation period began to run on November 19, 2003, ninety days after the North Carolina Supreme Court denied his first certiorari petition on August 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Instead of the limitations period expiring one year later on November 19, 2004, however, the tolling provision of \u00a7 2244(d)(2),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which pauses the limitation period while review of a properly filed petition is pending, stretched the period until January 19, 2006. This date \u2014 the apparent expiration date of Bilal\u2019s \u201cone year\u201d limitation period \u2014 is more than four years after Bilal\u2019s date of conviction, but only 35 days prior to his filing the petition at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">It is in the context of this complexity that Bilal\u2019s ambiguous response must be viewed. Question 18 begins by stating a condition: <em>\u201cIf </em>your judgment of conviction became final over one year ago.\u201d J.A. 26 (emphasis added). It then requires those who satisfy the condition to state why \u00a7 2244(d) does not bar their petition. Bilal responded \u201cN/A,\u201d J.A. 26, or \u201cnot applicable,\u201d presumably because he thought that he did not satisfy the condition. Put differently, Bilal may have thought that his \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d did <em>not </em>\u201cbee[o]me final over one year ago,\u201d excusing any further explanation of statutory exceptions or equitable tolling principles that would cause his petition not to be barred by \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The government interprets Bilal\u2019s response differently, contending that Bilal simply refused to answer question 18. It would seem, though, that if Bilal were declining to answer the question he would simply have left it blank. We think it far more likely that Bilal\u2019s cryptic answer spawned from his misapprehension of the term \u201cfinal,\u201d as his counsel suggests, or from a misunderstanding of question 18 entirely. Regardless of the reason behind it, Bilal\u2019s answer was arguably responsive, if confused, not an outright refusal to answer as the government asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Rather than asking Bilal to expand or clarify his answer, or inquiring about any statutory exceptions or applicable equitable tolling principles, the district court promptly dismissed his petition. It concluded that Bilal \u201chad an opportunity in his form petition to address the timeliness of his petition and <em>declined, </em>to do so.\u201d J.A. 62 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">Though we do not fault the district court for relying on the form petition in general, we find its response on these facts to be out of step with our treatment of pro se petitioners in this and other contexts. <em>See Hill, </em>277 F.3d at 707 (\u201c[N]otice and an opportunity to respond are particularly appropriate when the prisoner is <em>pro se ... </em>and the long-standing practice is to construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings liberally.\u201d); <em>cf. id. </em>at 708 (\u201cWe also disagree that Rule 59(e) affords a <em>pro se </em>petitioner ... an adequate opportunity to respond.\u201d); <em>Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 846 (4th Cir.1985) (\u201c[W]e hold that a <em>pro se </em>litigant must receive fair notification of the consequences of [his] failure to object ... before such a procedural default will result in waiver of the right of appeal. <em>The notice must be sufficiently understandable to one in appellant\u2019s circumstances fairly to apprise him of what is required.\u201d </em>(internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added)); <em>Carter v. Hutto, </em>781 F.2d 1028, 1033 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Cir.1986) (\u201c[W]here ... the pretrial order did not adequately inform [the pro se litigant] of the degree of specificity necessary ..., and whereas [he] had obviously sought to comply, it was incumbent on the magistrate to inform [him] of the deficiency of his response and afford him the opportunity to cure it.\u201d). Indeed, the very instructions accompanying the form petition here inform petitioners that if they fail to fill out the form petition properly the district court will notify them of the error and afford them an opportunity to \u201csubmit additional or correct information,\u201d not immediately dismiss the petition without further correspondence. 5B West\u2019s Federal Forms, District Courts, Criminal \u00a7 8959 (2007) (\u201cIf you do not fill out the form properly, you will be asked to submit additional or correct information.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">We thus find the district court\u2019s sua sponte dismissal of Bilal\u2019s petition to be premature. In doing so, we are not unsympathetic to the burdens that habeas petitions lade upon our district courts and consequently limit our holding to the narrow circumstances of this case. Here, the district court was faced with Bilal\u2019s apparent confusion regarding the timeliness of his petition and an absence of evidence that he intentionally evaded the issue. Furthermore, the state had not yet had the opportunity to assert the expiration of the limitations period, an affirmative defense that it ordinarily bears the burden of raising. In this context, we read <em>Hill </em>and <em>McMillan </em>as requiring the district court to afford Bilal, a pro se petitioner, an opportunity to put forth a statutory exception or equitable tolling principle that might explain the relatively brief period by which his petition was late. <em>See Day, </em>547 U.S. at 210, 126 S.Ct. 1675 (requiring that parties be afforded <em>\u201cfair </em>notice and an opportunity to present their positions\u201d prior to sua sponte dismissal (emphasis added)). Otherwise the district court\u2019s order would once again raise the concerns present in <em>Hill </em>and <em>McMillan: </em>a district court dismissing a habeas petition without first \u201cbe[ing] certain that there [we]re no circumstances that would cause the petition to be timely.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>277 F.3d at 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b263-9\">. We express no opinion on the merits of Bilal's argument that equitable tolling or a statutory exception excuses his month-long delay in filing his petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-10\">. Because the timeliness of Bilal\u2019s petition is at issue, we briefly recount the wending path of Bilal\u2019s post-conviction challenges. First, Bilal appealed his convictions and sentence to the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which affirmed both on December 3, 2002. He then filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the North Carolina Supreme Court, which was denied on August 21, 2003. Bilal next began state post-conviction proceedings by filing a pro se Motion for Appropriate Relief (\u201cMAR\u201d) on September 30, 2004, which was denied on January 31, 2005. On March 14, 2005, Bilal filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the North Carolina Court of Appeals, which was denied on March 28, 2005.
