We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-26\">Both the United States Supreme Court and this court have long held that classifications based on membership in a federally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>recognized Indian tribe are political, rather than racial, and thus subject to rational basis review. <em>See, e.g., Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 551-55, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974); <em>Means v. Navajo Nation, </em>432 F.3d 924, 932 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Kahawaiolaa v. Norton, </em>386 F.3d 1271, 1279 (9th Cir.2004). The challenged regulation permits only \u201ctribal members\u201d to hunt big game on Indian reservations in Montana. The regulation clearly classifies based on tribal membership rather than racial status as an Indian. Accordingly, the district court correctly reviewed the regulation under the rational basis standard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Mancari, </em>417 U.S. at 554, 94 S.Ct. 2474; <em>Kahawaiolaa, </em>386 F.3d at 1279.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The district court also correctly granted summary judgment in Montana\u2019s favor. Under the highly deferential rational basis test, a classification will be upheld \u201cif there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.\u201d <em>Kahawaiolaa, </em>386 F.3d at 1279 (quoting <em>Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 319-20, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993)). Montana asserts that the regulation furthers two legitimate governmental purposes: 1) promoting the conservation of wildlife within Indian Reservations; and 2) avoiding the logistical difficulties of regulating hunting differently for tribal members and non-members within reservations because of the varying land ownership patterns within Indian Reservations. Both of these reasons are \u201cplausible policy reasons\u201d for enacting the regulation and are rationally related to allowing only tribal members to hunt big game on Indian reservations. <em>Id. </em>at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b606-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\">. We reject Roberts's assertion that Montana lacked the power to enact the regulation. The regulation does not \u201cindirectly\u201d regulate hunting and fishing by members of the Crow Tribe on Indian lands nor does it discriminate against or impede any authorized regulation of the Crow Tribe. <em>See United States v. Montana, </em>686 F.2d 766, 768-69 (9th Cir. 1982) (describing, after remand, limitations on Montana\u2019s power \u201cto regulate hunting and fishing by non-members of the Crow Tribe within the exterior boundaries of the Crow Reservation\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
