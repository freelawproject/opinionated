After a sentencing hearing, the District Court principally sentenced him to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. He challenges the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Figueroa-Taveras argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because, he asserts, the District Court gave the Guidelines range \u2014 57 to 71 months\u2014 an improper \u201cpresumption\u201d of correctness. Such presumptions are impermissible. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 259-60, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Here, however, the District Court applied no such presumption when declining to depart from the Guidelines range, but rather used the range as a \u201cstarting point and the initial benchmark,\u201d which is entirely appropriate. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Indeed, Judge Patterson specifically noted that he had the \u201clegal authority\u201d to depart from the Guidelines, but declined to do so in Figueroa-Taveras\u2019s case because he had \u201ctaken into account the provisions of Section 3553(a) of Title 18 and conclude[d] that none of the provisions of that section would lead [him] to reduce the sentence from the guideline sentence.\u201d Specifically, Judge Patterson declined a defense request to grant a downward departure on the basis of the fact that Figueroa-Taveras had spent thirteen months in prison on a separate illegal entry charge. Judge Patterson found that this did not give him \u201cmuch of a reason to depart,\u201d especially in light of \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the characteristics of the defendant as shown by the presentence report.\u201d Thus, while the District Court noted that it \u201calways [had] the discretion\u201d to depart from the Guidelines range, a lower sentence was inappropriate even in light of the prior time served, because prison time \u201cdid not seem to have deterred the defendant from reentry, in other words, from committing the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b968-12\">We have considered all of Appellant\u2019s claims and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
