For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition in part and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The facts are well-known to the parties, so we will not recount them here at length. Jie, a native and citizen of Indonesia, entered the United States in 1980. He subsequently became a lawful permanent resident in 1989. On April 8, 1994, Jie was charged as being removable for having committed two or more crimes of moral turpitude; <em>i.e., </em>bank fraud, tax evasion, and use of a false Social Security number. Jie conceded removability and applied for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was subsequently found to be an aggravated felon. After two appeals to the Board, and two remands, Jie had a hearing, and the Immigration Judge (IJ) denied \u00a7 1182(c) relief. In a thorough opinion, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s denial of relief. Through counsel, Jie then filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">Under former \u00a7 1182(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> removable aliens could request discretionary relief from removal. Favorable factors, in relevant part, include the alien\u2019s family ties in the United States, the length of the residency, hardship to the family, service to the community, proof of genuine rehabilitation, and history of employment. Negative factors include the nature, recency, and seriousness of the criminal record or other evidence of bad character. <em>Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581, 584 (BIA 1978). The BIA has held that a serious crime may require the alien to show unusual or outstanding equities in his favor to have a favorable exercise of discretion considered. <em>Matter of Buscemi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 628, 633 (BIA 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s denial of \u00a7 1182(c) relief as a matter of discretion. Under the REAL ID Act, we have jurisdiction to review questions of law or constitutional issues raised in a petition for review filed by an alien who has committed certain crimes, such as Jie\u2019s. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). However, we lack jurisdiction to consider denials of discretionary relief under section 1182(c). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Jie argues that the IJ and BIA committed legal errors in denying him \u00a7 1182(c) relief. The government argues that Jie is trying to recast his challenge to the discretionary decision as a legal issue. We agree with the Government that, despite Jie\u2019s attempt to frame his arguments within the rubric of legal and constitutional issues, his claims directly relate to the BIA\u2019s exercise of discretion in determining that section 1182(c) relief is not merited in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">First, Jie contends that the IJ and BIA wrongly determined that his crimes were of particular seriousness such that Jie needed to show unusual or outstanding equities. However, the IJ noted that \u201c[d]ue to the paucity of evidence presented by the respondent, the Court\u2019s decision would be the same even had the Court found that the nature of his equities need not have reached the level of unusual or outstanding.\u201d App. at 21. In a footnote, the BIA noted that \u201ceven assuming that the respondent is not subject to the heightened standard of showing unusual or outstanding equities, we agree with the Immigration Judge\u2019s alternative decision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>the equities in question do not sufficiently counterbalance the negative factors in his case.\u201d App. at 9. Thus, this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Next, Jie argues that the IJ and the BIA failed to consider favorable factors \u2014 Jie\u2019s community ties, his prior stable employment, and impact of removal on his family. Jie\u2019s wife and adult children testified that Jie was very helpful and supportive of members of their Indonesian-Chinese church. They also mentioned how it would be hard on the family if Jie were to be removed. The IJ noted that these were relevant factors before noting that he had not heard of any hardship anyone would suffer, or testimony of involvement in community and church activities from anyone besides Jie\u2019s family. App. at 19-20. The BIA also found that the IJ \u201cweighed the equities presented \u2014 including his employment history, medical conditions, involvement in his church, and the testimonies provided by his family members \u2014 but concluded that such equities do not outweigh the negative factors in his case.\u201d App. at 9. Because the IJ and BIA explicitly considered these factors, Jie\u2019s argument is without merit. As noted, we lack jurisdiction to re-weigh these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Finally, Jie challenges the IJ\u2019s reliance on testimony regarding Jie\u2019s restitution payments in connection with his criminal case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearing, the IJ had questioned Jie regarding how much restitution per month he had paid. App. at 290-91. In his opinion, the IJ noted that Jie had told the Court that he paid less than $500 a month towards the restitution. App. at 15-16. An exhibit received into evidence included balance sheets showing that in fact, Jie paid exactly $100 each month during his three-year period of supervision. App. at 1045-47. The exhibit showed that Jie had paid only $3400 towards his restitution. App. at 1043. After describing the evidence of the money actually paid, the IJ concluded that Jie\u2019s testimony was not truthful. App. at 16. We lack jurisdiction to consider the IJ\u2019s factual finding that Jie was not truthful. <em>Kamara v. Attorney General, </em>420 F.3d 202, 211 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">Moreover, it appears from the opinion that the IJ was more concerned with the amount paid towards restitution, which may reflect a lack of accountability, and not Jie\u2019s misrepresentation of that amount. The BIA noted that Jie did not show sorrow or contrition for his crimes and agreed with the IJ that Jie attempted to absolve himself of culpability. App. at 9. This is a factor that is properly considered in determining whether relief should be granted as a matter of discretion. <em>Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">We will dismiss the petition for review to the extent that Jie seeks review of the BIA\u2019s discretionary decision. We will otherwise deny the petition, as we discern no errors of law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b987-7\">. Jie had also applied for withholding of removal, but because his brief does not raise any challenge to the denial of withholding of removal, only denial of \u00a7 1182(c) relief is at issue here. <em>Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 221, 235 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b987-12\">. Because Jie pled guilty before the effective dates of AEDPA and IIRIRA, relief under \u00a7 1182(c) was still available to him. <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b988-6\">. Jie had been ordered to pay restitution in the amount of approximately $495,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
