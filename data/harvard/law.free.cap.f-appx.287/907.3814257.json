On appeal, Caminero challenges the District Court\u2019s refusal to grant a minor role adjustment under United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 3B1.2(b) and an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the balance of the facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-19\">Caminero first argues that the District Court erred in declining to impose a minor role adjustment. \u201cThe defendant bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he is enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>tied to a mitigating role adjustment under section 3B1.2 of the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d 230, 234 (2d Cir.2001). Furthermore, \u201cwe are mindful that a sentencing court\u2019s assessment of the defendant\u2019s role in criminal activity is highly fact-specific and depends upon the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have said that \u201c[a] reduction [pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2] will not be available simply because the defendant played a lesser role than his co-conspirators; to be eligible for a reduction, the defendant\u2019s conduct must be \u2018minor\u2019 or \u2018minimal\u2019 as compared to the average participant in such a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Rahman, </em>189 F.3d 88, 159 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam). \u201cWe review for clear error a sentencing court\u2019s finding that a defendant did not play a minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Castano, </em>234 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The District Court rejected Caminero\u2019s request for a minor role adjustment, noting (1) that Caminero had participated in two sales of MDMA involving 10,000 pills and 1,000 pills; (2) that he had knowledge that such substantial quantities of pills were being sold; (3) his working the day shift at a drug spot for his supplier; and (4) his other minor MDMA sales during such shifts. Caminero does not challenge these factual findings; instead, he argues that by only engaging in the above conduct for four months, his role in the conspiracy was \u201c \u2018minor\u2019 or \u2018minimal\u2019 as compared to the average participant in such a crime.\u201d <em>Rahman, </em>189 F.3d at 159. However, given the underlying facts found by the District Court, there was no error, much less clear error, in the District Court\u2019s characterization of Caminero\u2019s role in the conspiracy, and the District Court properly declined to apply the adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Caminero\u2019s second argument is that the District Court erred in denying a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. \u201c[T]he district court\u2019s determination of acceptance of responsibility is a factual finding that must be upheld unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Hirsch, </em>239 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have held that \u201can intentional flight from judicial proceedings\u201d provides a valid basis for denying an acceptance of responsibility adjustment, even where the defendant has pled guilty. <em>United States v. Loeb, </em>45 F.3d 719, 722 (2d Cir.1995). As it is uncontested that Caminero fled from judicial proceedings to the Dominican Republic, his challenge to the sentence on this ground fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
