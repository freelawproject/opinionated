On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled in favor of the United States. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">In February 2000, Norman acquired 85,-398 shares of stock by exercising incentive stock options (\u201cISOs\u201d) granted to him by his employer, Network Appliance, Inc. Although Norman\u2019s ISO discount exceeded $4.5 million, by holding the shares rather than cashing in he avoided realizing any income on the transaction for regular tax purposes in 2000. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7 421(a)(1). For purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax (\u201cAMT\u201d), however, the discount was taxable income, and he paid AMT in 2000 as a result. <em>See </em>I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 56(b)(3), 83(a). Moreover, the investment strategy left him exposed to market risk. Not long after he acquired the shares, the dot-com bubble burst and the stock price plummeted. By the time Norman sold his shares in 2001, they had lost three-quarters of their value from the acquisition date. For regular income tax purposes, Norman still realized a capital gain of approximately $1 million. But for AMT purposes, he realized a capital loss exceeding $3.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">On his original 2001 return, Norman reported an income tax liability of $11,023 and paid the entire amount. He later filed an amended return, however, in which he deducted his $3.5 million AMT capital loss, claimed regular tax credits equal to his gross tax liability, reported no tax liability, and requested a full refund. He sued the United States after the Internal Revenue Service took no action on the refund request.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">Although he contested the issue in the district court, Norman now concedes that I.R.C. \u00a7 1211(b), which caps deductible capital losses at $3,000 in excess of capital gains for purposes of computing regular taxable income, also applies to the determination of AMT income. Nonetheless, he still maintains that I.R.C. \u00a7 56 establishes a \u201csequential formula\u201d that allows him to fully deduct his AMT capital loss as an alternative tax net operating loss (\u201cAT-NOL\u201d) under I.R.C. \u00a7 56(d)(2)(A)(i) notwithstanding the limitations on capital loss deductions in I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 172(d) and 1211(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">We reject Norman\u2019s reading of I.R.C. \u00a7 56. Norman cannot claim any ATNOL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>because \u00a7 172(d)(2)(A) fully applies to the calculation of ATNOL under \u00a7 56(d) and disallows the deduction of any individual capital losses in excess of capital gains. <em>Kadillak v. Comm\u2019r, </em>534 F.3d 1197 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Merlo v. Comm\u2019r, </em>492 F.3d 618, 623-24 (5th Cir.2007). His AMT capital losses are deductible only directly against AMT income, and that deduction is capped at $3,000 in excess of AMT capital gains pursuant to \u00a7 1211(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
