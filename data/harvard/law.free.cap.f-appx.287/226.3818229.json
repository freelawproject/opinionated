The District Court sentenced him to imprisonment totaling 72 months. Tanis appeals his sentence. He argues that the sentence is unreasonable because if the Court had properly considered the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, it would have imposed a shorter sentence. For the reasons set forth below, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-21\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-22\">Tanis has a criminal history dating back to 1993. He was convicted in New Jersey and Pennsylvania state courts of multiple counts of cruelty to animals and unlawful possession of weapons. He fled from justice at least once and was subsequently arrested in a different state on a fugitive warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-23\">In 2005, a confidential informant told FBI agents that Tanis was in possession of machine guns. The subsequent investigation resulted in searches of his home, his vehicles, and various gun shops. Tanis cooperated in the investigation, and the end result was the seizure of over 170 firearms, plus ammunition and gun parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>In 2006, Tanis pled guilty to possession of firearms by an individual who has been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). After his guilty plea but before his sentencing, Tanis attempted to deposit into his mother\u2019s bank account ten altered or counterfeit checks. He was indicted for bank fraud, possessing and uttering forged securities, and passing or attempting to pass false and fictitious financial instruments. Tanis and the government entered into a plea agreement whereby Tanis pled guilty to misprision of a felony and the parties agreed that the appropriate sentence was 12 months and a day, to be served consecutively to the sentence for the \u00a7 922(g) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In two back-to-back sentencing hearings on March 30, 2007, the District Court handed down sentences for Tanis\u2019s crimes. For the \u00a7 922(g) offense, the Court imposed a sentence of sixty months\u2019 imprisonment followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. For the misprision of a felony, the Court accepted the plea agreement and imposed a sentence of twelve months and a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">On April 11, 2007, Tanis filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The consolidated appeal is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of [a] sentence ... under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Smalley, </em>517 F.3d 208, 214 (3d Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). \u201cWe review for plain error ... when a defendant did not object to a purported error before the sentencing court.\u201d <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>373 F.3d 339, 341 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Tanis\u2019s sole argument is that his sentences, which totaled 72 months\u2019 imprisonment, were unreasonable. He claims that the District Court did not adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors when determining his sentences. Tanis did not object at the sentencing hearing that the Court had failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, so we review the sentences for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">Tanis specifically claims that a sentence of less than 72 months would have been sufficient for deterrence purposes under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); he says that \u201ca 6 year sentence does not alter behavior significantly more than a lesser sentence, say 4 years.\u201d He argues that because of his non-violent history, his cooperation with the government, and his remorse, a lesser sentence would be sufficient to protect society under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>asserts that the Sentencing Guidelines range improperly \u201cdrove the sentence.\u201d He says that the District Court gave too much weight to the Guidelines, resulting in a sentencing process that did not conform to the \u201cspirit of <em>Booker.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">We will consider the sentences separately-</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Tanis\u2019s sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release for the \u00a7 922(g) violation did not amount to plain error. The government requested a two-level downward departure because Tanis\u2019s cooperation led to the recovery of firearms. The Court granted the departure, resulting in a Level 22 offense with a Guidelines range of 77 to 96 months. The 60-month sentence was seventeen months below the bottom of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">The transcript of the sentencing hearing shows that the Court considered the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including deterrence, punishment, promotion of respect for the law, protection of the public, and correctional treatment. The Court also listed and considered the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a)(1), including Tanis\u2019s age, his poor health, and his cooperation with the government. Addressing the nature of Tanis\u2019s offense, one of the \u00a7 3553(a)(1) factors, the Court stated that Tanis\u2019s weapons offenses were \u201cvery, very serious in the times in which we live\u201d because \u201cguns and silencers and automatic weapons are the fear of all our public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">We conclude that the Court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In addition, the Court did not violate the \u201cspirit\u201d of <em>Booker. </em>As it was required to, the Court began by calculating the Guidelines sentence. <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006). It then fashioned a sentence that properly accounted for the nature of the offense and the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">\u201cA sentence that falls within the guidelines range is more likely to be reasonable than one outside the guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>469 F.3d 319, 327 (3d Cir.2006). In this case, the sentence was below the Guidelines range. Since Tanis\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that a 60-month sentence was unreasonable, it logically follows that there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-16\">The District Court sentenced Tanis to imprisonment of twelve months and a day for misprision of a felony, to be served consecutively to the \u00a7 922(g) sentence. The sentence was imposed in accordance with the plea agreement, which states that \u201c[pjursuant to Rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the government and the defendant stipulate and agree\u201d that Tanis will be sentenced to 12 months plus one day. The parties also agreed that \u201c[t]he sentence imposed for this offense shall run consecutive[ly] to the sentence imposed on the defendant\u2019s felon in possession of a firearm offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-17\">An agreement entered under Rule 11(c)(1)(C) \u201cbinds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1)(C); <em>Bernard, </em>373 F.3d at 343. It was reasonable for the District Court to sentence Tanis in accordance with the binding plea agreement. In addition, the sentence was well below the Guidelines range of twenty-one to twenty-seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>months. Even if Tanis had not agreed to the sentence, we would consider it reasonable. <em>See Lloyd, </em>469 F.3d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-8\">. It appears that Tanis's notice of appeal was not timely. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b) provides that a notice of appeal must be filed within ten days. Since the sentencing hearings were on March 30, 2007, the ten-day deadline was April 9, 2007. Tanis\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on April 11, 2007. As the Second Circuit has explained: \u201cWhen the government properly objects to the untimeliness of a defendant\u2019s criminal appeal, Rule 4(b) is mandatory and inflexible. But Rule 4(b), even when properly invoked, does not deprive us of subject-matter jurisdiction.... [Wjhere, as here, the government forfeits an objection to the untimeliness of a defendant\u2019s appeal by failing to raise it, we act within our jurisdiction when we decide to consider the appeal as though it were timely filed.\u201d <em>United States v. Frias, </em>521 F.3d 229, 234 (2d Cir.2008) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-17\">. Tanis\u2019s expression of remorse at his \u00a7 922(g) sentencing hearing was, to put it charitably, lukewarm. He told the District Court that the guns in question (170 automatic weapons and silencers) were family heir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>looms that he needed to care for. According to his \"understanding of the current law, .... [t]here was no procedure legally for me to register them.\u201d Tanis told the Court that \"given the opportunity, I would comply with any laws that were there, if possible.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
