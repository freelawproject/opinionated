(B.I.A. Aug. 29, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">In his brief to the Court, Lin argues that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen because he will likely obtain derivative asylee status through his wife, who has a pending asylum application. However, Lin made no such argument before the BIA. Instead, Lin argued that he is eligible for asylum based on his wife\u2019s forced abortions and forced IUD insertion in China and that he has a well-founded fear of persecution in China because of his having fathered two children. Because Lin failed to raise his derivative asylee status argument in his motion before the BIA, and because the Government has raised this failure to exhaust in its brief to this Court, we decline to consider this argument. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 124 (2d Cir.2007). Because Lin has effectively waived any challenge to the only decision the Court is \u201cempowered to review,\u201d the petition for review must be denied. <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007) (denying petition where applicant failed to raise \u201cany of the issues relevant\u201d to BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
