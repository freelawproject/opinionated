Oct. 15, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-21\">As a preliminary matter, while we treat each petition for review as challenging only the BIA decision from which it was timely filed, <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995), the BIA\u2019s \u201cvarying techniques\u201d in affirming prior agency decisions \u201caffect the scope of our review.\u201d <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). In Zou\u2019s case, the language of the BIA\u2019s October 2007 decision suggests that it intended to incorporate its March 2006 decision. Accordingly, we review both of those decisions together. <em>See Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 125 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, we remain mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Maghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Here, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zou\u2019s motion to reopen because he failed to demonstrate <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for asylum, withholding of deportation, or relief under the Convention Against Torture. Contrary to Zou\u2019s assertion, there is no indication that the BIA failed to sufficiently consider the documents he submitted in support of his motion to reopen. Indeed, while the BIA was not required to \u201cexpressly parse and refute ... each and every\u201d piece of evidence Zou offered, <em>see Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 337 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006), the detailed nature of its opinions suggests that it did so. For example, the BIA provided a lengthy evaluation of the affidavit and testimony of Dr. John S. Aird, including a balancing of the information contained therein against other sources in the record, such as the U.S. State Department\u2019s 1998 China Profile. <em>Cf. Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006) (discussing the BIA\u2019s proper rejection of the \u201coft-cited Aird affidavit\u201d as a basis for granting a motion to reopen). Moreover, the BIA adequately considered the September 2002 Population and Family Planning Law before rejecting it as a basis for reopening Zou\u2019s deportation proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(providing that \u201c[t]he BIA should demonstrate that it has considered [the record] evidence, even if only to dismiss it\u201d). In light of the foregoing, there is an insufficient basis for concluding that the BIA abused its discretion in denying Zou\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>Kaur, </em>413 F.3d at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
