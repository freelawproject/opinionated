Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>CH-3443-07-0584-I-1 (M.S.P.B. October 23, 2007). Because Fortenberry has not demonstrated that the Board abused its discretion or otherwise committed legal error in its decision, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b890-22\">Fortenberry was a mail handler for the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) in Chicago, Illinois for nearly ten years. He resigned from his position at USPS, effective January 12, 1994. After resigning his employment, Fortenberry was incarcerated for a period of time. He was released on May 4, 2007. Upon his release he applied for reinstatement with USPS. On August 2, 2007, Fortenberry filed an appeal to the Board claiming that USPS had unlawfully denied his reinstatement request. Fortenberry claimed that he was told by USPS that ex-felons were not employable at the agency, while the U.S. Department of Labor informed him that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>USPS could in fact employ ex-felons. Furthermore, he claimed that USPS was required to place him at the top of the list of applicants due to his status as a veteran.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">On August 2, 2007, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) issued an acknowledgement order finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over USPS\u2019s denial of reinstatement, because Fortenberry had not made a non-frivolous claim that he had an appealable action under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 352 or 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 353. Those regulations set forth appealable actions as including reemployment requests following a compensable, work-related injury, a return from military duty, and following a reduction in force. Failure to reemploy an ex-felon is not included as an appealable action. The AJ also found that Fortenberry\u2019s veterans claim required further evidence to establish Board jurisdiction. The order instructed him to file a response stating the date of the agency\u2019s alleged violation, the date that he filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, and the date that he received written notification, if any, from the Department of Labor. Fortenberry responded to the order, but did not address the Board\u2019s jurisdiction or any correspondence with the Secretary of Labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">On October 23, 2007, the AJ issued an initial decision dismissing Fortenberry\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The AJ found that Fortenberry did not raise a non-frivolous claim under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 352 or 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 353, nor did he allege that a complaint had been submitted to the Secretary of Labor within 60 days of USPS\u2019s alleged violation, as required under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Fortenberry timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The scope of our review in an appeal from a Board decision is limited. We can only set aside the Board\u2019s decision if it was \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>see Briggs v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>331 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2003). The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to actions specifically made appealable by law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a); <em>see Todd v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>55 F.3d 1574, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1995). Fortenberry, as the appellant, must show by a preponderance of evidence that the Board has jurisdiction over his claim. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Fortenberry has not shown that the Board had jurisdiction to hear his appeal. He has not alleged that his appeal meets any standard for Board jurisdiction found in any law, rule, or regulation. Rather, he alleges that USPS incorrectly believes that ex-felons cannot work at the agency. That question \u2014 whether ex-felons may or may not be employed by USPS \u2014 is not the issue before us, however. Even if Fortenberry were correct in his assertion that ex-felons may be employable, USPS\u2019s alleged misinterpretation of applicable labor laws still does not create a Boardappealable action. Similarly, the alleged misinformation provided by USPS to Fortenberry regarding his employability with the agency does not establish Board jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Fortenberry also argues that his status as a veteran entitles him to reemployment with USPS. The AJ construed this argument as a Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 (\u201cVEOA\u201d) claim. We similarly construe Fortenberry\u2019s claim. To establish Board jurisdiction based on VEOA, Fortenberry must show that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>filed an appeal with the Secretary of Labor within 60 days after the date of the agency\u2019s violation. <em>See 5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a. Fortenberry has not claimed that he ever filed a complaint with the Department of Labor. Thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction over his VEO A claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Fortenberry has not demonstrated that the Board abused its discretion or otherwise committed legal error. Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">\n<em>No costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
