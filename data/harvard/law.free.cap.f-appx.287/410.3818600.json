Crews was responsible for determining which employees should staff a project, reviewing employees, setting salary recommendations, and directing assignments. Crews consistently received strong performance evaluations and was expected to laterally transfer to a Dow position in Europe. However, Crews\u2019s human resources business part<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ner, Tom Hutson, noticed that Crews displayed hand tremors, slurred speech, and decreased engagement at meetings. Crews\u2019s supervisor, Margaret Walker, also noticed unusual behavior from Crews, including: inability to make organized arguments concerning topics she was very knowledgeable about; discussing improper topics during work-related meetings; missing or failing to cancel meetings; and difficulty in using routine office equipment. Accordingly, Dow notified Crews that her work duties were restricted until she completed a fitness-for-duty assessment by independent medical physicians. Such restrictions included restricted access to Dow\u2019s premises, e-mail, and verbal communications. Crews continued to receive full pay and benefits and was informed that her \u201csole work priority\u201d was to cooperate with Dow Health Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">On March 16, 2006, upon receiving written notice of the required fitness-for-duty assessment, Crews filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging disability-based discrimination in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq. </em>Four days later, Crews told a Dow physician that she wanted to pursue long-term disability benefits and admitted that she was being treated for depression and bipolar disorder via a complex prescription medication regime. Crews presented a certification from her personal physician and, pursuant to her own request, was placed on full-time paid medical leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d). When the FMLA leave expired, Crews continued to receive pay and benefits from Dow.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Crews then applied for long-term disability and Social Security benefits. Crews submitted documentation from her personal physician, stating: \u201cI do not believe [Crews] will be able to return to her previous job.\u201d On September 27, 2006, when Crews began receiving long-term disability benefits, she ceased to be a Dow employee and no longer received payment from Dow. Every two to three months, Crews\u2019s personal physician re-certifies that Crews will not be able to return to work in the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Crews sued Dow alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>discrimination in violation of the ADA based upon her physical impairment of severe hand tremors. Specifically, Crews alleges that Dow discriminated against her by: (1) restricting her access to work premises and e-mail; (2) canceling her transfer to Europe; and (3) terminating her employment. The district court granted Dow\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that Dow did not discriminate against Crews because she cannot simultaneously receive long-term disability benefits and remain an employee of Dow. Crews now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Melton v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n of Am., </em>114 F.3d 557, 559 (5th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Clark v. America\u2019s Favorite Chicken Co., </em>110 F.3d 295, 297 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Under the ADA, an employer may not \u201cdiscriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). A \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d is \u201can individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). To determine whether someone is a qualified individual, we must determine \u201cwhether the individual could perform the essential functions of the job\u201d and, if not, determine \u201cwhether any reasonable accommodation by the employer would enable him to perform those functions.\u201d <em>Chandler v. City of Dallas, </em>2 F.3d 1385, 1393-94 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Where a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d relies upon circumstantial evidence to establish unlawful discrimination under the ADA, we apply the well-known <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting framework. <em>See McInnis v. Alamo Cmty. Coll. Dist., </em>207 F.3d 276, 279 (5th Cir. 2000). \u201cUnder this framework, a plaintiff must first make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of discrimination by establishing that: (l)[h]e is disabled or is regarded as disabled; (2) he is qualified for the job; (3) he was subjected to an adverse employment action on account of his disability; and (4) he was replaced by or treated less favorably than non-disabled employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279-80. \u201cOnce the plaintiff makes his <em>prima facie </em>showing, the burden then shifts to the defendant-employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280. Then, the burden \u201cshifts back upon the plaintiff to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the articulated reason was merely a pretext for unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We find that Crews did not suffer unlawful discrimination when Dow restricted her access to work premises and e-mail and cancelled her transfer to Europe pending completion of a fitness-for-duty assessment. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Crews established a prima facie case, Dow articulated a legitimate, non-discriminatory rationale for requiring Crews to undergo a fitness-for-duty assessment-namely, the changes in Crews\u2019s workplace behavior noticed by Hutson and Walker. Dow reasonably could have found that such changes might impair Crews\u2019s performance as a Resource Leader.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on the summary judgment record, Crews has not established that this rationale was pretextual. Therefore, Crews has not established a violation of the ADA.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Regarding Crews\u2019s termination, which occurred upon her receipt of long-term disability benefits, we find that Crews is not a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d under the ADA. According to her own physician, Crews cannot return to work in the foreseeable future. Thus, Crews cannot perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodation. As the district court found, receipt of long-term disability benefits and Social Security benefits means that Crews is unable to perform her job.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Crews cannot claim incapacity to work for these purposes and then claim capacity to work for purposes of the ADA. Accordingly, as of her receipt of long-term disability benefits, Crews is not a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d under the ADA and the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Dow.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\">.
