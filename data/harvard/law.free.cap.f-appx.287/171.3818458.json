For the following reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-17\">We write exclusively for the parties, who are familiar with the factual context and legal history of this case. Therefore, we will set forth only those facts necessary to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-18\">This litigation arose over the contamination of the Malvern TCE Superfund Site in Malvern, Pennsylvania, where Chemclene Corporation had previously processed and stored industrial waste for many years. In 1996, the EPA informed the litigants that they were potentially responsible parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d) under CERCLA \u00a7 107(a). Appellees, members of the Chemclene Site Defense Group (\u201cCSDG\u201d), entered into a consent decree with the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, agreeing to undertake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>remediation of the site. In 2002, the CSDG brought a contribution action under CERCLA \u00a7 113 against the remaining PRPs, including Simon.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The District Court ultimately found Simon liable to the CSDG for contribution as a transporter of hazardous waste under CERCLA \u00a7\u00a7 113(f) and 107(a). The District Court found that the expenses submitted by CSDG, with one exception, were consistent with the National Contingency Plan (\u201cNCP\u201d) as mandated by CERCLA \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B), yielding $4,224,701 in allocable past costs. Based on the remedies approved in the EPA\u2019s Record of Decision (\u201cROD\u201d), the District Court estimated future allocable costs for the site to be $17,872,964. In addition, the Court found that CSDG would incur $1,000,000 to the EPA in oversight costs. Thus, the Court determined that the total (past and future) allocable response cost was $23,097,665. CSDG received settlements in the amount of $6,630,670, resulting in a remaining allocable cost amount of $16,466,995. Based on relative shares of waste and other factors, the District Court determined that Simon was responsible for 6.25% of the remaining allocable costs. In addition, the District Court applied an uncertainty premium of 50% to this amount, increasing Simon\u2019s responsibility to 9.38% of the remaining allocable costs. On July 7, 2006, based on these calculations, the District Court ordered Simon to pay CSDG $1,544,604.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">We have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We will set aside a District Court\u2019s findings of fact only if they are clearly erroneous. <em>FMC Corp. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Commerce, </em>29 F.3d 833, 838 (3d Cir.1994). We exercise de novo review over the District Court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>United States v. Dentsply Intern., Inc., </em>399 F.3d 181, 186 (3d Cir.2005). \u201cA district court\u2019s allocation of CERCLA response costs in a contribution action is reviewed for abuse of discretion. An abuse of discretion occurs when the district court\u2019s decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact, an errant conclusion of law or an improper application of law to fact.\u201d <em>Beazer East, Inc. v. Mead Corp., 412 </em>F.3d 429, 446 (3d Cir. 2005) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">Simon argues that (1) Appellees failed to prove that Simon is liable as a transporter under CERCLA; (2) entry of monetary judgment, rather than declaratory judgment, for future costs was erroneous, as future costs are unknown, and the \u201cuncertainty premium\u201d was improperly applied to past costs; and (3) Appellees failed to prove that past costs were necessary and compliant with the NCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">CERCLA \u00a7 107 provides that liability may only be imposed on a \u201cresponsible party.\u201d <em>United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp., </em>964 F.2d 252, 258 (3d Cir. 1992). CERCLA \u00a7 107(a) defines four categories of responsible parties, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXf\">any person who accepts or accepted any hazardous substances for transport to disposal or treatment facilities, incineration vessels or sites selected by such person, from which there is a release, or a threatened release which causes the incurrence of response costs, of a hazardous substance ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 107(a)(4). Simon does not dispute that it accepted hazardous substances for transport to the site, or that it did actually transport these substances to the site. It disputes only that Simon \u201cselected\u201d the site. We have construed transporter liability to include those parties that actively participated in the decision regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>location for disposal of a generator\u2019s waste. <em>Tippins Inc. v. USX Corp., </em>37 F.3d 87, 94 (3d Cir.1994) (\u201c[A] person is liable as a transporter not only if it ultimately selects the disposal facility, but also when it actively participates in the disposal decision to the extent of having had substantial input into which facility was ultimately chosen.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Appellees adduced a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence that together show that the District Court did not clearly err when it determined that Simon selected or actively participated in the selection of the Chemclene site: (1) Chemclene employees did not know where Simon\u2019s waste originated, indicating that the waste generators had no relationship with Chemclene. This lack of relationship implies that the waste generators were unlikely to have specifically selected the Chemclene site as their disposal site; (2) in a letter regarding Simon\u2019s contract with a particular generator, the President of Chemclene informed Simon that Chemclene was in compliance with the relevant regulations, raising the inference that Simon was advising that generator, and thus taking an active role in site selection; (3) Simon brought many loads of waste to Chemclene over a period of years for many different customers, supporting the inference that Simon often had input into site selection; and (4) a contracting officer at one generator with whom Simon contracted testified that it was that generator\u2019s policy not to tell a transporter where to take its waste, raising the inference that Simon, and not the generator, selected Chemclene as the site for that generator\u2019s waste. This evidence is sufficient to support the District Court\u2019s finding that it was more likely than not that Simon had actively participated in the selection of the Chemclene site. Therefore, the District Court did not clearly err in holding Simon liable as a transporter under CERCLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Simon next argues that the District Court erred in awarding a monetary judgment on this contribution claim, as opposed to declaratory judgment. However, Simon cites no statutory authority for this proposition. CERCLA \u00a7 113(g)(2) requires declaratory judgments for cost recovery actions, but \u00a7 113(g)(3), which governs contribution actions, contains no such requirement. Simon relies primarily on <em>Beazer, </em>412 F.3d 429, for the proposition that a declaratory judgment is required in contribution actions. <em>Beazer, </em>however, does not stand for this proposition. <em>Beazer </em>itself relied in part on a First Circuit case, <em>United States v. Davis, </em>261 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2001), which held that declaratory judgments were permitted in contribution actions, but not required. <em>Id. </em>at 46. That circuit has also held that a monetary judgment may be an applicable remedy in a contribution action. <em>See Am. Cyanamid Co. v. Capuano, </em>381 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.2004). In that case, the Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\">[t]he district court acted consistent with CERCLA\u2019s goals by entering a monetary judgment before the remediation was completed. Entering a monetary judgment fosters an incentive for timely settlements and provides finality for those parties that choose to settle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-8\">The fact that the monetary judgment is entered based on an estimate, therefore, does not on its own make that judgment unjust. The district court entertained many possibilities regarding the estimate of total response costs and both sides had opportunities to suggest whether the estimated response cost was too low or too high. After reviewing the possible estimated costs, the district court [came to a conclusion regarding] the best estimate of total response costs and entered a judgment using that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>est\u00edmate. We believe it was not error to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 26-27. Similarly, monetary relief was appropriate in this case because remediation could take more than thirty years, and such relief provides finality, as well as a greater likelihood that Appellees will be able to actually collect on their judgment. In contribution cases, the Court has the power to fashion remedies based on equitable considerations. CERCLA \u00a7 113(f)(1) (\u201cIn resolving contribution claims, the court may allocate response costs among liable parties using such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.\u201d). Thus, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in awarding monetary relief in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Simon also takes issue with the \u201cuncertainty premium\u201d applied by the District Court. As Simon concedes, the ultimate total cost of cleanup \u201cwill continue to be a moving target.\u201d It therefore asserts that the application of an uncertainty premium of fifty percent to past and future costs is in error, where past costs are known and future costs are speculative in nature. However, it is precisely because of this uncertainty that the District Court awarded the premium in this case. The District Court reasoned that the use of an uncertainty premium is often an effective mechanism to \u201cto ensure that the parties assuming cleanup are not unduly burdened by unforeseen future costs, and to acknowledge the benefit settling parties receive in resolving their liability early.\u201d <em>Action Mfg. Co. v. Simon Wrecking Co., </em>428 F.Supp.2d 288, 332 (E.D.Pa.2006). Because it found that there was evidence that the ultimate total cost of cleanup could be higher than originally anticipated and that the cleanup could take thirty years, the District Court found that an uncertainty premium on total costs was an equitable method of acknowledging the benefit received by Simon in resolving its liability prior to the completion of the cleanup. Because the District Court is permitted to allocate costs in such an equitable manner, CERCLA \u00a7 113(f)(1), it has not abused its discretion in imposing an uncertainty premium here.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Simon finally argues that Appellees have produced no evidence to support the conclusion that the costs already incurred by the CSDG are \u201cnecessary costs of response incurred ... consistent with the national contingency plan\u201d as required by CERCLA \u00a7 107(a)(4)(B). This argument is meritless. As the regulations state,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">For the purpose of cost recovery under section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA: ... (ii) Any response action carried out in compliance with the terms of an order issued by EPA pursuant to section 106 of CERCLA, or a consent decree entered into pursuant to section 122 of CERCLA, will be considered \u201cconsistent with the NCP.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.700(c)(3). Here, the CSDG members have entered into a consent decree pursuant to CERCLA \u00a7 122. As Simon has introduced no evidence that the CSDG has failed to comply with the terms of the consent decree, the CSDG\u2019s actions are therefore presumed to be consistent with the NCP. <em>See, e.g., Bancamerica Commercial Corp. v. Mosher Steel of Kansas, Inc., </em>100 F.3d 792, 796-97 (10th Cir.1996). Regardless, Appellees have introduced evidence that the costs they have incurred are \u201cnecessary to the containment and cleanup of hazardous releases.\u201d <em>Redland Soccer Club, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Army of the United States, </em>55 F.3d 827, 850 (3d Cir.1995) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). Chris Young, the project manager for the CSDG, testified that the costs incurred by the CSDG were directed to the investigation and cleanup of the site. The fact that some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the costs were incurred in the evaluation of less costly alternative remedies does not render such costs unnecessary. Therefore, the District Court did not err in determining that response costs as calculated by the Court were necessary and compliant with the NCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
