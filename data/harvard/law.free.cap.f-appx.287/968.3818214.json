The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants McCari\u2019s, Inc. and Duquesne Light Company. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-20\">Eugene Schirra, a union steam fitter and pipe fitter for nearly thirty years, worked as a contractor at several industrial sites. During that time period, his daughter, Karen Jesensky, regularly loaned her car to him for a work carpool, picked him up from his bus stop after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>work, and washed his work clothes. In late 1994 or early 1995, Jesensky was diagnosed with mesothelioma, seriously impairing her health.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Jesensky filed claims against sixty-nine defendants in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas. She alleged her mesothelioma was caused by secondhand exposure to asbestos products present at her father\u2019s workplaces. Most of the defendants were manufacturers or suppliers of asbestos products.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Two defendants \u2014 MeCarl\u2019s and Duquesne Light \u2014 were neither manufacturers nor suppliers of asbestos products. Jesensky\u2019s claims against McCarl\u2019s allegedly arise out of a four-month period during which McCarl\u2019s employed Schirra at Babcock &amp; Wilcox\u2019s steel mill in Koppel, Pennsylvania. Jesensky\u2019s claims against Duquesne Light Company arise out of a four-year period in which Schirra worked at the Shippingport Atomic Power Station. The Shippingport power plant, which used a nuclear reactor as a source for generating commercial electricity, was overseen by the Atomic Energy Commission (\u201cAEC\u201d) in exercise of its authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011 <em>et seq. </em>Duquesne Light Company contracted with the AEC to participate in the construction and operation of the power plant. Schirra worked at the Shippingport power plant as an independent contractor of Duquesne Light Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Jesensky\u2019s complaint, originally filed in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas, was removed by Duquesne Light under the federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In District Court, Duquesne Light moved for summary judgment, contending that Jesensky\u2019s complaint failed to properly plead a claim, and if a claim had been properly pleaded, that it owed no duty to Jesensky under Pennsylvania law. The Magistrate Judge interpreted Jesensky\u2019s complaint as asserting a claim of negligence, predicated on a premises liability theory, -without discussing the sufficiency of the pleadings. Reaching the merits, the Magistrate Judge recommended granting Duquesne Light\u2019s motion, finding the company owed Jesensky no duty under Pennsylvania law. The District Court, adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, granted summary judgment in favor of Duquesne Light Company without further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>McCarl\u2019s also moved for summary judgment in District Court, contending that it had not been identified as a source of any asbestos exposure that allegedly injured Jesensky. The Magistrate Judge, finding that Jesensky had not alleged any facts to support a negligence claim against McCarl\u2019s and indicating that no such claim could be found in the pleadings, recommended granting McCarl\u2019s summary judgment motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of McCarl\u2019s without further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The District Court was correct to dismiss Jesensky\u2019s claims against McCarl\u2019s based on the insufficiency of the pleadings, and the same reasoning is dispositive as to the claims against Duquesne Light. In the briefs, Jesensky characterizes the complaint as asserting a claim for negligence based on the company\u2019s \u201cfailure to warn\u201d of the dangers of the asbestos products used at its facility. <em>See, e.g., </em>Jesensky Br. at 11 (\u201cAlthough the Complaint in the present action is couched in terms principally applicable to product defendants, the essential claim against Duquesne Light is predicated on its failure to warn or otherwise protect Mr. Schirra, and thus derivatively Ms. Jesensky, against off-premises transportation of asbestos fibers.\u201d). At oral argument, Jesensky noted \u201cthe essence of our theory was that it was a negligence premises liability case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">These state law claims are absent from Jesensky\u2019s complaint. On its face, the complaint is void of any reference to a premises liability claim or \u201cfailure to warn\u201d theory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At oral argument, Jesensky conceded the complaint\u2019s deficiency, stating: \u201cit\u2019s true that that\u2019s not how we pled it; it was an inartful pleading.\u201d Moreover, Jesensky admitted at oral argument that the complaint \u201cshould have been amended.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Even so, Jesensky has not submitted a proposed amended complaint on this appeal. And there is no record of her having ever prepared or submitted a proposed amended complaint in the past. In a lawsuit that now dates back twelve years, we decline to permit amendment of the pleadings where the plaintiff has never moved to amend her complaint nor offered any explanation for her failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Duquesne Light Company and McCarl\u2019s. Accordingly, the Jesenskys\u2019 claims against both defendants are dismissed without leave to amend.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-9\">. Jesensky's husband also asserts claims relating to the injuries sustained by Karen Jesensky.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b991-7\">. Jesensky\u2019s claims against most of these defendants were either settled or dismissed in state court for Jesensky's failure to proffer evidence showing that her father was in contact with particular products. <em>See Eckenrod v. GAF Corp., </em>375 Pa.Super. 187, 544 A.2d 50, 52 (1988) (to survive a motion for summary judgment in an asbestos case, a plaintiff must establish that injuries were caused by the product of a particular manufacturer or supplier and must present evidence to show that he/she inhaled asbestos fibers shed by the specific product).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b991-8\">. Removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1) is proper if the moving party: (1) demonstrates that it acted under the direction of an officer of the United States; (2) demonstrates a causal nexus between Plaintiffs\u2019 claims and the acts it performed under color of federal office; and (3) raises a colorable federal defense. <em>See Mesa v. California, </em>489 U.S. 121, 124-35, 109 S.Ct. 959, 103 L.Ed.2d 99 (1989). Duquesne Light Company contends removal was proper here because, in constructing and operating the Shippingport power plant, it: (1) acted under the supervision and specific direction of Rear Admiral H.G. Rickover, Director of the Division of Naval Reactors of the AEC and his assigned officers; (2) followed Admiral Rickover\u2019s express orders in designing, constructing and operating the plant; and (3) indicated its intent to pursue the \"government contractor defense\" articulated in <em>Boyle v. United Techs. Corp., </em>487 U.S. 500, 108 S.Ct. 2510, 101 L.Ed.2d 442 (1988). Jesensky contends removal was improper and seeks remand to state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b992-5\">. The Magistrate Judge issued a Supplemental Report and Recommendation on the motion by McCarl's following Jesensky\u2019s filing of objections to the Magistrate Judge's initial Report and Recommendation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b992-6\">. The complaint alleges, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-7\">[\u00b6] 7. Defendants, at all times relevant and pertinent hereto, were engaged in the business of mining and/or milling and/or manufacturing and/or fabricating and/or supplying and/or selling asbestos-containing products to which plaintiff was exposed. Specifically, in the case of defendant Foster Wheeler Corporation, this includes the utilization of asbestos-containing products in the construction and/or reconstruction and/or repair of boilers in powerhouses, industrial facilities and elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-11\">[\u00b6] 10. Plaintiff's diseases [sic] as set forth herein with associated complications was [sic] directly and proximately caused by the acts of the defendants acting through their agents, servants and employees and the defendants are liable therefore, jointly and severally, to the plaintiff for their negligence, breach of warranty and as a result of the strict duty and liability imposed under Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-12\">[\u00b6] 11. The defendants mined and/or milled and/or manufactured and/or fabricated and/or supplied and/or sold products which they knew were defective and/or unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer, such as plaintiff, and acted in such a manner which was willful, wanton, gross and in total disregard for the health and safety of the user or consumer, i.e., plaintiff.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
