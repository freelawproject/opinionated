Holt contends that the district court abused its discretion when it imposed a sentence above the recommended Guidelines range without setting forth clear reasons for the departure. He argues that, absent articulated reasons for the sentence, this court cannot review it for reasonableness, as it is required to do under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He also maintains that the court\u2019s sentence was not a \u201cGuidelines sentence,\u201d urging that the court did not follow U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Section 4A1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-9\">(a)(l)Standard for Upward Departure.\u2014 If reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">\u00a9Types of Information Forming the Basis for Upward Departure. \u2014 The information described in subsection (a) may include information concerning the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">(A)Prior sentence(s) not used in computing the criminal history category (e.g., sentences for foreign and tribal offenses).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-14\">(B) Prior sentence(s) of substantially more than one year imposed as a result of independent crimes committed on different occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-15\">(C) Prior similar misconduct established by a civil adjudication or by a failure to comply with an administrative order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-16\">(D) Whether the defendant was pending trial or sentencing on another charge at the time of the instant offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-17\">(E) Prior similar adult criminal conduct not resulting in a criminal conviction ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-18\">(4)(B)In a case in which the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2g\">\u00a9Written Specification of Basis for Departure. \u2014 In departing from the otherwise applicable criminal history category under this policy statement, the court shall specify in writing the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqs\">(l)In the case of an upward departure, the specific reasons why the applicable criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-19\">The court\u2019s written Statement of Reasons explains the facts justifying the departure, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-20\">The Court departs from the advisory guideline range for reasons authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>by the sentencing guideline manual.... The sentence imposed departs <em>above the advisory guideline range </em>for the following reasons____government motion for departure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 4A1.3 Criminal History inadequacy. ... The defendant\u2019s criminal history (33 criminal history points) is not adequately reflected in the criminal history category VI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The Statement of Reasons also adopts the presentence investigation report without change, which provides details on Holt\u2019s past convictions, including felonies and misdemeanors. The district court provided sufficiently specific written reasons accompanying the judgment of conviction for why the criminal history category underrepresented Holt\u2019s criminal history. It also provided adequate reasoning for its incremental upward departure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In so doing, the district court followed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4AI.3 and thus imposed a \u201cGuidelines sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Holt also maintains that the district court\u2019s upward departure was unreasonable. Under <em>Booker, </em>this court reviews Holt\u2019s sentence for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In making this reasonableness determination, we review both the decision to depart and the extent of the departure \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This court looks first to whether the district court committed procedural error when it sentenced Holt. <em>See id. </em>at 596. Although the Guidelines generally direct a court to determine the extent of a departure by reference to \u201cthe criminal history category applicable to defendants whose criminal history or likelihood to recidivate most closely resembles that of the defendant\u2019s,\u201d no express reference is needed if it is evident that the court bypassed criminal history categories it deemed inadequate. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(4)(B); <em>United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 419 (5th Cir.2005). At the sentencing hearing, the Government put into context the frequency with which Holt had been convicted. The district court\u2019s agreement with the Government that an upward departure was warranted makes evident that the district court bypassed categories it deemed inadequate. <em>See id.-, see also United States v. Rosogie, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>21 F.3d 632, 633-34 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, as we have discussed, the district court complied with \u00a7 4A1.3(c) in its Statement of Reasons for the sentence that it imposed and correctly applied \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(A). <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348-49 (5th Cir.2006). The court also implicitly considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors pertaining to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct when it addressed Holt\u2019s recidivism in adopting the PSR, which stated, \u201cThe defendant\u2019s criminal history is one of continuing criminal behavior.... The defendant has repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to continue to commit new criminal offenses and not abide by the laws governing society.\u201d <em>See, e.g., United States v. Everist, </em>368 F.3d 517, 521 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe court already had made plain its view of the severity of ... [appellant\u2019s] conduct when it discussed the presentence report and the manner of the sentence calculation. Because the seriousness of the offense was an important and allowable element under \u00a7 3553(a), the court\u2019s statements imply consideration of relevant factors under the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Given that the district court made no significant procedural error when it upwardly departed, this court next looks to whether the sentence was substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. In light of Holt\u2019s criminal history, the sentence that he received was neither unreasonable nor an abuse of discretion. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 348-49; <em>Rosogie, </em>21 F.3d at 633-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">. The Government stated at the sentencing proceeding, \u201cThe government is asking for a sentence above the recommended range. The defendant in this case has 33 criminal history points. In the last nine years he\u2019s had five convictions. In 18 years he\u2019s had 17 convictions. He has a total of ten felony offenses to his credit. The criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of his true criminal history or his propensity or likelihood to reoffend. We are asking for a sentence above the recommended range.\u201d The court then found, \"I would agree that the criminal history of six does not adequately represent the defendant's actual propensity to commit crime and that an upward departure would be appropriate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">. See discussion <em>infra </em>discussing the court\u2019s bypassing of criminal categories that it deemed inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\">. Holt urges that there is no \"writing contained within the record of this case wherein the district court addresses why the applicable criminal history categoiy substantially under-represents the seriousness of Holt's criminal history. Nor is there any writing by the district court which addresses the likelihood that Holt will commit other crimes.\u201d Because we find that the court provided adequate reasoning for why the criminal history category under-represented Holt's criminal history, we need not address the court\u2019s consideration of the likelihood of future crimes. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(c) (\"In departing from the otherwise applicable criminal history category under this policy statement, the court shall specify in writing the following: (1) In the case of an upward departure, the specific reasons why the applicable criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history <em>or </em>the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
