Hayes, United States District Judge for the Southern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Plaintiffs-Appellants Louis and Frank Perretta (Plaintiffs), representatives of a class of limited partners of Prometheus Income Partners, LP (the Partnership), appeal the dismissal of their first amended complaint. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recount them here, except as necessary to explain our decision. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The vote of the limited partners in the Partnership was sufficient to ratify the transaction. California Corporate Code \u00a7 15686(f)(1)(E) requires only an \u201caffirmative vote of a majority in interest of the limited partners\u201d to approve \u201ctransactions in which the general partners have an actual or potential conflict of interest with the limited partners or the partnership.\u201d The statute makes no distinction between disinterested limited partners and those who are affiliates of the general partner, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 15611(q) (defining \u201c[(limited partner\u201d as \u201ca person who has been admitted to a limited partnership as a limited partner in accordance with the partnership agreement\u201d), and the Partnership\u2019s partnership agreement expressly permitted the general partner to hold limited partnership interests. We reject Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that section 15636 merely sets forth the requirements for such transactions to have legal effect. Rather, the statute sets forth how the \u201crights <em>and duties </em>of the partners in relation to the limited partnership shall be determined,\u201d including the duty of loyalty the general partner owes to the partnership and the limited partners. As Plaintiffs admit that 50.7% of all outstanding limited partner units were voted to approve the merger, the merger was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">The limited partners\u2019 ratification of the merger extinguishes Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for a breach of Defendants\u2019 duty of loyalty, unless they can show that Defendants\u2019 disclosure leading up to the vote was inadequate or misleading. <em>Skone v. Quanco Farms, </em>261 Cal.App.2d 237, 241, 68 Cal.Rptr. 26 (1968).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), requires that \u201cthe circumstances constituting fraud ... shall be stated with particularity.\u201d In this case, Plaintiffs fail to identify any concrete <em>facts </em>which Defendants failed to disclose. First, the date of the appraisals, the 2% brokerage commission, the 1% disposition fee, the loan pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>payment penalty, the history of the negotiations with Aspen (including a complete copy of the correspondence between Prometheus and Aspen), and the composition of the Merger consideration were all disclosed in the proxy statement. Whether those costs were fair or reasonable was a decision for the voting unitholders to make, not this court. Second, the cost to repair the construction defects was explicitly identified as an \u201cestimate,\u201d and the proxy statement included a disclaimer with respect to \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d The fact that Defendants had already signed repair contracts for less than that amount does not mean that those estimates for the final price were fraudulent. Because Plaintiffs have failed to specify any material fact that Defendants failed to disclose, the ratification vote extinguishes their claim for breach of fiduciary duty, and the district court did not err in dismissing the suit under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-11\">. Plaintiffs maintain that, even if there was a ratification, such a ratification would only place the burden of proving unfairness on them, rather than extinguishing their claim altogether. In support of this contention, they cite only cases drawn from Delaware corporate law. Their argument is triply unpersuasive: (1) the cases they cite involve only those involving a <em>dominant </em>shareholder, not, as with Defendants, holders of an 18.2% bloc, <em>see, e.g., Emerald Partners v. Berlin, </em>726 A.2d 1215, 1223 (Del.1999); <em>Kahn v. Lynch Commc\u2019n Sys., Inc., </em>638 A.2d 1110, 1116 (Del. 1994); (2) there is no evidence that California has adopted <em>Kahn </em>burden-shifting even in that limited context; and (3) even Delaware courts have declined to extend <em>Kahn </em>to limited partnerships, <em>see, e.g., R.S.M. Inc. v. Alliance Capital Mgmt. Holdings L.P., </em>790 A.2d 478, 498 n. 28 (Del.Ch.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
