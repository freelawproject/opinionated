EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">Plaintiff-Appellant Nicholas Harrison appeals from the district court\u2019s decision denying his request to remand his claims against Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Jolly to Oklahoma state court. Harrison also appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to resubstitute Jolly as the defendant in this case. We find neither claim convincing, and pursuant to our appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decisions. In addition, we GRANT Harrison\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">Harrison was enrolled as a student at the University of Central Oklahoma where he was a participant in the United States Army Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (\u201cROTC\u201d) Program. Lieutenant Colonel Jolly was Harrison\u2019s commanding officer in the ROTC program. After Harrison failed to complete several ROTC program requirements, Jolly recommended that the Army remove Harrison from the program. The Army agreed and ordered Harrison\u2019s removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-15\">After his removal, Harrison filed suit against Jolly in state court. The United States Attorney then certified, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679, that Jolly acted within the scope of his employment during the incidents alleged in Harrison\u2019s complaint. As a result of this certification, the case was removed to federal court and the United States was substituted for Jolly as the defendant. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)(2). After Harrison returned from active mili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tary duty service, the district court denied his motion to remand and dismissed his claims. Liberally construing his pro se brief, as we must, Harrison contends on appeal that the district court erred by failing to remand his case to state court and by failing to substitute Jolly for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Title 28, section 2679(d)(2) of the United States Code squarely dictates that once the Attorney General has certified that the government employee was acting within the scope of his employment, a district court may not remand the case to state court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Osborn v. Haley, </em>549 U.S. 225, 127 S.Ct. 881, 894, 166 L.Ed.2d 819 (2007). As the Supreme Court explained, \u201cCongress gave district courts no authority to return cases to state courts on the ground that the Attorney General\u2019s certification was unwarranted.... For purposes of establishing a forum to adjudicate the case ... \u00a7 2679(d)(2) renders the Attorney General\u2019s certification dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the district court properly denied Harrison\u2019s motion to remand the case to state court because it was powerless to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Section 2679(d)(2)\u2019s bar on remand, however, does not prevent the district court from resubstituting the federal official as the defendant for purposes of trial if the certification was improper. <em>Id. </em>We review de novo the district court\u2019s legal determination that the Attorney General\u2019s certification was proper. <em>See Richman v. Straley, </em>48 F.3d 1139, 1145 (10th Cir.1995); <em>see also Council on Am. Islamic Relations v. Ballenger, </em>444 F.3d 659, 664 (D.C.Cir. 2006). We refer to Oklahoma state law to determine whether Jolly acted within the scope of his employment. <em>See Richman, </em>48 F.3d at 1145; <em>see also Ballenger, </em>444 F.3d at 663. Under Oklahoma law, an employee acts within\u2019 the scope of his employment if he is \u201cengaged in work assigned, or if [he is] doing that which is proper, necessary and usual to accomplish the work assigned.\u201d <em>Nail v. City of Henryetta, </em>911 P.2d 914, 917 (Okla.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Turning to the instant case, our analysis begins with the Attorney General\u2019s certification, which provides us with prima facie evidence that Jolly acted within the scope of his employment. <em>Richman, </em>48 F.3d at 1145. Harrison bears the burden of overcoming the presumption this prima facie evidence creates. <em>Id. </em>In an attempt to meet this burden, Harrison argues that Jolly acted beyond the scope of his employment because Jolly\u2019s actions were malicious, willful, and wanton. Harrison, however, provides us only with this conclusory argument. Without more, he has failed to rebut the presumption the certification created, and accordingly, the district court properly declined his invitation to resubstitute Jolly as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision to deny Harrison\u2019s requests to remand the case to state court and to resubstitute Jolly as the defendant. In addition, we GRANT Harrison\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-10\"> After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b747-7\">.
