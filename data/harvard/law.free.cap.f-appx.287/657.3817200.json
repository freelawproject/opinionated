GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b679-14\">After a five day trial in this diversity action, a jury found that Medical Savings Insurance Company (\u201cMSIC\u201d) misrepresented the scope and nature of its insurance coverage, committing fraud against its insured, John Cook. In doing so, the jury awarded Mr. Cook $550,000 in compensatory damages and $550,000 in punitive damages. After trial, MSIC moved for judgment as a matter of law and a new trial or remittitur. The district court denied each of these motions and MSIC appealed. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, as we must, they indicate that, based on a referral from his accountant, Mr. Cook spoke with Troy Russell, an authorized insurance agent for MSIC, in the fall of 2008 about purchasing an MSIC health insurance policy. According to Mr. Cook, Mr. Russell represented that an MSIC policy would have a $5,000 deductible, which could be funded using a tax-advantaged health savings account, and that MSIC would pay 100 percent of medical expenses above the deductible amount, up to $1,000,000. Mr. Russell echoed and clarified this point, testifying at trial that he represented the policy would cover 100 percent of \u201creasonable and customary charges\u201d above the deductible amount, up to $1,000,000. The insurance policy itself (which Mr. Cook received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>but apparently did not read) confirmed this coverage and defined \u201creasonable and customary charge\u201d as the most common charge for particular services or supplies\u2014 defined as an amount equal or in excess of that charged by two-thirds of the providers in the area \u2014 so long as those charges could be considered reasonable. The policy then listed seven factors MSIC was permitted to consider in determining the reasonableness of a charge, including the skill and time required to perform the procedure, the severity of the condition being treated, the amount charged for similar services or supplies in the locality and in other parts of the country, and the cost to the provider, among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Unknown to Mr. Cook and undisclosed in the MSIC policy, MSIC actually enforced a different rule. Starting in 2001, MSIC decided that, for hospital bills over $8,000, it would pay only the reimbursement rate paid by Medicare for the procedure in question plus 26 percent \u2014 and would do so even though MSIC usually had no guarantee hospitals would accept that amount as payment in full. As a result, MSIC paid an average of only 30 to 40 percent of billed charges. MSIC did not publicly disclose its internal Medicare plus 26 percent reimbursement rule until December 2003, about two months after Mr. Cook purchased the policy, and then did so only in response to prodding from the Oklahoma Department of Insurance, which had received complaints about MSIC and forced MSIC to remove the \u201creasonable and customary charge\u201d language from its policy. Even then, however, in its disclosure letter to its policyholders, MSIC indicated that it would pay Medicare plus 26 percent only for claims incurred before January 1, 2004, and that claims incurred after that date would be paid in accordance with a new set of procedures outlined in an enclosed endorsement. The endorsement replaced the \u201creasonable and customary charge\u201d language of the MSIC policy sold to Mr. Cook with a new term \u2014 \u201creimbursable charge\u201d \u2014 but then proceeded to define that term in much the same way as \u201creasonable and customary charge,\u201d albeit with some modifications. The new definition explained that reimbursable charges could be less than the fees actually charged and that any excess would be the policyholder\u2019s responsibility. It also added two new factors to the list that MSIC could consider when determining whether a charge was reimbursable: billed charges and \u201cMedicare diagnostic or procedure codes, and reimbursement rates, with appropriate markups to reflect national average payment or reimbursement rates.\u201d Aplt. App. at 83. Mr. Cook testified he never saw the December 2003 letter and endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In August 2004, Mr. Cook was diagnosed with prostate cancer, for which he underwent surgery in September. He incurred a bill of $19,531.45 for the surgery, but MSIC agreed to pay only $6,970.50. That number represented the applicable Medicare charge plus 26 percent, with a 25 percent penalty deduction because Mr. Cook did not \u201cpre-certify\u201d the surgery with MSIC. According to evidence at trial, even though services were incurred in 2004 and thus purportedly subject to MSIC\u2019s new \u201creimbursable charge\u201d endorsement formula, MSIC did not consider the most common charge for the services billed to Mr. Cook or any other factors listed in its reimbursable charge endorsement; instead, it simply applied its longstanding Medicare plus 26 percent rule. When MSIC sent the hospital a check for $6,970.50 as payment in full, the hospital rejected the payment and billed Mr. Cook for the full amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">MSIC informed Mr. Cook that, if he chose to dispute his bill with the hospital, MSIC would pay his attorneys fees. In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>stead, Mr. Cook brought this suit against MSIC. He alleged that MSIC committed fraud when it sold him the insurance policy and breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to pay his hospital bill; he sought both compensatory and punitive damages. The district court denied summary judgment for MSIC and partial summary judgment for Mr. Cook and the case proceeded to trial, where a jury found in favor of MSIC on the good faith claim and in favor of Mr. Cook on the fraud claim, ultimately awarding Mr. Cook $550,000 in compensatory damages and $550,000 in punitive damages. The district court denied MSIC\u2019s various post-trial motions and MSIC timely appealed. We address first MSIC\u2019s arguments with respect to liability and then its contentions on damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">MSIC argues that, notwithstanding the jury\u2019s verdict, the evidence presented by Mr. Cook was insufficient to prove it committed fraud as a matter of law. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. See Williams v. W.D. Sports, N.M., Inc., </em>497 F.3d 1079, 1086 (10th Cir.2007). In doing so we will \u201cnot weigh the evidence, pass on the credibility of the witnesses, or substitute our conclusions for those of the jury,\u201d but will instead \u201cview the evidence and any inferences to be drawn therefrom most favorably to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). We may enter judgment as a matter of law \u201conly if the evidence points but one way and is susceptible to no reasonable inference supporting the party opposing the motion,\u201d such that \u201cthere is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis with respect to a claim or defense under the controlling law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Before us, MSIC does not object to the district court\u2019s legal instructions to the jury, but instead confines itself to arguing that Mr. Cook\u2019s proof failed as a matter of law to establish intentional or reckless conduct by MSIC, justifiable reliance by Mr. Cook, or any injury to him. We consider each of MSIC\u2019s liability arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">1. MSIC argues that Mr. Cook failed to prove the requisite <em>mens rea </em>for fraud as a matter of law because he did not present evidence that Mr. Russell, MSIC\u2019s insurance agent, intentionally or recklessly misrepresented the policy to Mr. Cook. This contention, however, simply misconceives the nature of Mr. Cook\u2019s suit. Mr. Cook did not sue Mr. Russell or allege that Mr. Russell intentionally misled him. Rather, his theory at trial was that, while Mr. Russell may have been \u201chonorable,\u201d as Mr. Cook himself testified, MSIC withheld full information about the company\u2019s policies from its own sales agents. Aplt. App. at 406. That is, in Mr. Cook\u2019s theory of the case, MSIC misled even Mr. Russell, by failing to disclose to him its true Medicare plus 26 rule for reimbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">MSIC offers no reason why the jury could not have found that this is exactly what occurred. Indeed, Mr. Russell and another MSIC agent testified that they had believed the \u201c100 percent of reasonable and customary\u201d provision in MSIC\u2019s policies meant that MSIC would generally base its reimbursement decision on what health care providers in the area were charging. <em>See </em>Aplt. App. at 440-441; Aple. App. at 362. A reasonable jury could conclude that neither knew MSIC was, instead, simply enforcing a Medicare plus 26 percent rule. <em>See </em>Aple. App. at 361; Aplt. App. at 439-42. In fact, when the other agent discovered the Medicare plus 26 percent formula after MSIC reduced payment on a client\u2019s bill, he was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>surprised and troubled that he took the \u201cunusual\u201d step of notifying his other clients and advising them to change insurers. Aple. App. at 368, 361-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">2. Next, MSIC argues that Mr. Cook did not demonstrate that he reasonably relied on MSIC\u2019s misrepresentation. This argument has two prongs: Did Mr. Cook present evidence of actual reliance? And was his reliance reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">On the first of these questions, MSIC argues that Mr. Cook did not actually rely on Mr. Russell\u2019s representations about its reimbursement policy by pointing to testimony indicating that Mr. Cook sought insurance advice from his accountant and that he did not find Mr. Russell to be a very strong salesman. But the record is replete with evidence from Mr. Cook that, although he consulted his accountant, he did in fact rely on Mr. Russell\u2019s representations about the policy\u2019s terms in deciding to purchase it and would not have purchased the MSIC policy had he known the truth. <em>See </em>Aplt. App. at 372-77, 363-64. The jury was free to credit this testimony and find it sufficient to establish actual reliance. <em>See Tice v. Tice, </em>672 P.2d 1168, 1171 (Okla.1983) (\u201cThe fraudulent representation need not be the sole inducement which causes a party to take the action from which the injury ensued. The key is that without the representation the party would not have acted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Second, MSIC argues that no reasonable person could rely on a salesman\u2019s statement that a health insurance policy pays for \u201ceverything\u201d above a $5,000 deductible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As it happens, however, although Mr. Cook testified that he was led to believe MSIC\u2019s policy would cover 100 percent of his medical expenses above the deductible up to $1,000,000, he never disputed that the MSIC policy contained certain exclusions and limitations defining what expenses were covered. Further, Mr. Russell testified that he told Mr. Cook not that the policy would pay for \u201ceverything,\u201d but that it would cover \u201creasonable and customary\u201d charges. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, as we are obliged to do, the jury was free to infer from this evidence that Mr. Russell sold the policy on the basis that it would cover reasonable and customary charges up to $1,000,000 \u2014 not that it would cover \u201ceverything\u201d \u2014 and that this was the representation on which Mr. Cook relied. MSIC does not argue that reasonable reliance on such a representation is impossible \u2014 nor could it, as its own policy solicited business on the basis of just such a promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Alternatively, MSIC argues that Mr. Cook could not have reasonably relied solely on Mr. Russell\u2019s oral representations when he was given a written policy to review. We need not address whether Oklahoma requires an insured to read his or her policy in order to discover the insurer\u2019s misrepresentations, however, because Mr. Cook could not have ascertained the truth by doing so. <em>See Silver v. Slusher, </em>770 P.2d 878, 882 n. 8 (Okla.1988) (\u201cAn action for fraud may not be predicated on false statements when the allegedly defrauded party <em>could have ascertained the truth </em>with reasonable diligence.\u201d (emphasis added)). The policy Mr. Cook received specified that MSIC would pay all \u201creasonable and customary charges,\u201d defined as the most common charge for particular services or supplies as determined by calculating what two-thirds of the providers in the area are charging for the same service or supplies, limited by reasonableness. The list of factors MSIC could consider in determining whether a charge was reasonable did not include the Medicare plus 26 percent formula or any other indication that MSIC would only pay according to such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Finally, MSIC argues that Mr. Cook\u2019s reliance on its misrepresentation was no longer reasonable after MSIC sent him the December letter and policy endorsement. On appeal, MSIC does not contest the district court\u2019s conclusion that the endorsement failed to constitute a valid amendment of the policy under Oklahoma insurance law; instead, even assuming the endorsement did not comply with Oklahoma insurance law requirements, MSIC asserts that it put Mr. Cook on notice of the true coverage of the policy and the falsity of the previous misrepresentation, making any further reliance on that misrepresentation unreasonable for purposes of a common law fraud claim. Even assuming without deciding that a legally inoperative endorsement can operate as a disclosure precluding claims of fraud, the December correspondence, as with the original policy, simply failed to indicate the truth about how MSIC would reimburse Mr. Cook\u2019s medical expenses; accordingly, it did not render his reliance on MSIC\u2019s previous misrepresentations unreasonable. <em>See Silver, </em>770 P.2d at 882 n. 8 (\u201cAn action for fraud may not be predicated on false statements when the allegedly defrauded party <em>could have ascertained the truth </em>with reasonable diligence.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The December letter stated that MSIC would pay Medicare plus 26 percent on claims incurred <em>prior </em>to January 1, 2004 and would pay according to the endorsement for claims, like Mr. Cook\u2019s, arising after that date. The endorsement purported to change \u201creasonable and customary charge\u201d to \u201creimbursable charge,\u201d but left the definition largely the same, still defining it as the most common charge for particular services or supplies as determined by calculating what two-thirds of the providers in the area are charging for the same service or supplies, limited by reasonableness. To be sure, the endorsement added to the existing list of reasonableness factors \u201cMedicare diagnostic or procedure codes, and reimbursement rates, with appropriate markups to reflect national average payment or reimbursement rates,\u201d and billed charges if \u201cless than a reasonable charge.\u201d Aplt. App. at 83. But nowhere did the endorsement suggest that MSIC \u2014 contrary to the endorsement \u2014 would not even consider what the most common charge for a particular procedure was but instead would automatically reduce payment on medical bills accruing even after January 1, 2004 to Medicare plus 26 percent, ultimately paying only 30 to 40 percent of billed charges. Based on this, a reasonable jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>conclude that Mr. Cook could not reasonably ascertain the truth about MSIC\u2019s coverage from the December correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">8. Lastly, MSIC asserts that, because it agreed to pay his hospital bill in full after he sued, Mr. Cook lacked evidence of economic damages and, thus, any injury cognizable in an Oklahoma common law fraud claim. This argument has at least two defects. First, Mr. Cook did testify to economic damages, including the fact that he personally paid $1,400 for an MRI because the hospital would not honor his MSIC insurance card and that he was improperly charged over $2,000 for a precertification penalty. Second, although MSIC is correct that damages for non-economic injuries such as mere embarrassment usually are not available in fraud under Oklahoma law, damages for mental and emotional distress are. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 76 \u00a7 2; <em>Mashunkashey v. Mashunkashey, </em>189 Okla. 60, 113 P.2d 190, 191 (1941); <em>Coble v. Bowers, </em>809 P.2d 69, 73 (Okla.Civ.App.1990). And, in testimony MSIC does not now challenge as improperly received by the district court, Mr. Cook spoke at length about the mental and emotional distress he and his wife suffered as a result of MSIC\u2019s fraud and their discovery that Mr. Cook did not have adequate health insurance during his struggle with cancer. On this unchallenged record, the jury was free to find that Mr. Cook\u2019s injury rose above the level of mere embarrassment and is thus compensable in fraud under Oklahoma law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">MSIC challenges the jury\u2019s damages award to Mr. Cook on three grounds, asserting that the punitive damages award is inappropriate as a matter of law, that the punitive damage jury instruction was unconstitutional, and that the compensatory and punitive damages are excessive and should be remitted. We evaluate the first two legal contentions <em>de novo </em>and the final, discretionary, argument under a more deferential standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b684-11\">MSIC\u2019s argument that the jury\u2019s punitive damages award fails as a matter of law itself has two different components. First, MSIC claims that it cannot be liable in punitive damages for the misrepresentations of its soliciting agent because the company did not know of or ratify the agent\u2019s actions. But MSIC admits that Mr. Russell was one of its soliciting agents and does not dispute that he was acting within the scope of his employment as an insurance salesman when he made the mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>representations to Mr. Cook regarding the MSIC policy. Under settled Oklahoma law, this is sufficient to expose MSIC to liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">Oklahoma does not impose the ratification requirement of Section 909 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts; thus it would be possible for the jury to have imposed punitive damages against [the defendant company] even without finding that it participated in or authorized the negligent acts of its employees. <em>See Kurn v. Radencic, </em>193 Okla. 126, 141 P.2d 580, 581 (1943) (\u201cIn this jurisdiction [exemplary damages] may be awarded against a principal or employer for the act of an agent or employee even though the principal did not personally participate in, authorize or ratify the act complained of.\u201d). <em>See also Rodebush v. Okla. Nursing Homes, Ltd., </em>867 P.2d 1241, 1245-46 (Okla.1993) (holding nursing home liable for the intentional tort of its employee); <em>Moore v. Target Stores, Inc., </em>571 P.2d 1236, 1240-41 (Okla.Civ. App.1977) (\u201cExemplary damages may be awarded against Target for the act of his [sic] agent even though the principal did not personally participate in or ratify the act.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-6\"><em>Magnum Foods, Inc. v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>36 F.3d 1491, 1498 n. 5 (10th Cir.1994). Oklahoma has consistently applied the doctrine of respondeat superior for purposes of punitive damages, and as recently as 1999 the Oklahoma Supreme Court confirmed that \u201c[p]unitive damages may be assessed against a principal or employer for the acts of its agents or employees if the agent or employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment.\u201d <em>Sides v. John Cordes, Inc., </em>981 P.2d 301, 306 n. 16 (Okla. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Second, MSIC argues that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support an award of punitive damages because its conduct \u201cdoes not demonstrate the elements of fraud or evil intent to which punitive damages are directed.\u201d Opening Br. at 45. But Oklahoma law specifically authorizes punitive damages when a defendant is guilty of fraud or of \u201creckless disregard for the rights of others.\u201d Okla. Stat. tit. 23 \u00a7 9.1(B)(1); <em>see Sides, </em>981 P.2d at 306. And, as we have already amply outlined, sufficient evidence existed from which the jury could conclude that MSIC intentionally or recklessly misrepresented its insurance coverage to induce Mr. Cook to purchase MSIC insurance, resulting in injury to Mr. Cook. <em>See supra </em>Part II.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">By way of a post-briefing Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) letter, MSIC argues that the punitive damage award in this case was unconstitutional under <em>Philip Morris USA v. Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1057, 166 L.Ed.2d 940 (2007), because the jury should have been instructed that it could not punish MSIC for injury to persons other than Mr. Cook. MSIC admits that it did not object to the jury instructions on this basis in the district court or request an instruction to this effect; neither did MSIC raise such an argument in either its opening or reply briefs on appeal. Yet, it could have done all this. The question whether such an instruction is necessary was hotly contested in other cases at the time of this trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>preme Court granted certiorari in the <em>Williams </em>case on May 30, 2006, before the district court\u2019s June 12, 2006, 2006 WL 1663783 and 2006 WL 1663784, ruling on MSIC\u2019s motion for remittitur or a new trial, and before any appellate briefing took place. The Court decided <em>Williams </em>on February 20, 2007, two days before MSIC\u2019s reply brief on appeal was due, yet even then MSIC waited nearly three additional weeks after appellate briefing in this matter was closed before first mentioning <em>Williams </em>in a March 12, 2007 Rule 28(j) letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">To be sure, we recognize that in some circumstances an appellate court may allow a party to raise an issue out of time because of an intervening change in the law. <em>See Employers Reins. Corp. v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>358 F.3d 757, 776 (10th Cir.2004). But the intervening law exception does not give litigants a second chance to raise new arguments whenever any supporting decision is handed down. Rather, our precedent indicates only that, if the intervening decision overrules or is contrary to previously controlling circuit precedent or is otherwise a material change in the law such that objecting or raising the argument earlier would have been futile, a party will be allowed to raise an argument under the new decision on appeal despite failing to preserve the issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If, however, the intervening decision simply resolves an open legal question, continues the current direction of the law, or provides further support for an argument, or if the issue was one which the litigant should have been aware of earlier, we generally require the party to have preserved the issue in the district court proceedings and its first brief on appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The latter circumstance pertains here. <em>Williams </em>did not overrule or contradict controlling Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit precedent, and an argument about the punitive damages instruction would not have been otherwise futile. In fact, the <em>Williams </em>decision was foreshadowed by <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Campbell, </em>538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed.2d 585 (2003), decided four years earlier, where the Court held that \u201c[d]ue process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the merits of other parties\u2019 hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 423, 123 S.Ct. 1513. The Court reversed the punitive damages award because it did not believe the defendant \u201cwas only punished for its actions toward the [plaintiffs],\u201d but rather was punished for \u201cconduct that bore no relation to the [plaintiffs\u2019] harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 422, 423, 123 S.Ct. 1513. Thus, as early as April 2003, defendants were on notice that jury instructions permitting direct punishment for harm to non-parties or unrelated to the plaintiff may be objectionable. Notably, the extent and import of <em>State Farm\u2019s </em>lessons were debated roundly in the federal courts after 2003,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and many courts soon came to read <em>State Farm </em>to mean what <em>Williams </em>ultimately confirmed it did mean.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Further, Mr. Cook would likely be prejudiced by our consideration of the new issue at this stage. Because MSIC did not interpose an appropriate and timely objection to the district court\u2019s instructions on punitive damages, Mr. Cook had no opportunity to establish a record or suggest alternative jury instructions; and because MSIC did not raise the argument in its appellate briefs, Mr. Cook\u2019s only written response to MSIC\u2019s argument was by rule limited to filing his own Rule 28(j) letter. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(j) (limiting supplemental letter to 350 words). This defect\u2014 that both parties\u2019 arguments on a novel and complex issue are confined to the parameters of the Rule 28(j) letter \u2014 would also impair our consideration of the issue in this case and \u201crun the risk of an improvident or ill-advised opinion, given our dependence as an Article-Ill court on the adversarial process for sharpening the issues of decision.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Headrick v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>24 F.3d 1272, 1278 (10th Cir. 1994) (White, J., sitting by designation) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">In contrast to our <em>de novo </em>review of MSIC\u2019s legal arguments challenging the jury\u2019s punitive award, we review the district court\u2019s denial of MSIC\u2019s motion for remittitur or a new trial due to excessive damages under a highly deferential standard, reversing only if we can discern a \u201cmanifest abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Vining v. Enter. Fin. Group, Inc., </em>148 F.3d 1206, 1216 (10th Cir.1998). Thus, the jury\u2019s award is inviolate unless we find it \u201cso excessive that it shocks the judicial conscience and raises an irresistible inference that passion, prejudice, corruption, or other improper cause invaded the trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">MSIC argues that the jury\u2019s award of $550,000 in compensatory damages, pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>marily for mental and emotional distress, is excessive. Our case law, however, supports Mr. Cook\u2019s contention that this is not necessarily so. For example, in <em>Vining, </em>which similarly involved an insurance denial of approximately $10,000, we upheld a $400,000 damages award for mental suffering as not excessive \u2014 and did so a decade ago. <em>Id. </em>at 1216-17; <em>see </em>Consumer Price Index, www.bls.gov/CPI (calculating $400,000 in 1998 equal to $531,612.27 in 2008). There, the deceased had purchased a credit life insurance policy to cover his car payments in the event of his death; upon his death, his widow sought to collect the $10,000 policy but the insurance company denied payment in bad faith. We concluded that Mrs. Vining did not need to show \u201csevere mental distress or outrageous conduct,\u201d and that her testimony regarding \u201cthe distress she experienced as a result of ... fighting the insurance company over the claim\u201d was sufficient to support the $400,000 award for emotional distress. <em>Id. </em>at 1217. <em>See also Malandris v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., </em>703 F.2d 1152, 1167-71 (10th Cir. 1983) (upholding $1,030,000 award for emotional distress where financial loss was only $30,000, on fraud and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims); <em>Chandler v. Denton, </em>741 P.2d 855, 867-68 (Okla.1987) (holding $600,000 award for intentional infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy not excessive).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Here, as in <em>Vining, </em>the plaintiffs distress resulted from an insurance company\u2019s refusal to pay benefits in the amount the plaintiff reasonably believed would be paid, and Mr. Cook\u2019s situation could be argued to be more egregious because Mrs. Vining\u2019s liability was limited to $10,000, while at the time Mr. Cook learned of MSIC\u2019s fraud and his lack of insurance coverage, he faced an unknown and potentially escalating series of bills related to cancer treatment. Indeed, the jury heard testimony, to which MSIC does not now object, from Mr. Cook about the distress and worry he and his wife suffered upon learning they did not have adequate health insurance, facing unknown costs for cancer treatment (knowing Mr. Cook could not obtain other coverage because of his condition), and simultaneously dealing with the hospital\u2019s collection efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">While failing to distinguish adequately <em>Vining </em>or other authority supporting the jury\u2019s award, MSIC calls to our attention and asks us to rely on <em>Fitzgerald v. Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Co., </em>68 F.3d 1257 (10th Cir.1995) and <em>Wulf v. City of Wichita, </em>883 F.2d 842 (10th Cir.1989). But neither case suggests remittitur would be appropriate here. In <em>Fitzgerald, </em>the jury awarded the plaintiff $250,000 for emotional distress resulting from the defendant\u2019s refusal to contract with the plaintiff for allegedly discriminatory reasons, and we remanded for a new trial because the evidence suggested the award was the product of passion and prejudice. 68 F.3d at 1265-66. MSIC does not point to anything that would suggest the jury in this case was carried away by passion or some other improper motivation \u2014 if anything, the record suggests just the opposite conclusion, given that the jury found in MSIC\u2019s favor on Mr. Cook\u2019s bad faith claim. <em>See </em>Verdict Form, Aplt. App. at 262. In <em>Wulf </em>the jury awarded the plaintiff $250,000 for stress and frustration related to being fired in retaliation for exercising his First Amendment rights, and we remanded for reconsideration of the damages based on comparison to other cases from the previous four years in which the plaintiffs were awarded significantly less (none of the awards approached even half of the <em>Wulf </em>plaintiffs award) for similar discharges in violation of the First Amendment. 883 F.2d at 875. Here, by contrast, MSIC has not presented us with any factually similar cases to demonstrate that circumstances such as Mr. Cook\u2019s are not compensated by awards this size. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>cordingly, we cannot say that the jury\u2019s award in this case is so extreme as to \u201cshock the conscience.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">H*</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b679-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-6\">. MSIC raised the legal reasonableness of Mr. Cook\u2019s reliance in its motion for summary judgment before trial but did not renew the argument in its post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. When \"the denial of summary judgment is based on the interpretation of a purely legal question, such a decision is appealable after final judgment\u201d at trial, despite a party's failure to renew its argument. <em>Wolfgang v. Mid-Am. Motorsports, Inc., </em>Ill F.3d 1515, 1521 (10th Cir.1997). The district court denied summary judgment on this issue on a purely legal basis, so we may review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Although MSIC argues on appeal that Mr. Cook\u2019s reliance must be \"justifiable,\u201d we conclude his reliance passes the arguably higher standard of \u201creasonableness,\u201d as required by Oklahoma law. See <em>Felix v. Lucent Techs., Inc., </em>387 F.3d 1146, 1164-65 (10th Cir.2004) (\u201cOklahoma law requires ... 'reasonable reliance' on misrepresentations, and ... \u2018an action for fraud may not be predicated on false statements when the allegedly defrauded party could have ascertained the truth with reasonable diligence.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Silver v. Slusher, </em>770 P.2d 878, 882 n. 8 (Okla.1988)); <em>Eckert v. Flair Agency, Inc., </em>909 P.2d 1201, 1206 (Okla.Civ.App.1995); <em>see also Field v. Mans, </em>516 U.S. 59, 70-72, 116 S.Ct. 437, 133 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (comparing justifiable and reasonable reliance).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-5\">. MSIC also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the jury\u2019s verdict in MSIC\u2019s favor on the bad faith claim contradicts its verdict in Mr. Cook\u2019s favor on the fraud claim and forecloses the possibility of recovery for fraud. As a general rule, we will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal, and MSIC offers us no reason to vary from the rule in this instance. <em>See Singleton v. Wulff, </em>428 U.S. 106, 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976); <em>Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., </em>928 F.2d 966, 970 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Separately, we note that MSIC purports to seek a new trial on the issue of liability as well but does not actually provide any discussion of this point as such in its briefs. Under our case law, \"[ajrguments inadequately briefed in the opening brief are waived,\u201d <em>Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>144 F.3d 664, 679 (10th Cir.1998), and, in any event, based on the arguments MSIC adduces for judgment as a matter of law we see nothing that would merit a new trial on liability because the jury\u2019s verdict, if not the only possible outcome here, was not against the great weight of the evidence. <em>See Escue v. N. Okla. Coll., </em>450 F.3d 1146, 1157 (10th Cir.2006) (\"The jury's verdict ... must be upheld unless it is clearly, decidedly or overwhelmingly against the weight of the evidence.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\">. <em>Compare, e.g., Univ.

MSIC also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the punitive damages award is unconstitutionally excessive according to the factors of <em>BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, </em>517 U.S. 559, 116 S.Ct. 1589, 134 L.Ed.2d 809 (1996). We may not consider this issue, however, because, again, MSIC did not raise it in the district court and offers no reason for us to stray from our general rule against considering issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Singleton, </em>428 U.S. at 120, 96 S.Ct. 2868; <em>Hicks, </em>928 F.2d at 970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b689-17\">. In the district court, MSIC argued that evidence of Mr. Cook's annual income was relevant to damages because a person with his income would not experience much mental anguish over a $10,000 insurance dispute. The district court excluded evidence of Mr. Cook\u2019s income, reasoning that Mr. Cook did not seek lost earnings or contend he could not pay his hospital bill, his income had little relevance to his mental pain and suffering, and any probative value was substantially outweighed by the prejudice the admission of such evidence would cause to Mr. Cook. MSIC now asserts this ruling was erroneous because Mr. Cook\u2019s annual income was relevant not only to damages but also to demonstrate his sophistication in the insurance industry and counter his reliance on the agent\u2019s representations. As it happens, however, the jury had before it ample evidence of Mr. Cook's profession, success, and ability to pay, and MSIC has not presented us with any authority suggesting that the dollar amount of a plaintiff's income is relevant to mental suffering. We therefore conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-26\">Concerning the punitive damages award, MSIC also renews the only argument it made for remittitur in the district court: that according to Oklahoma law, if we were to reduce compensatory damages, we must reduce punitive damages as well. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 23 \u00a7 9.1 (B)(2) (punitive damages may not exceed the greater of $100,000 or amount of compensatory damages). Because we have affirmed the compensatory damage award, this argument also fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
