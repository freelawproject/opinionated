Respondent Secretary of Health and Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d) moved to dismiss their case on the grounds that their claim is barred by the statute of limitations contained in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-16(a)(2). The special master assigned to petitioners\u2019 case granted respondent\u2019s motion and the United States Court of Federal Claims affirmed. <em>Mojica v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>79 Fed.Cl. 633 (2007). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The relevant statute of limitations provides that no petition for compensation may be filed \u201cafter the expiration of 36 months after the date of the occurrence of the first symptom of onset or of the significant aggravation of such injury.\u201d The Vaccine Act stipulates that \u201c[a] proceeding for compensation ... shall be initiated by service upon the Secretary and the filing of a petition ... with the United States Court of Federal Claims.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-ll(a)(l) (2000). We have held that the statute of limitations is not subject to equitable tolling. <em>Brice v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>240 F.3d 1367, 1374 (Fed.Cir.2001). In other words, if a petition for relief is filed outside the mandatory time period, the petition must be dismissed, even though equitable reasons exist to excuse the delay in filing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In this case, it is undisputed that the petitioners filed their petition for relief with the Court of Federal Claims outside the 36 months allowed for filing by the statute of limitations. Because of this fact, the special master dismissed the petition as \u201cduty bound to apply the law, despite the harsh-untenable, really-result.\u201d <em>Acevedo v. Sec\u2019y of Health and Human Servs., </em>No. 07-501V, 2007 WL 2706159, at *5 (Fed.Cl.Spec.Mstr. Aug. 31, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">On petitioners\u2019 motion for review in the Court of Federal Claims, the court stated that it \u201cis obliged to treat <em>Brice </em>as correctly stating the law, such that there is no possibility of equitable tolling under the Vaccine Act even in the circumstances presented by this case where counsel took reasonable steps to fulfill her obligation to file in time. This result is draconian but compelled by law.\u201d <em>Mojica, </em>79 Fed.Cl. at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">As is the case with the special master and the Court of Federal Claims, this panel is obligated to follow the law of the circuit as expressed in <em>Brice. </em>Until overturned by the Supreme Court or an en banc decision of this court, <em>Brice </em>is good law. <em>Texas American Oil Co. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>44 F.3d 1557, 1561 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc) (\u201cThis court applies the rule that earlier decisions prevail unless overruled by the court en banc, or by other controlling authority such as intervening statutory change or Supreme Court decision.\u201d). Because it is not disputed that the petition for relief under the Vaccine Act in this case was filed outside the time provided by the statute of limitations, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
