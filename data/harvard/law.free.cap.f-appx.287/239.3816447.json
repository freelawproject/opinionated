Gorou abandoned her challenge to the denial of her asylum application. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-19\">The Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d) requires the Attorney General to withhold removal of an alien if the Attorney General determines \u201cthat the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (2000). To establish eligibility for withholding of removal, an alien must show a clear probability that, if she was removed to her native country, her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d on a protected ground. <em>Id.; see Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 370 (4th Cir. 2004). \u201cThe burden of proof is on the applicant for withholding of removal ... to establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal\u201d on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b) (2008). A determination regarding eligibility for withholding of removal is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to decide to the contrary. 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (West 2005). This court will reverse the Board only if \u201cthe evidence ... presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812; <em>see Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-20\">We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Gorou failed to address the credibility problem with respect to the date and manner in which she arrived in the United States raised by her party membership card. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>showing that she arrived earlier than what her testimony suggested calls into question the remainder of her testimony and letters written in support of her application. The record does not compel a different result. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s denial of her application for withholding from removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">We also find because of the adverse credibility finding and Gorou\u2019 s lack of objective evidence supporting her claim that it is more likely than not she will be tortured, the Board did not err in denying her relief under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
