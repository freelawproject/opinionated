Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review \u201cwhether substantial evidence supports a finding by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that [Khan] abandoned [her] lawful permanent residence in the United States.\u201d <em>Khodagholian v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.2003). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that the government met its burden of showing Khan abandoned her lawful permanent resident status, because the record does not compel the conclusion that she consistently intended to return to the United States promptly. <em>See Singh v. Reno, </em>113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that \u201c[t]he relevant intent is not the intent to return ultimately, but the intent to return to the United States within a relatively short period\u201d and adding that an alien \u201cmay extend his trip beyond that relatively short period only if he intends to return to the United States as soon as possible thereafter\u201d); <em>see also Chavez-Ramirez v. INS, </em>792 F.2d 932, 937 (9th Cir.1986) (alien\u2019s trip abroad is temporary only if he has a \u201ccontinuous, uninterrupted intention to return to the United States during the entirety of his visit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-18\">We lack jurisdiction to review Khan\u2019s contention that the IJ was biased because she failed to raise it before the BIA. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (due process challenges that are \u201cprocedural in nature\u201d must be exhausted).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
