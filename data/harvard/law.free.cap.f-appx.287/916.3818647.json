He argues that the convictions were based on insufficient evidence, and that the anonymous jury that convicted him was tainted after two jurors recognized people they knew in the courtroom, expressed their fears to the rest of the jury, and were removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">\u201cA defendant challenging the sufficiency of trial evidence bears a heavy burden, and the reviewing court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Gagliardi, </em>506 F.3d 140, 149 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Giovanelli, </em>464 F.3d 346, 349 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 206, 169 L.Ed.2d 145 (2007)). Thus a jury verdict must be affirmed unless \u201cno rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Gagliardi, </em>506 F.3d. at 149-50 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">McGriff cannot meet this high burden. Multiple witnesses testified about their roles in McGriffs drug distribution trade, and their testimony was sufficient for a rational juror to conclude that the government had proven the existence of the \u201cMcGriff Enterprise.\u201d It is a closer question whether the murders of Eric Smith and Troy Singleton were horizontally and vertically related to that enterprise, as required to show a pattern of racketeering activity. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Daidone, </em>471 F.3d 371, 376 (2d Cir.2006). But the record contains direct and sufficient testimony that McGriff ordered the murders not simply for revenge or personal selfaggrandizement, but to re-establish and maintain the reputation of his enterprise after Smith and Singleton disrespected him. That reputation, in turn, was important to the strength of the enterprise \u2014 indeed, McGriff was able to obtain drugs on credit based on the strength of his reputation. The direct testimony of those involved in McGriffs enterprise was therefore sufficient to link the murders to the goals of the enterprise itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">McGriffs next argument is that the District Court failed to conduct a sufficient <em>voir dire </em>of the jurors following revelations that two of them had recognized people in the courtroom and were frightened. McGriff argues that this fear tainted the jury, and that a mistrial should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>declared. \u201c[A] trial judge\u2019s handling of alleged juror misconduct or bias is only reviewable for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Bufalino, </em>576 F.2d 446, 451-52 (2d Cir.1978) (internal quotation mark omitted); <em>see also United States v. Abrams, </em>137 F.3d 704, 708 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Gaggi, </em>811 F.2d 47, 51 (2d Cir.1987). The District Court did not abuse that discretion here. After Juror 12 expressed fear \u2014 both to the court and to her fellow jurors \u2014 upon seeing an old acquaintance in the courtroom, the District Court conducted an individual <em>voir dire </em>of each juror. All except for Juror 6 \u2014 who also said he recognized someone in the courtroom and was frightened \u2014 said that they were essentially unaffected and still willing and able to deliberate fairly and impartially. The jurors\u2019 self-assessments in this regard were consistent with the District Court\u2019s observation that \u201c[tjhese folks have been pretty consistently calm. Nobody has shown any emotional reaction here, from my observations.\u201d In these circumstances, the District Court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Jurors 6 and 12 and ordering the remainder of the jury to return to deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Finally, McGriff challenges the constitutionality of the federal murder-for-hire statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1958, which he says violates the Commerce Clause. This claim must fail because McGriff planned and coordinated the murders of Smith and Singleton using a two-way pager, which is itself a \u201cfacility of interstate commerce\u201d that falls within the Commerce Clause power described by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 558, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995) (identifying \u201cinstrumentalities of interstate commerce\u201d as one of the \u201cthree broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power\u201d). Under our caselaw, a showing that a regulated activity substantially affects interstate commerce is unnecessary when Congress regulates activity involving an instrumentality or facility of interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Gil, </em>297 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir.2002); <em>see also United States v. Perez, </em>414 F.3d 302, 305 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\u201c[E]ven though Perez\u2019s calls to Casiano were wholly intrastate communications, the fact that they were made using the SNET network, a facility involved in interstate commerce, leads us to conclude that Perez was properly subject to prosecution for using interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
