Hunt, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>a certificate of appealability on the question of whether the district court erred by treating his Rule 60(b) motion as an impermissibly successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. The government concedes that the district court improperly treated Hunt\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion as an unauthorized \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions on the jurisdiction of the district court, including whether a Rule 60(b) motion is a second or successive habeas petition. <em>Zakrzewski v. McDonough, </em>490 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-17\">A Rule 60(b) motion provides a \u201climited basis\u201d for a party to seek relief from a final judgment in a habeas case. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b); <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). A Rule 60(b) motion is not a successive habeas petition \u201cif it does not assert, or reassert, claims of error in the movant\u2019s state conviction.\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 538, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005). Where the Rule 60(b) motion does not attack the \u201csubstance of the federal court\u2019s resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings,\u201d the court should not construe it as a habeas corpus application. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-18\">Hunt\u2019s <em>pro se </em>Rule 60(b) motion sought to remedy defects in his \u00a7 2255 habeas proceeding. Hunt argued that the district court at his initial \u00a7 2255 hearing failed to consider all of the issues he raised in his \u00a7 2255 habeas motion, and he alleged problems with his appointed counsel. Hunt did not argue the merits of his \u00a7 2255 motion in his Rule 60(b) motion. Rather, he argued there were defects in the integrity of the hearing. As Hunt\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion claimed a defect in the process of his prior habeas proceedings, the district court erred in construing it as a successive habeas corpus application. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>545 U.S. at 532, 125 S.Ct. 2641. Without passing judgment on the merits of Hunt\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, we vacate and remand to the district court so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>it can properly address the merits of his motion as a Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
