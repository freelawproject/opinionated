We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo questions of law, <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006), and we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The BIA erred in concluding that Park is ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief under <em>United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839 (9th Cir.2002). Although Park\u2019s conviction was not a deportable offense in 1989, we have held that <em>Velasco-Medina </em>does not apply to applicants convicted pri- or to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. <em>See United States v. Leon-Paz, </em>340 F.3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir.2003) (distinguishing <em>Velasco-Medina </em>because Leon-Paz \u201ccould rely on the fact that he had a source of protection should his crime be declared an aggravated felony in the future\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">We do not consider the government\u2019s contention that Park is nevertheless ineligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief because her conviction followed a plea of not guilty, as this ground was not relied on by the BIA. <em>See Andia v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 1181, 1185 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (declining to consider \u201carguments advanced by the INS which were not relied on by the BIA\u201d). In light of our disposition, we need not address Park\u2019s equal protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
