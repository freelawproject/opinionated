On October 15, 2001, the District Court sentenced Lauersen principally to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment and restitution, as required by statute, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A, in the amount of $3,240,597.00. On February 18, 2005, following a remand for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), the District Court resentenced Lauersen principally to 70 months\u2019 imprisonment. The amount of restitution ordered, which was by statute required to reflect \u201cthe full amount of each victim\u2019s losses,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A), remained at $3,240,597.00. Lauersen now appeals the order of restitution only. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Lauersen contends that the District Court\u2019s \u201corder of restitution violated his Sixth Amendment right to be punished only upon fact-findings made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by him\u201d because the amount of restitution was based solely upon facts found by the District Court by a preponderance of the evidence. Plaintiffs Br. 7. He also challenges the validity of the facts found by the District Court, contending that the record contains \u201cparticular facts casting doubt on the accuracy\u201d of the loss amount on which the District Court based its order of restitution. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">We have determined previously that <em>Booker </em>identifies \u201cno constitutional requirement that the facts needed for [a] district court\u2019s fashioning of a restitution order be found by a jury or found beyond a 2\u2019easonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Reifler, </em>446 F.3d 65, 116 (2d Cir.2006). Lauersen invites us to reconsider this holding in light of <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007). Because <em>Cunningham </em>contains no language suggesting that the \u201cprinciple that jury findings[ ] or admissions by the defendant! ] establish the \u2018maximum\u2019 authorized punishment has [any] application to ... orders of restitution,\u201d <em>Reifler, </em>446 F.3d at 118, we decline to do so. We therefore reject Lauersen\u2019s first argument pursuant to <em>Reifler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s order of restitution generally for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120. \u201cWe will find such an abuse of discretion if the district court applies legal standards incorrectly!,] ... relies upon clearly erroneous findings of fact, or proceeds on the basis of an erroneous view of the applicable law.\u201d <em>Karaha Bodas Co., L.L.C. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan Minyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, </em>500 F.3d 111, 119 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">By statute, the Government bears the \u201cburden of demonstrating!, by a preponderance of the evidence,] the amount of the loss sustained by the victim as a result of the evidence.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664. Under this standard, a district court acts within its discretion in crediting the sentencing facts adduced by the Government as long as the record indicates that these facts \u201care more likely than not true.\u201d <em>United States v. Rizzo, </em>349 F.3d 94, 98 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Lauersen points to several small errors in the Government\u2019s calculation. Review of the record, however, indicates that the District Court took these errors into account when arriving at its findings of the actual and intended loss associated with Lauersen\u2019s offenses of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Having found no error in the District Court\u2019s application of the law, and no clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>error in the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
