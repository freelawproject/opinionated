Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence test. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). \u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, we view the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027. Therefore, the fact that evidence in the record may support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal, rather, reversal is only appropriate where the record \u201ccompels\u201d it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b863-18\">I. Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b863-19\">Moneada argues that the BIA erred when it denied his applications for asylum and withholding of removal on the ground that he had not suffered past persecution. Moneada must show that the evidence \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">\u201cAlthough the INA does not define persecution, we have often repeated that persecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner does not, however, need to have suffered serious physical injury when there are physical threats combined with other forms of mistreatment such as kidnapping or attempted murder. <em>De Santamaria v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 999, 1009 (11th Cir.2008). Moreover, \u201c[i]n determining whether an alien has suffered past persecution, the [BIA] must consider the cumulative effects of the [allegedly persecutory] incidents.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam). Additionally, we \u201cmay consider a threatening act against another as evidence that the petitioner suffered persecution where that act concomitantly threatens the petitioner.\u201d <em>De Santamaria, </em>525 F.3d at 1009 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">We are compelled to conclude that Moneada suffered past persecution in light of the cumulative effect of his encounters with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d). He was repeatedly threatened over the course of more than four years, chased by a vehicle containing armed gunmen who shot at him, and his brother was kidnapped and physically mistreated. Accordingly, we grant the petition as it relates to the BIA\u2019s denial of Moncada\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. Because, however, the BIA did not address whether there was a nexus between the persecution and a protected ground, we remand the case for the BIA to determine whether Moneada is now entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">II. CAT Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Moneada contends that he is entitled to CAT relief because he is subject to being tortured by the FARC, and the Colombian government is unable to control the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">To be entitled to relief under CAT, an applicant must establish that it is \u201cmore likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). The alien must also demonstrate that the feared torture would be by the government or with the government\u2019s acquiescence, i.e., the government is aware of misconduct that it has a duty to prevent and fails to intervene. <em>Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Moneada is not entitled to CAT relief. After the police became aware of Moncada\u2019s trouble with the FARC, it investigated, advised him concerning how to protect his safety, monitored his telephone, and determined the area from which one of the telephone threats against Moneada had originated. Therefore, the Colombian government did not acquiesce in the FARC\u2019s misconduct. Accordingly, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT relief, and we deny the petition as it relates to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
