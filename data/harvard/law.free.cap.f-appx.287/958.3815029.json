Jan. 24, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-17\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. <em>See Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-18\">A motion to reconsider must specify errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s decision and be supported with pertinent authority. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-19\">Lin argues that the BIA erred in relying on the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and Lin\u2019s failure to authenticate the documents he submitted as grounds for rejecting his new evidence and denying his motion. However, this Court has expressly held that the BIA may properly consider an underlying adverse credibility determination in rejecting the au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>thenticity of a document submitted to it in the first instance. <em>See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 146-49 (2d Cir.2007); <em>Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007). <em>Cf. Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 404-05 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that an IJ could not reject a birth certificate solely because it had not been authenticated pursuant to agency regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Lin further argues that the BIA erred in giving police notices submitted by Lin little weight because they were inconsistent with other information in the record. Whether or not the BIA erred in finding this inconsistency, Lin has not demonstrated that he would be subject to the prison terms or fines referred to in the notices or in the other documents submitted. Accordingly, the BIA did not err in its ultimate conclusion that the documents were not material to Lin\u2019s claims. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Lin further argues that the BIA relied excessively on statements in the 2004 Asylum Profile for China indicating that United States officials know of no confirmed case in which a person returned to China from the United States for illegal entry was subject to torture or other abuse. However, while this Court has cautioned against \u201cexcessive reliance\u201d on reports issued by the U.S. Department of State, <em>see Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 130 (2d Cir.2004), it has also found that such official publications are probative of an applicant\u2019s claims, <em>see Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the BIA did not rely exclusively, or even primarily, on the Asylum Profile but rather cited to it to bolster the finding that Lin\u2019s new evidence was insufficient to establish his <em>prima facie </em>eligibility for CAT relief. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 341-42 (finding that the agency properly relied on information contained in State Department country report, particularly in light of the IJ\u2019s finding that the petitioner was not credible).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Moreover, Lin failed to show a clear probability that someone in his particular alleged circumstances would be tortured. <em>See Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>MuXing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 144 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the BIA did not exceed its allowable discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
