On the basis of that finding, the district court applied a four-level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) (Nov.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-21\">\u201cA district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s offense level based on his role as an organizer or leader is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1331 (11th Cir. 2003). The government has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of the aggravating role. <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003). A defendant\u2019s base offense level is increased by four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>levels if \u201cthe defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Factors a court should consider in determining if the leadership/organizer enhancement applies are the: (1) exercise of decision-making authority; (2) nature of participation in the commission of the offense; (3) recruitment of accomplices; (4) claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime; (5) degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense; (6) nature and scope of the illegal activity; and (7) degree of control and authority exercised over others. <em>Rendon, </em>354 F.3d at 1331-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">While \u201c[t]he defendant does not have to be the sole leader or kingpin of the conspiracy in order to be considered an organizer or leader within the meaning of the Guidelines,\u201d <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1169 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted), a defendant\u2019s status as a middleman or distributor is insufficient to support a leadership role enhancement, <em>United States v. Yates, </em>990 F.2d 1179, 1182 (11th Cir.1993). The government must establish that the defendant exercised \u201cauthority in the organization that perpetrates the criminal conduct, the exertion of control, or leadership.\u201d <em>United States v. Alred, </em>144 F.3d 1405, 1422 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Scott does not challenge the finding that there were five or more participants the conspiracy. Instead, he argues that he was an equal participant with his co-conspirators and that he was not a leader or organizer. We disagree. The record shows that Scott: (1) taught two of his co-conspirators how to manufacture methamphetamine; (2) paid the rent for property used as a methamphetamine lab in Canton, Georgia; and (3) recruited accomplices to supply the materials necessary to manufacture methamphetamine. On the basis of those facts, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to find that Scott was a leader or organizer of the methamphetamine conspiracy. The district court therefore did not clearly err in applying a leadership role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Scott next contends that his 300-month prison sentence is unreasonable on the ground that it is effectively a life sentence, given his age and medical condition. We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Under this standard, we review the district court\u2019s sentencing decision only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cThe sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d there are a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-15\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>at 786 (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">There is no dispute that the district court imposed a procedurally reasonable sentence. We conclude that Scott\u2019s sentence is also substantively reasonable. The district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the parties\u2019 arguments and imposed a sentence below the advisory guideline range of 360 months to life imprisonment. The court recognized the severity of Scott\u2019s crimes and noted the effect of methamphetamine on society. The court also, however, expressed its reluctance to impose a life sentence in a case that was not a \u201cmajor trafficking case[ ].\u201d That reluctance was borne out in the court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence below the guidelines range. The fact that Scott will be in his seventies at the conclusion of his sentence does not make the district court\u2019s sentence unreasonable. Finally, the sentence imposed is far below the statutory maximum for each of the crimes for which he was convicted, which is a strong indicator of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 752 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that a sentence significantly lower than the statutory maximum is a sign of reasonableness). Scott has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
