Nelson, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Ming Yu Wang, </em>No. A95 687 429 (B.I.A. May 15, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 687 429 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 3, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">The submissions of <em>pro se </em>litigants are construed liberally and interpreted to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest. <em>See Triestman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, </em>470 F.3d 471, 474 (2d Cir.2006). When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA </em>482 F.3d 122, 126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">As a preliminary matter, pursuant to our decision in <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 314 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc), Wang is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum based on his wife\u2019s alleged forced abortion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 723 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Regarding Wang\u2019s claim of religious persecution, we find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that he failed to carry his burden of proof for asylum when he did not provide material corroborating evidence that was reasonably available to him. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 153 (2d Cir.2003), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 305. While an applicant\u2019s own testimony may sometimes be sufficient to meet his burden of proof, an IJ may also require the submission of corroborating evidence, or an explanation for its absence, where one would reasonably expect such evidence to be submitted. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 285-86 (2d Cir.2000). Here, the IJ gave weight to the absence of a written statement from Wang\u2019s wife corroborating his claims. Wang testified that he was in contact with his wife by phone and that she helped him to obtain a letter from their underground church. When asked to explain why his wife had not provided a statement, Wang testified that it was because she was illiterate, though he conceded that their 20-year-old son could have helped his wife to write a statement. Because the agency identified the particular piece of missing, relevant documentation and properly found that this document was \u201creasonably available\u201d to Wang, the agency did not err in denying his asylum claim for lack of corroboration. <em>Jin Shui Qiu, </em>329 F.3d at 153. Moreover, Wang was given an opportunity to explain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>absence of a statement from his wife, <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 394-95 (2d Cir.2005), and he points to no evidence that would have compelled the IJ to accept that explanation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Because Wang was unable to meet his burden of proof for asylum, he was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003). Finally, the agency\u2019s finding that Wang did not establish eligibility for CAT relief was not in error because \u2014 consistent with the agency\u2019s findings that he failed to provide reasonably available corroborative evidence \u2014 he provided insufficient evidence that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured in China. <em>See Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 168 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Wang\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-8\"><em>. </em>Judge Sotomayor continues to believe that <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>was in error to the extent that it applied beyond unmarried partners, <em>see Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 327 (Sotomayor, J., concurring), but notes that the Attorney General has since adopted the Court's construction of the statute and overruled the BIA\u2019s former <em>per se </em>rule of spousal eligibility, <em>see In re J-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 520 (BIA 2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
