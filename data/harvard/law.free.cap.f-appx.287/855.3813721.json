Boncelet (Mr. Boncelet) petitions for review of the United States Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s (Board) final order in <em>Boncelet v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>PH844E070201-I-1 (June 12, 2007). The initial decision of the Board, which became final on June 12, 2007, affirmed the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM\u2019s) reconsideration decision, which reaffirmed OPM\u2019s earlier determination to disallow Mr. Boncelet\u2019s disability retirement application under the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System. Mr. Boncelet petitions this court for review. The petition is <em>dismissed </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b875-23\">The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Department of Homeland Security, terminated Mr. Boncelet\u2019s employment as a Transportation Security Screener at the Newark International Airport, effective January 28, 2005. TSA terminated Mr. Boncelet because he \u201cdid not successfully complete the Annual Proficiency Review (APR) and consequently [did] not meet the requirements for Annual Recertification as a Transportation Security Screener.\u201d Mr. Boncelet applied for disability retirement, and OPM dismissed the application as untimely, but OPM later reconsidered its initial decision and waived its timeliness requirement. OPM then disallowed Mr. Boncelet\u2019s application for disability retirement. OPM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>found Mr. Boncelet did not provide documentation showing any medical condition that could cause him to fail his recertification tests, and found there was no evidence that he had any inability to regularly attend work and perform his assigned duties prior to failing his recertification test. Mr. Boncelet appealed to the Board, and at Mr. Boncelet\u2019s request, the appeal was decided on the record without a hearing. The administrative judge affirmed OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision in an initial decision dated May 8, 2007, and that decision became final on June 12, 2007. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The scope of our review in disability retirement cases \u201cis limited to correcting errors involving \u2018important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u2019\u201d <em>Smith v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>784 F.2d 397, 398 (Fed.Cir.1986) (citation omitted). We may not review the \u201cfactual underpinnings\u201d of disability determinations. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">Mr. Boncelet appears to agree that the Board applied the correct law. Pet. Br., Answer to Question No. 3. He does not ask us to correct any errors by the Board involving \u201cimportant procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u201d <em>See Smith, </em>784 F.2d at 398. Rather, his arguments involve the factual underpinnings of the Board\u2019s decision. He argues that the Board failed to recognize certain aspects of his medical condition, including the severity of his seizures, the advice of his doctors, and the nature of his medication regimen. The government responds that the Board did take these facts into account. Because we do not have the power to review the factual underpinnings of the Board\u2019s decision, <em>id. </em>at 401, we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
