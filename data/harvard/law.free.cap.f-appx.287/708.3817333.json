LUCERO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">Kirino Carrillo-Jaime, a citizen of Mexico, appeals his sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment imposed following his plea of guilty to one count of illegal reentry by a previously deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1826(a) and (b). He raises a single issue on appeal: Whether the district court erred in adding 16 levels to his base offense level under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) based on its finding that his prior conviction for residential burglary in the State of Washington amounted to a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). For its part, the government raises an antecedent question: Whether Carrillo-Jaime waived the issue now advanced by conceding it at his sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">Because we agree with the government that Carrillo-Jaime waived his only asserted ground for appeal, we affirm the sentence. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">On March 3, 2007, agents from United States Customs and Border Protection apprehended Carrillo-Jaime after he entered the United States without authorization near Columbus, New Mexico. Two months later, Carrillo-Jaime pleaded guilty to a one count information charging him with illegal reentry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b). His Presentenee Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) noted a base offense level of 8, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), but added a 16-level adjustment under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) because he had previously been convicted of a felony \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Application Note l(B)(iii) to \u00a7 2L1.2 defines \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d as a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and the PSR listed a 2005 conviction for \u201cResidential Burglary-Domestic Violence\u201d in Wenatchee, Washington as the predicate for the adjustment. After deducting 3 points for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, the PSR calculated a final offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of III. Taken together, these determinations yielded an advisory sentencing range of 46-57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-17\">Following release of the PSR, Carrillo-Jaime lodged written objections with the district court. Relevant to this appeal, he claimed that the 16-level adjustment under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) was improper because the Washington statute under which he was convicted, Wash. Rev.Code. \u00a7 9A.52.025(1), encompasses conduct which would not qualify as \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d under federal law. <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599-602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). In support of this proposition, he cited <em>United States v. Wenner, </em>351 F.3d 969 (9th Cir. 2003), in which the Ninth Circuit held that \u00a7 9A.52.025(1) is broader than federal \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d because the Washington definition of a \u201cdwelling\u201d in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>eludes structures that fall outside the federal definition of the same term.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Carrillo-Jaime separately maintained that the adjustment was also improper under the so-called \u201cmodified categorical approach,\u201d which permits a federal court to look to certain documents from the prior conviction to determine whether the defendant was actually charged with and convicted of all of the elements of the federal crime. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 15, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). He contended that the documents used to support the adjustment did not reveal whether he was convicted of entering a \u201cdwelling,\u201d as defined by federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">In response to Carrillo-Jaime\u2019s objection, the United States Probation Office (\u201cProbation Office\u201d) filed an addendum to the PSR and attached a copy of the state court document charging him with \u201cResidential Burglary-Domestic Violence.\u201d That information charged that Carrillo-Jaime had \u201cunlawfully and feloniously with intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein, enter[ed] or remain[ed] unlawfully in a dwelling other than a vehicle located at [123 Main St.], Wenatchee, WA, to wit: the residence of [Jane Doe].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court asked counsel for Carrillo-Jaime whether, given the addendum to the PSR and the judgment and sentence entered in the state case, counsel wished to address the written objection to the adjustment \u201cany further.\u201d The following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\">Counsel: I have to admit, now that we have seen the information, and I apologize if I misread that or overlooked the important residence language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-10\">The Court: It\u2019s very specific.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-11\">Counsel: Correct. The wind has been taken out of the sails of the argument to a certain extent involving the 16 level increase. When you look at the Washington statute, it\u2019s clearly ambiguous to a certain extent. But under the modified clerical [sic] approach, the Court can look at the information, and it would appear, Judge, that does satisfy____ I think that it would appear that the information satisfies the crime of violence requirement of 2L1.2.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">Following this exchange, Carrillo-Jaime did not again object to the legal or factual applicability of the \u00a7 2L1.2 adjustment. He instead acknowledged that the \u201c16 level increase for the residential burglary [was] warranted ... under the guidelines,\u201d and argued only that the resulting sentencing range was \u201cexcessive\u201d in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. The district court concluded that the adjustment was properly applied and ultimately sentenced Carrillo-Jaime to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, the bottom of the relevant sentencing range. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b730-15\">As the sole issue he presents for our review, Carrillo-Jaime seeks to resuscitate his original objection to the 16-level adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). He maintains that Washington law defines burglary more broadly than federal law, because \u201cresidential burglary\u201d in that state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>includes burglary of a fenced area, a railway car, or a cargo container. <em>See Wenner, </em>351 F.3d at 972; <em>see also </em>Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 9A.52.025, 9A.04.110(5) &amp; (7). Thus, he concludes, we must apply the \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d described in <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 15, 125 S.Ct. 1254. Under this approach, Carrillo-Jaime urges that the underlying documents relied upon by the district court to impose the adjustment \u2014 the information and judgment from his prior conviction \u2014 do not \u201cexclude the possibility that the [Washington] offense was, for instance, burglary committed in the victim\u2019s fenced backyard area.\u201d Without addressing the merits of this issue, the government contends that we may not review the argument now asserted because Carrillo-Jaime affirmatively waived his objection to the adjustment at sentencing. Given the record before us, we agree with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">A defendant who fails to properly object to an error in the district court, thereby forfeiting any challenge thereto, may nonetheless obtain relief on appeal upon review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Teague, </em>443 F.3d 1310, 1314 (10th Cir.2006); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). But a defendant who waives an issue by intentionally relinquishing or abandoning it in the court below is precluded from seeking any appellate review of that question. <em>United States v. Carrasco-Salazar, </em>494 F.3d 1270, 1272 (10th Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]aiver is accomplished by intent, but forfeiture comes about through neglect.... [A] party that has <em>waived </em>a right is not entitled to appellate relief.\u201d (quotation and alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In <em>Carrasco-Salazar, </em>we addressed a case strikingly similar to the instant one. We specifically considered whether a criminal defendant had waived his prior objection to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) crime-of-violence adjustment by representing to the court at sentencing that all of his objections had been resolved. <em>Id. </em>As in this case, following the defendant\u2019s written objection to the crime-of-violence adjustment, the Probation Office submitted an addendum to the PSR that included a copy of the relevant state charging document. <em>See id. </em>at 1271. We held that, by later indicating to the sentencing court that all of his objections to the PSR had been resolved, the defendant waived the sentencing objection and was not entitled to appellate review. <em>Id. </em>at 1273. We reasoned that \u201c[t]here can be no clearer intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right ... than when the court brings the defendant\u2019s prior objection to his attention, asks whether it has been resolved, and the defendant affirmatively indicates that it has.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">Carrillo-Jaime\u2019s remarks at sentencing establish intentional abandonment even more clearly than the statement at issue in <em>Carrasco-Salazar. </em>Not only did Carrillo-Jaime fail to pursue any factual or legal argument against application of the adjustment, but he also conceded that the addendum to the PSR had taken the wind \u201cout of the sails of the argument,\u201d that \u201cthe information satisfies the crime of violence requirement of 2L1.2,\u201d and that the adjustment was \u201cwarranted ... under the guidelines.\u201d By these statements, he plainly conveyed to the court that he was abandoning his previous objection. <em>See id. </em>at 1273; <em>see also United States v. Martinez-Jimenez, </em>294 F.3d 921, 923 (7th Cir.2002). He has therefore waived the question now pursued and is not entitled to appellate review of its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b729-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
