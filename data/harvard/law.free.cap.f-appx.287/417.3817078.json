Garcia admitted at rearraignment that he was apprehended in Laredo, Texas, in 2007 after having been removed from the United States in 1997. Garcia argues that the district court committed plain error by applying the \u201caggravated felony\u201d enhancement under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) based on the finding that he had committed an aggravated felony in 2000 and had been removed in 2001. Garcia argues that the fact of his 2001 removal was not alleged in his indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial, or admitted by him during the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-24\">Because Garcia did not object on this ground before the district court, plain error review applies to this issue. <em>See Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>ed States v. Gourley, </em>168 F.3d 165, 171 n. 10 (5th Cir.1999). As the Government acknowledges, the district court plainly erred in finding that Garcia was removed in 2001 for purposes of increasing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2) beyond the two-year statutory maximum under \u00a7 1326(a) that otherwise would have been applicable. <em>See United States v. Rojas-Luna, </em>522 F.3d 502, 504-06 (5th Cir.2008). However, contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, this error did seriously affect the fairness and integrity of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 507. In the exercise of our discretion, relief is warranted. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing consistent with <em>Rojas-Luna.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
