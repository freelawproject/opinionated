ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b725-18\">Ever Miguel Jurado-Lara, a citizen of the Republic of Mexico, appeals from the sentence imposed for crimes relating to his use of false information and false documents to obtain employment in the United States. Although Mr. Jurado-Lara was removed from the United States during his period of supervised release and after completion of his 16-month term of imprisonment, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over his appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-20\">To obtain employment in the United States, Mr. Jurado-Lara used the name and social-security number of Michael Soto, a United States citizen. Beginning in early 2000, he presented a series of employers with photo-ID cards with Mr. Jurado-Lara\u2019s pictui\u2019e, but Mr. Soto\u2019s name and social-security number. In January 2004, Mr. Jurado-Lara married Melissa Macias, a United States citizen. Through his wife\u2019s petition for alien rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>tive, he received a social-security card and an employment-authorization card valid from June 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Mr. Jurado-Lara then procured work under his own name and, in 2005, he applied for permanent-resident status in his own name. In February 2007, his wife received a notice of approval of the relative-immigration-visa petition she filed on his behalf. The same month, however, he was taken into custody based on criminal charges arising from his earlier use of Mr. Soto\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">A jury found Mr. Jurado-Lara guilty of two counts of possession of false documents in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a), two counts of making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(3), and five counts of misuse of a social security number in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B). A prepared Presentence Investigation Report (PIR) stated that the applicable sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, established a base offense level of six and increased the minimum offense level to 12 because Mr. Jurado-Lara\u2019s offenses \u201cinvolved ... the unauthorized ... use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain ... other means of identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(C)(i). The resulting advisory guidelines range was a prison term of 10 to 16 months. Overruling Mr. Jurado-Lara\u2019s objections to the PIR, the district court sentenced him to a term of 16 months, followed by two years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Mr. Jurado-Lara filed a timely notice of appeal challenging his sentence-specifically the six-level enhancement of his offense level. During the pendency of the appeal, he completed his sentence and was removed to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">Before we can address the merits of Mr. Jurado-Lara\u2019s arguments we must determine if his deportation moots his case and deprives this court of jurisdiction. When \u201cintervening acts destroy a party\u2019s legally cognizable interest\u201d in the lawsuit, the federal courts no longer have jurisdiction to decide a matter. <em>Moongate Water Co. v. Dona Ana Mut. Domestic Water Consumers Ass\u2019n, </em>420 F.3d 1082, 1088 (10th Cir. 2005) (quotation omitted). In particular, when a defendant completes the appealed sentence before an appellate court reaches a decision, \u201cthe court must determine whether sufficient collateral consequences flow from the underlying judgment and the completed sentence to save the appeal from mootness.\u201d <em>United States v. Meyers, </em>200 F.3d 715, 718 (10th Cir.2000). A \u201ccollateral consequence\u201d of the conviction means \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">The government argues that Mr. Jurado-Lara\u2019s case is controlled by the holding of <em>United States v. Vera-Flores, </em>496 F.3d 1177 (10th Cir.2007). In <em>Vera-Flores, </em>we dealt with a defendant who, like Mr. Jurado-Lara, had been deported following his term of incarceration but prior to the expiration of his term of supervised release. Although the defendant was legally subject to a one-year term of supervised release, his deportation \u201celiminated all practical consequences associated with serving a term of supervised release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1181. Thus, the removal rendered [the defendant\u2019s] appeal moot because he had no \u201cactual injury likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1181-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-11\">The only collateral consequence asserted by Vera-Flores was that if he obtained \u201cpermission to apply for lawful reentry during the pendency of his ... supervised release and were he actually admitted dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ing that time period, he would be forced to serve out the remainder of his supervised release term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1182. This hypothetical scenario was too \u201cremote\u201d and \u201cspeculative\u201d to save his appeal from mootness. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, we dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In contrast, Mr. Jurado-Lara asserts collateral consequences with regard to the immigration laws. An actual sentence of 12 months or greater makes his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546 an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for immigration purposes, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(4S)(P); a noncitizen convicted of an aggravated felony is permanently inadmissible, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(A)(ii)(II). If this court determined, however, that the application of the six-level enhancement was erroneous, the upper end of the corrected advisory guideline range would be under 12 months. As a result, Mr. Jurado-Lara would not have an aggravated-felony conviction and would not be subject to the statutory bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">We conclude that Mr. Jurado-Lara met his burden of demonstrating \u201ccollateral consequences adequate to meet Article Ill\u2019s injury-in-fact requirement.\u201d <em>Spencer, </em>523 U.S. at 14, 118 S.Ct. 978. His appeal is not moot because the asserted collateral consequences from the judgment give Mr. Jurado-Lara \u201ca substantial stake\u201d in the outcome of the case. <em>See Carafas v. La Vallee, </em>391 U.S. 234, 237, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (1968) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Furthermore, we decline to adopt a blanket rule that a \u201cdeported defendant\u2019s inability to appear in court for resentencing pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 precluded] the court from affording relief.\u201d <em>Vera-Flores, </em>496 F.3d at 1182 n. 4 (discussing the holding of <em>United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007)), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 1216, 170 L.Ed.2d 58 (2008). Rule 43 provides that a defendant\u2019s presence is required at sentencing. And \u201ca defendant has a due process right to be present at a proceeding whenever ... a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence.\u201d <em>United States v. Gagnon, </em>470 U.S. 522, 526, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 84 L.Ed.2d 486 (1985) (internal quotation omitted). The rights afforded by Rule 43 and due process, however, can be waived with the express or implied consent of the accused. <em>See id. </em>at 526-28, 105 S.Ct. 1482; Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(c). Mr. Jurado-Lara\u2019s continued pursuit of his appeal may be considered an implied waiver of the right to be present at a potential resentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>450 F.3d 1201, 1211 (10th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[A]n express statement of waiver by the defendant is not required; instead, waiver can be inferred from the defendant\u2019s actions and words.\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">In sum, dismissal is not the appropriate resolution of Mr. Jurado-Lara\u2019s appeal. We therefore proceed to analyze the merits of his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Mr. Jurado-Lara asserts that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i) because the government failed to prove that he used Mr. Soto\u2019s identifying information without Mr. Soto\u2019s authorization. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>374 F.3d 941, 947 (10th Cir.2004) (stating government bears burden of establishing sentence enhancements). Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(10)(C)(i), the government was required to show that Mr. Jurado-Lara engaged in \u201cthe unauthorized transfer or use of any means of identification unlawfully to produce or obtain any other means of identification.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>\u201cmeans of identification\u201d must \u201cbe of an actual (i.e. not fictitious) individual,\u201d \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 9(A), used \u201cwithout that individual\u2019s authorization,\u201d <em>id. </em>cmt. n. 9(C)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The record does lack direct evidence of Mr. Soto\u2019s permission to allow the illegal use of his name and assigned social security number, and there is no specific finding by the court on this aspect of the enhancement. However, the objection offered by the defense was general in nature. Neither in counsel\u2019s written objection to the PIR nor in his oral argument at the sentencing hearing was there any mention of the authorization issue. Certainly, there was nothing in the objection itself which would call the court\u2019s attention to the precise point raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">We have previously \u201chighlight[ed] the need for a party to raise specific objections before the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>531 F.3d 1261, 1271 (10th Cir. 2008). If a defendant raises a specific objection to an enhancement, then the district court is given the opportunity to \u201chear[] evidence and ma[k]e findings regarding the factual question at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although \u201c \u2018we have reviewed sentencing errors that were not raised in the district court under a plain error standard, plain error review is not appropriate when the alleged error involves the resolution of factual disputes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Easter, </em>981 F.2d 1549, 1555-56 (10th Cir.1992)). In accordance with our established precedent, we will not review Mr. Jurado-Lara\u2019s objection to the enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
