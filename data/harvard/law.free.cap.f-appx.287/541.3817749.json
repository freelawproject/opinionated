Having conducted a thorough review of the record before the district court, <em>see Larson v. Kempker, </em>414 F.3d 936, 939 (8th Cir.2005) (de novo review), we conclude that summary judgment was proper. Contrary to Tweeton\u2019s assertion, he was required to offer evidence countering defendants\u2019 supporting affidavits and other evidence, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e) (2006) (revised 2007) (to oppose properly supported summary judgment motion, adverse party may not rely merely on allegations or denials, but must set out specific facts \u2014 by affidavits or other evidence \u2014 showing genuine issue for trial); <em>Larson, </em>414 F.3d at 939 (nonmoving party must show existence of facts on record creating genuine issue). Aso, because his complaint was unverified, it could not be considered as such evidence. <em>Cf. Ward v. Moore, </em>414 F.3d 968, 970 (8th Cir.2005) (where amended complaint was verified under penalty of perjury, it was equivalent of affidavit and could serve as response to defendants\u2019 summary judgment motion). Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-16\">. The Honorable Paul A.
