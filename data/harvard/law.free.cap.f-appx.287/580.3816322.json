Garcia-Lagar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>da argues that the BIA improperly denied \u00a7 212(c) relief as he was a permanent legal resident of the United States, and that he was denied an opportunity to prove his status. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The BIA neither deemed Garcia-Lagarda deportable nor denied him \u00a7 212(c) relief on the basis that he is not a permanent legal resident. Rather, the BIA reached both decisions because Garcia-Lagarda entered the country without inspection. He raises no issue with respect to this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">To the extent that Garcia-Lagarda suggests that the IJ improperly denied him a continuance, the point is not developed by argument and is, thus, abandoned. <em>See Ghahremani v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 993, 997 (9th Cir.2007) (issues raised but not supported by argument are deemed abandoned). In any event, the IJ did not abuse his discretion; Garcia-Lagarda did not request time to subpoena documents from the Social Security Administration until eight years after the proceedings were commenced and on the eve of a decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
