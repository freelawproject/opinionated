Because Ahmed has failed to satisfy the standards for the issuance of a COA, we deny his request and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Ahmed, the former owner/operator of a convenience store in Tulsa, Oklahoma, became the subject of an investigation by local police after he reported two robberies of pseudoephedrine from his store, totaling over 138,000 tablets. During the course of the investigation, an undercover police officer purchased numerous bottles of pseudoephedrine tablets from Ahmed. Ahmed was subsequently charged with, and pled guilty to, distributing pseudoephedrine tablets with knowledge that the tablets would be used to manufacture methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(c)(2). Ahmed was sentenced to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ahmed filed a direct appeal challenging the district court\u2019s calculation of his sentence. This court affirmed the judgment of the district court. <em>United States v. Ahmed, </em>140 Fed.Appx. 1 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">On June 8, 2006, Ahmed filed a pro se motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 arguing, in pertinent part, that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an interpreter in order to ensure that Ahmed fully understood the nature of the charge he was pleading guilty to. More specifically, Ahmed argued that he was not aware that the term \u201ccrank,\u201d which was used by a confidential informant during a conversation with Ahmed, was slang for methamphetamine. The district court rejected that claim, noting that at no time during the change of plea hearing \u201cdid [Ahmed] notify the Court that he was having any difficulty understanding the proceedings or that he needed an interpreter.\u201d ROA, Doc. 65 at 17. In other words, the district court noted, Ahmed\u2019s \u201cinteractions with the Court during the change of plea and sentencing hearing did not suggest that [he] had any problems understanding the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Ahmed has since filed a notice of appeal and an application for COA with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">Issuance of a COA is jurisdictional. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). In other words, a federal prisoner may appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion only if the district court or this court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2553(c)(2). In order to make such a showing, a federal prisoner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484,120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">Nothing in the record on appeal persuades us that the <em>Slack </em>standard has been satisfied. Not only does Ahmed fail to point us to any evidence that would support his claimed inability to understand the charge against him, he makes no attempt to refute the district court\u2019s description of his conduct during the change of plea and sentencing healings. Thus, we are not persuaded that Ahmed can establish either that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to obtain an interpreter fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, or that Ahmed was prejudiced by that failure. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(1984) (outlining requirements for establishing ineffective assistance of counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The application for COA is DENIED and the matter is DISMISSED. Ahmed\u2019s motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b50-16\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
