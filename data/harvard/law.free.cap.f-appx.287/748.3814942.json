Davis raises two issues on appeal. First, whether the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), erred in giving \u201cno weight\u201d to Davis\u2019s treating physicians\u2019 opinions. Second, whether the ALJ erred by failing to properly consider Davis\u2019s subjective complaints and non-exertional impairments. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s reasons for discrediting both the opinions of the treating physicians and Davis\u2019s testimony as to her pain, are not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Davis filed an application for disability insurance benefits alleging that she had been unable to work since June 2003. The Commissioner denied Davis\u2019s application initially and upon reconsideration. Davis filed a request for a hearing before an ALJ. At the hearing, Davis testified and presented documentary evidence, the bulk of which was already in the administrative record. The vocational expert (\u2018VE\u201d) also testified at the hearing. R.Exhs. at 330. To the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question regarding a \u201cyounger individual\u201d with Davis\u2019s education, work history, and similar physical restrictions, the VE testified that such a hypothetical person would not be able to do any of the past work performed by Davis. <em>Id. </em>at 332. To the ALJ\u2019s inquiry into whether such a hypothetical person could perform occupations that exist in the national economy, the VE testified that he would advance the position of mai\u2019ker or pricer. <em>Id. </em>at 332-33. He stated that this job had a \u201clight exertional level, SVP of two, which is simple, routine, non interfering, three step work activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333. He testified that the second position he would advance was that of garment sorter, which was also at the light exertional level, SVP of two, and which was unskilled, entry-level work. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ then asked the VE whether he had heard Davis\u2019s testimony; the ALJ responded that he had. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ asked whether those same two positions would be available to Davis if the ALJ found credible her testimony that she had severe problems with concentration, severe pain on a regular basis, required much time lying down, and suffered depression and anxiety. <em>Id. </em>at 333-34. The VE responded that if that were the case, Davis would not be able to function in either of the two named jobs. <em>Id. </em>at 334. He stated that in his opinion, Davis \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to function on any job on a sustained basis in the competitive labor market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ then inquired whether a restriction on walking more than 10 minutes at a time, plus the initially-named restrictions, would impact one\u2019s ability to perform those same two jobs, and the VE responded yes. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">The ALJ denied Davis benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 12-24. The ALJ first found that Davis\u2019s earnings after the onset of her medical conditions did not constitute substantial gainful activity. <em>Id. </em>at 16. Next, the ALJ examined the severity of Davis\u2019s combination of impairments, finding that her asthma was \u201cunder good control with medication and not a severe impairment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17. He found that the medical evidence indicated that Davis had fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and degenerative disc disease, \u201cimpairments that are severe within the meaning of the Regulations but not severe enough to meet or medically equal, either singly or in combi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>nation to one of the impairments listed in Appendix 1, Subpart P, Regulations No. 4.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The ALJ stated that the evidence showed that Davis had only mild restrictions in activities of daily living, citing the questionnaire she filled out in which she indicated that she had no problems caring for her personal needs, that she was able to cook and clean, and that she could pick her daughter up from school. <em>Id. </em>at 18. He stated that Davis had moderate difficulty in social functioning, as she reported that she does not want to go anywhere, but that she generally gets along well with people. <em>Id. </em>He stated that Davis had moderate difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace, as she reported having problems concentrating and remembering, though David Ghostley, a clinical psychologist, had noted that her concentration was unimpaired. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the ALJ stated that there was no evidence that Davis had experienced an episode of decompensation since her alleged onset date. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The ALJ found that, \u201c[bjased on the objective findings and inconsistencies,\u201d Davis\u2019s testimony of experiencing extreme pain which kept her from being able to sit, stand, or walk for prolonged periods, or care for her personal hygiene needs, was not credible. <em>Id. </em>at 18-19. Specifically, the ALJ pointed to the inconsistency of Davis\u2019s statement in the questionnaire, that she was able to care for her personal needs, and her statement at the hearing that she sometimes had to have her husband wash her hair and that she goes days without taking a bath. <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">In considering the medical opinions of Davis\u2019s treating physicians, the ALJ stated that he gave no weight to Dr. Edmund LaCour\u2019s 10 March 2004 physical assessment of Davis, in which Dr. LaCour found severe restrictions on Davis\u2019s ability to sit, stand, or walk for long periods of time, as well as restrictions on her ability to do such things as push, pull, bend, and crawl. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ found that Dr. LaCour\u2019s assessment was \u201ctoo extreme and not supported by the objective findings of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. The ALJ then considered Dr. LaCour\u2019s 7 October 2004, assessment, in which Dr. LaCour stated that Davis might be able to work on a part-time basis, if the job was not physically demanding or particularly stressful. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ rejected Dr. LaCour\u2019s opinion, stating that the evidence supported the conclusion that she had a greater residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) than Dr. LaCour indicated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">The ALJ then considered Davis\u2019s psychological complaints, stating that the evidence revealed that Davis was not credible. <em>Id. </em>He stated that Davis\u2019s daily living activities and history of conservative treatment did not support her extreme allegations, citing Davis\u2019s statements that she picks her daughter up from school, cooks, and performs light cleaning. <em>Id. </em>He noted that the record showed that Davis denied experiencing any side-effects from her medications. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">The ALJ also considered the medical opinion of Dr. Ghostley, which was given after a consultative psychological evaluation on 17 May 2004. <em>Id. </em>He gave \u201csignificant weight\u201d to Dr. Ghostley\u2019s opinion that Davis\u2019s \u201cability to understand and remember instructions, as well as to respond appropriately to supervisors, coworkers, and work pressures in a work setting\u201d, was impaired. <em>Id. </em>However, the ALJ found that, although Davis did have some limitations, she was \u201cnot as limited as alleged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">The ALJ next considered the 20 May 2004 assessment by Nelson Handal, M.D., and stated that he rejected Dr. Handal\u2019s opinion that Davis had a global assessment functioning level (\u201cGAF\u201d) level of 50. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>at 19-20. The ALJ found that this assessment was not supported by Dr. Handal\u2019s subsequent treatment records, and that the evidence revealed that Dr. Handal had noted on 10 September 2004 that Davis was \u201cfunctioning \u2018fair.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The ALJ found that the evidence showed that Dr. LaCour had noted on 6 December 2004 that Davis had not seen Dr. Handal in several months, and that Dr. Handal\u2019s 17 January 2005 assessment was inconsistent, as Dr. Handal reported that Davis was functioning \u201cfair,\u201d and yet found her condition to be \u201cworse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The ALJ also stated that a treatment note by Dr. Handal, dated 30 June 2005, revealed that Davis was found to be functioning fair, that Dr. Handal had assessed her condition as \u201coverall improved,\u201d though Dr. Handal continued to find her GAF level was 50. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ stated, he gave \u201cno weight to Dr. Handal\u2019s opinion that [Davis]\u2019s global assessment level was 50 as it is totally inconsistent with his treatment records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the ALJ found that Davis\u2019s treatment by Dr. Handal was sporadic, and that Dr. Handal continued to assess Davis a GAF of 50, though his treatment records revealed that she was denying feelings of depression and anxiety. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The ALJ then turned to the state agency physical residual functional capacity assessment form, to which he stated he gave no weight, since it was not signed or dated. <em>Id. </em>He noted, however, that he found the opinions in the assessment to be consistent with the record evidence. <em>Id.; see also, id. </em>at 142\u201449. The ALJ also considered the state agency psychiatric review technique form, which was completed by a state medical consultant. <em>Id. </em>at 20. The medical consultant found that Davis had mild restrictions on activities of daily living, mild difficulties in maintaining social functioning, moderate difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence or pace, and no episodes of decompensation. <em>See id. </em>at 218-31. The ALJ found that Davis had moderate limitations in social functioning, though he stated that the evidence supported the conclusion that Davis was not as limited as alleged. <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">The ALJ found that Davis had the RFC to lift or carry 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently, that she could occasionally push or pull with her lower extremities, that she could never climb ladders, ropes, or scaffolds, and that she could never kneel or crawl. <em>Id. </em>Further, Davis could occasionally climb ramps and stairs, balance, stoop and crouch, as well as occasionally reach overhead with her arms. <em>Id. </em>He found that she must avoid concentrated exposure to extreme cold and heat, and avoid all exposure to heights and dangerous machinery. <em>Id. </em>at 20-21. Finally, the ALJ stated, that due to Davis\u2019s pain and emotional problems, she could only concentrate on simple, routine, unskilled work, that she could not perform quota or piece rate work, that she must avoid large crowds in the workplace, and that she could not wait on public customers, either face-to-face or over the telephone. <em>Id. </em>at 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Next, the ALJ found that Davis could not perform any of her past relevant work, but that she was capable of performing a significant range of light work as defined in 20 CFR \u00a7 404.1567. <em>Id. </em>Based on the VE\u2019s testimony, Davis could perform marker/pricer and garment sorter jobs. <em>Id. </em>at 22. The Appeals Council denied review. <em>Id. </em>at 4, ID. The district court affirmed. Rl-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">We review a Social Security determination to ascertain whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>(per curiam). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001). Under this limited standard of review, we will not decide the facts anew, make credibility determinations, or re-weigh the evidence. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. Further, on review, there is no presumption \u201cthat the Commissioner followed the appropriate legal standards in deciding a claim for benefits or that legal conclusions reached were valid. Instead, we conduct an exacting examination of these factors.\u201d <em>Miles v. Chater, </em>84 F.3d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">In evaluating a claim for disability benefits, an ALJ must evaluate the claimant\u2019s case with respect to the following five criteria, as set forth in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520: \u201c1. [i]s the individual performing substantial gainful activity; 2 [d]oes she have a severe impairment; 3 [d]oes she have a severe impairment that meets or equals an impairment specifically listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1; 4 [c]an she perform her past relevant work; and 5 [b]ased on her age, education, and work experience, can she perform other work of the sort found in the national economy\u201d. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004). At the fourth and fifth steps, a determination of the claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d), is made by the ALJ by considering the claimant\u2019s ability to sit, stand, walk, lift, carry, push, pull, reach, handle, stoop, crouch, and other work-related physical demands. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(e), (f), 404.1545(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">A. <em>Whether the ALJ erred in giving \u201cno weight\u201d to Davis\u2019s treating physicians\u2019 opinions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Davis argues that the ALJ erred in giving \u201cno weight\u201d to the opinions of two treating physicians without showing \u201cgood cause.\u201d Davis asserts that the record of her treatment by her rheumatologist, Dr. LaCour, demonstrates that (1) her condition was worsening; (2) her medications were routinely increased; (3) she had lengthy and repeated absences from work; and (4) Dr. LaCour\u2019s treatment notes were entirely consistent with both his treatment plan and Davis\u2019s restrictions. Further, Davis contends that the ALJ misread the record of her treatment by her psychiatrist, Dr. Handal, when he found that Dr. Handal had found Davis to be doing \u201cfair\u201d at several of her visits. Davis submits that the assessment of \u201cfair,\u201d relied on by the ALJ, was Davis\u2019s own assessment of her health, not Dr. Handal\u2019s, as his medical notes began, \u201cPatient is reportedly ...,\u201d rather than stating Dr. Handal\u2019s own assessment. Davis asserts that Dr. Handal\u2019s treatment demonstrates that he clearly did not agree with her own assessment that she was doing fair, as he repeatedly changed her medications and increased her dosages. Finally, Davis argues that in order for the ALJ to give a treating physician\u2019s opinion no weight, the ALJ had to consider the factors laid out in <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41. She contends that it was an error of law for the ALJ to give the only medical opinions in the case \u201cno weight,\u201d because each physician is board certified in their respective specialties, Davis had been treated by Dr. LaCour for over two years and by Dr. Handal for 15 months at the time of the hearing, as she had numerous visits with each doctor, and as each doctor had substantially the same opinion regarding Davis\u2019s ability to perform in a work environment. Since the only medical evidence contradicting her physicians\u2019 opinions is an unsigned and undated opinion of an agency employee, Davis contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>that the ALJ had no medical evidence to support the RFC he used for her, and that the unsigned opinion cannot be viewed as substantial evidence that can overcome the opinions and medical evidence of her two treating physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Social Security regulations provide guidelines for the ALJ to use when evaluating medical opinion evidence. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527. The ALJ considers many factors when weighing medical opinions, including the examining relationship, the treatment relationship, how supported an opinion is, whether an opinion is consistent with the record, and a doctor\u2019s specialization. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1) \u2014 (6). In Social Security disability benefits cases, generally, the opinions of examining physicians are given more weight than non-examining physicians, treating physicians are given more weight than non-treating physicians, and specialists are given more weight on issues within their areas of expertise than non-specialists. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1), (2), (5). When the ALJ does not give the treating source\u2019s opinion controlling weight, the ALJ applies other factors such as the length of treatment, the frequency of examination, the nature and extent of the relationship, as well as the supportability of the opinion, its consistency with other evidence, and the specialization of the physician. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2) \u2014 (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The opinion of a treating physician \u201cmust be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u2018good cause\u2019 is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240 (quoting <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1440 (11th Cir.1997)) (internal quotations omitted). Good cause is shown when the: \u201c(1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241. Where the ALJ articulated specific reasons for failing to give the opinion of a treating physician controlling weight, and those reasons are supported by substantial evidence, there is no reversible error. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Here, the ALJ improperly gave \u201cno weight\u201d to the medical opinion of Dr. LaC-our. First, Dr. LaCour and Davis had a longstanding relationship in which Dr. LaCour was her treating physician for nearly two years. <em>See </em>R.Exhs. at 212, 298-99. Moreover, Dr. LaCour saw Davis on a fairly frequent basis, having seen her at least 15 times between her onset date of 1 June 2003, and April 2005, and communicating with her regularly. <em>See id. </em>at 212-299.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">In examining Dr. LaCour\u2019s medical opinion, the ALJ first discredited Davis\u2019s testimony regarding her extreme limitations based on the objective findings and the inconsistency between her testimony and her response to a question on the daily activities questionnaire. <em>Id. </em>at 19. He found that the progress notes from Dr. LaCour indicated that Davis had reported feeling better, that she refused trigger injections, and that by April 2005, she was \u201coverall improved.\u201d <em>Id.. </em>In light of these findings, the ALJ stated that the 10 March 2004, assessment by Dr. LaCour was \u201ctoo extreme and not supported by the objective findings of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, an examination of the specific inconsistencies cited by the ALJ, as well as the objective findings of record, demonstrates that the substantial record evidence does not support his conclusion to give Dr. LaCour\u2019s medical opinion \u201cno weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">In the daily activities questionnaire, Davis stated, in part, that she was able to care for her personal needs on a regular basis without assistance, that her family helped to take care of her, that she \u201csome<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>times\u201d cooked, and that her daughter and husband did the shopping for her. <em>Id. </em>at 117-18. She also stated that she had \u201cgood days\u201d and \u201cbad days,\u201d noting that on a good day, she was capable of performing light dusting and cleaning in the kitchen, and on a bad day, she would lay in bed. <em>Id. </em>at 118. While the ALJ found these statements inconsistent with Davis\u2019s testimony that her husband sometimes had to wash her hair and that she would go days without taking a bath, it should be noted that Davis filled out the questionnaire over a year prior to giving testimony at the hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 324-25. Within a period of many months following 6 April 2004, the day on which Davis completed the questionnaire, Davis was again given a work excuse by Dr. LaCour, she reported that she was not functioning well at home, Dr. LaCour increased her medication due to the pain she was experiencing, and he found that her fibromyalgia pain had increased \u201call over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273, 291, 294, 301. Davis\u2019s testimony that her husband sometimes had to wash her hair, and her response to the questionnaire, that she was capable of caring for her own personal needs, do appear to contradict each other when viewed in isolation. <em>Id. </em>at 117, 324-25. However, when that testimony is viewed in light of the questionnaire as a whole, where Davis stated that her family helped to care for her, and that she had good days and bad days, her statement that her husband \u201csometimes\u201d had to wash her hair, appears entirely consistent. <em>Id. </em>These statements alone do not provide the substantial evidence required to support the ALJ\u2019s reasons for giving Dr. LaCour\u2019s opinion \u201cno weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The ALJ also examined Davis\u2019s testimony in light of her medical history and Dr. LaCour\u2019s progress notes in deciding to give Dr. LaCour\u2019s opinion \u201cno weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. The ALJ found that Davis\u2019s testimony of experiencing extreme pain was inconsistent with several progress notes completed by Dr. LaCour between 2003 and 2005. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the ALJ looked at the 19 June 2003 and 1 December 2003 progress notes, where Davis had reported overall improvement and decreased pain. <em>Id. </em>He also noted that on 6 December 2004, Davis refused trigger injections, opting instead to use Lidoderm patches. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the ALJ noted that on 7 April 2005, Dr. LaCour indicated that Davis\u2019s fibromyalgia was improved since starting Cymbalta. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ found that this evidence was inconsistent with both Davis\u2019s testimony and Dr. LaCour\u2019s 10 March 2004, physical assessment of Davis, where he stated that she could not sit for six to eight hours in an eight-hour workday, that she could not stand or walk for six hours in an eight-hour workday, that she could lift 10-20 pounds, but only 10 pounds repetitively, and that she could not push or pull with arm or foot controls, bend, squat, crawl and climb. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ stated that Dr. LaCour\u2019s assessment was \u201ctoo extreme and not supported by the objective findings of record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">However, while the objective findings of record demonstrate that Davis did have periods of overall improvement between 2003 and 2005, she also had many more periods where her condition remained stable or became worse. On 19 June 2003, the date cited by the ALJ for Davis\u2019s improvement, Davis complained to Kenneth Roberts, M.D., the company doctor, that her knees were aching and her feet were swelling. <em>Id. </em>at 181. On 24 June 2003, Davis was excused from work until 10 July 2003 by Dr. Roberts, M.D., who also referred her to a rheumatologist, Dr. LaCour. <em>Id. </em>at 180, 212. On 9 July 2003, Dr. LaCour\u2019s objective findings showed that Davis\u2019s soft tissue was notable for \u201c1 + tenderness in all 18 fibromyalgia tender points,\u201d and on 23 July 2003, Davis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>received a work excuse through September 9, 2003. <em>Id. </em>at 213. On 9 September 2003, Davis was found to have 1-2+ tenderness, and on 12 September 2003, she described her pain as a ten on a scale of one to ten. <em>Id. </em>at 254. Further, on 16 September 2003, Davis had increased pain in her neck and shoulders, and Dr. LaC-our\u2019s objective findings showed \u201c[significant tenderness 2-3+ in the paracervical, paralumbar area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210. The record has many more such examples where Davis\u2019s condition worsened or simply failed to improve. <em>See id. </em>at 245, 175, 209, 197, 239, 208, 207, 205, 238. Specifically, within the weeks before Dr. LaCour completed the 10 March 2004, physical assessment rejected by the ALJ as too extreme, Dr. LaCour\u2019s objective findings show that Davis\u2019s fibromyalgia was \u201cvery symptomatic, quite a bit of tenderness,\u201d and that she had \u201cat least 1-2 + tenderness on soft tissue palpitation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 208. Further, Dr. LaCour\u2019s assessment shows that Davis was experiencing debilitating symptoms and missing much work because of it. <em>Id. </em>at 205. In fact, on 10 March 2004, the day on which Dr. LaCour completed the physical assessment of Davis, Davis was out of work with a work excuse until 2 April 2004. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, while the ALJ cited Davis\u2019s refusal of trigger injections on 6 December 2004 as evidence that her treatment was conservative, the record shows that Davis did in fact opt for the injections at other points in time, as Dr. LaCour noted on 13 August 2004 that the injections were helping with Davis\u2019s pain. <em>Id. </em>at 291. The periods of improvement cited by the ALJ, taken in conjunction with the periods of increased pain and debilitation, are consistent with Davis\u2019s statements that she experienced good days and bad days, both within the questionnaire and in her testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 328. They are also consistent with Dr. LaCour\u2019s 10 March 2004 physical assessment. Again, substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the objective findings of record did not support Dr. LaCour\u2019s medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The ALJ also rejected Dr. LaCour\u2019s 7 October 2004 medical opinion that Davis might be able to work part-time, assuming the job was not physically demanding and not particularly stressful. <em>Id. </em>at 289. The ALJ found that this opinion was not supported by the record, stating that the evidence supported the conclusion that Davis\u2019s RFC allowed her to perform at the level of light exertion. <em>Id. </em>at 19. However, the record evidence shows that Davis was on leave from work from 23 June 2004 through 9 August 2004. <em>Id. </em>at 294. It also shows that two months prior to Dr. LaCour\u2019s October assessment, on 13 August 2004, Dr. LaCour noted that he had increased Davis\u2019s medications because of the pain she was experiencing. <em>Id. </em>at 291. The record also reflects that at various points throughout 2004, both Dr. LaCour and Davis\u2019s physical therapist remarked that Davis\u2019s muscle pain was aggravated by increased work, and that her pain decreased when she was on medical leave. <em>Id. </em>at 239, 294. Further, following the medical opinion given in October, Davis continued to experience increased pain from her fibromyalgia upon her return to part-time work. <em>Id. </em>at 301. Dr. LaCour\u2019s 6 December 2004 physical examination of Davis showed that she had tenderness in 14 of the 18 fibromyalgia tender points, and that her knees were especially tender. <em>Id. </em>at 302. Again, the substantial record evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dr. LaCour\u2019s medical opinion should be given \u201cno weight,\u201d as the evidence demonstrates that Dr. LaCour\u2019s objective findings are consistent with his October 2004 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Regarding the ALJ\u2019s decision that \u201cno weight\u201d be given to Dr. Handal\u2019s medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>opinion, the ALJ first concluded that Davis was not credible as to her psychological complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The ALJ explained his conclusion by citing the \u201cDaily Activities Questionnaire\u201d completed by Davis, stating, that she reported that she picks her daughter up from school every day, cooks, and performs light cleaning, as well as noting that she generally gets along with most people. <em>Id. </em>at 19, 118-19. The ALJ also noted Davis\u2019s history of conservative treatment and her denial of experiencing side-effects from her medications. <em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">While we will not make credibility determinations or re-weigh the evidence, it is useful to examine statements made by Davis, because the ALJ relied in part on Davis\u2019s own assertions in determining that Dr. Handal\u2019s medical opinion should be given \u201cno weight.\u201d <em>See Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1211. While the ALJ cited Davis\u2019s responses to the \u201cDaily Activities Questionnaire,\u201d completed in April 2004, in finding her \u201cextreme allegations\u201d not credible, the record evidence demonstrates that Davis\u2019s responses to the questionnaire did not contradict her later statements. <em>Id. </em>at 19. Specifically, when Davis was asked in the questionnaire how often she left her house, she responded, \u201cI pick up my daughter from school and go to the doctor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 118. Regarding Davis\u2019s ability to perform household chores, Davis stated in the questionnaire, \u201csometimes, I cook[,] if not[,] my husband brings home food or we just eat sandwiches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She also stated, \u201cIf I am having a good day I can do light dusting and clean the kitchen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Davis noted, \u201c[everything] that [I do] just depends on if I am having a good day,\u201d and \u201cI lay in bed if I am having a bad day. If [I\u2019m having a] good day I try to work around the house,\u201d and \u201cI have to take several breaks in order for me to complete tasks on a good day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119-20. Davis further stated that her daughter and husband did the shopping for her, and that while she used to balance the checkbook, she no longer did because she could not handle the anxiety and details of the task. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 120. While Davis stated, and the ALJ cited, that she gets along well with most people, when asked about her social activity, Davis stated that a friend came to see her several times a week, but that she did not participate in social activities due to the pain she experienced, and that she did not want to go anywhere and simply stayed home because of the pain. <em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">While the ALJ cited several of these statements to show that Davis was more capable than she later testified, these statements do not directly contradict her later statements. <em>Id. </em>at 19. First, Davis did not state on the questionnaire that she picked her daughter up \u201ceveryday,\u201d as the ALJ stated. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 19. When asked how often she left the house, she replied that she did so to go to the doctor and to pick her daughter up. <em>Id. </em>at 19. At the hearing, Davis asserted that she slept a lot because of feelings of sadness, that she had stopped cooking, though she might do so on a good day, and that she stopped going to the grocery store. <em>Id. </em>at 323-24, 328. While these statements may expand on some of her earlier statements, none of them works to contradict them. Moreover, it should be noted that the questionnaire was completed by Davis prior to her first session with Dr. Handal, and nearly a year and a half prior to the hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 284; 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Further, Davis\u2019s responses to the questionnaire are not inconsistent with the objective findings of Dr. Handal. Specifically, Dr. Handal diagnosed Davis as having major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, and restless leg syndrome. <em>Id. </em>at 286. Davis\u2019s statements on the ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>tionnaire, that she did not like to leave her house, and that she no longer balanced the checkbook because of the anxiety it caused her, are consistent with Dr. Handal\u2019s diagnosis. <em>Id. </em>at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Moreover, while the ALJ stated that Davis\u2019s history of conservative treatment failed to support her psychological complaints, the record evidence shows that Davis was on several medications for depression, anxiety, and mood stability, that she switched medications to better address her problems, and that she had her dosages increased on several occasions. <em>See id. </em>at 274, 276, 278, 279, 282, 287. With regard to the ALJ\u2019s statement that Davis did not complain about side-effects from her medications to Dr. Handal, it is true that Davis repeatedly \u201cdenied adverse events or serious side[-]effects.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 279, 281. However, Davis did report to Dr. Handal that she was experiencing \u201cpoor concentration, difficulty following directions, jumps tasks and does not complete assignments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281. She further reported that she was experiencing a lack of motivation, stating she had only cooked two meals since her last visit with Dr. Handal, and that she was very forgetful and had difficulty focusing even when attempting to carry on a conversation, stating, \u201cI get lost and I feel so dumb.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After hearing her complaints, Dr. Handal noted his recommendation that Davis hold off on taking one of her medications for two days, to see if her memory would improve. <em>Id. </em>at 282. Furthermore, when asked at the hearing whether she experienced side-effects from her medications, Davis stated, \u201cI have severe memory problems. I can\u2019t concentrate, I\u2019m afraid to drive anymore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Following his finding that Davis was not credible, the ALJ rejected Dr. Handal\u2019s 20 May 2004 assessment that found Davis to have a GAF of 50. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The ALJ stated that he rejected this opinion because is was not supported by Dr. Handal\u2019s subsequent treatment records. <em>Id. </em>at 20. Specifically, the ALJ pointed to Dr. Handal\u2019s 10 September 2004 progress note stating that Dr. Handal found that Davis was functioning \u201cfair.\u201d <em>Id.; see id. </em>at 271. He also pointed to Dr. Handal\u2019s 17 January 2005 progress note, stating that Dr. Handal had opined that Davis\u2019s functioning was fair, but assessed that her condition was worse, while also noting that Davis was \u201ccooperative, alert and in no acute distress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20; <em>see id. </em>at 296. The ALJ also pointed to Dr. Handal\u2019s 22 February 2005 progress note, stating that Dr. Handal again noted that Davis was functioning fair, that Davis reported eating good and sleeping fair, but that Davis\u2019s condition was worse. <em>Id. </em>at 20; <em>see id. </em>at 307. The ALJ then addressed the 30 June 2005 progress note, stating that the note revealed that Dr. Handal found Davis to be functioning fail\u2019, that he indicated that her condition was overall improved, but that he again gave Davis a GAF level of 50. <em>Id. </em>at 20; <em>see id. </em>at 305. The ALJ gave \u201cno weight\u201d to Dr. Handal\u2019s opinion that Davis had a GAF of 50, finding that \u201cit is totally inconsistent with the treatment records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. He further stated that the 30 June 2005 progress note indicated that Davis denied feelings of depression and was content with her treatment, yet Dr. Handal continued to find her GAF to be 50. <em>Id.; see id. </em>at 305. The ALJ also stated that Davis\u2019s treatment by Dr. Handal was sporadic, citing a statement made by Dr. LaCour that Davis had not seen Dr. Handal in months. <em>Id. </em>at 20; <em>see id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">First, as to Dr. Handal\u2019s progress note dated 10 September 2004, Dr. Handal noted, \u201cReportedly, patient is functioning fair. The patient is reportedly eating fair and sleeping fair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271. These statements were not Dr. Handal\u2019s assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>of how Davis was functioning, as asserted by the ALJ, but rather were Davis\u2019s own assessment of how she was functioning. Dr. Handal wrote under the section of the note titled \u201cAssessment,\u201d that Davis was \u201cmildly improved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, on the progress note dated 17 January 2005, Dr. Handal again noted, \u201cReportedly, patient is functioning fair. The patient is reportedly eating \u2018back and forth\u2019 and sleeping fair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296. He further quoted Davis\u2019s own statement that she was really unhappy and isolating herself from her family. <em>Id. </em>Again, while the ALJ stated that these statements reflected the findings of Dr. Handal, which contradicted his assessment that Davis\u2019s condition was worse, they were actually statements of Davis\u2019s own self-assessment. Dr. Handal noted that Davis reported to him that she had been crying a lot and was depressed, and that she had tried to go back to work but had quit. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Handal then noted his own assessment, which was that Davis was doing worse at the present time. <em>Id. </em>Third, Dr. Handal\u2019s progress note, dated 22 February 2005, states, \u201cReportedly, patient is functioning fair. The patient is reportedly eating good and sleeping fair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307. Again, this assessment was Davis\u2019s, not Dr. Handal\u2019s. Dr. Handal then noted that Davis reported that she had done well on Cymbalta, but that since the medication ran out, she had been crying and had not wanted to leave her house. Further, she reported that she had started a part-time job and that she was \u201cabsolutely miserable,\u201d \u201ctired of all this crap and doing this to my family.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Handal then noted his assessment that Davis was doing worse. <em>Id. </em>Fourth, the progress note dated 30 June 2005, stated, \u201cReportedly, patient is functioning fair. The patient is reportedly eating good and sleeping fair with the Trazodone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305. These statements were Davis\u2019s own assessment of her condition. Davis then reported that her mood was improved and that she had not suffered any panic attacks. She also reported that she had quit her part-time job because it was stressful, but that she felt trapped because she could not work. <em>Id. </em>Davis also denied feeling depressed or anxious. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Handal then gave his own assessment, which was that Davis was overall improved. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The ALJ misread the record evidence in finding that Dr. Handal repeatedly assessed Davis\u2019s ability to function as \u201cfair.\u201d Therefore, as far as the ALJ relied on this stated inconsistency in finding that Dr. Handal\u2019s opinion was not supported by the record, the ALJ\u2019s decision to give Dr. Handal\u2019s opinion \u201cno weight\u201d is not supported by substantial record evidence. The ALJ further found that Dr. Handal continued to give Davis a GAF of 50 even when his treatment notes revealed that he found she had improved, concluding that Dr. Handal\u2019s diagnosis was therefore unsupported by the record. However, as stated above, a GAF of 50 indicates either serious symptoms or serious impairments in social, occupational, or school functioning. Even when Dr. Handal assessed that Davis had shown improvement, his progress notes still contained evidence of Davis\u2019s serious impairments, and his diagnoses as to each of her impairments remained the same. <em>See id. </em>at 271-72. Moreover, just as Dr. Handal did not adjust Davis\u2019s diagnosis when she showed improvement, he did not adjust it when Davis\u2019s condition worsened, and Davis\u2019s condition routinely improved and worsened throughout the time she was seen by Dr. Handal. <em>See id. </em>at 271, 275, 277, 279, 281, 286, 296-97. Because Dr. Handal\u2019s diagnosis must be given considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary, and since his diagnosis is not contradicted by contrary findings and is consistent with his own assessments and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>progress notes, the substantial record evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision to give Dr. Handal\u2019s medical opinion \u201cno weight.\u201d <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">As to the ALJ\u2019s finding that Davis\u2019s treatment by Dr. Handal was sporadic, citing Dr. LaCour\u2019s statement on 6 December 2004 that Davis had not seen Dr. Handal in several months, the record evidence shows that Davis did not see Dr. Handal between 10 September 2004 and the 6 December 2004 statement by Dr. LaCour. However, the record also shows that in the three and one-half months between 20 May 2004 and 10 September 2004, Davis saw Dr. Handal on seven occasions. <em>See id. </em>at 271, 275, 277, 279, 281, 284. After 6 December 2004, Davis saw Dr. Handal on several more occasions. <em>See id. </em>at 296, 305, 307. The record therefore demonstrates that Davis underwent frequent treatment with Dr. Handal.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Furthermore, it should be noted that the ALJ gave \u201csignificant weight\u201d to the opinion of the consulting psychologist, Ghostley. <em>Id. </em>at 19. That opinion stated, in part, \u201c[m]emory for recent events was impaired ... [jjudgment with regard to social functioning, family relationships, finances, employment, and future plans was poor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. He further found that \u201cher ability to understand and remember instructions, as well as to respond appropriately to supervisors, co-workers, and work pressures in a work setting is impaired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Ghostley also found that a \u201cfavorable response to treatment is not expected within the next 6 to 12 months. As such, her prognosis is considered poor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>These findings, to which the ALJ gave significant weight, appear consistent with Dr. Handal\u2019s finding that Davis continued to have a GAF of 50, due to either serious symptoms or serious impairments in social, occupational, or school functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">Considering the longstanding relationship Davis had with Dr. LaCour, and the frequent treatment she underwent with Dr. Handal, as well as the facts that both Dr. LaCour\u2019s and Dr. Handal\u2019s medical opinions were bolstered by the evidence and that their medical records were overall consistent with their medical opinions, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for giving \u201cno weight\u201d to their opinions was not supported by substantial record evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">B. <em>Whether the ALJ erred by failing to properly consider Davis\u2019s subjective complaints and non-exertional impairments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">On appeal, Davis argues that the ALJ failed to evaluate her pain under the three-part \u201cpain standard.\u201d She asserts that the ALJ improperly discredited her subjective complaints of pain and did not consider whether her complaints stemmed from an underlying impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce such pain. Davis maintains that the ALJ\u2019s failure to properly evaluate her subjective complaints of pain led to his failure to give adequate consideration of the effect the exertional and non-exertional impairments had on her ability to work. Further, Davis contends that the ALJ failed to adequately articulate his reasons for finding her testimony not credible, because he relied solely on her response to one question in the questionnaire to make that finding. Finally, Davis argues that, since the ALJ failed to properly consider her subjective pain and its underlying source, the first hypothetical question he posed to the VE severely minimized the effects of her depression, memory loss, and pain. She asserts that because of this minimization, the VE found that she could perform some light work. Under the second hypothetical posed to the VE, in which the ALJ described severe problems with concentra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>tion, pain, and the need for much rest, as Davis testified she experienced, the VE stated that a person experiencing such problems would not be able to function at any job on a sustained basis. Davis contends that had the ALJ properly considered her physicians\u2019 opinions and her own testimony regarding pain and memory problems, Davis would have established her disability under the second hypothetical posed to the VE.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">A three-part \u201cpain standard\u201d applies when a claimant attempts to establish disability through his or her own testimony of pain or other subjective symptoms. The pain standard requires \u201c(1) evidence of an underlying medical condition; and (2) either (a) objective medical evidence confirming the severity of the alleged pain; or, (b) that the objectively determined medical condition can reasonably be expected to give rise to the claimed pain\u201d. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1225 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). A reversal is warranted if the ALJ\u2019s decision contains no evidence of the proper application of the three-part standard. <em>See Holt v. Sullivan, </em>921 F.2d 1221, 1223-24 (11th Cir. 1991) (per curiam). \u201cIf the ALJ decides not to credit a claimant\u2019s testimony as to her pain, he must articulate explicit and adequate reasons for doing so. Failure to articulate the reasons for discrediting subjective pain testimony requires, as a matter of law, that the testimony be accepted as true.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1561-62 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Where the ALJ improperly discredited claimant\u2019s subjective complaints, and thus failed to give adequate consideration to the effect the combination of claimant\u2019s exertional and non-exertional impairments had on her ability to work, the regulations require remand to the ALJ for reconsideration of claimant\u2019s residual functional capacity. <em>Swindle v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 222, 226 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam). When evaluating a claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms, the ALJ must consider such things as: (1) the claimant\u2019s daily activities; (2) the nature, location, onset, duration, frequency, radiation, and intensity of pain and other symptoms; (3) precipitating and aggravating factors; (4) adverse side-effects of medications, and (5) treatment or measures taken by the claimant for relief of symptoms. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3) (i)-(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">In this ease, the ALJ made specific reference to the pain standard, stating that he must consider all symptoms, including pain, and the extent to which these symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence based on the requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529, and Social Security Ruling 96-7p. R.Exhs. at 18. Further, the ALJ offered his reasoning as to why he found Davis not credible. <em>Id. </em>at 19. However, the reasons offered are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Here, the ALJ first determined that Davis\u2019s testimony of experiencing \u201csuch extreme limitations\u201d was not credible because he found her statement in the daily activities questionnaire, that she could care for her personal needs, was inconsistent with her testimony given one year later, that her husband or child sometimes had to wash her hair. <em>Id. </em>at 19. The ALJ also found Davis\u2019s testimony inconsistent and not credible because of several progress notes completed after her onset date which demonstrated improvement in her condition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">However, as noted above, the inconsistencies as reported by the ALJ are not supported by the record, and the ALJ must consider several factors when evaluating a claimant\u2019s subjective symptoms. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(3)(i)-(iv). Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>garding Davis\u2019s daily activities, Davis testified that the main cause of her inability to work is the pain she experiences. R.Exhs. at 321. She testified that her husband sometimes had to wash her hair because of the pain she experienced when she tried to do it herself. <em>Id. </em>at 324-25. She stated that she no longer cooks, unless she\u2019s having a particularly good day, that she sleeps often, and that her bad days outweighed her good. <em>Id. </em>at 323-28. She testified that the pain in her back, which travels down her legs, keeps her from sitting, crossing her legs, or standing for long periods of time. <em>Id. </em>at 322. On the questionnaire she completed on 6 April 2004, Davis stated that she had good days and bad days, and that the bad days prevented her from doing much more than lying in bed. <em>Id. </em>at 118. She stated that she sometimes cooks, and on a good day, she can perform light cleaning. <em>Id. </em>She stated that she no longer shops, pays the bills or balances the checkbook. She leaves the house only to go to the doctor, or to pick her daughter up from school. <em>Id. </em>at 118-20. Further, on a good day, she requires a break from any task after approximately a half-hour. <em>Id. </em>at 120. Accordingly, Davis\u2019s statements at the hearing were substantially the same as the answers she gave a year prior on the questionnaire, and the medical evidence supports those statements. Specifically, the medical evidence demonstrates that beginning in June 2003, Davis reported difficulty getting up from a seated position, because her hands, feet, and legs were aching. <em>Id. </em>at 176. By August 2003, Davis was only able to walk short distances. <em>Id. </em>at 258. In September 2003, Davis had increased pain in her neck and shoulders, and, in December 2003, Davis was experiencing a tingling pain down the back of her right leg and was given a handicap tag. <em>Id. </em>at 209-10. In February 2004, Dr. LaCour found that Davis\u2019s fibromyalgia continued to have debilitating symptoms, and that if her symptoms did not improve, he would approve her disability. <em>Id. </em>at 205. Finally, that same month, and again in March, Davis\u2019s physical therapist noted that Davis was experiencing much pain in her neck and shoulders, and that the pain was increasing. <em>Id. </em>at 237-38. This medical evidence supports Davis\u2019s statements, both within the questionnaire and at the hearing, that she was experiencing great pain that kept her from being able to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">As to the nature, location, onset, duration, frequency, radiation, and intensity of pain and other symptoms, Davis testified that she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in June 2003. <em>Id. </em>at 315. She stated that she is unable to work because of the pain she suffers in her arms and legs, and the pain from her back that goes into her legs. <em>Id. </em>at 321-22. She stated that the pain in her legs is so sensitive that her physical therapist cannot touch it. <em>Id. </em>at 322. She stated that the pain keeps her from being able to sit for even an hour at a time. <em>Id. </em>at 323. Davis\u2019s medical records show that as to intensity, Davis frequently rated her pain between a six and a ten on a scale of one to ten. <em>See id. </em>at 236-37, 241, 244, 254-55, 257, 259-60. Dr. LaCour\u2019s records show that over the nearly two years that he saw Davis, Davis repeatedly reported experiencing pain. On 14 different occasions, Dr. LaCour\u2019s progress notes mentioned Davis\u2019s pain, as well as his objective findings, noting, in part, \u201ctenderness,\u201d \u201csignificant tenderness,\u201d \u201cvery symptomatic,\u201d \u201cdebilitating\u201d and \u201cpain all over.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213, 209, 208, 205, 301. As to aggravating factors, Davis\u2019s physical therapist assessed that her myofascial pain (painful musculoskeletal condition) was aggravated by her increased work. <em>Id. </em>at 239. Dr. LaCour assessed that Davis\u2019s fibromyalgia continued to \u201chave significant tenderness since starting back to work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>His plan to address her pain was to release her from work for four weeks. <em>Id. </em>Regarding adverse side-effects from medications, Davis testified at her hearing that her medications caused severe memory problems and difficulty concentrating. <em>Id. </em>at 319. She stated in the questionnaire that she no longer performed certain household chores due to her inability to concentrate, and Davis\u2019s medical records show that she complained of memory and concentration problems to both Dr. Handal and Dr. LaCour. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 281, 291, 294. Dr. Handal recommended suspending her use of one medication in order to determine whether it was the cause of her memory problems. <em>Id. </em>at 282 Dr. Ghostley also noted Davis\u2019s memory problems. <em>Id. </em>at 217. Finally, regarding the measures taken by Davis to mitigate her symptoms, Davis testified that she took medications, attended physical therapy, took baths, and had her husband stretch her. <em>Id. </em>at 319. The record evidence shows that Davis consistently visited Dr. LaCour and Dr. Handal, that she took the medications prescribed her and adjusted them as recommended by her doctors, and that she attended physical therapy sessions. Again, the record evidence supports the statements made by Davis both at her hearing and within the questionnaire she completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">With this information as background, the ALJ had to consider the three-part \u201cpain standard.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225. As to the first prong, it is clear from the record, as the ALJ found, that Davis had underlying medical conditions. R.Exhs. at 17. The second prong requires either objective medical evidence that confirms the severity of the alleged pain arising from that condition, or that the objectively determined medical condition is of such severity that it can be reasonably expected to give rise to the alleged pain. <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1225. We have recognized that fibromyalgia can be disabling. <em>See Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1243 (stating that fibromyalgia was a severe impairment that could limit a claimant\u2019s ability to perform unlimited types of work at the sedentary level). The Ninth Circuit has described fibromyalgia as a \u201crheumatic disease that causes inflammation of the fibrous connective tissue components of muscles, tendons, ligaments, and other tissue. Common symptoms ... include chronic pain throughout the body, multiple tender points, fatigue, stiffness, and a pattern of sleep disturbance that can exacerbate the cycle of pain and fatigue associated with this disease.\u201d <em>Benecke v. Barnhart, </em>379 F.3d 587, 589-90 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Here, the record evidence, which consists of medical progress reports and physical therapist reports, Davis\u2019s subjective statements, and the assessments, objective findings, and recommendations of Davis\u2019s doctors, supports Davis\u2019s testimony as to her pain. The ALJ\u2019s reasons for discrediting Davis\u2019s testimony, that she was inconsistent and that progress notes demonstrated improvement in her conditions, are not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s reasons for discrediting the opinions of Davis\u2019s treating physicians as well as Davis\u2019s testimony as to her pain are not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND for further considerations in accordance with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
