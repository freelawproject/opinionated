Armant, Louisiana prisoner # 150261, filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint against Richard L. Stalder, the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections; C.M. Lensing, the Warden of Elayn Hunt Correctional Center; Robert Abel, the Assistant Warden; Dr. Michael Hegmann; and Dr. Theodore Irra. Armant alleged that Dr. Irra was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs by modifying his medical duty status,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that Stalder, Lensing, Abel, and Hegmann were aware of his administrative grievance concerning the modification of his duty status but failed to investigate Armant\u2019s complaint and grant him relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations as to all the defendants, first dismissing with prejudice Armant\u2019s claims against Stalder, Lensing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Abel, and Hegmann for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), and then granting summary judgment in favor of Dr. Irra. Armant appeals both of these orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">A prison official\u2019s deliberate indifference to an inmate\u2019s serious medical needs -violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). \u201cA prison official acts with deliberate indifference \u2018only if ... he knows that the inmate faces a substantial risk of serious bodily harm and ... he disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). \u201c[I]f a prison official assign[s] an inmate to work detail ... knowing] that such an assignment could exacerbate a serious physical ailment, then such a decision could constitute deliberate indifference\u201d in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 194 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We first address the district court\u2019s dismissal of Armant\u2019s claims against Stalder, Lensing, Abel, and Hegmann. We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim. <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). Dismissal is proper if, assuming all pleaded facts are true, \u201cthe plaintiff fails to allege any set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., </em>296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir.2002). We must liberally construe the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. </em>Although we hold <em>pro se </em>complaints to less stringent standards, conclusory allegations or legal conclusions are insufficient to prevent a motion to dismiss. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">We hold that Armant has failed to show that the district court erred in dismissing his complaints against Stalder, Lensing, Abel, and Hegmann. In his brief, Armant does not point to any factual allegations of his complaint that establish the personal involvement of these defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States ex rel. Farmer v. City of Houston, </em>523 F.3d 333, 345 (5th Cir.2008) (noting that this court is not required to search the record to find a legal and factual basis for an issue). Armant has not suggested that Stalder, Lensing, Abel, and Hegmann were responsible in any manner for the creation or implementation of any prison policy that was \u201cthe moving force of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>See Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 304 (5th Cir.1987) (\u201cSupervisory liability exists even without overt personal participation in the offensive act if supervisory officials implement a policy so deficient that the policy \u2018itself is a repudiation of constitutional rights and is the moving force of a constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Grandstaff <em>v. City of Borger, </em>767 F.2d 161, 169 (5th Cir.1985))). Thus, Armant\u2019s claim fails to raise a constitutional issue. <em>See Hernandez v. Estelle, </em>788 F.2d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir.1986). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Armant\u2019s claims against Stalder, Lensing, Abel, and Hegmann.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">Turning to Armant\u2019s claims against Dr. Irra, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>grant of summary judgment. <em>Hannah v. United States, </em>523 F.3d 597, 601 (5th Cir. 2008). Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and affidavits show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Hannah, </em>523 F.3d at 601. Once the moving party satisfies its initial burden of demonstrating that no material fact issue exists, the burden shifts to the nonmovant. <em>Forsyth v. Barr, </em>19 F.3d 1527, 1533 (5th Cir.1994). The nonmovant must point to specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); <em>Forsyth, </em>19 F.3d at 1533. This court draws all inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Hannah, </em>523 F.3d at 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">We agree with Armant that the district court erred when it granted summary judgment in favor of Dr. Irra. At the time of summary judgment, the district court had evidence from the Commissioner\u2019s prior proceeding calling into question the constitutionality of Armant\u2019s modified duty status. Specifically, Armant presented the district court with: (1) the Commissioner\u2019s recounting of Dr. David Morrill\u2019s testimony that he could discern \u201cno objective findings\u201d or reasons in the medical records as to why Armant\u2019s duty status was modified; (2) the Commissioner\u2019s holding that the decision to remove Armant\u2019s duty status restrictions was \u201carbitrary, manifestly erroneous, and bordered on a violation of cruel and unusual punishment;\u201d and (3) the state court judgment adopting the Commissioner\u2019s Report. This evidence was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgment in favor of Dr. Irra.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Armant\u2019s claims against Stalder, Lensing, Abel, and Hegmann. The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Dr. Irra is reversed, and Armant\u2019s claim as it pertains to Dr. Irra is remanded for further proceedings. We express no opinion on the ultimate outcome of those proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-13\">. A \"duty status\u201d is a written designation assigned by a prison medical doctor indicating an inmate's physical or mental ability to perform hard labor in accordance with his sentence. Duty statuses are generally assigned by physicians following a medical evaluation, and they are subject to change depending on changes in the medical condition of a particular inmate. Duty statuses may range from no duty (indicating a need for bed rest), to light duty or regular duty with restrictions, and finally to regular duty without restrictions (indicating the inmate is capable of performing any and all hard labor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">. In Armant's original complaint, he alleged that Stalder, Lensing, Abel, and Hegmann violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment when they were aware of but chose to ignore the improper modification of his duty status. On appeal, Armant raises as an issue that \"defendants\" violated his Eighth Amendment rights, but he never mentions by name Stalder, Lensing, or Abel in those sections, and he only briefly discusses Hegmann\u2019s review of his medical status.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
