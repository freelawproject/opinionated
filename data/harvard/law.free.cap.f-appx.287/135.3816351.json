Jones, United States District Judge. On February 9, 2007, Weigart pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). On June 1, 2007, Judge Jones sentenced Weigart to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, two years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Weigart\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that Judge Jones erred in denying her a two-level downward adjustment for a minor role. Weigart asserts that she should have been granted the adjustment because she was the least culpable participant in the money laundering conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, a standard which \u201cdoes not entail the substitution of our judgment for that of the sentencing judge. Rather, the standard is akin to review for abuse of discretion.\u201d Un<em>ited States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.2006). In determining \u201cwhether a sentence is reasonable, [the Court] ought to consider whether the sentencing judge \u2018exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion[,] ... committed an error of law ... or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir.2005)). Further, \u201cthe abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions \u2014 whether inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">A defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a minor role adjustment under Section 3B1.2 of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Yu, </em>285 F.3d 192, 200 (2d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Castano, </em>234 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000). A district judge\u2019s analysis of the defendant\u2019s role in criminal activity is \u201c \u2018highly fact-specific and depends upon the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to other participants, the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture, and the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d 230, 234 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Shonubi, </em>998 F.2d 84, 90 (2d Cir.1993)). A minor role reduction \u201c \u2018will not be available simply because the defendant played a lesser role than his co-conspirators; to be eligible for a reduction, the defendant\u2019s conduct must be \u2018minor\u2019 ... as compared to the average participant in such a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235 (quoting <em>United States v. Rahman, </em>189 F.3d 88, 159 (2d Cir.1999)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">Weigart has failed to establish that her co-conspirators were more deeply involved in the money laundering conspiracy. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Judge Jones noted, Weigart had a close relationship to her co-conspirators \u2014 her nephew and her husband \u2014 and was undoubtedly a trusted member of the conspiracy, having been made responsible for safeguarding almost $400,000 in cash over a lengthy trip from the Bronx to Texas. Furthermore, even assuming that Weigart established that she had a lesser role than her co-conspirators, it does not follow that Judge Jones\u2019s denial of her minor role application was error. <em>See Castano, </em>234 F.3d at 113 (\u201cWe have held that a defendant may not receive a minor role adjustment solely because she \u2018played a lesser role than [her] co-conspirators; to be eligible for a reduction, the defendant\u2019s conduct must be minor ... as compared to the average participant in such a crime.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Rahman, </em>189 F.3d at 159). In sum, Weigart offers no persuasive evidence that a minor role reduction was warranted. Although she takes issue with the weight afforded by the district court to various undisputed facts, the decision of whether to grant a minor role adjustment \u201cis inherently fact-bound and largely committed to the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Bush, </em>352 F.3d 1177, 1184-85 (8th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Caballero, </em>936 F.2d 1292 (D.C.Cir.1991)). While alternative inferences may have been available from the facts before the district court, the inferences drawn by the court did not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Weigart\u2019s contention that the district court erred in using factors that warranted an increase in her base offense level as a reason to deny her minor role application lacks merit. Such double consideration is \u201clegitimate where a single act is relevant to two dimensions of the Guidelines analysis,\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>967 F.2d 20, 25 (2d Cir.1992), and Judge 20 Jones\u2019s consideration of the sum of drug money transported by Weigart was relevant to the role 21 W\u00e9igart played in the offense in addition to its relevance to setting the applicable base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Weigart\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>246 F.Supp.2d 263 (S.D.N.Y.2002) and <em>United States v. Perez, </em>321 F.Supp.2d 574 (S.D.N.Y.2003) is misplaced. In <em>Ruiz </em>and <em>Perez, </em>the respective defendants faced strikingly divergent potential sentences as a result of the interplay of the 10-year statutory minimum for drug offenses involving a certain quantity, the safety valve relief provisions that apply to some first-time drug offenders, the applicable Sentencing Guidelines, and the \u00a7 3B1.2 mitigating role provision which, if applied, would have capped the offense level at 30. <em>See Perez, </em>321 F.Supp.2d at 584; <em>Ruiz, </em>246 F.Supp.2d at 265. In both cases, the district court justified its decision to grant a minor role adjustment by citing the extensive and complex nature of the drug organizations involved, and the relatively low level occupied by each defendant within the organization. <em>See Perez, </em>321 F.Supp.2d at 586; <em>Ruiz, </em>246 F.Supp.2d at 269. The concerns driving <em>Perez </em>and <em>Ruiz </em>are not implicated here; Weigart knew that her actions were part of a larger scheme, and the expansive and compartmentalized organization present in <em>Perez </em>and <em>Ruiz </em>did not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\">. Although the law of this Circuit is inconsistent with respect to whether mitigating role adjustments are reviewed <em>de novo </em>or for clear error, <em>see United States v. Burgos, </em>324 F.3d 88, 91 &amp; n. 2 (2d Cir.2003), we need not decide this issue because the district court's determination that Weigart failed to meet her burden of establishing entitlement to a minor role adjustment was correct under either standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
