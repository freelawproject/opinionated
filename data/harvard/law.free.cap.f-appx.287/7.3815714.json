Ibeagwa claims that he was persecuted and severely harmed by the Nigerian government for his participation in the Ijaw Youth Council, a dissident political group operating in the Niger River Delta region of Nigeria. The BIA affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) determination that Ibeagwa was not credible, and had failed to provide corroborating evidence of his identity as the son of a prominent local chief in the village of Odi. On appeal, Ibeagwa raises several statutory interpretation issues regarding the REAL ID Act. He also challenges the denial of his request for CAT relief. We deny the petition on all grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-18\">Ibeagwa was found removable on multiple grounds, but the IJ specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>declined to find that Ibeagwa\u2019s conviction for violating California Penal Code \u00a7 487(a) (grand theft) constituted an aggravated felony in light of <em>Penuliar v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1037 (9th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Subsequent to that decision, however, the Supreme Court vacated <em>Penuliar </em>in light of <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007). <em>See Gonzales v. Penuliar, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1146, 166 L.Ed.2d 992 (2007). Contrary to Ibeagwa\u2019s argument that we cannot overturn a \u201cfinding\u201d made by the IJ, it is within our jurisdiction to determine whether, as a matter of law, under <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>the conviction counts as an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Ibeagwa argues further that <em>Duenas-Alvarez </em>does not address his situation because it did not address the distinction between principal- and accessory-based liability for generic theft offenses and left open the question \u201cwhether the possibility of being convicted under [California Vehicle Code] section 10851(a) as an accessory after the fact renders the statute categorically broader than the generic theft offense.\u201d <em>See United States v. Vidal, </em>504 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc). Section 10851(a), however, is a vehicular theft statute that unlike \u00a7 487(a), \u201cexpressly extends to one who is an \u2018accessory to ... the driving or unauthorized taking or stealing,\u2019 \u201d thereby establishing a \u201crealistic probability\u201d that California \u201c \u2018would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a theft offense.\u201d <em>Vidal, </em>504 F.3d at 1082 (quoting <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 822). <em>Compare </em>Cal.Vehicle Code \u00a7 10851(a) <em>and </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 487(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Indeed, <em>Vidal </em>distinguishes its holding from a case featuring a statute that is similar to \u00a7 487(a). <em>See Vidal, </em>504 F.3d at 1082 n. 18 (citing <em>United States v. Gomez-Mendez, </em>486 F.3d 599, 604-05 (9th Cir. 2007)). As we explained in <em>Vidal, </em>the defendant in <em>Gomez-Mendez </em>could not have been convicted as an accessory after the fact to statutory rape because he was only charged under California Penal Code \u00a7 261.5, which \u201cunlike Vehicle Code section 10851(a) <em>does not expressly include accessory-after-the-fact liability within the statutory offense.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Here, like <em>Gomez-Mendez </em>but unlike <em>Vidal, </em>the grand theft statute does not expressly include accessory-after-the-fact liability within the statutory offense, and so, we conclude that Ibeagwa\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 487(a) was for an aggravated felony, thereby limiting our jurisdiction only to reviewing questions of law and constitutional claims. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), 1252(a)(2)(d); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 648 (9th Cir. 2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">Ibeagwa makes several statutory arguments that the government claims were not properly exhausted before the BIA. Though there is no question that Ibeagwa, who proceeded <em>pro se </em>below but is now represented by counsel, has refined his legal claims on appeal, we disagree with the government\u2019s narrow view of the exhaustion doctrine. Although far from a perfect and refined recitation, Ibeagwa sufficiently raised his arguments before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-11\">Upon reviewing Ibeagwa\u2019s statutory arguments, however, we conclude that he is not entitled to relief. Ibeagwa first argues that the IJ and BIA erred in apply<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ing the REAL ID Act to his application, which was apparently signed on May 12, 2005 and time-stamped by the INS on June 1, 2005. The REAL ID Act applies only to \u201capplications for asylum, withholding, or other relief from removal made on or after [May 11, 2005].\u201d Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005), \u00a7 101(h)(2). Ibeagwa claims that he only applied on June 1, 2005 because he relied on the IJ\u2019s May 5, 2005 instructions not to mail the application but to submit it at the June 1 hearing. In any case, he claims his application should be considered timely because he \u201cmade\u201d it at his initial hearing by declaring his intent to apply for asylum, which is sufficient in light of the statute\u2019s distinguishing between \u201cma[king]\u201d and \u201cfiling\u201d applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The BIA does not distinguish between the terms \u201cmade\u201d and \u201cfiled\u201d as referenced in the REAL ID Act. <em>See generally Matter of S-B, </em>241 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 42 (BIA 2006). In addition, the cases upon which Ibeagwa relies are not on point and therefore do not counsel a different conclusion. Finally, the Code of Federal Regulations makes it clear that an asylum application is not \u201cmade\u201d or considered complete until the applicant files a completed Form I-589, Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.3(a), 1208.3(c)(3). In sum, the IJ and BIA did not err in applying the REAL ID Act to Ibeagwa\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Ibeagwa next argues that the IJ and BIA considered some irrelevant factors in application of the REAL ID Act\u2019s adverse credibility criteria. However, the IJ\u2019s consideration of some irrelevant factors ultimately has no bearing on the outcome of Ibeagwa\u2019s petition because under either the pre- or post-REAL ID Act regime, so long as one of the identified grounds underlying a negative credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence, we are bound to accept the negative credibility finding. <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004) (affirming negative credibility finding even though some of the factors were factually unsupported or irrelevant).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Here there is more than one relevant ground. These include (1) Ibeagwa\u2019s convictions for grand theft of personal property and forgery, <em>see Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, </em>416 F.3d 931 (9th Cir.2005); (2) discrepancies regarding the date on which Ibeagwa\u2019s passport was allegedly issued; (3) Ibeagwa\u2019s failure to provide the name of his initial employer in the United States; and (4) Ibeagwa\u2019s inability to recall the alleged date of release from detention despite his specific testimony about other aspects of his claim, including dates, that was otherwise verbatim with Ibeagwa\u2019s written declaration. These all are appropriate considerations, particularly in light of REAL ID Act\u2019s eradication of the \u201cheart of the claim\u201d requirement. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(l)(B)(iii) (adverse credibility findings can be based on inconsistencies], inaccuracies] or falsehood[s], \u201cwithout regard to\u201d whether they \u201cgo [] to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Ibeagwa also takes issue with the conclusion that he failed to provide corroborating evidence of his testimony. He claims that the IJ ultimately held the lack of corroboration against him despite the fact that from the outset, the IJ had indicated that this was the government\u2019 burden to carry. Second, Ibeagwa asserts that the IJ and BIA erred by holding that he should have produced his wife to testify even though he was never requested to do so. And finally, he argues that they erred in concluding that verification of his identity from a fellow resident of the village of Odi, was \u201creasonably available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Though over the course of the several months of continued proceedings the IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>made it clear that he expected the government to investigate and produce evidence to rebut Ibeagwa\u2019s testimony regarding his identity, under the statute the burden remained on Ibeagwa. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(i), 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii). The IJ also put Ibeagwa on notice of this responsibility, pointedly telling him at the September 6, 2005 hearing, \u201c[t]his is something that should be able to be verified by you. I\u2019m letting you know that I need cooperative [sic.] evidence of your claim, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">In addition, Ibeagwa fails to recognize a distinction separating his case from the cases upon which he relies, in which the IJ <em>bases the adverse credibility finding itself </em>on a lack of corroborating evidence. <em>See Sidhu v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1085, 1091 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[W]here an applicant produces credible corroborating evidence to buttress an aspect of his own testimony, an IJ may not base <em>an adverse credibility determination </em>on the applicant\u2019s failure to produce additional evidence that would further support that particular claim.\u201d) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted); <em>Zi Lin Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 611, 620-21 (9th Cir. 2004). Such was not the case here. Ibeagwa failed to meet his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Finally, Ibeagwa also appeals the BIA\u2019s rejection of his CAT claim. First, he argues that the BIA erred by not addressing his CAT claim, but this claim is not substantiated by the record; the BIA opinion clearly affirms, albeit summarily, the IJ\u2019s conclusion with respect to the CAT claim. Second, Ibeagwa claims that the IJ and BIA let the analysis of the withholding of removal claim \u201cwash over\u201d into the analysis of Ibeagwa\u2019s petition for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">We recognize that \u201cthe standards for the two bases of relief are distinct and should not be conflated.\u201d <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156-57 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1282-83 (9th Cir.2001) (remanding for reconsideration of a CAT claim where the BIA relied unduly on its prior adverse credibility determination and failed to consider relevant country conditions in the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">Here, however, the IJ did not conflate the standards, but rather, separately considered the CAT claim under the appropriate standard. In addition, the adverse inference against Ibeagwa\u2019s credibility is far more damning than most cases in that the IJ did not believe Ibeagwa is who he claims to be. Thus, unlike other adverse credibility determinations that might not affect an IJ\u2019s separate weighing of other evidence related to CAT claims, here a more searching review of the documentation could have not benefitted Ibeagwa because the IJ did not believe that this information pertained to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b28-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\">. Though Ibeagwa appears to concede in his reply brief that our jurisdiction is limited to reviewing only constitutional claims and questions of law, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), his arguments nonetheless exceed this limited scope of review, and so, we initially address his argument that his conviction was not for an aggravated felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
