Wang contends that he has a subjectively and objectively well-founded fear of future persecution in China based on (1) his being present during two police raids of the underground church he attended; (2) his mother having been arrested twice for attending the same church; (3) conditions noted in the Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in China for 2003 and in the June 2004 Department of State Profile of Asylum Claims and Country Conditions for China; and (4) his continued church attendance in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Before proceeding to the merits of Wang\u2019s petition, we must determine whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to review the petition. <em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1252 (11th Cir.2006). We make this determination de novo. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). We may review the final order of removal in this case only if Wang has \u201c \u2018exhausted all administrative remedies available to [him] as of right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2003) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1)). This means that he presented to the BIA the claims that he asks us to review. In other words, we lack subject matter jurisdiction to review claims that he failed to raise before the BIA. Id., at 1323.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">In appealing to the BIA, the only issue Wang presented in his brief was: \u201cDid the Immigration Judge err in finding that the respondent failed to credibly demonstrate that he suffered past persecution.\u201d His brief concluded with the request that the IJ\u2019s \u201cdecision not to grant asylum be reversed.\u201d The BIA assumed, contrary to the IJ\u2019s finding, that Wang\u2019s testimony was credible, but found that Wang had failed to prove entitlement to asylum and therefore dismissed his appeal. We lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider Wang\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to those claims. As indicated above, he presented no argument in support of those claims to the BIA; his sole contention was that IJ erred in denying his application for asylum on the ground that his testimony was not credible. He similarly failed to exhaust his claim that he possesses a well-founded fear of future persecution (irrespective of past persecution), and that a pattern or practice of persecution of similarly-situated persons exists in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
