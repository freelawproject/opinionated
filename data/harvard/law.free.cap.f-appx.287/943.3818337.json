Mar. 27, 2006). The BIA\u2019s decision affirmed the decision of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Gabriel Videla denying Almonte\u2019s petition. <em>In re Almonte, </em>No. A40-072-522 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 13, 2004) (\u201cIJ Decision\u201d). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues raised in this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">In his petition, Almonte raises three challenges to the agency\u2019s decision: (1) He contends that the IJ used the wrong legal standard to determine whether to exercise his discretion to grant a waiver; (2) he contends that the IJ erroneously found that he committed two crimes after he was found inadmissible at the airport in October 2000, when, in fact, he had committed only one; and (3) he contends that the BIA should have issued an opinion rather than affirming without one.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">We lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) to review final orders of removal against aliens deemed removable because of prior criminal convictions, and under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) to review purely discretionary decisions by the Attorney General, \u201csubject to the exception set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), which restores our jurisdiction to review \u2018constitutional claims or questions of law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Khan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 31, 34 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">We may not assert jurisdiction based solely on the ability of an alien to frame his argument as though it were a constitutional claim or question of law. We must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATT\">study the arguments asserted ... to determine, regardless of the rhetoric employed in the petition, whether it merely quarrels over the correctness of the factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices, in which case the court would lack jurisdiction, or whether it instead raises a \u201cconstitutional claim\u201d or \u201cquestion of law,\u201d in which case the court could exercise jurisdiction to review those particular issues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-15\"><em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">Almonte does not contest that he is removable because of his 1992 attempted robbery conviction, which triggers the jurisdiction-stripping provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). And the agency\u2019s decision to deny a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility is a discretionary decision that we also lack jurisdiction to review under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). <em>See Avendano-Espejo v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir.2006). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Thus, unless Almonte raises a \u201cconstitutional claim[] or question[] of law,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), we must dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">As to the first issue raised in his petition, Almonte argues that the IJ erred as a matter of law by treating \u201cunusual or outstanding equities\u201d as a threshold showing that he must satisfy in order to merit the section 212(c) waiver, rather than, as the BIA later made clear in <em>Matter of Edwards, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 191, 196 n. 3 (B.I.A.1990), the kind of showing required only if the negative factors relating to an alien\u2019s application are very serious. In <em>Khan, </em>we determined that, following <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>we did have jurisdiction to review the petitioner\u2019s argument that the IJ \u201cimproperly imposed a heightened legal standard by requiring that [the petitioner] demonstrate \u2018unusual or outstanding equities\u2019 that would overcome the seriousness of his prior convictions\u201d because the argument raised a question of law. <em>Khan, </em>495 F.3d at 35. Almonte argues that the IJ made the same error alleged by the petitioner in <em>Khan; </em>therefore, under <em>Khan </em>and <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>we have jurisdiction to review this alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">In considering whether to exercise its discretion to grant a petitioner\u2019s request for a section 212(c) waiver of inadmissibility, an IJ must \u201cbalanc[e] ... the social and humane considerations presented in an alien\u2019s favor against the adverse factors evidencing his undesirability as a permanent resident.\u201d <em>Matter of Edwards, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 195. \u201c[A]s the negative factors grow more serious, it becomes incumbent upon the alien to introduce additional offsetting favorable evidence, which in some cases may have to involve unusual or outstanding equities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Matter of Buscemi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 628 (B.I.A. 1988), the BIA had stated that \u201can alien who demonstrates unusual or outstanding equities, as required, merely satisfies the threshold test for having a favorable exercise of discretion considered in his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634. In <em>Matter of Edwards, </em>the BIA noted that its statement in <em>Matter of Buscemi </em>could be \u201cmisleading, as it might be read to imply that a full examination of an alien\u2019s equities can somehow be pretermitted.\u201d 20 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 196 n. 3. To the contrary, the BIA said, \u201ca proper determination as to whether an alien has demonstrated unusual or outstanding equities can only be made after a complete review of the favorable factors in his case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">Here, although the IJ did cite the \u201cmisleading\u201d language from <em>Matter of Buscemi, </em>it appears from the record that in fact he applied the proper standard from <em>Matter of Edwards, </em>reviewing and balancing all the relevant factors in Almonte\u2019s case. We conclude, therefore, that the IJ did not err as a matter of law in weighing the equities in Almonte\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">As to the second issue Almonte raises, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review his contention that the IJ erroneously found that he had committed two crimes after he was found inadmissible at the airport, rather than one. In <em>Khan </em>we held that the IJ\u2019s \u201cunambiguous misstatement\u201d of the record \u2014 in that case, asserting that the petitioner had multiple drug convictions rather than a single drug conviction with multiple counts \u2014 presented a question of law because the IJ\u2019s \u201cfact-finding [was] \u2018flawed by an error of law.\u2019 \u201d 495 F.3d at 36 (quoting <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329). The IJ in this case did not unambiguously state that Almonte had committed two crimes after he was found inadmissible at the airport; at all times the IJ correctly referenced the relevant dates of conviction. Because Almonte does not point to any \u201cunambiguous misstatement of pertinent facts in the record,\u201d <em>id., </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>lack jurisdiction to review his contention that the IJ erred in his consideration of Almonte\u2019s criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Finally, Almonte argues that the BIA\u2019s decision to decide his appeal without opinion was a violation of his due process rights. Looking to determine whether he is making what may be properly characterized as a constitutional claim, we conclude that the substance of his contention is no more than that the BIA failed to comply with its own regulations in handling his claims on appeal. That alone would not be a constitutional violation, and we are without jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision in this regard. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. Having completed our review, we deny Almonte\u2019s motion for a stay of removal as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
