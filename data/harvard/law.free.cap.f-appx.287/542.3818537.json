Henderson, </em>855 F.2d 536, 541 (8th Cir.1988) (there is no statutory or constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in civil case). We also decline to address claims that he raises for the first time on appeal. <em>See Poolman v. City of Grafton, </em>487 F.3d 1098, 1101 (8th Cir.2007) (declining to consider claim raised for first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-21\">Regarding Carter\u2019s claim of a civil rights violation, we have carefully reviewed the record and considered Carter\u2019s arguments on appeal, and we conclude that summary judgment was appropriately granted. <em>See Johnson v. Hamilton, </em>452 F.3d 967, 971-72 (8th Cir.2006) (de novo standard of review). We also agree with the district court that Carter\u2019s negligence and medical malpractice claims are not cognizable under section 1983, <em>see Alberson v. Norris, 458 </em>F.3d 762, 765 (8th Cir.2006); <em>Dulany v. Carnahan, </em>132 F.3d 1234, 1239 (8th Cir.1997), and we find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these state-law claims, <em>see Johnson v. City of Shorewood, </em>360 F.3d 810, 819 (8th Cir.2004). However, we modify the judgment to clarify that the dismissal of Carter\u2019s state-law claims was without prejudice, <em>see Labickas v. Ark. State Univ., </em>78 F.3d 333, 334-35 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam), and we affirm the judgment as modified, see 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-18\">.
