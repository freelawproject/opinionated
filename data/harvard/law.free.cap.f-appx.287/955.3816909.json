A98 420 358/359 (B.I.A. Oct. 31, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-23\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen and reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-24\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen and reconsider. Much of the Petitioners\u2019 brief to this Court is devoted to challenging the IJ\u2019s underlying denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. These arguments, albeit in more conclusory form, reiterate those raised in Bong\u2019s prior petition for review challenging the BIA\u2019s July 2006 affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Fui Ha Bong v. Gonzales, </em>236 Fed.Appx. 710 (2d Cir.2007). In this Court\u2019s summary order resolving that petition, we decided that both the IJ\u2019s past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>persecution and well-founded fear findings were supported by substantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 711-12. That decision remains the law of the case. <em>See U.S. v. Quintieri, </em>306 F.3d 1217, 1225 (2d Cir.2002). We will not revisit Petitioners\u2019 assertions.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">In any event, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen and reconsider as untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3)(ii). The motion was filed on September 10, 2007, more than ninety days after September 1, 2006, when the BIA\u2019s July 2006 order became final. Thus, whether construed as a motion to reopen or reconsider, it was untimely. Because there is no exception to the time limitation for motions to reconsider, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), the BIA\u2019s proper finding that Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider was untimely is dispositive of their motion to reconsider. To the extent the BIA nonetheless considered their arguments, it properly found that they failed to \u201cspecify any error of fact or law\u201d where their motion essentially reargued their merits appeal. <em>See Matter of O-S-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to the extent it construed it as a motion to reopen. As the BIA noted, the Petitioners failed to present any new or previously unavailable evidence in support of their motion. In the absence of such evidentiary support, the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 90; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
