The district court dismissed the complaint because Thomas already initiated state-court proceedings seeking benefits from Johnson Controls. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment but not its reasoning inasmuch as it grounded the dismissal on <em>Colorado River </em>abstention when it should have invoked its Declaratory-Judgment-Act discretion. <em>See Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., </em>515 U.S. 277, 286, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995) (holding that <em>Colorado River </em>ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>stention is inapplicable to actions requesting declaratory relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">It suffices for disposition of this appeal to say that the district court acted well within its discretion in declining to decide this issue of an employee\u2019s right to state workers\u2019 compensation benefits. <em>See id.; see also Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Flowers, </em>513 F.3d 546, 554 (6th Cir.2008). Such a case has no business in federal court, particularly after the state court has reached a decision inconsistent with the requested federal relief. Johnson Controls cited not one example of a federal court entertaining the merits of a state workers\u2019 compensation claim. And when confronted at oral argument with the frivolous nature of this case \u2014 and worse yet, this appeal \u2014 appellant\u2019s counsel failed to offer any tenable justification, even when given the opportunity to defend against <em>sua sponte </em>sanctions with a post-argument brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
