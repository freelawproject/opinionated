Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d (JA. 11) The district court construed this motion as a motion seeking relief from judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), and denied the motion on the grounds that an unpublished, February 3, 2005 order of the Sixth Circuit had already denied identical claims to those raised in Petitioner\u2019s motion. Because Petitioner has not sought a certificate of appealability from the district court, this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the present appeal. Accordingly, we DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">On June 1, 1990, Petitioner was convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. He was eventually sentenced to 360 months incarceration for this crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">Early in his incarceration, on December 29, 1992, Petitioner sent a letter to the district court asking that his federal sentence run concurrently with a five and one-half year sentence that he had previously received in Michigan state court. In a May 14, 1993 order, the district court construed Petitioner\u2019s letter as a habeas petition brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, and granted the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">On April 23, 1997, Petitioner filed an additional motion in the district court, styled as a \u201cMotion to Vacate Conviction and/or Sentence Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d (J.A. 31) The district court deemed this motion to be a second or successive habeas petition, and transferred the motion to this Court. This Court agreed with the district court\u2019s characterization of Petitioner\u2019s motion, and declined to certify Petitioner\u2019s second or successive habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-20\">Between 2001 and 2003, Petitioner sought permission to file three additional habeas petitions, and this Court denied him permission in each instance. On December 15, 2003, however, the Supreme Court decided <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), which held that \u201cwhen a court re-characterizes a pro se litigant\u2019s motion as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>first \u00a7 2255 motion ... the district court must notify the pro se litigant that it intends to recharacterize the pleading, warn the litigant that this recharacterization means that any subsequent \u00a7 2255 motion will be subject to the restrictions on \u2018second or successive\u2019 motions, and provide the litigant an opportunity to withdraw the motion or to amend it so that it contains all the \u00a7 2255 claims he believes he has.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 124 S.Ct. 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">This time represented by counsel, Petitioner filed yet another motion for habeas relief on August 11, 2004. In this motion, Petitioner argued that it should be construed as a first habeas petition because, under <em>Castro, </em>the district court \u201cerred in construing Wilson\u2019s 1992 letter as a \u00a7 2255 motion because the warnings enunciated in the <em>Castro </em>decision were not issued to Wilson by the Court.\u201d (J.A. 43) Accordingly, Petitioner requested that the district court resolve the claims originally raised in his April 23, 1997 habeas petition, in addition to two additional claims raised for the first tim\u00e9 in the new motion. <em>Castro </em>notwithstanding, the district court construed Petitioner\u2019s motion as a second or successive habeas petition, and transferred the motion to this Court to allow Petitioner to seek permission to pursue his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In an unsigned, February 3, 2005 order, this Court agreed with the district court that Petitioner\u2019s August 11, 2004 motion was a second or successive habeas petition, and denied Petitioner leave to pursue his habeas claims. The order, however, made no mention of <em>Castro, </em>and it is not immediately apparent from the facial language of the order whether the panel considered Petitioner\u2019s <em>Castro </em>claim before denying him leave to file a habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On March 4, 2005, Petitioner filed, in the district court, the <em>pro se </em>motion which is now before this Court. In this motion, which Petitioner styled as a motion \u201cfor relief from judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Rule 60(b)(6),\u201d Petitioner argues that \u201c[i]n light of <em>Castro, </em>this Court erred in construing Mr. Wilson\u2019s 1992 letter as a \u00a7 2255 motion because the warnings enunciated in <em>Castro </em>decision [sic] were not issued to Wilson by this Court.\u201d (J.A. 15) Accordingly, the motion asks the district court to reconsider its initial order construing Petitioner\u2019s 1997 filing as a second or successive habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The district court construed Petitioner\u2019s motion as a motion seeking relief from a district court judgment pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b). In denying such relief to Petitioner, the district court noted that the arguments presented in Petitioner\u2019s latest motion, including his argument that, under <em>Castro, </em>he is entitled to have his 1992 letter reclassified as something other than a \u00a7 2255 habeas petition, were considered by the Sixth Circuit and rejected in this Court\u2019s February 3, 2005 order. Accordingly, the district court held that so long as the February 3, 2005 order stands, a lower court is powerless to grant the relief requested in Petitioner\u2019s latest motion. Petitioner now appeals that determination to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">As a threshold matter, it is unclear just how we should construe the motion at issue in this appeal, and the question of how the motion is construed will necessarily impact any analysis of how the motion should be disposed of. Petitioner styles his <em>pro se </em>motion as seeking \u201crelief from judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Rule 60(b)(6),\u201d and the district court accordingly construed the motion as seeking relief under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Rule 60(b) permits a district court to \u201crelieve a party or its legal representative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>from a final judgment, order, or proceeding\u201d for any of six reasons, including \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect\u201d and \u201cany other reason that justifies relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(6). In his motion, Petitioner claims that the district court was \u201cin error\u201d when it construed his April 23, 1997 motion as a second or successive habeas petition, and requests that the district court reconsider this decision in light of <em>Castro. </em>Noting that Petitioner had already raised his <em>Castro </em>claim in the Sixth Circuit, and that we rejected that claim, the district court held that it was powerless to second guess a decision of the Sixth Circuit, and denied Petitioner\u2019s request. (J.A. 32-33)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In a letter filed with this Court, the government proposes an alternative means of construing Petitioner\u2019s motion. According to the government\u2019s letter, under <em>In re: Nailor, </em>487 F.3d 1018 (6th Cir.2007), a Rule 60(b) motion filed in a habeas case must be construed as a \u201csecond or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in disguise.\u201d Letter from Stephen J. Murphy, United States Attorney to United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of June 4, 2007, at 1. As the government concedes in its supplemental brief, however, <em>Nailor </em>only applies \u201cwhen a Rule 60(b) motion attacks ... the substance of the federal court\u2019s resolution of a claim on the merits\u201d 487 F.3d at 1022. When, however, the Rule 60(b) motion alleges \u201csome defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings,\u201d then the motion should not be treated as a second or successive habeas petition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In the instant case, Petitioner argues that his federal habeas proceedings are tainted because they misconstrued his 1992 letter as a \u00a7 2255 habeas petition. Such a claim alleges a \u201cdefect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings\u201d themselves; it does not confront the merits of any of the substantive claims raised in his habeas petitions. Accordingly, the district court properly construed Petitioner\u2019s motion as a Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Before we may consider the merits of Petitioner\u2019s appeal from the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion, we must first raise the issue of whether or not we have jurisdiction to hear this case. A U.S. Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to hear a habeas appeal without a certificate of appealability. <em>United States v. Hardin, </em>481 F.3d 924, 926 (6th Cir.2007). Such a certificate of appealability may issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Moreover, although a circuit judge has authority to grant a certificate of appealability to a habeas petitioner, a petitioner appealing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 petition must \u201capply first to the district court for a certificate of appealability.\u201d <em>Kincade v. Sparkman, </em>117 F.3d 949, 953 (6th Cir.1997). In <em>United States v. Hardin, </em>we held that a habeas petitioner must also obtain a certificate of appealability before appealing the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion. 481 F.3d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Petitioner did not apply for a certificate of appealability from the district court. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to hear his appeal until Petitioner seeks a certificate of appealability from the district court. <em>Hardin, </em>481 F.3d at 926; <em>Kincade, </em>117 F.3d at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">In holding that we lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal, we acknowledge that such a decision appears contrary to the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1). Under \u00a7 2253(c)(1), \u201c[ujnless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken to the court of appeals from ... the final order in a proceeding under section 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>guage of this statute is facially ambiguous as to whether the word \u201ccircuit\u201d only modifies the word \u201cjustice,\u201d thus leaving the word \u201cjudge\u201d unmodified and permitting any judge to issue a certificate of appealability, or whether the adjective \u201ccircuit\u201d also modifies \u201cjudge,\u201d thus reserving the power to issue certificates of appealability to circuit judges. <em>See Lozada v. United States, </em>107 F.3d 1011, 1015 (2d Cir.1997). What is not ambiguous, however, is that a circuit judge does have the power to issue a certificate of appealability. Accordingly, based only on the language of \u00a7 2253(c)(1), it appears strange that this Court has held that a petitioner appealing the denial of a \u00a7 2255 petition must \u201capply first to the district court for a certificate of appealability.\u201d <em>Kincade, </em>117 F.3d at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Section 2253(c)(1) is not the only provision of law governing certificates of appealability, however. Indeed, Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1) provides that a habeas petitioner \u201ccannot take an appeal unless a circuit justice or a circuit <em>or a district judge </em>issues a certificate of appealability under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c).\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 22(b)(1) (emphasis added). As the advisory committee notes accompanying Rule 22(b)(1) make clear, the reference to \u201ca district judge\u201d in the language of the rule resolves the ambiguity in \u00a7 2253(c)(l)\u2019s statutory language in favor of allowing district judges to issue a certificate of appealability. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 22 advisory committee\u2019s note (1998 amendment); <em>see also Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Authority, </em>105 F.3d 1063, 1070 (6th Cir.1997), <em>overruled on other grounds by Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997), (\u201c[Djistrict courts retain the authority to issue certificates of appealability under the AEDPA.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">We have also interpreted the language of Rule 22 to require habeas petitioners to seek a certificate of appealability from a district court prior to seeking one from a circuit judge. Under Rule 22(b)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the district judge who rendered the judgment must either issue a certificate of appealability or state why a certificate should not issue. The district clerk must send the certificate or statement to the court of appeals with the notice of appeal and the file of the district court proceedings. If the district judge has denied the certificate, the applicant may request a circuit judge to issue the certificate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-8\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>Lozada v. United States, </em>the Second Circuit explained that \u201cRule 22(b) specifies that the district judge who rendered the judgment \u2018shall\u2019 either issue a COA or give reasons for denying one, implying that the district judge is required to be the initial COA decision-maker. If the district judge denies a COA, a request may then be made to a court of appeals.... [T]he amended Rule simply sets forth the sequence of applications \u2014 first to the district court and then to the court of appeals.\u201d 107 F.3d at 1017. In <em>Kincade v. Sparkman, </em>the Sixth Circuit adopted the Second Circuit\u2019s holding as its own. 117 F.3d at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">To be clear, we are extremely skeptical of Lozada\u2019s analysis, as the holding in that case contrasts sharply with the statutory language governing certificates of appealability. Section 2253(c)(1) permits a \u201ccircuit justice or judge\u201d to issue a certificate of appealability, strongly implying that the power to issue such a certificate rests within the original authority of circuit judges. Nothing in the statutory language suggests that a circuit judge\u2019s power to issue certificates of appealability is instead the mere power to review a district judge\u2019s denial of such a certificate on appeal. Moreover, we see nothing in the language of Rule 22 which compels the decision reached by the Second Circuit in <em>Lozada. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>To the contrary, Rule 22(b)(2) expressly states that a \u201crequest [for a certificate of appealability] addressed to the court of appeals may be considered by a circuit judge or judges, <em>as the court </em>prescribes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Such language expressly authorizes the judges of this Court to consider requests for a certificate of appealability; it adds no requirement that the certificate issue only if a district court has first denied a similar request.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Were the jurisdictional issue presented in this appeal one of first impression before the Court, we would hold that a single circuit judge has authority to issue a certificate of appealability in the first instance. Neither the plain language of \u00a7 2253(c)(1) nor that of Rule 22 reduces a circuit judge\u2019s authority to issue certificates of appealability to the mere authority to review decisions of the district court regarding whether a certificate of appealability should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">As much as we may as we disagree with the holdings in <em>Lozada </em>and <em>Kincade, </em>however, we also must be cognizant that \u201c[a] panel of this Court cannot overrule the decision of another panel. The prior decision remains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the United States Supreme Court requires modification of the decision or this Court sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.\u201d <em>Salmi v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, </em>774 F.2d 685, 689 (6th Cir.1985); Accordingly, because we are bound by our prior decisions requiring Petitioner to seek a certificate of appealability in the district court before appealing his case to this Court, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Because Petitioner failed to seek a certificate of appealability from the district court, we hereby DISMISS this appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b515-10\">MERRITT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AYe\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">In order to allow this court to make a clear ruling on this case, I concur in Judge Clay\u2019s opinion; and I agree with his criticism of the <em>Kincade </em>and <em>Lozada </em>cases. When read in conjunction with the familiar rule of lenity, which we are required to apply in criminal cases, the language of \u00a7 2253(c)(1) should not be read as a jurisdictional bar to our consideration of this case on the merits. The language \u2014 \u201ca circuit justice or judge\u201d \u2014 allows a single circuit judge to allow an appeal in a \u201chabeas\u201d proceeding which includes \u201ca proceeding under section 2255.\u201d Our court\u2019s previous ruling that we lack jurisdiction unless the request to appeal is first presented to the district court that has denied the petition cannot be squared with the language of \u00a7 2253(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">In addition, based on the record now before us, I can find no compliance with the <em>Castro </em>case by the district court, and therefore no procedural bar to deciding petitioner\u2019s claim on the merits. The procedural morass created in this and similar cases is just another instance of spinning our back wheels in the mud when we could more easily shift to front wheel drive and decide the case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">RONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">I write separately because I am not prepared to criticize the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Lozada v. United States, </em>107 F.3d 1011, 1017 (2d Cir.1997), or this court\u2019s binding precedent in <em>Kincade v. Sparkman, </em>117 F.3d 949, 953 (6th Cir. 1997). To the contrary, the reasoning in <em>Lozada </em>strikes me as persuasive, though I would keep an open mind if and when I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>were ever properly presented with the question at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">But as both of my colleagues acknowledge, we lack the authority to overrule Kincade\u2019s holding that Rule 22 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure requires a \u00a7 2255 petitioner to seek a certificate of appealability from the district court before applying to a circuit judge. <em>See </em>117 F.3d at 953. The language in the lead opinion criticizing <em>Kincade </em>and <em>Lozada </em>is therefore dicta, and I see no reason to engage in an extended discussion over a question of law that has been settled in this circuit until such time as either the Supreme Court or this court sitting en banc decides otherwise.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
