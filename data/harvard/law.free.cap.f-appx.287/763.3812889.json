According to plaintiffs amended complaint for money damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for false arrest, plaintiffs sister called the police and the defendant responded to the call. The defendant observed that plaintiffs sister had a bloody nose; she told him that the plaintiff had \u201cegged on\u201d the assault. She subsequently swore out a complaint against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-21\">The defendant moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that he was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court granted the motion. In a well reasoned Memorandum Opinion, the court held that the defendant \u201creasonably could have believed that probable cause existed in light of the information he possessed at the time he arrested the plaintiff.\u201d The plaintiff now appeals. We find no error in the district court\u2019s reasoning, and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
