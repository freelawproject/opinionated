Approximately a year and a half later, Dorothy Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d), one of the decedent\u2019s six siblings, filed an administrative tort claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d) on behalf of the decedent, alleging improper medical care. On the form for the administrative tort claim, Standard Form 95 (\u201cSF-95\u201d), Johnson identified the claimant as \u201cDorothy Johnson for Edward Johnson\u201d and on an addendum stated that she was the \u201crepresentative of the estate of Edward L. Johnson.\u201d The DVA notified Johnson that she had to provide the DVA with evidence that she was either the executrix or administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate, or that all of the decedent\u2019s siblings (who were his surviving heirs under Texas law) had agreed for Johnson to act on behalf of the decedent\u2019s estate. On November 4, 2005, the DVA sent Johnson a letter acknowledging that Johnson had accepted the DVA\u2019s offer to settle the claim for $50,000, but stating that the DVA could authorize the settlement \u201conly if it is with an authorized representative of Edward Johnson\u2019s estate.\u201d The DVA asked Johnson whether she intended to probate the decedent\u2019s estate and obtain letters testamentary. The DVA contacted Johnson again on January 24, 2006, stating that if she did not probate the estate by January 31, 2006, the DVA would deny Johnson\u2019s claim. Johnson failed to respond to this request. As promised, the DVA denied Johnson\u2019s claim on February 10, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-15\">Johnson then brought suit against the United States of America (\u201cUnited States\u201d) under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671-80. The district court denied Johnson\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted the United States\u2019 motion to dismiss, which the court treated as a motion for summary judgment. The district court reasoned that Johnson lacked the capacity, or legal right, to bring a claim on behalf of the decedent. Johnson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">Under the FTCA, the United States is liable in damages \u201cin the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.... \u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674. Thus, we use the law of the state where the incident occurred to analyze Johnson\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b); <em>Richards v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 1, 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>82 S.Ct. 585, 7 L.Ed.2d 492 (1962). The decedent here died without a will and with no living child, spouse, or parent, meaning that Johnson, as one of the decedent\u2019s surviving siblings, is one of his \u201cheirs.\u201d Tex. Prob.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3(o), 37, 38(a)(3). Under Texas law, heirs have the capacity to sue on behalf of a decedent. Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 71.021(b). However, the Texas Supreme Court has stated that \u201cheirs at law can maintain a survival suit during the four-year period the law allows for instituting administration proceedings <em>if they allege and prove that there is no administration pending and none [is] necessary.\" Austin Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Lovato, </em>171 S.W.3d 845, 850-51 (Tex. 2005) (quoting <em>Shepherd v. Ledford, </em>962 S.W.2d 28, 31-32 (Tex.1998)) (emphasis added). Here, Johnson filed her claim with the DVA approximately a year and a half after the decedent\u2019s death, which is within the four-year period under Texas law to institute an administration proceeding. <em>See </em>Tex. Prob.Code Ann. \u00a7 74. Therefore, Johnson had to allege and prove that there was no administration pending and that none was necessary to demonstrate that she had the capacity to sue on behalf of the decedent. There is no evidence in the record that Johnson provided this information, either before she filed her claim with the DVA or in response to the DVA\u2019s repeated requests. Simply put, without evidence that there was no administration pending and none was necessary, Johnson lacked the capacity to bring a claim on behalf of the decedent, and the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the United States on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
