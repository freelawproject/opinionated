Tucker petitions for review of a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) dismissing Ms. Tucker\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Tucker v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. DA0752070394-I-1, 108 M.S.P.R. 19 (M.S.P.B. Sept.14, 2007) <em>(\u201cBoard Decision </em>\u201d). Because the Board properly held that it lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Tucker\u2019s appeal, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-26\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b895-27\">Ms. Tucker was employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d) as a dietician. In June 2006, the DVA removed Ms. Tucker on a charge of making false and defamatory statements using a DVA computer. To settle her subsequent appeal to the Board, Ms. Tucker and the DVA signed a Last Chance Agreement (\u201cLCA\u201d). In the LCA, the DVA agreed to reinstate Ms. Tucker, provided the DVA could later remove her if she failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>maintain \u201csatisfactory conduct and/or performance\u201d for twenty-four months. The LCA defined \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d conduct and/or performance to be any conduct and/or performance \u201cdeemed by the Agency to be an offense punishable by a removal or suspension under the Agency\u2019s table of penalties.\u201d Ms. Tucker also agreed \u201cto waive all appeal rights\u201d should she be removed for failing to comply with this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">On April 17, 2007, the DVA determined that Ms. Tucker\u2019s \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d conduct constituted a violation of the LCA and, thus, removed her pursuant to that agreement. Ms. Tucker filed an appeal with the Board, but the administrative judge found that Ms. Tucker failed to prove that the Board had jurisdiction given her waiver of appeal rights in the LCA. <em>Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 12. When the Board denied review, the administrative judge\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Board. <em>Tucker v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. DA0752070394-I-1, 108 M.S.P.R. 19 (M.S.P.B. Jan.9, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">We determine whether the Board has jurisdiction without deference to the Board, but we accept the Board\u2019s factual findings as long as they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). Ms. Tucker waived her right to appeal the DVA\u2019s decision to remove her for violating the LCA. <em>See Gibson v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>160 F.3d 722, 725 (Fed.Cir.1998) (\u201c[A]n employee can waive the right to appeal in a last-chance agreement.\u201d). Accordingly, the Board lacks jurisdiction to review Ms. Tucker\u2019s removal unless she proves that: (1) she complied with the LCA; (2) the DVA breached the LCA; or (3) she involuntarily entered into the LCA. <em>See Buchanan v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>247 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed. Cir.2001). There is no indication that Ms. Tucker involuntarily entered into the LCA, <em>see Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 11-12, but Ms. Tucker alleges that she established jurisdiction on the other two grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">Ms. Tucker first asserts that the Board has jurisdiction because she complied with the LCA. The DVA alleged three instances of \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d conduct: (1) demonstrating inattention to duty and questionable patient care procedures on January 11, 2007; (2) being disrespectful towards a supervisor on January 25, 2007; and (3) being absent without leave (\u201cAWOL\u201d) between March 19, 2007 and March 30, 2007. The Board found that Ms. Tucker failed to prove that she maintained satisfactory conduct as required by the LCA in any of these instances. We review the Board\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">With respect to the first instance, the Board found that Ms. Tucker \u201cwas inattentive to duty, and engaged in questionable care practices with respect to [a particular] patient.\u201d <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 6. The Board based this finding on a letter from the patient and Mr. Brewer\u2019s testimony regarding a subsequent conversation with the patient. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 4-6. Ms. Tucker argues that this finding is clearly erroneous because her testimony provided a different account of the day\u2019s events and because neither the patient\u2019s letter nor Mr. Brewer\u2019s testimony should have been credited. Ms. Tucker also asserts that the patient was schizophrenic and, thus, his account of events is necessarily suspect. While she claims that the patient\u2019s medical records corroborate her testimony, the only relevant medical document in the record fails to support her assertions. Because a reasonable mind could find this evidence to be sufficient to support the Board\u2019s finding, <em>see Haebe v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>288 F.3d 1288, 1298 (Fed.Cir.2002), we conclude that substantial evidence sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>ports the finding that Ms. Tucker failed to comply with the LCA in this first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">With respect to the second instance, the Board found that Ms. Tucker spoke to Mr. Brewer (her supervisor) in a confrontational and disrespectful manner during a staff meeting on January 25, 2007. <em>Board Decision, </em>slip op. at 8-9. The Board based this finding on the testimony of Mr. Brewer and three other agency employees who attended the staff meeting and found Ms. Tucker\u2019s tone and attitude to be disrespectful, argumentative, and sarcastic. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 6-8. Ms. Tucker argues that she was not insubordinate, that Mr. Brewer never spoke to her about the meeting, and that, immediately following the meeting, Mr. Brewer approved her request for time off. Four individuals, however, testified that Ms. Tucker was confrontational and disrespectful to Mr. Brewer. Thus, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">With respect to the third instance, the Board found that Ms. Tucker was AWOL during the time period from March 19, 2007 to March 30, 2007. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 11. After acknowledging that Ms. Tucker was injured on March 7, 2007, the Board found that the only medical documentation in the record indicated that Ms. Tucker was able to work four hours per day during this time period. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 9-11. Ms. Tucker asserts that she provided adequate medical documentation, that the Board demanded excessive medical proof, and that her Department of Labor workers compensation claim was approved from the date of injury. The record, however, fails to support any of these claims. The only document regarding Ms. Tucker\u2019s medical condition between March 19 and March 30 indicates that Ms. Tucker was able to work four hours per day, leaving her in AWOL status for those hours. There is no evidence that Ms. Tucker was awarded workers compensation for any of these AWOL hours. Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">On appeal, Ms. Tucker further alleges that the Board has jurisdiction because the DVA breached the LCA. Specifically, Ms. Tucker asserts that Mr. Brewer violated paragraph 9 \u201cby using [the agreement] as a reason for making a decision to remove [her].\u201d Paragraph 9, however, simply states that the LCA shall not be used to \u201cresolv[e] any other complaints which have been or may be filed\u201d and that the DVA\u2019s failure to remove Ms. Tucker for a violation of the LCA shall not serve as a precedent for the DVA\u2019s decision to remove her for a subsequent violation. Mr. Brewer simply informed management that \u201cMs. Tucker currently has a last change [sic] agreement that needs to be considered in the decision making process.\u201d This statement does not violate paragraph 9 of the LCA. Ms. Tucker also appears to argue that the DVA violated the LCA in a variety of other ways, but none of these alleged wrongs are relevant to any LCA provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">Finally, Ms. Tucker\u2019s list of other grievances with the DVA are not relevant to establishing that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal in this situation. Because Ms. Tucker waived her appeal rights in the LCA and failed to establish that the Board had jurisdiction in spite of that waiver, we conclude that that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Ms. Tucker\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
