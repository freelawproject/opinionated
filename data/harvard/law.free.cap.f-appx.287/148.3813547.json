He challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that his prior New Jersey state conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon constituted an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), thereby subjecting him to an eight-level increase in his base offense level. The government argues that any error was harmless because the district court articulated an alternative ground for the sentence that was imposed that makes Santiago-Bautista\u2019s challenge irrelevant. Because we agree that any error in the calculation of the applicable Guideline range was harmless, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">Inasmuch as we write primarily for the benefit of the parties, we discuss only the background necessary to our brief opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, the district court imposed a custodial sentence of 19 months based on two independent grounds. The district court concluded that violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> constituted a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), resulting in an offense level 13, criminal history category 3, and yielding an advisory Guideline range of 18 to 24 months. However, the court went on to explain that even if that legal conclusion was incorrect (and the offense level should have been 10), the court would nevertheless have \u201cvar[ied] up 2 points, and using a range of 15 to 21 months, impose[d] a sentence of 19 months.\u201d App. 101. This variance would be based on \u201cthe nature and circumstances of this defendant, ... [the] nature and circumstances of the offense, [his] violent act regarding Miss Chan,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> prior membership in a gang, his lack of candor [towards] law enforcement, and his use of fraudulent documentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further explained that such a sentence would address some concerns about danger to the public, as well as \u201creflect the seriousness of the reentry,\u201d and \u201cpromote respect for the law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Thus the court clearly considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) when imposing this sentence. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the district court erred in its analysis of Defendant\u2019s prior conviction, that error was harmless as the court would have imposed the same sentence anyway for the reasons it explained. We are convinced that the district court engaged in a careful and extensive explanation of the reasoning underlying the sentence under either Guidelines framework. We find no error in the alternate sentence, nor do we find any merit in Santiago-Bautista\u2019s argument that a district court abuses its discretion when it articulates an alternate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">N.J.S.A. 2C:39-5(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgement of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b169-8\">. The district court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review factual findings relevant to the Sentencing Guidelines for clear error and we exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556, 570 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc). \"In deciding whether the alleged error was harmless, 'a court of appeals must decide whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence had it not relied upon the invalid factor or factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Smalley, </em>517 F.3d 208, 212 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b169-21\">. That statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVt\">Any person who knowingly has in his possession any other weapon under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses as it may have is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b170-6\">. This is a reference to the prior conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon. According to the arrest report, his girlfriend (Ms. Chan) told officers that \"Santiago threatened her with a hammer by putting the claw edge against her face and then told her that he would \u2018stab her in the stomach repeatedly' if she left him or gets him \u2018locked up.\u2019 \" PSR \u00b6 30. Ms. Chan had some visible injuries.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
