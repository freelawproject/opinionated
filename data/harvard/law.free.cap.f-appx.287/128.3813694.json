We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-25\">Paredes challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court erred by failing to provide sufficient legal analysis supporting its determination that a four-level reduction for his \u201cminimal\u201d role in the offense was unwarranted. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SB1.2(a). Paredes suggests that the district court failed to comprehend the distinction between \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cminimal\u201d participants under the Guidelines, because the court made specific findings with regard to its ruling that Paredes was entitled to a two-level \u201cminor\u201d role reduction but did not so with regard to its rejection of Paredes\u2019 request for an adjustment as a \u201cminimal\u201d participant in the charged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings as to the extent of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense under the clearly erroneous standard, but \u201c[w]e review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusion as to whether the circumstances constitute \u2018minimal\u2019 or \u2018minor\u2019 participation.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaston, </em>68 F.3d 1466, 1468 (2d Cir.1995) (per curiam); <em>see also United States v. Gotti, </em>459 F.3d 296, 349 (2d Cir. 2006) (discussing \u201ceither/or\u201d approach to selecting standard of review of district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to specific facts of a case). On the record before us, we have no difficulty affirming the district court\u2019s decision not to grant Paredes a four-level reduction for \u201cminimal\u201d participation, even pursuant to our <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Although the district court did not preface its conclusion that Paredes was not entitled to a \u201cminimal\u201d role reduction by summarizing all of its underlying findings, the court thereafter cited the appropriate legal standard for determining a mitigating role adjustment, <em>see United States v. Carpenter, </em>252 F.3d 230, 234 (2d Cir.2001), and the basis for the court\u2019s decision is manifest in the transcript of the sentencing hearing: (i) Paredes had on more than one occasion delivered substantial cash payments as transportation fees for the drugs; (ii) Paredes knew the transaction involved a large amount of drugs; and (iii) Paredes was trusted to take possession of and deliver a valuable quantity of drugs. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 comment n. 4 (explaining that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise ... is indicative of a role as minimal participant\u201d). At the outset of the hearing, moreover, the district court explicitly acknowledged Paredes\u2019 request that he \u201creceive a four-level departure for his minimal role in the offense.\u201d Paredes\u2019 counsel also conceded during a lengthy deliberation that Paredes was an unlikely candidate for the four-point reduction: \u201c[T]his isn\u2019t at first blush necessarily the kind of case that you would necessarily give four points off for, because he did go twice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">Under the circumstances, we conclude that this is not a case, as Paredes implies, where the district court failed to realize that there was a difference between \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cminimal\u201d roles under the Guidelines. Paredes\u2019 claim that the district court failed to consider a minimal role reduction therefore has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
