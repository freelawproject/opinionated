Shelby received a hearing, and the Disciplinary Hearing Officer found that Shelby had violated the prison\u2019s rule prohibiting possession of drugs because the drugs were in his cell and thus he was responsible for them. Shelby was disciplined with the loss of good-time credits and visitation privileges, segregation, and a transfer to another facility. He eventually was moved to a federal prison in Colorado, and from there he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, claiming that his right to due process had been violated because, he asserted, there was not sufficient evidence to support the DHO\u2019s finding. The district court for the District of Colorado agreed, granted his petition, and ordered the Bureau of Prisons to expunge the violation from Shelby\u2019s record and reinstate his good-time credits. <em>Shelby v. United States, </em>No. 03-cv-1336 (D.Colo. Aug. 4, 2004) (unpublished order). Relying on the Colorado district court\u2019s decision, Shelby then filed this action under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), seeking damages from the guard who filed the disciplinary report, another guard who participated in the investigation, and the DHO who conducted the disciplinary hearing. The district court for the Southern District of Illinois screened Shelby\u2019s complaint prior to service, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, and dismissed it on the ground that it fails to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">We review de novo a dismissal under \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim. <em>Westefer v. Snyder, </em>422 F.3d 570, 574 (7th Cir.2005). Shelby\u2019s allegations are sparse, but his complaint turns on the decision of the Colorado district court, and he has attached the court\u2019s order to his appellate brief. Thus he has incorporated that decision into his complaint. <em>See Levenstein v. Salafsky, </em>164 F.3d 345, 347 (7th Cir.1998); <em>Wright v. Associated Ins. Cos., </em>29 F.3d 1244, 1248 (7th Cir.1994). So, in setting out the facts, we rely on the factual findings in the Colorado district court\u2019s order and accept as true the additional allegations in Shelby\u2019s complaint. <em>See Westefer, </em>422 F.3d at 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">In November 2002, while Shelby was working at his job in the kitchen at Green-ville, guards searched his cell, which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>shared with four other inmates, and which he could not lock to exclude other uninvited inmates. During the search the guards found four packets of marijuana under a cellmate\u2019s bunk, a Chapstick cap containing barbiturates in a bag next to a cellmate\u2019s bunk, four packets of marijuana on a cellmate\u2019s bunk, a balled-up sock containing twenty packets of marijuana on an unassigned bunk (which had been \u201cclaimed\u201d by another inmate whose authority to be in the cell is unclear), and a red balloon and ten packets of marijuana inside a tennis shoe on top of the unassigned bunk. Four inmates were present during the search, although we cannot tell if all of them were Shelby\u2019s cellmates. At that time Shelby and his cellmates all denied knowing anything about the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In January 2003 one of the guards who conducted the search wrote a disciplinary report charging Shelby with possessing drugs. Afterward another guard interviewed Shelby and concluded that \u201cthe incident report supports the charge.\u201d At the hearing before the DHO, Shelby testified that he did not own the drugs and had not known that they were in his cell. Another inmate (we do not know whether he was one of Shelby\u2019s cellmates) testified that he, not Shelby, was the owner of the drugs and that Shelby \u201c[ajin\u2019t seen nothing and didn\u2019t know nothing about it.\u201d The DHO issued written findings discounting that witness\u2019s testimony, finding it \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Shelby was unaware of the drugs given the number of hiding places, and concluding that Shelby was thus responsible for possessing the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The district court construed Shelby\u2019s civil-rights complaint as challenging only the disciplinary transfer and revocation of visitation privileges, and then dismissed it, reasoning that because inmates do not have a liberty interest in being housed at a particular facility, <em>see Hoskins v. Lenear, </em>395 F.3d 372, 375 (7th Cir.2005); <em>Whitford v. Boglino, </em>63 F.3d 527, 532 (7th Cir.1995), or in having ready access to visitors, <em>see Ky. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Thompson, </em>490 U.S. 454, 460, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989); <em>see also DeWalt v. Carter, </em>224 F.3d 607, 613 (7th Cir.2000), they are not entitled to due process before they are transferred or lose visitation privileges. So, the dismissal of those theories was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">However, construing Shelby\u2019s pro se complaint liberally, as we must, <em>see Kaba v. Stepp, </em>458 F.3d 678, 681 (7th Cir.2006), we conclude that he also seeks damages for the temporary loss of his good-time credits. A prisoner is entitled to nominal damages if a due-process violation resulted in the loss of good-time credits, even if they were later restored. <em>See Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 266-67, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978); <em>Gates v. Towery, </em>430 F.3d 429, 431 (7th Cir.2005). Punitive damages may also be available if the prisoner can prove that the defendants acted with an \u201cevil motive\u201d or \u201ccallous indifference\u201d to his due-process rights. <em>Smith v. Wade, </em>461 U.S. 30, 56, 103 S.Ct. 1625, 75 L.Ed.2d 632 (1983); <em>see Marshall ex rel. Gossens v. Teske, </em>284 F.3d 765, 772 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">So we must decide whether Shelby has stated a civil-rights claim for a due-process violation that resulted in the temporary loss of his good-time credits. To satisfy the notice-pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint need include only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2); <em>see Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). For a plaintiff attempting to make out a claim under <em>Bivens, </em>this standard is satisfied if the plaintiff alleges that he was deprived of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>constitutionally protected right by a person acting under color of federal authority. <em>See Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 389-92, 91 S.Ct. 1999; <em>Case v. Milewski, </em>327 F.3d 564, 568 (7th Cir.2003); <em>see also Kramer v. Village of North Fond du Lac, </em>384 F.3d 856, 861 (7th Cir.2004). Shelby has stated a claim because he has alleged that the defendants \u2014 two correctional officers and a DHO involved in his disciplinary proceedings \u2014 acted under color of federal authority in depriving him of his right to due process when he was found to have possessed drugs without any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">And, although Shelby did not have to plead facts under the liberal notice-pleading rule, the facts he did include in his complaint and its attachments do not undercut his claim. <em>Cf. Henderson v. Sheahan, </em>196 F.3d 839, 846 (7th Cir.1999) (observing that pro se plaintiffs can plead themselves out of court if they plead facts that undermine their allegations). The district court in Colorado tells us that numerous stashes of drugs were found throughout Shelby\u2019s cell, but that the drugs were not found among Shelby\u2019s possessions, the cell was not locked, many inmates may have had access to the cell, and another inmate came forward to claim the drugs, asserting that Shelby knew nothing about them. A decision to discipline an inmate comports with due process if it is supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d <em>see Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985), and evidence of constructive possession is sufficient to meet this standard when drugs are found where only a handful of inmates have access, <em>see Hamilton v. O\u2019Leary, </em>976 F.2d 341, 345\u201446 (7th Cir.1992); <em>see also Mason v. Sargent, </em>898 F.2d 679, 679-80 (8th Cir. 1990) (holding that \u201csome evidence\u201d supported disciplinary charge against inmate where he and another inmate shared a locker and the other inmate admitted to putting contraband in the locker). But the inference of constructive possession is too weak to satisfy the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard where the plaintiff was just one of many inmates who shared access to an area where contraband was found. <em>See Broussard v. Johnson, </em>253 F.3d 874, 877 (5th Cir.2001) (holding \u201csome evidence\u201d standard not met where more than 100 inmates had access); <em>Hamilton, </em>976 F.2d at 347-18 (Posner, J., dissenting) (noting that a one-in-eight chance contraband belonged to a prisoner is \u201cnot my idea of \u2018some evidence\u2019 \u201d and observing that a one-in-thirty-two chance would not satisfy \u201csome evidence\u201d standard). Because Shelby may be able to prove, consistently with the facts he has alleged, that too many inmates had access to his cell to hold him accountable for the drugs on a theory of constructive possession, he is entitled to proceed with his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Shelby, though, is wrong in thinking that the district court will be compelled to accept the Colorado district court\u2019s conclusion that his right to due process was violated. That decision is not preclusive. Shelby\u2019s victory on his \u00a7 2241 petition means only that he is not barred from bringing his <em>Bivens </em>claim by the doctrine, announced in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), that if a plaintiffs success in a civil-rights suit for damages would invalidate a conviction or sentence, the plaintiff must first have the conviction or sentence, as relevant here, \u201ccalled into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364; <em>see also Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 648, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (holding that <em>Heck </em>doctrine applies to civil-rights suits challenging prison disciplinary proceedings); <em>Case, </em>327 F.3d at 569 (noting that <em>Heck </em>doctrine applies to <em>Bivens </em>claims). Nothing compels the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>court to adopt the Colorado district court\u2019s reasoning or to follow its rationale. <em>See Garza v. Henderson, 779 </em>F.2d 390, 392-94 (7th Cir.1985) (district court\u2019s issuance of writ of habeas corpus did not have preclusive effect in inmate\u2019s subsequent civil-rights claim for damages). Thus, on remand after the record has been developed and the issues of fact have been resolved, the court may be required to undertake its own analysis to determine whether, consistent with the law of this circuit, the defendants\u2019 actions violated due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
