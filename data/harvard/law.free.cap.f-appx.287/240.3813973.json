Spivey reserved the right to challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the evidence seized during a traffic stop. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On December 1, 2006, Montgomery County (North Carolina) Sheriff Deputy Michael Concannon and Biscoe Police Officer M. Glover stopped a vehicle due to an expired inspection sticker and license registration. Spivey sat in the front passenger seat. Concannon asked Spivey to exit the vehicle; a frisk of his person did not reveal any weapons. Concannon did not place Spivey under arrest and left him with Glover. Concannon then looked underneath the front passenger seat and found a loaded handgun. Spivey admitted it was his firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether Con-cannon\u2019s search of the vehicle was a valid protective search authorized under <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983). Under <em>Long, </em>a police officer may conduct a protective search of the passenger compartment of a lawfully stopped automobile where the \u201cofficer possesses a reasonable belief based on \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant\u2019 the officer in believing that [a] suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons\u201d within the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 1049-50, 103 S.Ct. 3469 (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Concannon conducted the protective search of the vehicle because he considered Spivey to be armed and dangerous due to Spivey\u2019s criminal history. Concannon knew Spivey often carried firearms, had multiple prior convictions involving firearms, and had pending charges for shooting into a house occupied by children. We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">Quite simply, reasonable suspicion of a suspect\u2019s dangerousness need not be based solely on activities observed by the police during or just before the relevant police encounter, but can be based on the suspect\u2019s commission of violent crimes in the past-especially when those crimes indicate a high likelihood that the suspect will be \u2018armed and dangerous\u2019 when encountered in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-10\"><em>United States v. Holmes, </em>376 F.3d 270, 278 (4th Cir.2004). We conclude Concannon had a reasonable belief of Spivey\u2019s dangerousness sufficient to conduct a protective search of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Accordingly, we affirm Spivey\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
