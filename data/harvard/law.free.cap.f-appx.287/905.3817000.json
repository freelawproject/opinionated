We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">In the aftermath of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>we review sentences for \u201creasonableness,\u201d 543 U.S. 220, 262, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), \u201ca deferential standard limited to identifying abuse of discretion regardless of whether a challenged sentence is \u2018inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d 163, 170 (2d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Our review proceeds in two steps: we \u201cmust first ascertain whether the sentence was administered without procedural error,\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>524 F.3d 209, 214 (2d Cir.2008); and second, if the sentence is \u201cprocedurally sound,\u201d we must \u201cconsider [its] substantive reasonableness\u201d by evaluating \u201cwhether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported\u201d the sentence imposed, <em>Gall v. United States, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">On this appeal, Libbett does not challenge the procedures employed by the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>trict court in imposing the 110-month sentence. He argues only that the sentence was substantively unreasonable because the court did not properly account for his age, health, and drug addiction. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Libbett\u2019s 110-month prison sentence falls at the low end of his 110-137 month Guidelines range, derived from a base offense level of 25 and criminal history category of VI. \u201c[I]in the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u201d <em>United States. v. Eberhard, </em>525 F.3d 175, 179 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2467, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201c[W]here [the sentencing] judge and [Sentencing] Commission <em>both </em>determine that the Guidelines sentence[ ] is an appropriate sentence for the case at hand, that sentence likely reflects the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Libbett\u2019s sentence warrants no different conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Libbett claims that his age at sentencing, 38, and his professed commitment to reform indicate a low risk of recidivism that makes a Guidelines sentence substantively unreasonable in his case. The argument merits little discussion. The assessment of a defendant\u2019s risk of recidivism is a finding of fact that we review only for clear error. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d at 173-74. In doing so, we are mindful that a district court\u2019s insights as to recidivism are informed both by its experience imposing scores of sentences each year and by its direct interaction with the defendant, institutional advantages that we do not share. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98; <em>Rita v. United States, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2469; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d at 170-71. In Libbett\u2019s case, the record reveals fifteen convictions over twenty years. <em>See </em>Sentencing Tr. at 27. Thus, the district court observed that Libbett had had \u201cabout 15 opportunities to say I don\u2019t want to do this anymore ... and [yet] here we are again in 2007, conviction number 16.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. Under these circumstances, the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines cannot be deemed substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Libbett\u2019s argument that his health problems and drug addiction rendered his sentence substantively unreasonable is similarly without merit. We identify no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s conclusion that the \u201cvery serious\u201d nature of the firearms offenses to which Libbett pleaded guilty, <em>id. </em>at 27, and his demonstrated recidivism, indicated that \u201ca sentence at the low end of the guideline range,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 30, was appropriate to serve the statutory goals of sentencing in his case. In short, this is not one of \u201cthose outlier sentences that reflect actual abuse of a district court\u2019s considerable sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>531 F.3d at 173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">In sum, because defendant\u2019s sentence was not unreasonable, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
