R.App. P. 84(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-14\">Arthur D\u2019Amario appeals the order and separate judgment entered by the United States District Court for the District of Colorado denying his application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 for writ of habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-17\">Petitioner D\u2019Amario was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey of threatening to kill a federal judge. He was sentenced to 84 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. D\u2019Amario, </em>No. 06-CR-112-PSD, 2007 WL 928473 (D.N.J. Mar. 26, 2007). His criminal appeal is proceeding before the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. <em>See United States v. D\u2019Amario, appeal docketed, </em>No. 07-1955 (3d Cir. Apr. 3, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-18\">Shortly after filing his criminal appeal, Petitioner filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court for the District of New Jersey raising claims based on ineffective assistance of counsel. In a May 30, 2007 Order, the district court denied the \u00a7 2255 motion, as premature, because of Petitioner\u2019s criminal appeal before the Third Circuit. Subsequently, the Third Circuit granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to voluntarily dismiss his civil appeal from the denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See D\u2019Amario v. United States, </em>No. 08-1606 (3d Cir. May 30, 2007) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-19\">In November 2007, while incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Englewood, Colorado, Arthur D\u2019Amario filed a \u00a7 2241 application in the District of Colorado raising claims based on prosecutorial misconduct and insufficient evidence. The District of Colorado denied the application, concluding that the appropriate remedy was under \u00a7 2255 in the District of New Jersey where Petitioner was convicted and sentenced, and not under \u00a7 2241 in the District of Colorado. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2241 application. <em>See Brad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>shaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Upon review of the record and appellate brief, we conclude the district court was correct in denying the \u00a7 2241 application. A motion under \u00a7 2255 in the District of New Jersey is the exclusive remedy for Petitioner to challenge his 2007 conviction and sentence <em>after </em>the Third Circuit renders a decision in his criminal appeal. The fact that a \u00a7 2255 motion in the District of New Jersey at this time is premature does not establish that relief under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The district court\u2019s January 4, 2008 Order and separate judgment are AFFIRMED. The motion for leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>is DENIED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b657-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of <em>orders </em>and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
