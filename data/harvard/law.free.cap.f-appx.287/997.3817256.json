For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">Petitioner entered the United States in 1993, without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an Immigration Officer. In 2005, Petitioner was served with a Notice to Appear, which charged that he was in the United States without authorization. Petitioner admitted the allegations and applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). After an evidentiary hearing, on July 21, 2005 the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) issued its decision and order of removal to Guatemala, concluding that Petitioner had failed to meet his burden of proof regarding his claims. On February 14, 2007, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. On May 14, 2007, Petitioner filed a motion to reopen the BIA\u2019s decision based on new evidence. The BIA denied the motion on August 17, 2007, noting, <em>inter alia, </em>a number of authenticity questions about the evidence, the motion\u2019s lack of any supporting affidavit, and the evidence\u2019s lack of specific relevance to Petitioner\u2019s circumstances. On September 17, 2007, Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s decision. The BIA denied the motion on October 23, 2007. On November 23, 2007, Petitioner filed with this Court his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">Although Petitioner urges otherwise, our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s October 23, 2007 decision denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Nocon v. I.N.S., </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1032-33 (3d Cir.1986) (final deportation orders and orders denying motions to reconsider are independently reviewable; a timely petition for review must be filed with respect to the specific order sought to be reviewed); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (a motion for reconsideration does not toll the time to file a petition for review of a final deportation order). We review the denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Nocon, </em>789 F.2d at 1033. Under that standard of review, we may reverse the BIA\u2019s decision only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-10\">A motion for reconsideration must specify the errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s prior decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). It is a \u201crequest that the Board re-examine its decision in light of additional legal arguments, a change of law, or perhaps an argument or aspect of the case which was overlooked.\u201d <em>In re Ramos, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 336, 338 (BIA 2002) (en banc) (internal quotation and citations omitted). In this case, Petitioner filed his motion for reconsideration to seek additional time for authenticating the evidence submitted with his earlier-adjudicated motion to reopen. Petitioner also argued that the BIA erred by not granting the motion as unopposed. In denying the motion for reconsideration, the BIA cited section 1003.2(b)(1) and concluded that the motion specified no error of fact or law in the earlier decision warranting reconsideration of the August 17, 2007 decision, notwithstanding the government\u2019s lack of response to the motion to reopen. Upon review of the relevant docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>ments in the administrative record, we agree with the BIA\u2019s conclusion. We add that Petitioner\u2019s argument that the BIA erred in denying the motion to reopen simply because it was unopposed has no merit, given the restrictive standards governing motions to reopen, as well as the discretionary nature of such motions. <em>See Sevoian, </em>290 F.3d at 173. In sum, we discern no abuse of the BIA\u2019s discretion in its October 23, 2007 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
