Garcia initially argued that his three-year term of supervised release exceeds the maximum one-year term authorized by the illegal reentry statute because he is not subject to the enhanced penalty authorized by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). However, the parties have now informed the Court that while Garcia\u2019s appeal was pending and within the first year of his term of supervised release, the district court revoked Garcia\u2019s term of supervised release and sentenced him to eight months of imprisonment. The district court was authorized to \u201crequire the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>sion.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Because Garcia\u2019s supervised release was revoked within the first year of his term of supervised release, and because Garcia received a revocation sentence of less than one year, he is not suffering any direct or collateral consequences from the erroneously imposed three-year term of supervised release. <em>See Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998) (noting that the case-or-controversy requirement demands that \u201csome concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction\u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained\u201d). Thus, as all parties to this appeal now agree, the issue presented by Garcia\u2019s appeal is moot. We therefore dismiss Garcia\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
