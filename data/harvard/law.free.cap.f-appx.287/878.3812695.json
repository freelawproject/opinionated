Marassa appeals from a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction and under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. <em>Marassa v. United States Postal Service, </em>No. CH0752070639-I-1. Although we hold that the Board erred in invoking collateral estoppel, we <em>affirm </em>on the alternative ground that Mr. Marassa did not make the nonfrivolous allegations necessary to establish the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b899-13\">\n<em>A. Mr. Marassa\u2019s Employment with the Postal Service</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b899-14\">Mr. Marassa worked for Respondent the United States Postal Service (\u201cPostal Service\u201d). On August 17, 1987, Mr. Marassa started work as a Part-Time Flexible Mail Handler. On October 9, 1987, the Postal Service removed Mr. Marassa because his carpal tunnel syndrome rendered him unable to perform the physical requirements of the mail-handling position. On May 13, 1988, Mr. Marassa applied for disability benefits from the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers Compensation Program (\u201cOWCP\u201d), and he thereafter received benefits retroactive to October 10, 1987 (the day after his removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\">Mr. Marassa partially recovered the next year, and on November 5, 1988, his OWCP disability benefits ceased and he accepted a position with the Postal Service as a Modified Custodial Laborer on the night shift. But Mr. Marassa was apparently not satisfied with his new position, and requested reassignment to another position. On February 24, 1989, Mr. Marassa\u2019s doctor wrote to the Postal Service that Marassa had \u201crecovered completely from his carpal tunnel syndrome on the left side\u201d but had permanently lost strength in his left hand. On March 9, 1989, Mr. Marassa filed a grievance against the Postal Service, seeking reassignment. He also wrote to the Postal Service on March 16, 1989 that he would \u201crefuse the reemployment I accepted\u201d in November of 1988 \u201cuntil I\u2019m put back on my original and rightful\u201d assignment, but that he was \u201cnot resigning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-18\">Starting the next day, March 17, 1989, Mr. Marassa did not return to work. On May 9, 1989, the Postal Service told Mr. Marassa that he could be removed for being absent from work without permission, and on June 13, 1989, the Postal Service removed him for unauthorized absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-19\">From February 23, 1989 until July 25, 1989, Mr. Marassa received benefits from OWCP for a seven-percent partial loss of the use of his left arm. Mr. Marassa\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>grievance against the Postal Service proceeded to arbitration and was denied on July 26,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">\n<em>B. Mr. Marassa\u2019s First Appeal to the Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">More than fourteen years later, on December 26, 2005, Mr. Marassa wrote to the Postal Service, stating that he had just learned of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8151, and requesting that he be restored to his original mail-handling position pursuant to \u00a7 8151(b)(1) because he recovered from his carpal tunnel syndrome within one year of his worker\u2019s compensation claim. After further correspondence from Mr. Marassa, the Postal Service responded on May 31, 2006, denying the request for restoration. The Postal Service explained that it had made \u201call efforts\u201d in 1988 to reemploy Marassa in his former position, but that mail-handling work assignments were \u201cnot conducive to [his] physical limitations.\u201d Therefore, the Postal Service stated, \u00a7 8151 was satisfied by Mr. Marassa\u2019s reemployment as a Modified Custodial Laborer, after which he refused to appear for work and was removed for being absent without leave (\u201cAWOL\u201d). On August 4, 2006, Mr. Marassa replied to the Postal Service, requesting that he be apprised of his appeal rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">On August 14, 2006, Mr. Marassa appealed to the Board, arguing that he was fully recovered from carpal tunnel syndrome within a year of his May 13, 1988 claim for disability benefits \u2014 as evidenced by his doctor\u2019s letter on February 24, 1989 \u2014 and therefore he was entitled to be restored to his original mail-handling position under \u00a7 8151(b)(1). Administrative Judge Puglia (\u201cAJ Puglia\u201d), in an Initial Decision, dismissed Mr. Marassa\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Marassa v. United States Postal Serv., </em>No. CH-0353-06-0725-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Dec.12, 2006). Regarding Mr. Marassa\u2019s claim that the Postal Service should have restored him in 1989 because he was by then fully recovered, AJ Puglia wrote, \u201cI find that [Mr. Marassa] is not a fully-recovered employee\u201d because under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.102 \u201c[a] \u2018fully-recovered\u2019 employee is one whose compensation payments have terminated,\u201d while Mr. Marassa \u201creceived OWCP benefits from February 23 through July 25, 1989, including February 24,1989, the date he claims he sought restoration as fully recovered.\u201d Regarding Mr. Marassa\u2019s claim that the Postal Service should have restored him in 2006, AJ Puglia wrote that Mr. Marassa \u201cwas removed, effective June 13, 1989, for unauthorized absence,\u201d and under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 353.302, \u201c[a]n employee who has been removed for cause rather than a compensable injury is not entitled to restoration.\u201d Finally, AJ Puglia noted that the Postal Service sought to dismiss Mr. Marassa\u2019s appeal \u201cas untimely by seventeen years,\u201d but, given the Board\u2019s lack of jurisdiction over the appeal, AJ Puglia expressly declined to decide whether the appeal was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-8\">On December 26, 2006, Mr. Marassa petitioned for review of AJ Puglia\u2019s decision by the full Board. The petition for review was denied on April 4, 2007, and Mr. Marassa appealed to the Federal Circuit. In a non-precedential opinion issued August 17, 2007, we affirmed on an alternative ground. <em>Marassa v. United States Postal Serv., </em>249 Fed.Appx. 177 (Fed.Cir. 2007) <em>(\"Marassa I\u201d). </em>We explained that the regulations in effect in 1989 provided for restoration under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8151(b)(1) if an employee fully recovered within one year of the date the employee was <em>first eligible </em>for compensation. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8151(b)(1); <em>Marassa I, </em>249 Fed.Appx. at 180 n. 3 (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 353.301, 303 (1989) as interpreted by <em>Gavette v. Department of the Treasury, </em>44 M.S.P.R. 166, 170, 177 (1990)). In Mr. Marassa\u2019s first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>appeal, he alleged that he was fully recovered on February 24,1989 \u2014 more than one year after he was first eligible for compensation on October 10, 1987 (the date to which his disability benefits were retroactively awarded) \u2014 and thus the Board did not have jurisdiction over his claim. <em>Marassa I</em>, 249 Fed.Appx. at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">\n<em>C. Mr. Marassa\u2019s Second Appeal to the Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">On August 24, 2007, Mr. Marassa filed a second appeal to the Board. He again challenged the Postal Service\u2019s refusal to restore him, and also challenged his removal from the Modified Custodial Laborer position in 1989. This time Mr. Marassa cited 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8151(b)(2), and requested the \u201crestoration of [his] employment in the USPS [w]ith the proper reinstatement in [his] former craft and or equivalent position as determined by 5 USC 8151(b)(2) (1989).\u201d He also contended that the Postal Service could not legally have removed him on June 13, 1989, because he was receiving compensation payments at that time and thus was not AWOL. Mr. Marassa\u2019s second appeal was assigned to Administrative Judge Chase (\u201cAJ Chase\u201d), who on September 20, 2007, issued an order to show cause why the doctrine of collateral estoppel would not apply to bar the appeal. Mr. Marassa responded that the doctrine did not apply because the first appeal concerned \u00a7 8151(b)(1) while the second appeal concerned \u00a7 8151(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">In an Initial Decision dated November 14, 2007, AJ Chase dismissed Mr. Marassa\u2019s second appeal. <em>Marassa v. United States Postal Serv., </em>No. CH-0752-07-0639-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov.14, 2007). AJ Chase concluded (1) that Mr. Marassa does not have standing to challenge his 1989 removal because he is not an employee and lacks veterans preference eligibility under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(B), and (2) that collateral estoppel bars Mr. Marassa from establishing the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over his second appeal from the Postal Service\u2019s refusal to restore him. Regarding collateral estoppel, AJ Chase noted that \u201c[AJ] Puglia found that [Mr. Marassa] was not a fully-recovered employee ... [and] was removed, effective June 13,1989, for unauthorized absence,\u201d and both findings established that Mr. Marassa is not entitled to restoration under \u00a7 8151.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Mr. Marassa filed a petition for review of AJ Chase\u2019s Initial Decision by the full Board. The petition for review was denied on March 6, 2008, 108 M.S.P.R. 576, and Mr. Marassa appealed to the Federal Circuit. We have jurisdiction over the Board\u2019s decision under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">\n<em>A. Applicable Legal Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Our authority is limited by statute. \u201cWe must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Campion v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>326 F.3d 1210, 1212 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)). The Board may apply collateral estoppel to dismiss an appeal where: \u201c(i) the issue previously adjudicated is identical with that now presented, (ii) that issue was actually litigated in the prior case, (iii) the previous determination of that issue was necessary to the end-decision then made, and (iv) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Dep\u2019t of Energy, </em>424 F.3d 1271, 1274-1275 (Fed.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>As we explained in <em>Marassa I, </em>the Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to those areas specifically provided for by statute, rule or regulation. <em>See Saunders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed.Cir.1985). The appellant bears the burden of establishing the Board\u2019s jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence, and must make nonfrivolous allegations to establish that jurisdiction is proper. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2)(i); <em>Coradeschi v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>439 F.3d 1329, 1332 (Fed. Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">An employee who recovers from injury or disability <em>within one year </em>is entitled under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8151(b)(1) to resume his former position or an equivalent position. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8151(b)(1). An employee who recovers after more than one year is not similarly entitled to full restoration, but under Section 8151(b)(2) is only \u201cguarantee[d] <em>priority consideration </em>in reemployment.\u201d <em>Gallo v. United States, </em>529 F.3d 1345, 1347 (Fed.Cir.2008) (emphasis added). <em>See also Kachanis v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>212 F.3d 1289, 1295 (Fed.Cir. 2000) (recognizing that \u00a7 8151(b)(1) affords workers injured for less than one year <em>absolute </em>priority in hiring and \u201c[i]f Congress had intended similar priority for workers injured more than one year, it would have done the same under section 8151(b)(2)[,][b]ut it did not\u201d). We have noted \u201cthe absence in section 8151(b)(2) of any details on the extent to which agencies are required to grant priority under that section, or on how agencies are to afford such priority,\u201d and have concluded that the statute grants \u201cthe Office of Personnel Management and the agencies discretion in such matters.\u201d <em>Kachanis, </em>212 F.3d at 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\n<em>B. The Parties\u2019 Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Here, Mr. Marassa contends that AJ Chase erred (1) by concluding that AJ Puglia had found Mr. Marassa to be not fully recovered from carpal tunnel syndrome \u2014 according to Mr. Marassa, AJ Puglia at least made inconsistent findings on this point and at most implied that he was fully recovered in July of 1989 \u2014 and (2) by applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel to his \u00a7 8151(b)(2) claim. He also argues (3) that he could not have been AWOL at the time of his removal in June of 1989 because he was receiving disability payments from OWCP at that time, and (4) that the Postal Service\u2019s failure to give him notice of his appeal rights constituted good cause for his late filing with the Board.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">The Postal Service agrees that AJ Chase misstated AJ Puglia\u2019s earlier finding regarding Mr. Marassa\u2019s recovery\u2014 although according to the Postal Service, AJ Puglia did indeed find that Mr. Marassa was not fully recovered <em>as of February 2Jh 1989 </em>\u2014 and offers that Mr. Marassa should not be barred by collateral estoppel from alleging that he <em>later </em>became a fully recovered employee. However, the Postal Service argues that we may affirm on the alternative grounds that Mr. Marassa (1) is not in-fact fully recovered and (2) has not formally requested placement on the Postal Service\u2019s reappointment list as required by regulations pertaining to \u00a7 8151(b)(2). <em>See 5 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 353.301(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">\n<em>C. Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">We hold that the Board erred in applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>to dismiss Mr. Marassa\u2019s second appeal. Although in the first appeal AJ Puglia did indeed make findings regarding Mr. Marassa\u2019s lack of full recovery and removal for cause in June of 1989, and did indeed conclude from these findings that the Board lacked jurisdiction, we did not rely on these findings in <em>Marassa I </em>and instead affirmed the Board\u2019s decision on an alternative ground. <em>See Marassa I, </em>249 Fed.Appx. at 178 n. 1 (\u201c[although <em>not relevant to our decision, </em>Marassa was removed from this position for being absent without official leave\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Id. </em>at 180 (affirming because \u201cMarassa has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was fully recovered by October 10, 1988 \u2014 one year after he was eligible for compensation\u201d). Thus, though the issues of Mr. Marassa\u2019s full recovery and removal were actually litigated in the first appeal, they were not essential to the judgment and cannot serve to collaterally estop Mr. Marassa from contesting jurisdiction in the second appeal. <em>See Morgan, </em>424 F.3d at 1274-1275; <em>cf. Mandich v. Watters, </em>970 F.2d 462, 465 (8th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe general rule is that, if a judgment is appealed, collateral estoppel only works as to those issues specifically passed upon by the appellate court.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">However, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision on an alternative ground. Mr. Marassa\u2019s second appeal requests the \u201crestoration of [his] employment in the USPS [w]ith the proper reinstatement in [his] former craft and or equivalent position as determined by 5 U.S.C. 8151(b)(2) (1989).\u201d As noted above, \u00a7 8151(b)(2) does not give an employee the right to restoration, only to priority consideration for reemployment within the framework established by Office of Personnel Management and agency regulations. Under this framework, in order to appeal a violation of \u00a7 8151(b)(2) an employee must present factual information that he was denied restoration <em>because of the employment of another person. See </em>5 C.F.R \u00a7 353.401(b) (1989) (later redesignated \u00a7 353.304(b), <em>see </em>60 F.R. 45,650, 45,-657 (Sept. 1, 1995)) (\u201cAn individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than 1 year after compensation begins may appeal to MSPB as provided for in parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees, respectively.\u201d); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 330.209 (competitive service employees) (\u201cAn individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under this sub-part have been violated <em>because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly </em>may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board\u2019s regulations.\u201d) (emphasis added) (regulation effective in 1989, <em>see </em>53 F.R. 45,065 (Nov. 8,1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">Mr. Marassa alleges that he was fully recovered from his injury on July 25, 1989, and that thereafter the Postal Service did not rehire him, but he does not allege that the Postal Service denied him priority over another person who could not otherwise have been properly appointed. We have explained that a petitioner must make a nonfrivolous allegation of this nature to establish the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Rasing v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>444 F.3d 1349, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2006) (\u201cThe Board lacked jurisdiction over any [reinstatement priority] claim by Mr. Rasing because Mr. Rasing failed to demonstrate the second jurisdictional requirement of section 330.209 \u2014 that any alleged violation of the [governing regulations] resulted in the appointment of a person \u2018who otherwise could not have been appointed properly.\u2019 \u201d). Because Mr. Marassa failed to make such an allegation here, he failed to establish the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over his \u00a7 8151(b)(2) claim, and the Board\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b902-5\">. We note, however, that neither Mr. Marassa\u2019s \u00a7 8151(b)(1) claim in the first appeal, nor his \u00a7 8151(b)(2) claim in the second appeal, were dismissed for untimely filing. To the extent that Mr. Marassa raises timeliness as part of a challenge to the Board\u2019s dismissal of his appeal of the Postal Service's 1989 removal decision, we affirm that the Board did not have jurisdiction over that removal decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
