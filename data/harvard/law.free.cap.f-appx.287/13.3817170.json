Solorio-Nunez contends (1) the district court erred in applying a felony \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) based upon his conviction for Willful Infliction of Corporal Injury to a Cohabitant under California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5, a \u201cwobbler\u201d statute; (2) the 41-month sentence imposed by the district court was proeedurally unreasonable because the court failed to fully consider the factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and (3) his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">I. Felony \u201cCrime of Violence\u201d Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">The district court properly applied an enhancement for a felony \u201ccrime of violence\u201d based upon the Solorio-Nunez\u2019s conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5. That section provides for punishment as a felony or as a misdemeanor and is therefore a \u201cwobbler\u201d under California law. However, a felony judgment was imposed when the California court sentenced Solorio-Nunez to three years incarceration in state prison, suspended execution of the sentence, and granted probation with 364 days in county jail as a condition of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">\u201cUnder California law, a \u2018wobbler\u2019 is presumptively a felony and \u2018remains a felony except when the discretion [of the trial court] is actually exercised\u2019 to make the crime a misdemeanor.\u201d <em>Ewing v. California, </em>538 U.S. 11, 16, 123 S.Ct. 1179, 155 L.Ed.2d 108 (2003) (quoting <em>People v. Williams, </em>27 Cal.2d 220, 163 P.2d 692, 696 (Cal.1945)). California Penal Code \u00a7 17(b) provides two ways for a court to exercise that discretion. <em>United States v. Diaz-Argueta, </em>447 F.3d 1167, 1169 (9th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-14\">When a crime is punishable, in the discretion of the court, by imprisonment in the state prison or by fine or imprisonment in the county jail, it is a misdemeanor for all purposes under the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-15\">(1) After a judgment imposing a punishment other than imprisonment in the state prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-16\">(3) When the court grants probation to a defendant without imposition of sentence and at the time of granting probation, or on application of the defendant or probation officer thereafter, the court declares the offense to be a misdemean- or.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-17\">Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 17(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-18\">Here, the California court did not exercise its discretion under either \u00a7 17(b)(1) or \u00a7 17(b)(3). A wobbler offense becomes a felony within the meaning of \u00a7 17(b) when the trial court sentences the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>dant to a term in state prison for that offense and then suspends execution of the sentence. <em>See People v. Wood, </em>62 Cal.App.4th 1262, 73 Cal.Rptr.2d 308, 311-12 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">To exercise its discretion under \u00a7 17(b)(1), the court must actually impose a misdemeanor sentence. With two exceptions which are not applicable here, misdemeanor sentences may not exceed one year. Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 19.2. Solorio-Nunez\u2019s sentence of three years imprisonment, with execution suspended, was therefore a felony sentence. Incarceration in the county jail was simply a condition of probation and does not \u201cconvert\u201d the sentence to a misdemeanor sentence. <em>See People v. Esters, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 917, 34 Cal.Rptr. 264, 267 (1963) (\u201c[T]he requirement that appellant serve time in the county jail as a condition of probation did not constitute imposition of sentence to the county jail\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">If a sentencing court suspends imposition of a sentence and grants probation, the court may later declare the offense to be a misdemeanor under \u00a7 17(b)(3). Here, rather than suspend imposition of a sentence, the state court imposed a prison sentence, but suspended its execution. Accordingly, \u00a7 17(b)(3) was not applicable. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>967 F.2d 287, 293 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201c[W]hen a sentencing court grants probation after a conviction, it may suspend the imposition of sentence, in which case no judgment of conviction is rendered, or it may impose sentence and order its execution stayed. In the latter case only, a judgment of conviction is rendered.\u201d (citing <em>People v. Arguello, </em>59 Cal.2d 475, 476, 30 Cal.Rptr. 333, 381 P.2d 5 (Cal.1963))).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">II. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">Solorio-Nunez argues the district court committed procedural error in sentencing by failing to adequately consider the factors enumerated under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Solorio-Nunez failed to object below. We therefore review for plain error. <em>United States v. Knows His Gun, </em>438 F.3d 913, 918 (9th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1214, 126 S.Ct. 2913, 165 L.Ed.2d 931 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Although the only 3553(a) factor the district court explicitly discussed on the record was the need to avoid unwai\u2019ranted sentencing disparities, the court reviewed the submitted papers. We therefore \u201ctake it\u201d the court gave the 3553(a) factors as outlined in the papers some consideration. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 996 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). In addition, the court did not fail to respond \u201cto a specific nonfrivolous argument tethered to a \u00a7 3553(a) factor.\u201d <em>See Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 992. Considering the record presented, we find the district court did not plainly err. <em>Cf. United States v. Stoterau, </em>524 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir.2008) (\u201c[WJhen a defendant\u2019s arguments are straightforward and uncomplicated, the district court does not abuse its discretion when it listens to the defendant\u2019s arguments and then \u2018simply [finds those] circumstances insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">III. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">This Court reviews the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Grissom, </em>525 F.3d 691, 696 (9th Cir.2008). This Court is to look at the totality of the circumstances, including the degree of variation from the Guideline range. <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-13\">Here, the properly-calculated Guideline range was 63 to 78 months im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>prisonment. The district court granted a four-level downward variance from a total offense level of 22 to a total offense level of 18. The district court sentenced the defendant to the low end of that range, 41 months. Considering the totality of the circumstances presented on the record, we find the sentence imposed is not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b34-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
