The BIA denied the motion to reconsider because it concluded that it had not made an error of fact or law in the denial of the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-22\">Ramos argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider because the denial of the motion to reopen was erroneous in fact and law. Ramos asserts that the evidence he presented with his motion to reopen was material, and obtained after his original removal hearing. Ramos also argues that he explained in his motion to reconsider why the evidence he submitted with his motion to reopen was unavailable for his initial hearing and did not include specific dates about the occurrences therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-23\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Assa\u2019ad v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003)). Our review of the BIA\u2019s decision is \u201climited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion\u201d and whether the manner in which it was exercised \u201chas been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation omitted) (reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C), INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329. \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)). A motion to reconsider will be denied if it is based on legal arguments that could have been made in an earlier proceeding. <em>In re O-S-G, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 56, 58 (BIA 2006). In addition, \u201c[a] motion to reconsider contests the correctness of the original decision based on the previous factual record, as opposed to a motion to reopen, which seeks a new hearing based on new or previously unavailable evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u201cA motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B), INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B). A motion to reopen \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(i), INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i). However, the 90-day time limitation does not apply to a motion to reopen based upon \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii). The movant in a motion to reopen \u201cbears a heavy burden\u201d and must present new evidence that would likely change the result in the case if the proceedings before the Immigration Judge were reopened. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 813 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">After reviewing the record, we conclude in this case that the BIA did not make any factual or legal errors in its denial of the motion to reopen. Furthermore, Ramos\u2019s arguments in his motion to reconsider reiterated previously made arguments or alleged new facts that should have been alleged in the motion to reopen. Thus, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to reconsider. Accordingly, we deny Ramos\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
