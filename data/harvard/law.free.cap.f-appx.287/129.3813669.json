Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005). <em>United States v. Najmehchi, </em>No. 04-0200 (2d Cir. Apr. 25, 2005) (ordering a <em>Crosby </em>remand). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and various proceedings in this court and the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-22\">We review sentencing decisions for reasonableness, asking \u201cwhether the sentencing judge exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion, committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 27 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 192, 166 L.Ed.2d 143 (2006) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted). \u201cReasonableness\u201d includes both procedural and substantive reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">At the original sentencing, the district court imposed a sentence of 97 months\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence at the lowest end of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range of 97 to 121 months. In reconsidering its sentence after the <em>Crosby </em>remand, the district court reimposed the original sentence, concluding that a sentence lower than the Guidelines recommended was not appropriate. On appeal, Najmehchi argues that his sentence should have been reduced in light of his acceptance of responsibility for his wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that Najmehchi\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable. Assessing procedural reasonableness requires considering \u201csuch factors as whether the district court properly (a) identified the Guidelines range supported by the facts found by the court, (b) treated the Guidelines as advisory, and (c) considered the Guidelines together with the other factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a). ...\u201d <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 131-132 (2d Cir.2006). The first of those factors, the issue of proper identification of the Guidelines range, was resolved on the first appeal, <em>United States v. Najmehchi, </em>118 Fed.Appx. 569, 570 (2d Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 854, 126 S.Ct. 122, 163 L.Ed.2d 129 (2005), and is not before us now. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>475 F.3d 468, 475-76 (2d Cir.2007) (applying the \u201claw of the case\u201d doctrine), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 881, 169 L.Ed.2d 739 (2008). As for the others, the district court explicitly stated that the sentencing decision was made as a result of \u201cconsidering all the factors under Section 3553(a).\u201d In addition, the court specifically referred to appellant\u2019s \u201ccriminal history,\u201d his \u201cfamily history,\u201d his \u201carrest conduct,\u201d and the \u201chistory of the litigation.\u201d That the court properly treated the Guidelines as advisory is evident from its having seriously considered the defendant\u2019s request for a sentence that was below the Guidelines recommendations, before concluding that in light of \u201cthe criminal conduct and the perjury\u201d which the defendant had committed, the defendant\u2019s specific circumstances did \u201cnot ... warrant a nonguidelines sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">Finally, we conclude that Najmehchi\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable, because it \u201cwas well within the broad range of reasonable sentences that the District Court could have imposed in the circumstances presented.\u201d <em>Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
