Because a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 is not categorically for an offense relating to counterfeiting and, under the modified categorical approach, the record in this case does not demonstrate unequivocally that the jury was required to find the requisite elements for an offense relating to counterfeiting, we grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">The Immigration and Nationality Act defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as, inter alia, an \u201coffense relating to ... counterfeiting ... for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R). Resurrecci\u00f3n was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. To determine whether a conviction under \u00a7 2314 is for an offense \u201crelating to ... counterfeiting,\u201d we apply the \u201ccategorical\u201d approach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>set forth in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). First, we assess whether the statute of conviction encompasses offenses that are narrower than or equal to the federal definition of an offense \u201crelating to [counterfeiting].\u201d <em>Vizcarra-Ayala v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 870, 874 (9th Cir.2008). If so, the conviction necessarily is for an offense \u201crelating to [counterfeiting].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The BIA found Resurrecci\u00f3n ineligible for cancellation of removal and waiver of inadmissibility because it concluded that his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 was for an offense \u201crelating to counterfeiting,\u201d and therefore qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R). This was error. Section 2314 covers conduct that is beyond the core offense of counterfeiting. It includes, for example, ordinary interstate transportation of stolen property. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, a conviction under \u00a7 2314 is not categorically a conviction for an offense \u201crelating to counterfeiting,\u201d even if we construe the meaning of \u201crelating to\u201d broadly.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">When the statute of conviction is facially over-inclusive, as it is here, the court may conduct a modified categorical approach to determine whether the record unequivocally establishes that the conviction necessarily included the requisite elements of the offense \u201crelating to counterfeiting.\u201d <em>See Vizcarra-Ayala, </em>514 F.3d at 877. To satisfy the modified categorical approach in the case of a jury conviction, as here, the record of conviction must establish that the \u201c \u2018jury was actually required to find all the elements\u2019 of [the generic offense].\u201d <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1211 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143), <em>superseded on other grounds by </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 4 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">In this case, the agency did not reach the modified categorical approach, and the government contends that under <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam), we lack the authority to decide issues that have not been decided at the agency level. But <em>Ventura </em>is inapplicable here because the BIA did decide the issue of whether Resurreccion\u2019s conviction was an aggravated felony \u2014 albeit under the categorical approach, rather than the modified categorical approach. Where the agency has decided whether a conviction is an aggravated felony, we may reach the question even if the agency stopped short of the modified categorical analysis. <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 1121, 1132-34 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc) (distinguishing <em>Ventura </em>and applying the modified categorical approach in the first instance because agency addressed the issue under the categorical approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">Because Resurrecci\u00f3n is seeking cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a), he has the burden of proving that he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>Sandoval-Lua v. Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 1121, 1130 (9th Cir.2007). However, we have held that an alien bears his burden of proof on this issue when he produces an inconclusive record of conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Applying the modified categorical approach, we conclude that the evidence in this record is insufficient to show that Resurreccion\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 was necessarily for an offense \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>lating to counterfeiting.\u201d Here, the only judicially noticeable document in the record establishing the conviction was the judgment, which indicates that Resurrecci\u00f3n was found guilty on count three under \u201c18 USC 2314\u201d and which labels the crime as \u201cTransportation of Counterfeited Securities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The judgment in this case does not specify the elements under which Resurrecci\u00f3n was convicted; it cites the statute. The name of the statute obviously does not narrow the offense, since we have just held that the statute is overbroad, and the judgment does not specify a subsection. The judgment\u2019s label of \u201cTransportation of Counterfeited Securities\u201d does not establish the missing facts under the modified categorical approach. <em>See Huerta-Guevara v. Ashcroft, </em>321 F.3d 883 (9th Cir. 2003). Likewise, the sentencing judge\u2019s reference to \u201ccounterfeit instrument\u201d in the judgment does not suffice because sentencing findings are not cognizable under the modified categorical approach. <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 892, 898 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Finally, Resurreccion\u2019s admission in a motion that he was convicted for transportation of counterfeited securities and a statement in a judicial opinion describing the nature of Resurreccion\u2019s conviction are insufficient because they are not judicially noticeable documents we can consider under the modified categorical approach. <em>See Tokatly v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 613, 623 (9th Cir.2004) (rejecting government\u2019s request to expand \u201cthis court\u2019s \u2014 and the Board\u2019s \u2014 strict rules against extra-record of conviction evidence\u201d to include statements in a brief or judicial admissions).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Because a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 is not categorically for an offense \u201crelating to counterfeiting\u201d and the record of conviction in this case does not demonstrate unequivocally that the jury was required to find the requisite elements for an offense relating to counterfeiting, we GRANT the petition and remand to the BIA for further proceedings not inconsistent with this memorandum disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b577-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b577-14\">. Resurreccion argued in his brief that his conviction was not for an aggravated felony because he lacked the intent to defraud. He did not brief the precise legal arguments on which we decided the case, i.e., whether his conviction was \"generic\" using the categorical and modified categorical approaches. Nevertheless, he adequately preserved the question by contending his conviction for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 is not an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101. <em>See Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>466 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc) (treating question of whether a conviction under \u00a7 2314 is an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(R) as one issue, encompassing both categorical and modified categorial approaches). Likewise, there was adequate administrative exhaustion because Resurrecci\u00f3n argued to the BIA that his conviction for 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 was \"not an offense of counterfeiting per se, within the meaning of \u00a7 101(a)(43)(R).\u201d \"A petitioner need not ... raise the <em>precise </em>argument below.\u201d <em>Vizcarra-Ayala v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 870, 873 (9th Cir.2008) (finding administrative exhaustion even though petition did not set forth specific legal grounds, but the petitioner did specify issue that formed basis of appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\">. The government contends that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314 \"relates to\u201d counterfeiting and that the \"relating to\u201d language has been construed broadly. However, \u00a7 2314 could be violated without <em>any </em>counterfeiting having occurred to which a defendant\u2019s conduct could \"relate.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
