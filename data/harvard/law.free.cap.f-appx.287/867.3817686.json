Because Mr. Lanzo raises no issue within this court\u2019s scope of review, we <em>dismiss </em>the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">Mr. Lanzo served in the U.S. Army from October 1979 to November 1982. In 1988 he underwent surgery to remove an exostosis \u2014 a benign bony growth \u2014 on his right foot. Mr. Lanzo filed a claim for service connection for the disability that led to the surgery. With his claim for service connection, he filed a report stating that in 1982, while he was on active duty, a road wheel from a tank fell on his foot while he was attempting to change it. No report of the injury, however, was shown in his service medical records. His claim was therefore denied by the regional office in 1989 and the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-14\">In the 1990s Mr. Lanzo attempted to reopen his claim by submitting affidavits from two private physicians and lay affidavits from family members and a neighbor. In 2000, following his appeal of an adverse decision by the regional office, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals reopened his claim and remanded it to the regional office for further proceedings. On remand, the regional office again denied the claim. In 2003 the Board remanded Mr. Lanzo\u2019s claim once again, this time for a medical examination. The medical examiner concluded that the condition of Mr. Lanzo\u2019s right foot was not related to the injury he sustained in 1982. Relying on the examiner\u2019s conclusion, the Board in 2005 upheld the denial of Mr. Lanzo\u2019s claim based on the lack of a nexus between his current condition and the injury he sustained to his right foot while he was on active duty. In its opinion the Board stated that it gave little weight to the first private physician\u2019s opinion that Mr. Lanzo\u2019s foot injury was service connected because the opinion merely stated the physician\u2019s conclusion and did not provide any reasons or evidence in support of that conclusion. Likewise, the Board found the second physician\u2019s opinion insufficient to support Mr. Lanzo\u2019s claim because it was based entirely on Mr. Lanzo\u2019s recitation of the history of his injury, and because the physician had recommended that Mr. Lanzo obtain an opinion from an orthopedist. The Board further explained that the lay affidavits from Mr. Lanzo\u2019s family members did not provide any added support for Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>Lanzo\u2019s claim because none of the family members were present when the injury occurred and their knowledge of the accident was based only on Mr. Lanzo\u2019s reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">On appeal to the Veterans Court, Mr. Lanzo raised two arguments. First, he argued that the Board\u2019s reliance on the 2004 examination by a Department of Veterans Affairs medical examiner was improper because the examiner\u2019s report inaccurately described how his in-service foot injury occurred, stating that \u201che fell on his right foot.\u201d The court rejected that argument because the report later showed that the examiner understood that Mr. Lanzo\u2019s assertion was that the injury occurred as the result of a wheel falling on his right foot. Second, Mr. Lanzo argued that the Board did not adequately explain its reasons for discounting the lay affidavits. The court rejected that argument because the Board had stated that it found those affidavits insufficient to establish a nexus between his alleged in-service injury and his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Mr. Lanzo now appeals from the decision of the Veterans Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">The Veterans Court addressed each of Mr. Lanzo\u2019s arguments and found no clear error in the Board\u2019s conclusion that the record showed \u201ca lack of credible medical evidence of a nexus between the injury and [Mr. Lanzo\u2019s] disability.\u201d To the extent that Mr. Lanzo requests that we reweigh the evidence before the Board, we may not do so under this court\u2019s limited scope of review of decisions of the Veterans Court. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">Mr. Lanzo argues that the Veterans Court misunderstood that his claim for service connection was based on an injury to his right foot and not to his left foot. Presumably, that argument is directed to the court\u2019s statement that the examiner \u201cnoted the in-service treatment of his right foot for multiple corns and both feet for a fungus infection.\u201d Mr. Lanzo states that he has never had a fungus infection on his left foot and that his left foot, not his right foot, has corns. Even if the examiner\u2019s statement misidentified Mr. Lanzo\u2019s feet, that error is purely factual, and we have no jurisdiction to review challenges to factual determinations. 38 U.S.C \u00a7 7292(d)(2)(A). In any event, Mr. Lanzo\u2019s argument does not address the Veterans Court\u2019s and the Board\u2019s reliance on the examiner\u2019s conclusion that the present condition of Mr. Lanzo\u2019s right foot was not related to his 1982 injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">Because Mr. Lanzo\u2019s appeal presents no issue within this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
