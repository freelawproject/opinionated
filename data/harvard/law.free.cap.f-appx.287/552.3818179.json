Our jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>tion is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to remand. <em>Movsisian v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 1095, 1098 (9th Cir.2005). We review de novo questions of law. <em>Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir. 2004). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Fonseca-Ramirez\u2019s motion to remand because the record indicates that the IJ reviewed Fonseca-Ramirez\u2019s pleadings with current counsel at the April 7, 2003 merits hearing. Moreover, the IJ properly used the abstract of judgment to establish the fact of Fonseca-Ramirez\u2019s conviction. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(3)(B) (listing permissible documents for proof of conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Fonseca-Ramirez failed to exhaust before the BIA his contention that Cal. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11378 is a divisible statute, and we are not persuaded that \u201cthere has been a change, or at least a significant clarification, of the law since the [BIA\u2019s] decision.\u201d <em>Huerta-Guevara v. Ashcroft, </em>321 F.3d 883, 886 (9th Cir.2003). We therefore dismiss this aspect of the petition for review. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (court generally lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Fonseca-Ramirez\u2019s remaining arguments are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
