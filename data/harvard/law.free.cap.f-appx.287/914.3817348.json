He now appeals, claiming that the district court (Daniels, J.) was guided by the wrong legal standard. According to the defendant, the court erred in sentencing him by employing the appellate standard of reasonableness instead of following the parsimony clause of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), which requires that a sentence be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">However, in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>we noted that the use of the word \u201creasonable\u201d at sentencing does not automatically create reversible error. 475 F.3d 468, 477 (2d Cir.2007). In determining whether the district court adhered to the appropriate legal standard, the critical issue is whether the court understood its obligation to impose a sentence that was no greater than necessary, not what specific language the court used. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">It is clear from the sentencing transcript that the district court here properly understood the governing standard and applied it. The court\u2019s obligation to impose the lowest sufficient sentence was the basis for the defendant\u2019s argument that a non-Guidelines sentence was appropriate, and whether the Guidelines sentence was greater than necessary was the only issue before the court That the court chose not to consider the charges still pending against the defendant as an aggravating factor but decided that a Guidelines sentence was nevertheless warranted given the defendant\u2019s criminal record, type of criminal record, and the significant time he had previously served demonstrates that the court understood \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s dictate. Moreover, the court explicitly stated that it \u201cconsidered all of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in this case\u201d as well as \u201cthe arguments made in writing by the defense,\u201d which included significant discussion of the parsimony clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">It is clear that the court considered the defendant\u2019s parsimony clause argument but simply disagreed with the defendant and, despite using the word reasonable, imposed a sentence that was \u201csufficient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>but not greater than necessary.\u201d Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
