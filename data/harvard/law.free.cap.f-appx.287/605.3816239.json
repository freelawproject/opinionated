Arturo Perez-Morales raised several challenges to his conviction and sentence. We previously ruled on all but one of these challenges. <em>See United States v. Perez-Morales, </em>221 Fed.Appx. 545 (9th Cir.2007). We deferred ruling on Perez-Morales\u2019 sentencing challenge pending resolution of <em>Claiborne v. United </em>States, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2245, 167 L.Ed.2d 1080 (2007) (mem.), and <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). <em>Perez-Morales, </em>221 Fed.Appx. at 546. For the reasons set forth below, we now affirm the sentence of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">We will only set aside a sentence when it is procedurally erroneous or substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Carty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 993 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc). Perez-Morales argues that the district court erroneously treated the Guidelines as presumptively correct instead of advisory. <em>See Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 993. We disagree. After calculating Perez-Morales\u2019 sentence under the Guidelines, the district court stated that the Guidelines are \u201cjust an advisory range, and only taken as one factor among many that I should consider under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553.\u201d The district court then considered the mitigating factors presented by Perez-Morales and tailored his sentence to his individual crime and his individual characteristics. <em>See id. </em>at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">Perez-Morales also argues that the district court improperly \u201cdouble-counted\u201d his prior drug trafficking conviction to enhance his criminal history score and to raise the guideline offense level. We disagree. Sentencing courts are permitted to use a defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction as the basis for an increase and in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history score. <em>See United States v. Luna-Herrera, </em>149 F.3d 1054, 1056 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentence of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b626-24\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
