R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b639-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">David Barrios appeals from the 57-month sentence imposed upon remand following his guilty-plea conviction for importation of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Barrios contends that the district court erred by denying him a minor role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), because he was substantially less culpable than his co-participants and he lacked the mental capacity to be anything other than a minor participant. We conclude that the district court did not err. <em>See United States v. Lui, </em>941 F.2d 844, 849 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that substantial amounts of narcotics is grounds for refusing to grant a sentence reduction); <em>see also United States v. Howard, </em>894 F.2d 1085, 1088-89 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Barrios also contends that the government breached the plea agreement by arguing on appeal that the district court did not err in refusing to grant him a minor role adjustment and that the government is estopped from taking this position on appeal. We conclude that a plain reading of the plea agreement demonstrates that the government is not bound to any position regarding a minor role adjustment on appeal. <em>See United States v. Schuman, </em>127 F.3d 815, 817-18 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (concluding no breach of the plea agreement where agreement did not specify that the government would move for a downward adjustment).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Barrios\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b639-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
