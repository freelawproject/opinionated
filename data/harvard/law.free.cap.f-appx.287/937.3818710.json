Gordon-Uruakpa denying petitioner\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zheng, </em>No. A 98 717 813 (B.I.A. Sept. 28, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 717 813 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 8, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court ordinarily reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir. 2005). Here, however, we decline to review the IJ\u2019s decision because Petitioner failed to exhaust any of the arguments he makes before this Court. In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust the categories of relief they seek, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), petitioners must also raise to the BIA the specific issues he or she later raises in this Court. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). While not jurisdictional, this judicially imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Zheng argues before this Court that the IJ erred in finding that he did not establish past persecution, a well-founded fear of persecution, or a likelihood of persecution or torture based on his resistance to China\u2019s family planning policy. In his Notice of Appeal to the BIA, though, he asserted only that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding was erroneous and that he \u201cmet the burden of proof.\u201d However, the IJ never made a credibility finding and Petitioner\u2019s bare assertion that he met his burden of proof is insufficient to preserve any issue for this Court\u2019s review. <em>See Lin Zhong, </em>480 F.3d at 119-20. Accordingly, the petition for review must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
