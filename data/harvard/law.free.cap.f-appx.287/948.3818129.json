Kargapolov, a native and citizen of Russia, seeks review of a December 4, 2007 order of the BIA affirming the March 13, 2006 decision of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Gabriel C. Videla denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Dmitriy V. Kargapolov, </em>No. A98 977 677 (B.I.A. Dec. 4, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 977 677 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Mar. 13, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">Because Kargapolov failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination before the BIA, and because the Government has identified that failure, we decline to consider the challenge he makes before this Court in the first instance. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1, 123 (2d Cir.2007). To the extent the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was dispositive of Kargapolov\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, his failure to exhaust is fatal to those claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">The Government also argues that this Court may not consider Kargapolov\u2019s argument that the IJ\u2019s biased conduct at his hearing deprived him of his due process rights. We find, however, that such argument was exhausted where Kargapolov ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>gued that the proceedings were \u201cunfair\u201d and the BIA addressed the merits of that argument. <em>See Xian Tuan Ye v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>446 F.3d 289, 296-97 (2d Cir.2006). Nonetheless, we find no merit to Kargapolov\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">An individual in removal proceedings is entitled to due process of law under the Fifth Amendment. <em>See Reno v. Flores, </em>507 U.S. 292, 305-07, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993). In order \u201c[t]o establish a violation of due process, [he] must show that [he] was denied a full and fair opportunity to present [his] claims or that the IJ or BIA otherwise deprived [him] of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Burger v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 131, 134 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotations omitted). In his brief to this Court, Kargapolov cites to several portions of the transcript in which the IJ questioned him, and asserts that in denying his case, the IJ relied on \u201cirrelevant considerations\u201d and made certain remarks about his demeanor. However, Kargapolov has not demonstrated that the IJ\u2019s conduct in questioning him was improper; indeed, as the BIA noted, an IJ is empowered to \u201cinterrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses\u201d in a removal proceeding. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l). While Kargapolov asserts that the IJ\u2019s conduct was hostile throughout his questioning, he fails to demonstrate that the IJ\u2019s conduct denied him \u201ca full and fair opportunity\u201d to present his claims. <em>Burger, </em>498 F.3d at 134. Accordingly, he has not shown that the IJ\u2019s conduct violated his due process rights. <em>Cf. Islam v. Gonzales, </em>469 F.3d 53 (2d Cir.2006) (remanding where \u201can IJ\u2019s conduct results in the appearance of bias or hostility such that [the Court] cannot conduct a meaningful review of the decision below\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
