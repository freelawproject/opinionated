We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">At all relevant times Smith, a veteran, was employed at the Houston VA Medical Center. One day in March 2006, after reporting to work, Smith found himself in need of emergency medical care. He was hospitalized for approximately five days. Around this time, Smith alleges that his co-workers at the VA Medical Center accessed his medical records without authorization and disclosed his personal information to others. Smith claims to have suffered physical and mental injuries as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Smith filed this Privacy Act claim in district court on May 12, 2006. Defendants filed a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Defendants argued that because Smith\u2019s injuries arose in the context of his employment, his sole remedy was under FECA, and he would have to pursue his claims with the Secretary. On May 15, 2007, 516 F.Supp.2d 832, the district court denied the motion to dismiss, but found a substantial question as to whether FECA governed Smith\u2019s claims. The district court ordered this action held in abeyance pending the Secretary of Labor\u2019s determination whether FECA applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Shortly after the district court issued its abatement ruling, it came to light that Smith had already filed a claim for FECA benefits on May 22, 2006, only days after filing his Privacy Act lawsuit. In his FECA claim, Smith had complained that \u201csupervisors and co-workers gave out my mental health diagnosis to other co-[wo]rkers.\u201d The Secretary disallowed Smith\u2019s FECA claim for insufficient evidence on July 5, 2006. Smith did not seek reconsideration by the Secretary, and the decision became final during the pendency of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">The district court ruled that the Secretary\u2019s decision was a denial of Smith\u2019s claim on the merits, not a determination that Smith\u2019s claims were outside FECA\u2019s coverage. Because the Secretary\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s claim precluded any other remedy, the district court dismissed Smith\u2019s Privacy Act claim for lack of jurisdiction. Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">FECA functions as a federal workers\u2019 compensation act, providing coverage for personal injury sustained in the performance of an employee\u2019s duties. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102(a). When a federal employee\u2019s injury falls within the scope of FECA, FECA is exclusive of any other remedy. <em>White v. United States, </em>143 F.3d 232, 234 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>451 F.2d 963, 965 (5th Cir.1971) (noting that FECA is \u201cintended to serve as a substitute rather than a supplement for the tort suit\u201d). Congress has given the Secretary of Labor exclusive authority to administer FECA and to decide all questions arising under FECA, including the question of coverage. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8145; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>White, </em>143 F.3d at 237. The actions of the Secretary in allowing or denying payment of benefits under FECA are \u201cnot subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b)(2). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cFECA contains an unambiguous and comprehensive provision barring any judicial review of the Secretary of Labor\u2019s determination of FECA coverage. Consequently, the courts have no jurisdiction over FTCA claims where the Secretary determines that FECA applies.\u201d <em>Sw. Marine, Inc. v. Gizoni, </em>502 U.S. 81, 90, 112 S.Ct. 486, 116 L.Ed.2d 405 (1992) (internal citations and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Because the Secretary has sole authority to administer FECA, the courts\u2019 jurisdiction in this area is limited to determining whether a \u201csubstantial question\u201d of coverage under FECA exists. <em>White, </em>143 F.3d at 234. As a rule, there is a substantial question of coverage unless it is certain as a matter of law that the Secretary would find the claim outside the scope of FECA. <em>Id.; Concordia v. United States Postal Service, </em>581 F.2d 439, 442 (5th Cir.1978). If there is a \u201csubstantial question,\u201d a plaintiff cannot pursue a tort action unless he first obtains a determination from the Secretary that FECA does not apply. <em>Bennett v. Barnett, </em>210 F.3d 272, 277 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Bailey, </em>451 F.2d at 965. If the Secretary concludes that a claim <em>is </em>governed by FECA, the courts have no jurisdiction either to review that determination or to consider the underlying claim. <em>Id.; SW Marine, </em>502 U.S. at 90, 112 S.Ct. 486. This is true whether or not the Secretary ultimately allows benefits under FECA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b); <em>Bennett, </em>210 F.3d at 277; <em>see also Tippetts v. United States, </em>308 F.3d 1091, 1094 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In this case, our review is curtailed because the Secretary exercised jurisdiction over Smith\u2019s claim before the district court even reached the matter. Smith argues that the district court erred in finding a substantial question as to FECA coverage. This point is moot. By the time the district court considered the issue, Smith had already (unbeknownst to the court) submitted his claim to the Secretary, who denied it, not for lack of coverage, but for insufficient proof. This court has determined that such a denial is conclusive as to FECA coverage: \u201cBy ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence, the Secretary thought coverage existed. Thus, the district court did not have jurisdiction to try the claim.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>210 F.3d at 277 and n. 7 (\u201cHad the Secretary of Labor agreed with [plaintiff], the Secretary would have dismissed the claim for lack of coverage; however, the dismissal was based on lack of proof.\u201d). As in <em>Bennett, </em>the Secretary\u2019s denial of Smith\u2019s claim on the merits is fatal to his federal court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Smith complains that he was \u201cill-advised as to the Application of FECA and the Privacy Act to his claims.\u201d Smith\u2019s reasons for seeking FECA benefits from the Secretary are irrelevant. <em>See Grijalva v. United States, </em>781 F.2d 472, 474 (5th Cir. 1986). In <em>Grijalva </em>the Secretary\u2019s prior determination of FECA coverage precluded plaintiffs subsequent tort action. <em>Id. </em>In an effort to undermine the Secretary\u2019s determination, the plaintiff argued that \u201cthe accident affected her mental capacity and made her incapable of submitting an informed and voluntary application for benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Grijalva </em>court dismissed this argument as immaterial: \u201cRegardless of her mental capacity at the time she sought [FECA] benefits, she did so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the plaintiff in <em>Grijalva </em>wished to contest her eligibility under FECA, she was required to seek review from the Secretary. <em>Id. </em>(citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(a)). So here. If Smith believed the Secretary\u2019s determination was in error, his recourse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>was to the Secretary. This court is without power to order the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">We emphasize that we are not deciding whether Smith\u2019s injuries are covered under FECA. <em>See White, </em>143 F.3d at 238. Smith filed a FECA claim for these injuries with the Secretary, and the Secretary found FECA applicable. That decision precludes any further action on Smith\u2019s Privacy Act claims. The judgment of the district court dismissing for lack of jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
