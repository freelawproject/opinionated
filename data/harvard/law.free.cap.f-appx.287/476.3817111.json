In addition, he argues that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause proscribes the district court\u2019s preponderance-of-the-evidenee finding that he distributed more than three kilograms of heroin. Because the district court imposed a reasonable sentence and because judicial factfinding at sentencing does not violate a defendant\u2019s right to due process, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">Over the course of at least three trips, Williams transported heroin from New York City to Cincinnati for distribution. An informant tipped the Regional Enforcement and Narcotics Unit (RENU) to Williams\u2019s activities, and RENU agents arrested Williams in an apartment as he was packaging freshly transported heroin for individual sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">The Government charged Williams with two counts: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin (Count One), and \u2014 for the unsold drugs he had on the day of his arrest \u2014 possession with intent to distribute in excess of one kilogram of heroin (Count Two). Ultimately, he pleaded guilty to Count One in exchange for the Government\u2019s promise to forgo prosecuting Count Two and other potential money-laundering offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">After accepting Williams\u2019s guilty plea, the court found that he transported more than three kilograms and sentenced him at the top of the applicable range. Williams\u2019s appeal secured a limited <em>Booker </em>remand from this court, but sentencing under the newly advisory Guidelines resulted in the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">In addition to arguing that his sentence is generally unreasonable, Williams targets several alleged problems with the district court\u2019s judgment, urging that the district court ignored his age, understated his employment history, overstated his criminal history, overestimated his likelihood of recidivism, and disregarded his post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct. He also says the court violated his Fifth Amendment right to due process when it found the three-kilogram quantity by a mere preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">A. <em>Reasonableness Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-17\">Although Williams does not categorize his sentencing arguments, we read them to make both procedural and substantive complaints. To review sentences, we first determine whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d then \u201cconsider the substantive reasonable<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">1. <em>Procedural Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>Gall </em>discusses several examples of procedural errors, and Williams targets \u201cfailing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u201d and \u201cselecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To adequately explain a sentence, a judge need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own decision-making authority,\u201d but \u201cwhen a judge decides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United </em>States, \u2014U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Williams contends that the district court summarily discounted his age and mischaracterized his employment history. When invited by the court to offer objections to the sentence, Williams neither pressed the court to explain why his age did not sway it nor argued that the court unfairly characterized his work history, so we apply plain error review to his procedural-unreasonableness claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">a) <em>Age</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-12\">First, Williams argues that the district court disregarded his age when it dismissed the argument with one bare reference to his 51 years. We cannot fault the district court for giving this factor short shrift. Advisory Guidelines policy instructs that \u201c[a]ge ... is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted\u201d unless \u201cthe defendant is elderly and infirm and ... a form of punishment such as home confinement might be equally efficient as and less costly than incarceration.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.1. Williams argues that he should be released at age 65 instead of age 70 because he will be \u201cinfirm\u201d by age 65, but the PSR indicates that Williams is in good health for the time being, making Williams\u2019s argument too speculative to show plain error on that basis alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">Even putting health issues aside, Williams persists, his age deserved consideration because studies confirm that recidivism decreases with age. Williams cites data from a Sentencing Commission report indicating that only 41.1% of 51-year-old defendants in his criminal history category reoffend. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Comm\u2019n, <em>Measuring Recidivism: The Criminal History Computation of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines </em>28 (2004), <em>available at </em>http://www.ussc.gov/publieat/Recidivism_ General.pdf. Although the <em>average </em>51-year-old Category VI offender may not return to crime, sentencing mandates individualized assessments. Williams\u2019s crimes actually escalated as he got older, undermining the inference he draws from the Sentencing Commission\u2019s report. <em>See United States v. Bullion, </em>466 F.3d 574, 577 (7th Cir.2006) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s argument that his likelihood of recidivism would decrease with age, given his particularly violent history).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-16\">Moreover, Williams contends that the district court\u2019s judgment fails to appreciate that a lengthy incarceration will deprive him of the chance to prove his rehabilitation through legitimate employment, yet he does not explain how his employment prospects will differ materially if he is released at age 65 instead of age 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-17\">b) <em>Employment History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-18\">Williams argues that the district court slighted his work experience when it stated that \u201cMr. Williams has no verifiable substantial work history\u201d and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>showed \u201cunwillingness or inability to maintain any substantial legitimate employment.\u201d J.A. 97-98. He argues that his three-year track record maintaining his mother\u2019s properties in exchange for $100 to $150 per week and free rent, together with \u201cvarious temporary jobs in the building trades area,\u201d amounts to a substantial work history. <em>See </em>J.A. 118. Given that Williams\u2019s mother was the only person to verify his maintenance work and that Williams provided no specifics about his \u201ctemporary jobs,\u201d the district court did not unfairly characterize his work history, especially given that Williams had reached middle age by the time of sentencing. Williams himself told the court, \u201c[U]p until this point in my life [the period of incarceration between his sentencing and resentencing], I\u2019ve never had regular employment.\u201d J.A. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The district court explained that Williams\u2019s sketchy work history made him more prone to recidivism. J.A. 97-98. That is, if released without a sufficiently deterrent punishment, Williams would likely return to a criminal livelihood, as he had done in the past. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.9 (\u201cThe degree to which a defendant depends upon criminal activity for a livelihood is relevant in determining the appropriate sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">c) <em>Explanation of Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Williams challenges as deficient the district court\u2019s explanation of his sentence, but our review of the sentencing transcript confirms that the district court addressed all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Of the need \u201cto reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), the district court observed that Williams \u201ccommitted a Class A felony, which is the most serious category of offense, and consequently a significant term of imprisonment is required to reflect the seriousness of this offense and to impose an appropriate punishment.\u201d J.A. 98. The district court noted \u2018Williams\u2019s drug abuse history, extensive criminal history and unwillingness or inability to maintain any substantial legitimate employment,\u201d despite his earning an associate\u2019s degree. These traits marked him a likely recidivist, requiring the court \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). In addition, the court acknowledged an earlier rehabilitation program that Williams completed, but found that he needed \u201caftercare follow-up\u201d so he would not \u201crevert to the use of controlled substances.\u201d J.A. 97; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). Finally, the court stated that \u201cprotecting the public from further crimes of the defendant and deterrence should be the main goals in fashioning an appropriate sentence for Mr. Williams.\u201d J.A. 98; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B), (C).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The district court explained Williams\u2019s sentence, as well as its rejection of his mitigating arguments as required; we find no procedural error, plain or otherwise, to persuade us to disturb his sentence. <em>See United States v. Vonner, </em>516 F.3d 382, 386 (2008) (en banc); <em>see generally </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">2. <em>Substantive Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Williams\u2019s remaining sentencing arguments implicate substantive unreasonableness. \u201cA sentence may be substantively unreasonable where the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Liou, </em>491 F.3d 334, 337 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotations and brackets omitted). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>This court reviews the length of sentences \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Bolds, </em>511 F.3d 568, 578 (6th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 591). Because the Sentencing Guidelines are the product of \u201cthe Sentencing Commission[\u2019s] examination of] tens of thousands of sentences and work [ ] with the help of many others in the law enforcement community over a long period of time,\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2464, within-Guidelines sentences are afforded a presumption of reasonableness, <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>436 F.3d 706, 708 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also Vonner, </em>516 F.3d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Williams complains that the sentence weighed his criminal history too heavily, given \u201cthe dreary, but typical, pattern that a low-level drug-addict can acquire: crimes involving relatively small amounts of property and crimes involving the possession of drugs.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 15. But cumulatively, the crimes made Williams a Category VI offender \u2014 the highest offender category \u2014 and Kentucky considered him a \u201cPersistent Felony Offender.\u201d Although Williams describes himself as a non-violent offender and points out that he did not have a weapon when he was arrested, his history is not without dangerous offenses. For one thing, Williams pleaded guilty to armed robbery in Kentucky. For another, he fled from police three separate times, triggering this court\u2019s recognition that fleeing, eluding, and escape \u201ccreate [ ] a conspicuous potential risk of injury to pedestrians, vehicles sharing the road, passengers in the fleeing car and the pursuing officer.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>378 F.3d 578, 582 (6th Cir.2004). Given this history, \u201cit was reasonable for the district court to place substantial weight on [his] criminal history in reaching its sentencing determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 384 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Williams next insists that the sentence over-penalizes him for the seriousness of his offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (\u201cThe court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary....\u201d). Williams argues that he deserved a lower Guidelines sentence because he sold drugs as a small-scale activity to support his drug habit. Undermining this argument, the district court considered that drug proceeds also supported buying a BMW, fur coats, and jewelry \u2014 the subjects of a later forfeiture action.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Nor did the district court double-count the nature of his offense by commenting on the \u201cresurgence of heroin in society.\u201d This statement actually comes from Williams\u2019s first sentencing hearing, not his <em>second </em>sentencing hearing. Regardless, because \u00a7 3553(a) specifically requires the district court to impose a sentence that will \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense,\u201d among other factors, the district court could \u2014 -and, indeed, is encouraged to \u2014 comment on the nature of the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Next, Williams urges the view that the district court took incomplete account of his \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), by declining to consider his post-sentencing rehabilitative conduct. Our <em>United States v. Worley, </em>453 F.3d 706, 709-10 (6th Cir.2006), which held that considering post-sentencing conduct unfairly benefits a defendant who has the good fortune of a <em>Booker </em>remand, defeats this argument as do many decisions after <em>Worley </em>reinforcing its sound policy. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sexton, </em>512 F.3d 326, 333 (6th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he district court was not permitted to consider the defendants\u2019 post-sentencing conduct for purposes of <em>Booker </em>resentencing.\u201d); <em>United States v. Keller, </em>498 F.3d 316, 324 (6th Cir.2007) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(\u201c[Consideration of post-sentencing factors is incompatible with the limited scope of a <em>Booker </em>remand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Having determined that the district court did not overemphasize the seriousness of Williams\u2019s offense, that it reasonably characterized Williams\u2019s criminal history as serious, and that it properly refused to consider Williams\u2019s post-sentencing conduct, we find no abuse of sentencing discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">B. <em>Due Process Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Williams argues that the Fifth Amendment guarantees defendants the right to have sentencing facts found beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than by a preponderance of the evidence, and this due process interest attaches because of the threat to a defendant\u2019s liberty. The district court declined to hear this challenge, barring it under the mandate rule because Williams never objected to the quantity finding during his first appeal. Even Williams agreed, \u201c[Ujnder these circumstances I can\u2019t expect the Court to re-evaluate my offense level,\u201d J.A. 89, and defense counsel conceded that \u201cbringing] this stuff up right now puts the government in a tough position,\u201d J.A. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">As the district court properly ruled, the mandate rule left it \u201cwithout authority to expand its inquiry beyond the matters forming the basis of the appellate court\u2019s remand.\u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>168 F.3d 263, 265 (6th Cir.1999). Complementing the mandate rule, \u201cthis Court [generally] lacks authority to consider any issues on appeal that were beyond the scope of the limited remand.\u201d <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>503 F.3d 522, 527 (6th Cir.2007). Here that forecloses Williams\u2019s plea that we entertain further challenges to prevent \u201cserious injustice\u201d and take account of changed legal authority wrought by <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. 2456. The mandate rule bars Williams\u2019s due process challenge, but even if the claim were properly before the court, we would find that it lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">We affirm Williams\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
