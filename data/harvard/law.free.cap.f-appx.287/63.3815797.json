The object of the venture was the construction of a cement plant in Nigeria. The parties to this appeal are the owner who proposed to build the plant and an agent the owner hired to help secure financing. The owner and agent entered a written agreement setting forth their respective rights and obligations. The owner later sued the agent for fraud (and on related theories), asserting the agent helped dupe the owner into paying a fee for nonexistent financing. The agent moved to compel arbitration based on a clause in the parties\u2019 agreement that required arbitration of \u201c[a]ny legal dispute arising from\u201d the agreement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>district court denied the motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Appellee Triple I: International Investments, Inc. (\u201cTriple I\u201d) wished to build a cement plant in Nigeria. It needed a $520 million loan. It hired appellant K2 Unlimited, Inc. (\u201cK2\u201d) to help find an entity that would issue a financial guarantee bond as collateral for the contemplated loan. Triple I and K2 entered a written agreement that was entitled \u201cIntent-to-Collateralize and Fund Memorandum.\u201d R.l.71.12. The agreement called for K2 to \u201cprocure a Financial Guaranty Bond\u201d and for Triple I to pay K2 a fee of five percent \u2014 $26 million \u2014 upon consummation of the loan transaction. <em>Id. </em>The agreement included a clause that required arbitration of \u201c[a]ny legal dispute arising from\u201d the agreement. R.l.71.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">K2 and others purportedly found a lender (Japan Venture Fund Group) and an issuer of a financial guarantee bond (International Underwriters AG &amp; Liberty Reinsurance Corporation, S.A. (\u201cInternational\u201d)). For issuance of the bond, Triple I agreed to pay International a fee of $10.4 million, payable half in advance and half upon Triple I\u2019s receipt of the loan proceeds. Triple I made the $5.2 million advance payment through an escrow agent (W.E. Fielding and Associates), but the lender did not fund the loan. Despite an agreement between Triple I and International requiring all but $200 of the fee to be refunded if the bond was not used, International did not refund the fee. Triple I thus was out $5.2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">International filed a lawsuit in which it denied that Triple I was entitled to a refund of the entire $5.2 million but also sought to \u201cinterplead\u201d that amount for a determination by the court of the parties\u2019 respective rights. Triple I counterclaimed. In due course International voluntarily dismissed its complaint, and Triple I twice amended its counterclaim. In the second amended counterclaim, Triple I asserted that the whole deal was a sham from the outset. Triple I named 11 counterclaim defendants, including K2, its chief executive officer Diane Glatfelter, and its chief operating officer Robert Rice. Triple I sought recovery against K2 and the officers for fraud and under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">K2 and its officers moved to compel arbitration based on the arbitration clause in the \u201cIntent-to-Collateralize and Fund Memorandum.\u201d The district court denied the motion. K2 and the officers filed this appeal. For convenience, in this opinion we refer to K2 without continuing to refer to the officers; both sides apparently agree that the officers\u2019 fate on this appeal rises or falls with that of K2.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision on whether a dispute is covered by an arbitration agreement. <em>See, e.g., Employers Ins. of Wausau v. Bright Metal Specialties, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">III. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">A dispute ordinarily is arbitrable if the parties have agreed to arbitrate it. As we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-13\">Absent some violation of public policy, a federal court must refer to arbitration any controversies covered by the provisions of an arbitration clause. <em>Chastain v. Robinson-Humphrey Co., </em>957 F.2d 851, 854 (11th Cir.1992). Whether a party has agreed to arbitrate an issue is a matter of contract interpretation: \u201c[A] party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d <em>United Steel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>workers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Telecom Italia, SpA v. Wholesale Telecom, Corp., </em>248 F.3d 1109, 1114 (11th Cir.2001). The canons of construction run in favor of arbitration. <em>See, e.g., Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (\u201cany doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Triple I and K2 agreed to arbitrate \u201c[a]ny legal dispute arising from\u201d their agreement. R.l.71.14. The question thus is whether the disputes at issue \u2014 that is, the claims set forth in the second amended counterclaim \u2014 \u201carise from\u201d the agreement. They do.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Triple I has sued K2 for fraud (and on related theories), not for breach of the agreement. But the agreement defined the parties\u2019 entire relationship. Had K2 performed the agreement by finding an actual issuer of a financial guarantee bond, Triple I would have had nothing to complain about. Instead, at least according to the allegations of the second amended complaint, K2 participated in a charade. K2\u2019s failure to perform the agreement is squarely at the heart of Triple I\u2019s fraud claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">In <em>Gregory v. Electro-Mechanical Corp., </em>83 F.3d 382, 384 (11th Cir.1996), the parties entered an agreement with a clause requiring arbitration of \u201cany dispute between any of the Parties which may arise hereunder.\u201d A dispute arose, and one set of parties filed a lawsuit against another set of parties asserting claims for fraud and for other torts as well as for breach of contract. The district court refused to compel arbitration, but we reversed. We framed the issue as \u201cthe meaning of the words \u2018arising hereunder\u2019 in the context of an arbitration provision contained in a larger agreement.\u201d <em>Gregory, </em>83 F.3d at 383. We held that the phrase encompasses not only breach of contract claims, but also tort claims of the type at issue. We said that if the party accused of wrongdoing \u201chad fully complied with the contract, as interpreted by the plaintiffs, there would be no tort claims.\u201d <em>Gregory, </em>83 F.3d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">The case at bar is not meaningfully distinguishable from <em>Gregory. </em>There the arbitration clause applied to \u201cany dispute ... which may arise hereunder,\u201d that is, under the larger agreement of which the arbitration clause was a part. In the case at bar, the arbitration clause applies to \u201c[a]ny legal dispute arising from\u201d the agreement. There is no substantive difference. In <em>Gregory, </em>the lawsuit alleged fraud, other torts, and breach of contract, but the court addressed the arbitrability of the tort claims without suggesting that the presence of an express breach of contract count was important to the analysis. Here the lawsuit alleges fraud and other torts. And here, as in <em>Gregory, </em>if the party accused of wrongdoing \u201chad fully complied with the contract, ... there would be no tort claims.\u201d <em>Gregory, </em>83 F.3d at 384.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If, as we held in <em>Gregory, </em>the district court was required to compel arbitration of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>fraud and other tort claims at issue there, then the district court was equally required to compel arbitration of the fraud and other tort claims at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">More recent decisions are fully consistent with this conclusion. In <em>Telecom Italia, SpA v. Wholesale Telecom Corp., </em>248 F.3d 1109 (11th Cir.2001), we summarized our decisions addressing an arbitration clause applicable to disputes \u201carising from\u201d or \u201crelated to\u201d an underlying agreement. Citing <em>Gregory, </em>we said, \u201cWe have required arbitration where the tort could not have occurred but for a breach of contract.\u201d <em>Telecom Italia, </em>248 F.3d at 1114-15. And we said that, under <em>Gregory </em>and our other decisions, a dispute \u201carises out of\u2019 a contract if it is \u201crelated \u2014 with at least some directness \u2014 to performance of duties specified by the contract.\u201d <em>Telecom Italia, </em>248 F.3d at 1116. <em>See also Blinco v. Green Tree Servicing LLC, </em>400 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2005) (broadly construing agreement to arbitrate any dispute \u201carising from or relating to\u201d the contract at issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The case at bar easily comes within the <em>Telecom Italia </em>formulations of the test for determining whether a claim \u201carises from\u201d an agreement. The torts alleged by Triple I \u201ccould not have occurred but for\u201d K2\u2019s failure to perform the agreement. And the dispute is \u201crelated \u2014 with at least some directness \u2014 to\u201d K2\u2019s performance (or, more accurately, failure to perform) the agreement. Triple I\u2019s claims thus arise from the agreement and must be arbitrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The parties agreed to arbitrate disputes of the kind now at issue. The order denying the motion to compel arbitration is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for entry of an order compelling arbitration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\">. Finding that a tort could not have occurred but for a <em>breach </em>of a contract is different from finding that the tort could not have occurred but for the <em>existence </em>of the contract. A tort that could not have occurred but for the existence of the contract does not necessarily arise from the contract. <em>See Seaboard Coast Line R.R. Co. v. Trailer Train Co., </em>690 F.2d 1343, 1351 (11th Cir.1982) (saying that a dispute does not \"arise out of or in connection with\u201d a contract just because the dispute would not have arisen if the contract \u201chad never existed\u201d), <em>quoting Necchi v. Necchi </em>Sewing <em>Machine Sales Corp., </em>348 F.2d 693, 698 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
