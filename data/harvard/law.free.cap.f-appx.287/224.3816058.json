For the reasons that follow, we will affirm Silman\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Because we write for the parties, we set out only those facts which are pertinent to our analysis. On December 9, 2005, Anthony Rodrigues, a confidential informant, informed FBI agents of a conspiracy between himself, Joshua Rovnak, and Jarrod Ross, Silman\u2019s boyfriend, to rob a bank in Erie, Pennsylvania. Later that day, Rodrigues, wearing a recording device provided by the FBI, engaged Ross and Silman in a conversation regarding the details of the robbery plan. On December 12th, before the planned robbery could occur, police apprehended Ross and Rovnak outside the National City Bank identified as the target of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">FBI agents questioned Silman about her involvement in and knowledge of the bank robbery on two occasions. On December 12, 2005, in response to the agents\u2019 questions, Silman lied about her name and her birth date and indicated she had no knowledge of the robbery plan. In an interview conducted by FBI and state police agents on December 15, 2005, after being advised of the content of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, specifically having read a copy of \u00a7 1001, and admitting that she may have made a false statement in violation of subsection (2) on December 12th, Silman told agents that she may have heard Rovnak and Rodrigues discuss plans to rob a bank, but never heard Ross speak of a bank robbery. FBI agents then presented Silman with recordings of telephone conversations she had with Ross while he was detained in Erie County Prison after his arrest. In the recordings, Ross and Silman discuss the bank robbery. Even after listening to these recordings, Silman continued to deny both her own and Ross\u2019s involvement in the robbery. Before the two interviews, the agents knew Silman\u2019s role only as revealed on the recordings. They did not know whether she had any role beyond that or whether there were any additional co-conspirators or illegal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">On June 13, 2006, a grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania returned an indictment charging appellant Jessica Silman with the violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2). The indictment charged that Silman made a materially false statement when she stated she had no knowledge of any plan to commit bank robbery. On January 23, 2007, a jury found Silman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>guilty. On May 4, 2007, the District Court sentenced her to six months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by two years\u2019 supervised release. Silman filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">On appeal, Silman contends that her conviction for knowingly and willfully making a materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement was based on insufficient evidence because the Government failed to show that the statements were material.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[w]e must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and sustain the verdict if any rational juror could have found the elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Cartwright, </em>359 F.3d 281, 286 (3d Cir.2004). The Supreme Court has held that materiality is an element under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and that the question of whether a statement is material must be answered by the jury. <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 522-23, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995); <em>see also Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Materiality of a statement does not turn on whether the investigators would have believed the statement or whether the statement influenced the investigation. <em>United States v. McBane, </em>433 F.3d 344, 351 (3d Cir.2005) (citing <em>Brogan v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 398, 118 S.Ct. 805, 139 L.Ed.2d 830 (1998)). Rather, a statement is material if it is of a type \u201ccapable of influencing a <em>reasonable </em>decisionmaker.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). In <em>McBane, </em>we concluded that a defendant\u2019s denial of criminal conduct was material despite agents\u2019 knowledge of its falsity because it would still normally have been capable of influencing a criminal investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 352. Here too, it does not matter that Silman\u2019s statements did not actually influence the agents. The jury could have found that, like the defendant\u2019s false statements in <em>McBane, </em>Silman\u2019s false statements were material because they were of a type capable of influencing a reasonable decisionmaker investigating the scope of the conspiracy and the degree of responsibility of the persons who may have been involved. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we find no basis for overturning the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we will AFFIRM the Judgment and Commitment Order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
