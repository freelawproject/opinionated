R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b622-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-23\">Plaintiff Carol Wilcox appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her discovery request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>and its grant of summary judgment to Defendants Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Wells Fargo and Company Long Term Disability Plan. We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In denying Wilcox\u2019s request to conduct discovery in order to obtain and present evidence of Defendants\u2019 conflict of interest, the district court found that \u201c[s]uch limited discovery would not itself be unduly burdensome\u201d but concluded that \u201cthe need for efficiency and economy in ERISA cases generally dictates that no discovery be permitted until a showing of need has been made.\u201d The district court also held that a plaintiff could not obtain discovery where the standard of review was likely to be an abuse of discretion unless the plaintiff made a \u201csubstantial showing that a conflict of interest is likely to change the review to <em>de </em>novo.\u201d Similarly, in granting the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court applied the applicable standard of review at the time, as articulated in <em>Atwood v. Newmont Gold Co., Inc., </em>45 F.3d 1317 (9th Cir.1995), requiring Wilcox to establish the existence of a \u201cserious\u201d conflict of interest to invoke heightened scrutiny and <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Following the district court\u2019s decision, we overruled <em>Atwood </em>in <em>Abatie v. Alta Health &amp; Life Insurance Co., </em>458 F.3d 955 (9th Cir.2006) (en banc). We held that a conflict of interest must be weighed as a factor in abuse of discretion review on a case-by-case basis, informed by the nature, extent, and effect of the conflict on the decision-making process. <em>Id. </em>at 967. We also concluded that a district court could, in its discretion, consider extrinsic evidence in evaluating the conflict\u2019s effects. <em>Id. </em>at 970. Where, for example, there was evidence that a plan administrator \u201chas repeatedly denied benefits to deserving participants by interpreting plan terms incorrectly or by making decisions against the weight of evidence in the recoi\u2019d,\u201d then the court could \u201cweigh a conflict more heavily[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 968-69. The Supreme Court endorsed this approach in <em>Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Glenn, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008), holding that a conflict of interest \u201cshould prove more important (perhaps of great importance) where circumstances suggest a higher likelihood that it affected the benefits decision, including, but not limited to, cases where an insurance company administrator has a history of biased claims administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2351. The Court also held that a district court could consider evidence of an administrator\u2019s actions taken in an effort \u201cto reduce potential bias and to promote accuracy,\u201d such as \u201cwalling off claims administrators from those interested in firm finances,\u201d or \u201cimposing management checks that penalize inaccurate decisionmaking irrespective of whom the inaccuracy benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(noting that in such circumstances, the weight of a conflict might be reduced to \u201cthe vanishing point\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">Although the district court stated in its order refusing to consider Wilcox\u2019s Rule 60 motion that <em>\u201cAbatie </em>would not require a different result in this case\u201d because the district court \u201capplied an abuse of discretion standard as required by <em>Abatie,\u201d Glenn </em>and <em>Abatie </em>require a more complex analysis. They require the district court to consider the conflict of interest as a factor whose weight depends on the \u201cnature, extent, and effect\u201d of the conflict on the decision-making process, which may be unmasked through discovery. <em>Abatie, </em>458 F.3d at 967, 970; <em>see also Welch v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>480 F.3d 942, 949-50 (9th Cir.2007). As <em>Abatie </em>and <em>Glenn </em>materially altered the standard of review applicable to the review of a plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits under ERISA, permitting consideration of evidence outside of the administrative record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>to determine the appropriate weight to accord the conflict of interest factor, we vacate the judgment and remand to the district court for further proceedings, including reconsideration of Wilcox\u2019s discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">VACATED and REMANDED. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b622-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
