We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-16\">In its complaint, the Association alleges that the FAA arbitrarily issued a Finding of No Significant Impact (\u201cFONSI\u201d) with respect to the proposed expansion project at the Troy Municipal Airport in Troy, Alabama. It also alleges that the FAA failed to follow its own regulations requiring additional review and approval of certain mitigation measures. On appeal, the Association maintains that the district court has jurisdiction over the first claim (the \u201cFONSI claim\u201d) because the FONSI is not a final order, and therefore, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(a)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> does not divest the district court of jurisdiction. The Association also argues the district court has jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702, over its claim that the FAA failed to comply with its own regulations (the \u201cprocedural claim\u201d). The district court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">1. The FONSI Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">The parties disagree on whether \u00a7 46110 jurisdiction exists only over \u201cfinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>orders,\u201d and if it does, whether the FONSI in this case is a \u201cfinal order.\u201d The Association argues that \u00a7 46110 grants the courts of appeals jurisdiction only over final orders, and that the FONSI in this case is not final because it requires the City of Troy to finalize its wetland mitigation plan prior to the start of construction. The FAA responds that \u00a7 46110 jurisdiction extends to non-final agency orders. For support, it cites our decision in <em>George Kabeller, Inc. v. Busey, </em>999 F.2d 1417 (11th Cir.1993), which it argues stands for the proposition that \u201cany suit concerning FAA administrative action, whether final or not, lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.\u201d (Def.\u2019s Br. at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">We agree with the Association that courts of appeals have \u00a7 46110 jurisdiction only over an agency order that is \u201cfinal.\u201d <em>See, e.g., City of Dania Beach, Fla. v. FAA, </em>485 F.3d 1181, 1187 (D.C.Cir.2007); <em>Americopters, LLC v. FAA, </em>441 F.3d 726, 735 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Aerosource, Inc. v. Slater, </em>142 F.3d 572, 578 (3d Cir.1998). But we also acknowledge that <em>Busey </em>recognized a narrow exception to permit \u00a7 46110<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> jurisdiction where <em>no order </em>has been issued, the absence of \u201cwhich might affect the future adjudicative power of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1422. In simpler terms, the <em>Busey </em>exception applies when an agency\u2019s failure to act results in a final order never being issued, thereby indefinitely depriving the court of appeals of jurisdiction. This is not that type of case. The Association does not allege that the FAA failed to issue any order thereby depriving the courts of appeals of \u00a7 46110 review. Instead, the Association challenges the order as being arbitrarily issued. Therefore, <em>Busey </em>does not apply and we must determine whether the FON-SI is a \u201cfinal order.\u201d We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">First, the FAA treats the FONSI as a final order. <em>See </em>R.l-1, Ex. B at 12 (\u201cThis decision constitutes the Federal approval for the actions identified above ... [and] constitutes a Final Order of the Administrator subject to review by the courts of appeals to the United States in accordance with 49 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 46110.\u201d). While an agency\u2019s characterization of an order is not binding, it certainly is informative. <em>Aerosource, Inc., </em>142 F.3d at 579.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Second, the FONSI is final because, while the City must fulfill certain \u201cmitigation measures,\u201d the FAA did not condition issuance of the FONSI on the City\u2019s fulfillment of those measures. At no point has the FAA indicated that its determination that the proposed airport expansion \u201cwill not have a significant effect on the human environment,\u201d 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.13, is in any way dependent upon the City\u2019s satisfactory completion of these measures, which range from finalizing the wetland mitigation plan to ministerial tasks such as obtaining construction permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">Finally, the complaint charges that the FAA acted arbitrarily in issuing the FON-SI, a claim which tests the propriety of the FONSI. If the FONSI were not in a final form susceptible of meaningful review, this claim would not be ripe, as the reviewing court would in essence be rendering an advisory opinion on a preliminary administrative decision. We conclude the FONSI is a final order and courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction over this claim under \u00a7 46110.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">Our determination that the FONSI is a final order necessarily resolves the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>Association\u2019s claim that the district court had jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act (\u201cDJA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2321, to decide whether the FONSI was a final order. The DJA permits any court of the United States to \u201cdeclare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). However, that power exists only \u201c[i]n the case of actual controversy <em>within its jurisdiction.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The law is settled that the DJA itself does not grant federal courts jurisdiction, but rather, authorizes a specific type of relief in cases where jurisdiction already exists. <em>Schilling v. Rogers, </em>363 U.S. 666, 677, 80 S.Ct. 1288, 1296, 4 L.Ed.2d 1478 (1960). Because the district court does not have jurisdiction over the FONSI claim, it lacked the power to render a declaratory judgment on the issue of finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">2. The Procedural Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">We turn now to the Association\u2019s argument that the district court erred in ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider its procedural claim against the FAA. The Association asserts that the FAA has failed to comply with FAA Order 1050.1E, H 405(g)(4), which states that the FAA should review and approve any proposed changes in or deletion of a mitigation measure that was included as a condition of approval of the FONSI. The Association alleges that the FAA has not reviewed or approved the mitigation plan changes despite written requests for immediate review. The Association argues the district court retains APA jurisdiction over this claim, regardless of whether the FONSI is a final order. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">The determination of whether the FAA conducted a mitigation measure review as required by FAA Order 1050.1E, H 405(g)(4) is intertwined with the merits of deciding whether the FAA arbitrarily issued the FONSI. Therefore, it is properly raised in the courts of appeals under \u00a7 46110. <em>See City of Oxford, Ga. v. FAA, </em>428 F.3d 1346, 1352-58 (11th Cir.2005) (entertaining, on \u00a7 46110 petition after issuance of a FONSI, plaintiffs claim that the FAA failed to comply with its own regulations and the procedural requirements of National Environmental Policy Act); <em>City of Dania Beach, </em>485 F.3d at 1189-91 (granting petition for \u00a7 46110 review after FAA failed to engage in environmental review process required by FAA Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">3. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b787-10\">Because the FONSI is a final order, the courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction under \u00a7 46110 to entertain a challenge to its issuance. The courts of appeals also have jurisdiction over the Association\u2019s procedural claim because it is intertwined with the merits of the FONSI claim. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing both claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-11\">.
