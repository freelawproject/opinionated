She conceded removability, but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) on the theory that she would be persecuted and tortured because of her religion if she were removed to China. The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied the asylum application as untimely and denied the other applications on the merits. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed. Because the BIA adopted the reasoning of the IJ, we review the IJ\u2019s decision for substantial evidence, <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001), and must deny the petition if the IJ provided \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for her decision, <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir.2004). Addressing only the application for withholding of removal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we grant the petition for review and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Zheng argues that the BIA violated her right to due process by summarily adopting the IJ\u2019s finding that the asylum application was untimely. The argument is unpersuasive. Affirmance by adoption does not violate due process. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 851 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Alaelua v. INS, </em>45 F.3d 1379, 1381-82 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Zheng next argues that the adverse credibility determination underlying the denial of withholding of removal is not supported by substantial evidence. We agree. The IJ found that Zheng lacked credibility for several reasons, but none of them are cogent. <em>Singh, </em>367 F.3d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">The IJ found that Zheng was not credible in part because she purportedly testified that \u201cthe person who accompanied her and smuggled her here ... took [her] passports and all the documents,\u201d and yet she \u201cwas able to somehow have a boarding pass in a false name\u201d at the time of the asylum hearing. This finding is not supported by the record. Zheng never testified that someone accompanied her to the United States, or that such a person took both the passport and <em>all </em>other documents in her possession. She simply testified that upon her arrival in San Francisco an individual named Mr. Lin took the false passport. Zheng\u2019s possession of the ticket stub at the asylum hearing was consistent with this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">The adverse credibility determination was also based on Zheng\u2019s hospital records. According to the IJ, the records are inconsistent because (1) one states that Zheng had a miscarriage on November 21, 2001, while another states that she had an abortion only a week later on November 28, and (2) they bear different official stamps. Given the record before the IJ, neither of these reasons is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">The IJ\u2019s first reason cannot constitute substantial evidence because it rested on personal speculation. <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 887 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ appears to have assumed that the records describe what is known as a \u201ccomplete miscarriage,\u201d or one in which the \u201cembryo or products of conception have emptied out of the uterus\u201d and bleeding \u201csubside[s] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>quickly.\u201d Am. Pregnancy Ass\u2019n, Miscarriage, http://www.americanpregnancy.org/ pregnancycomplications/miscarriage.html (last visited May 6, 2008). If Zheng\u2019s uterus had emptied completely on November 21, it would have been impossible for her to have an abortion only a week later. But there was no basis for assuming that is what occurred. There are various types of miscarriages, only some of which involve the complete and unassisted expulsion of the \u201cproducts of conception\u201d within a short period. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cMiscarriage is often a process and not a single event. There are many different stages or types of miscarriage.\u201d). The medical documents themselves are silent on the precise nature of Zheng\u2019s condition, and the IJ was not qualified to determine independently that one type of miscarriage had occurred rather than another.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The IJ\u2019s speculation was particularly problematic because it ignored Zheng\u2019s explanation for the purported inconsistency in the records. <em>See Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 887 (\u201cAn adverse credibility finding is improper when an IJ fails to address a petitioner\u2019s explanation for a discrepancy or inconsistency.\u201d). Zheng testified that she suffered continuous bleeding from her uterus after the beating and had an abortion involving a \u201csuction\u201d procedure on November 28th once it became apparent that the baby could not be saved. The IJ never addressed this testimony. This oversight is significant because Zheng\u2019s testimony is consistent with the conclusion that her beating induced what is known as an \u201cincomplete miscarriage,\u201d and that she undement the \u201cabortion\u201d on November 28th to treat that condition. <em>See </em>Am. Pregnancy Ass\u2019n (incomplete miscarriage may involve persistent bleeding and may be treated with dilation and curettage); <em>see also </em>Merck Manual of Diagnosis &amp; Therapy 2199-2201 (Mark H. Beers ed., 2006) (describing various types of miscarriages and them corresponding treatments); Am. Med. Ass\u2019n Encyclopedia of Med. 690 (Charles B. Clayman ed., 1989) (\u201cIf a miscarriage is incomplete or inevitable and bleeding is heavy, a <em>D and C </em>(scraping out of the uterus) may be required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The IJ\u2019s conclusion that the medical records are suspect because they bear dissimilar stamps is also unpersuasive. The English translations of the records consistently state that Zheng stayed at the \u201cChangle Hospital\u201d or \u201cChangle City Hospital.\u201d Moreover, the IJ failed to address Zheng\u2019s explanation that the stamps differed only because they came from separate units within the hospital. <em>See Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 887 (\u201cAn adverse credibility finding is improper when an IJ fails to address a petitioner\u2019s explanation for a discrepancy or inconsistency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">The adverse credibility determination also relied on the IJ\u2019s findings that (1) Zheng could not recall the name of her current pastor or the location of the church she attends, and (2) could not recall \u201cwhat happened between\u201d the Old Testament and New Testament. Again, neither of these constitutes substantial evidence. <em>Singh, </em>367 F.3d at 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">The IJ\u2019s first finding is unpersuasive because nothing in the record suggests that Zheng did not know the location of her church. Zheng testified that she attended the \u201cSalvation Army Church,\u201d but counsel never questioned her about its location. Additionally, while it is true that she was unable to recall the name of her pastor, that fact cannot support the IJ\u2019s determination because it is only tangentially related to the circumstances of Zheng\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>persecution in China. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[M]inor inconsistencies or factual omissions that do not go to the heart of the asylum claim are insufficient to support\u201d an adverse credibility determination.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The IJ\u2019s second finding is also unpersuasive. That Zheng could not recall \u201cwhat happened between\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Old Testament and the New Testament does not \u201cgo to the heart\u201d of her asylum claim. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Zheng\u2019s knowledge of Christianity was clearly sufficient to support her story. She testified of learning that Jesus \u201csaved the children and healed the sick,\u201d that the Bible is divided into the New Testament and the Old Testament, and that the first book of the Old Testament is Genesis. She also testified about her belief that Jesus was buried in the \u201colive mountain,\u201d apparently a reference to the \u201cMount of Olives.\u201d These answers displayed a level of exposure to Christianity that would be very difficult to explain if Zheng were not herself a believer.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The final basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was Zheng\u2019s demeanor during the asylum hearing. The IJ found that Zheng was \u201chesitant, particularly on cross examination in responding to some questions.\u201d Credibility determinations based on demeanor are entitled to \u201cspecial deference,\u201d <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999), but we cannot conclude that Zheng\u2019s demeanor constitutes substantial evidence. Given her ability to consistently recount rather detailed facts pertaining to her persecution in China, the variety of documents that appear to support her story, and her apparent willingness to answer all of the questions posed during cross-examination, the mere fact that she was \u201chesitant\u201d while responding to the government\u2019s questions is not a cogent basis for an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">Zheng next argues that the IJ erred in finding her ineligible for withholding of removal. To qualify, Zheng was required to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that her life or freedom would be threatened in China on account of her religion. <em>Hanna v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 933, 939 (9th Cir.2007). She is presumptively eligible for relief if she shows through credible testimony \u2014 and, if necessary, other corroborating evidence \u2014 that she suffered past persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). The IJ found that Zheng failed to establish past persecution for the following reasons: (1) she is not credible; (2) her husband, child, and mother remain in China unharmed; (3) she stayed in China for over two months after her release from detention and nothing further happened to her during that period; and (4) a 2002 State Department Country Report explains that the Chinese government usually does not persecute small house churches that maintain a low profile. We conclude that the denial of withholding of removal is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Because we have concluded that substantial evidence did not support the adverse credibility determination, <em>see supra </em>pp. 3-8, that determination cannot in turn support the denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">That Zheng\u2019s family has remained in China unharmed is not a cogent reason for denying the application. Zheng testified that her husband is not Christian, and there is no indication that her son or mother converted. Accordingly, there is no reason to believe that the government would persecute them on account of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The IJ\u2019s finding that nothing further happened to Zheng from the date of her release from detention to the date of her departure to San Francisco is also unpersuasive. The finding ignores Zheng\u2019s testimony that the government shut down her motel because of her religious activities. That action deprived Zheng of her primary source of income up to the time she left for the United States. Moreover, whether Zheng suffered additional harm after her detention and beating is irrelevant to whether Zheng has established presumptive eligibility for withholding of removal on the basis of past persecution. Even if she had suffered no further persecution during the brief period from November 2001 to January 2002, that does not negate that she was detained and beaten, and the detention and beating alone would satisfy Zheng\u2019s initial burden under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">The State Department\u2019s 2002 Country Report also does not offer substantial evidence. The passage that the IJ referred to states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">[M]any small \u2018family churches,\u2019 generally made up of family members and friends, that conducted activities similar to those of home Bible study groups, usually were tolerated by the authorities [in 2002] as long as they remained small and unobtrusive. Family churches reportedly encountered difficulties when their memberships became too large, when they arranged for the use of facilities for the specific purpose of conducting religious activities, or when they forged links with other unregistered groups.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: China (2002), <em>available at: </em>http://www.state.gOv/g/drl/ rls/hrrpt/2002/18239.htm (last visited May 7, 2008). This passage establishes only that the government \u201cusually\u201d tolerates small unregistered groups such as Zheng\u2019s. Such a general and qualified statement cannot justify rejecting Zheng\u2019s specific testimony of persecution and the various corroborating documents. <em>Cf. Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 922-23 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that a State Department report\u2019s general description of conditions in a country did not compel the conclusion that those conditions had been experienced by the individual petitioner). Moreover, the Country Report generally supports the credibility of Zheng\u2019s story in documenting a variety of limitations on religious freedom in China in 2002. The Report states that \u201cgovernment respect for religious freedom remained poor,\u201d that \u201ccrackdowns against unregistered groups, including underground Protestant and Catholic Groups ... continued,\u201d that police closed \u201cscores\u201d of house churches, and that leaders of unauthorized groups were \u201csometimes targets of harassment, interro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>gations, detention, and physical abuse.\u201d The Report also notes a police raid on a house church in Fujian Province. Taken together with Zheng\u2019s other evidence, the Country Report is an unpersuasive basis for concluding that past persecution did not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">The petition for review is GRANTED. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">. We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision on the application for asylum, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) &amp; (a)(3), and Zheng does not appeal the adjudication of her CAT claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">. Since the passage of the Real ID Act of 2005, Pub. L No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005), weaknesses in the alien's testimony need not go to the heart of the claim to constitute substantial evidence. <em>See Jibril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1138 n. 1 (9th Cir. 2005). However, we apply the law as it existed prior to the Real ID Act because Zheng filed her applications before May 11, 2005. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 109-13, div. B, \u00a7 101(h)(2), 119 Stat. 231, 305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b614-13\">. We note that the interregnum between the end of the Old Testament and the start of the New Testament is approximately four hundred years. It is unclear what aspects of this history the IJ expected Zheng to recount.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
