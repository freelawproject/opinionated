Goodwin appeals the sentence imposed following his plea of guilty to possession of child pornography. Goodwin argues that the district court erred by allowing certain victim impact statements into his presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), by imposing two five-level enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2, and by failing to consider his acceptance of responsibility at sentencing. \u201cAppellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines, its application of the Sentencing Guidelines to the facts of the case for abuse of discretion, and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Snipe, </em>515 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir.2008). Upon review of the record, the briefs of the parties, and the arguments of counsel, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-19\">Goodwin first argues that two victim impact statements should not have been included in his PSR because the district court did not appoint a guardian ad litem for the victim, and because the statements are unreliable and therefore irrelevant. Goodwin relies upon 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509 for the proposition that a guardian ad litem is required in order for a child\u2019s victim impact statement to be included in a PSR. However, \u00a7 3509(h) clearly states that the court \u201cmay\u201d appoint a guardian ad litem. The statute does not require such appointment. Goodwin\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 3509(f) is misplaced because that subsection merely clarifies a guardian ad litem\u2019s responsibilities with respect to the PSR, should one be appointed; it does not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>quire such appointment. Goodwin\u2019s argument that the statements were unreliable fails because the district court did not clearly err in finding that one was written by the victim herself and the other was written by the victim\u2019s mother, who may assume her underage daughter\u2019s rights here pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Next, Goodwin argues that the district court erred in applying five-level sentence enhancements for engaging in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor and because his offense involved six hundred (600) or more images. The district court did not clearly err in finding a pattern of abuse because Goodwin\u2019s admissions that he had abused his sisters-in-law were corroborated by the girls themselves. Nor was there clear error in the court\u2019s finding that Goodwin\u2019s offense involved six hundred or more images. Even if only the twelve (12) video files of child pornography observed by the probation officer or the thirteen (13) video files containing images of identified child victims are counted, the total number of images is well beyond six hundred., because under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2 cmt. 4(B)(ii), each video is considered to contain seventy-five (75) images.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Finally, Goodwin argues that because the guideline range exceeded the statutory maximum for his crime, the district court erred in failing to consider reducing his sentence from the maximum based upon acceptance of responsibility. We disagree. Acceptance of responsibility was one mitigating factor among many aggravating factors in this case, all of which were taken into account in the court\u2019s calculation under the Sentencing Guidelines. Where, as here, the guideline range exceeds the statutory maximum, the statutory maximum becomes the guideline sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a). The district court did not err in its interpretation of the guidelines, nor did it abuse its discretion in applying them to the facts of this case. There was no error in its imposition of the statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">There being no reversible error, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b629-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
