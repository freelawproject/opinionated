In <em>Caraco Pharm. Labs., Ltd. v. Forest Labs., Inc., </em>527 F.3d 1278 (Fed.Cir.2008) <em>(\u201cCaraco\"),</em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court considered several aspects of the Hateh-Waxman Act that are relevant to the determination of Article III jurisdiction in the Hateh-Waxman context. We incorporate the <em>Caraca </em>decision and rely on that background but do not repeat it in full detail here.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Plaintiff-Appellee Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (\u201cMerck\u201d) obtained approval from the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) for the drug FOSOMAX\u00ae which is used to treat and prevent osteoporosis. Defendant-Appellant Apotex, Inc. (\u201cApotex\u201d) is a generic drug company that is seeking FDA approval to commercialize a generic version of FOSOMAX\u00ae. This case was instituted by Merck against Apotex for patent infringement when Apotex filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) with the FDA and so notified Merck. Apotex counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and noninfringement. Following discovery, Merck granted Apotex a covenant not to sue for infringement of all patents-in-suit and moved to dismiss all claims and counterclaims on the grounds that the case no longer presented an Article III case or controversy. Apotex then moved to amend its counterclaims to add a claim for a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The district court denied Apotex\u2019s motion to amend its counterclaims and granted Merck\u2019s motion to dismiss all claims and counterclaims for lack of Article III jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">Apotex appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of Article III jurisdiction and the denial of Apotex\u2019s motion to add an antitrust counterclaim. Because this action arises in part under the patent laws, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1). We <em>affirm </em>the district court\u2019s denial of Apotex\u2019s motion to add an antitrust counterclaim as within the district court\u2019s discretion. In addition, because the infringement and invalidity counterclaims have been rendered moot during the pendency of this appeal, we <em>vacate </em>the district court\u2019s decision regarding those claims and <em>remand </em>with instructions to dismiss the claims as moot. <em>See Duke Power Co. v. Greenwood County, </em>299 U.S. 259, 267, 57 S.Ct. 202, 81 L.Ed. 178 (1936) (\u201cWhere it appears upon appeal that the controversy has become entirely moot, it is the duty of the appellate court to set aside the decree below and to remand the cause with directions to dismiss.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">As part of the process for obtaining FDA approval for FOSOMAX\u00ae, Merck listed ten patents in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book, including United States Patent Nos. 4,621,077 (\u201cthe '077 patent\u201d); 5,358,941 (\u201cthe '941 patent\u201d); 5,681,590 (\u201cthe '590 patent\u201d); 5,849,726 (\u201cthe '726 patent\u201d); 6,008,207 (\u201cthe '207 patent\u201d); 6,090,410 (\u201cthe '410 patent\u201d); 6,194,004 (\u201cthe '004 patent\u201d); 5,994,329 (\u201cthe '329 patent\u201d);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 6,015,801 (\u201cthe '801 patent\u201d); and 6,225,-294 (\u201cthe '294 patent\u201d). The '077 patent covers alendronate sodium, the active ingredient of FOSOMAX\u00ae. Six of the listed patents \u2014 the '941, '590, '726, '207, '410, and '004 patents \u2014 cover various formulations for the FOSOMAX\u00ae tablets. The remaining three patents \u2014 the '329, '801, and '294 patents \u2014 are directed to FOSOMAX\u00ae dosing schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Merck\u2019s '077 patent expired on August 6, 2007. However, Merck obtained an additional six-month period of regulatory exclusivity from the FDA in exchange for Merck\u2019s submission of certain pediatric studies pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a. As a result, no generic drug company could obtain FDA approval for alendronate sodium \u2014 which was protected by the '077 patent \u2014 until February 6, 2008. Merck\u2019s nine remaining Orange-Book-listed patents expire on dates ranging from 2012 to 2018. Merck also obtained an additional six-month period of regulatory exclusivity beyond the patent terms of each of these remaining patents under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">On February 24, 2006, Apotex sent Merck a letter informing Merck that Apotex had filed an ANDA with the FDA to obtain approval for a generic version of FOSOMAX\u00ae. As discussed in <em>Caraco, </em>ANDA filers must submit one of four certifications addressing each Orange-Book-listed patent covering the FDA approved drug upon which the ANDA is based. <em>See </em>527 F.3d at 1282-83. For the '077 patent, Apotex filed a Paragraph III certification stating that Apotex would not market its generic drug until six months<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after the expiration of the '077 patent. For Merck\u2019s nine other Orange-Book-listed patents for FOSOMAX\u00ae, Apotex filed a Paragraph IV certification stating that the patents were invalid or not infringed by Apotex\u2019s generic drug. Merck then sued Apotex under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for infringement of the nine Orange-Book-listed patents for which Apotex filed a Paragraph IV certification (the \u201cpatents-in-suit\u201d). Upon Merck\u2019s filing of this infringement action, the FDA stayed approval of Apotex\u2019s ANDA for thirty months as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">Following discovery, Merck granted Apotex a covenant not to sue on all the patents-in-suit. The covenant provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>Merck unconditionally represents, stipulates, agrees, and covenants that it will not sue Apotex for infringement of, or otherwise assert, enforce, or hold Apotex liable for infringement of any of the '941, '590, '726, '207, '410, '004, '329, '801, and '294 patents based on the importation, manufacture, use, sale, or offer for sale of the alendronate sodium tablets that are the subject of and described in Apotex\u2019s ANDA No. 077-982.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq1Y\"><em>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., </em>No. 06-CV-230 (D.Del. Aug. 16, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Importantly, Apotex was not the first Paragraph IV ANDA filer with respect to Merck\u2019s drug FOSOMAX\u00ae. The first Paragraph TV ANDA filer was Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (\u201cTeva\u201d), which filed a Paragraph IV ANDA on September 29, 1999.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, Teva is entitled to 180 days of generic market exclusivity for its generic version of FOSOMAX\u00ae. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) (2000);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>see generally Caraco, </em>527 F.3d at 1283-85 (discussing the pre-MMA 180-day exclusivity provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act). After Teva filed its Paragraph IV ANDA, Merck sued Teva under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2)(A) for infringement of the '077 patent. Merck ultimately obtained a judgment that the drug described in Teva\u2019s ANDA infringed the '077 patent and that the '077 patent was not invalid. <em>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., </em>228 F.Supp.2d 480, 505 (D.Del.2002), <em>aff'd, </em>347 F.3d 1367 (Fed.Cir.2003). Following its decision, the district court issued an order prohibiting the FDA from approving Teva\u2019s ANDA earlier than the expiration date of the '077 patent on August 6, 2007. <em>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., </em>No. 00-035-JJF (D.Del. Dec. 3, 2002) (Final Judgment Order). Due to Merck\u2019s additional sixth-month regulatory exclusivity pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355a, Teva\u2019s ANDA could not be approved until February 6, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">On June 26, 2008, Apotex informed this court via letter that the FDA approved Teva\u2019s ANDA on or about February 6, 2008 and that Teva immediately began marketing its generic version of FOSOMAX\u00ae. As a result, Teva has triggered its 180-day exclusivity period pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(I) (2000). The parties agree that Teva\u2019s 180-day exclusivity period will expire on or about August 5, 2008.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, Apotex informed this court that the FDA decided to treat the thirty-month stay on Apotex\u2019s ANDA as dissolved once this suit was dismissed by the district court for lack of Article III jurisdiction. Accordingly, Apotex concedes that it will receive final approval for its ANDA when Teva\u2019s 180-day exclusivity period expires on August 5, 2008, rather than August 24, 2008, when the thirty-month stay was set to expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In its decision dismissing this case for lack of Article III jurisdiction, the district court found that Apotex\u2019s alleged injury-in-fact \u2014 namely, delayed entry into the market \u2014 is not fairly traceable to any actions taken by Merck. Moreover, the district court found that Merck\u2019s grant of a covenant not to sue Apotex eliminated the controversy between the parties. However, depending on the circumstances, a justiciable Article III controversy may continue to exist between a patentee drug company and a Paragraph IV ANDA filer in the context of the Hatch-Waxman Act even after the patentee drug company has granted the Paragraph IV ANDA filer a covenant not to sue. <em>Caraco, </em>527 F.3d at 1296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">This case, however, has been rendered moot by two factual developments that were brought to this court\u2019s attention after oral argument. First, the FDA decided to treat the thirty-month stay on Apotex\u2019s ANDA as dissolved once the district court dismissed this case. Second, the first Paragraph IV filer (i.e., Teva) triggered its 180-day exclusivity period under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) (2000) by marketing its generic drug on or about February 6, 2008. As a result, Apotex no longer suffers a delay in entering the market under either the thirty-month stay provision or the 180-day exclusivity provision that is traceable to Merck and redressible by a court judgment. <em>Cf. Caraco, </em>527 F.3d at 1292-94. Indeed, Apotex\u2019s only remaining delay in entering the market is the balance of Teva\u2019s 180-day exclusivity period, which expires on or about August 5, 2008. Teva is entitled to this exclusivity under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) (2000). Although the statute provides that a judgment for Apotex in this case could have <em>triggered </em>Teva\u2019s 180-day exclusivity period, nothing in the statute provides that such a judgment can <em>eliminate </em>Teva\u2019s exclusivity period. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv) (2000). Accordingly, Apotex\u2019s noninfringement and invalidity counterclaims are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">The parties also dispute whether the district court abused its discretion in denying Apotex\u2019s motion to file an amended counterclaim for a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. \u201cIn review of an order denying a motion to amend, a subject which is not unique to patent law, we look to the law of the regional circuit court.\u201d <em>Kalman v. Berlyn Corp., </em>914 F.2d 1473, 1480 (Fed.Cir.1990). As this case is on appeal from the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, we look to the law of the Third Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), courts \u201cshould freely grant leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 15(a). A court, however, has discretion to deny a motion to amend for reasons of \u201cundue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). \u201cIn assessing \u2018futility,\u2019 the district court applies the same standard of legal sufficiency as [it] applies under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d <em>In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.3d 1410, 1434 (3d Cir. 1997). Thus, an amendment to add a counterclaim is futile if the amendment fails to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Id. </em>Under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, a court should \u201caccept as true all of the allegations in the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>plaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom, and view them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., </em>132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir.1997). However, \u201ca court need not credit a complaint\u2019s \u2018bald assertions\u2019 or \u2018legal conclusions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Here, the district court held that Apotex failed to sufficiently plead an antitrust injury. In particular, the district court found that Apotex failed to allege facts sufficient to support its antitrust counterclaim, and that Apotex\u2019s antitrust allegations were \u201cbald and conclusory.\u201d <em>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v. Apotex, Inc., </em>488 F.Supp.2d 418 (D.Del.2007). On this basis, the district court denied Apotex\u2019s request to add an antitrust counterclaim on the grounds that such an amendment would be futile. In light of the record before us, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Apotex\u2019s motion to add an antitrust counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Apotex\u2019s motion to amend its counterclaims to add an antitrust counterclaim. In addition, because Apotex\u2019s noninfringement and invalidity counterclaims have been rendered moot during the pendency of this appeal, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision regarding those claims and remand with instructions to dismiss the claims as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-11\">.
