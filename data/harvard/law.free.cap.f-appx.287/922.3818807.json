We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-17\">Pryce argues that there was insufficient evidence that he carried a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime or possessed a firearm in furtherance of that crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i). A claim of insufficient evidence is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Lewter, </em>402 F.3d 319, 321 (2d Cir.2005). We \u201creview the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor,\u201d <em>United States v. Gaskin, </em>364 F.3d 438, 459 (2d Cir.2004), and will disturb the jury\u2019s verdict only if we find that no \u201crational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Here, we ask \u201cwhether a reasonable jury could, on the evidence presented at trial, find beyond a reasonable doubt that possession of the firearm facilitated a drug trafficking crime.\u201d <em>Lewter, </em>402 F.3d at 322. We believe that the jury could reasonably have inferred a \u201cnexus between the firearm and the drug selling operation,\u201d <em>United States v. Finley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>245 F.3d 199, 203 (2d Cir.2001), from Mark Daley\u2019s testimony that Pryce told him that he needed a weapon because the marijuana business was dangerous, together with the fact that the handgun was found in the immediate proximity of about half a pound of marijuana in Pryce\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Pryce argues also that there was insufficient evidence that he joined the conspiracy. Resolving issues of credibility, in particular Daley\u2019s, in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict, as we must, <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>157 F.3d 949, 955 (2d Cir.1998), we find that the Government presented \u201cevidence from which it can reasonably be inferred that [Pryce] knew of the existence of the scheme alleged in the indictment and knowingly joined and participated in it.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaviria, </em>740 F.2d 174, 183 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Pryce challenges the district court\u2019s finding that, for sentencing purposes, he was accountable for 63,000 pounds of marijuana. It appears that this figure was generated by multiplying 1,000 pounds, the government\u2019s initial rough approximation of the quantity of marijuana seized on September 16, 2003, from a truck rented by defendant Barnes, by 63, the number of trucks alleged by the government to have been rented by Barnes. The government now points out that the amount actually seized on September 16, 2003, was 1,100 pounds, and the correct overall figure should be 69,300 pounds.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> Pryce, for his part, insists that the amount of marijuana attributable to Barnes was not within the scope of his agreement with Barnes and not reasonably foreseeable to him. Although the district court found that Pryce knew about Barnes\u2019s shipments of marijuana and indeed sold large quantities of marijuana for Barnes, it is not clear to us whether the district court equated the scope of Pryce\u2019s jointly undertaken criminal activity with the scope of the entire conspiracy. \u201c[T]he fact that the defendant is aware of the scope of the overall operation is not enough to hold him accountable for the activities of the whole operation. The relevant inquiry is what role the defendant agreed to play in the operation, either by an explicit agreement or implicitly by his conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Studley, </em>47 F.3d 569, 575 (2d Cir.1995). We remand so that the district court can correct any miscalculation and for a particularized finding of the scope of Pryce\u2019s agreement to participate in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction, VACATE the sentence, and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b944-6\"> Although the district court found Pryce responsible for 63,000 pounds (28,576.8 kilograms), it applied an offense level of 38, which is the offense level for a crime involving more than 30,000 kilograms, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1(c). The correct offense level for a crime involving 63,000 pounds is 36.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
