Dec. 26, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">In his brief, rather than challenge the denial of his motion, Kong appears to challenge the IJ\u2019s underlying denial of relief. We lack jurisdiction to review such arguments. <em>See Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001). With respect to the denial of his motion, Kong\u2019s sole argument is that the BIA abused its discretion in declining to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen his proceedings or reconsider its earlier decision. We lack jurisdiction to review a decision of the BIA regarding whether to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen proceedings under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Cyrus v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 197, 202 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
