A state court denied his Petition for Writ of Mandate, in which Pesqueira claimed that he was summarily demoted under a constitutionally invalid provision of a municipal employment manual. The district court held that <em>res judicata </em>barred the \u00a7 1983 claim, which included a First Amendment claim not expressly raised in the state court action and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">Generally, under California law, a judgment resolving a claim for \u201cdeclaratory and coercive relief, has a preclusive effect.\u201d <em>Mycogen Corp. v. Monsanto Co., </em>28 Cal.4th 888, 123 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 51 P.3d 297, 306 (2002). \u201cCalifornia\u2019s res judicata doctrine is based upon the primary right theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn determining the primary right at stake, the significant factor is the harm suffered.\u201d <em>Takahashi v. Bd. of Trs. of Livingston Union Sch. Dist., </em>783 F.2d 848, 851 (9th Cir.1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). Generally, in the employment context, the \u201cprimary right\u201d is \u201cthe contractual right to employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, it is unclear from the state proceedings which was the \u201cprimary right\u201d at stake here, because Pesqueira asserts a right that may be affected by <em>Garcetti v. Ceballos, </em>547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct. 1951, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006), and that may or may not be independent of the procedural claim denied by the state court and now clearly barred by <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b605-19\">We remand to permit Pesqueira to identify his \u201cprimary right\u201d claim under California law and to show cause why any First Amendment claim related to his demotion was not precluded by the state court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-20\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b605-21\">VACATED &amp; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b605-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
