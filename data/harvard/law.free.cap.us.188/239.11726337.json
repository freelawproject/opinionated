The Circuit Court, at the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case, instructed the jury to find a verdict for defendant, which was done and judgment entered thereon. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-4\">There were three causes of action which were all based upon sec. 4965 .of the Revised Statutes, quoted on page 60. By order of the Circuit Court, dated June 10, 1899, the marshal seized 10,590 eight-page prints and 13,205 four-page prints, described ip' the writ, and also five metal electrotype plates, all of which be found in the defendant\u2019s possession (page 13).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-5\">The action was tried at Covington, Kentucky, on December 12 and 13, 1899, before Hon.

It is alleged in the petition, and is in fact copyrighted on the 18th of April, and the publication plainly \u2019shows it was prior to that.

They are all mere matter of advertising.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-12\">The next day the court delivered a written opinion which con- , eludes as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-13\">\u201c The case must turn upon the others (other questions), and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>especially upon the general proposition that the things copyrighted in this case were by no means such as either the Constitution or the legislation of Congress intended to protect by the privilege of copyright. The court' cannot bring its mind to yield to the conclusion that such tawdry pictures as these were ever meant to be given the enormous protection of not only the exclusive right to print them, but the additional protection of a penalty of a dollar each for reprints from them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-3\">\u201c As previously stated, they are neither \u2018 pictorial illustrations\u2019 nor \u2018 works connected with the fine arts. \u2019 within the meaning of section 4952. Not being so, there was no authority to grant the copyrights, whether the Constitution authorizes Congress to promote the fine arts or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-4\">\u201c The judgment of the court is, that the plaintiffs, on their own showing, are not entitled to recover, and for that reason the motion of defendant will be granted, and I will instruct the jury to find a verdict for it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-5\">The jury, in accordance with said instruction, returned a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQ6\">There is no question as to the fact of infringement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-7\">The sheets in evidence, made by defendant, contain reproductions by means of cheap electrotype plates of each of the plaintiffs\u2019 designs.

Whether on the question of artistic merit or value of these lithographic prints or chromos, the Circuit Court was justified in taking the case from the jury, and condemning them entirely as not being fit subjects for copyright.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-10\">Second. Whether the copyrights were obtained for these prints in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States, and are valid copyrights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-11\">The second question involves the inquiries: Whether the copyrights were properly taken out by the plaintiffs, in their trade names of \u201c The Courier Co.\u201d and \u201c The Courier Lithographing Co.,\u201d and, incidentally, whether plaintiffs have the right to sue in their individual name's for infringement of these copyrights; and whether the Statuary Act Design was copyrighted before it was published,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The three pictures in question are show-bills or circus bills, also called posters and, more definitely, picture-posters. They are colored lithographs or chromolithographs, commonly called \u201c chromos.\u201d They were designed primarily to be sold to the proprietors of circuses and other shows, and by them to be used for advertising; but they could be sold to any one, or used for any purpose for which they were adapted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-5\">They were made in the plaintiffs\u2019 lithographing establishment under a special contract with the proprietor of a circus, by which the plaintiffs agreed to design and get up certain representations of scenes supposed to be exhibited at the show, the plaintiffs reserving rights of design and of copyright, and with the usual understanding that so long as the proprietor of the circus used- these designs he had the right to them, but if he ceased to use any of them, the plaintiffs could sell the design or the pictures which embodied it, to any one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-6\">The..fundamental question of the right to copyright such show-bills or posters, is a question of great importance, involving the protection of an immense industry. The foundation of the copyright law is in the provision of the Constitution (art. 1, sec. 8), which authorizes Congress\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">\u201c To promote the progress of science and <em>useful arts, </em>by se-. curing for limited times, to authors and inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-8\">It is settled that the words \u201c authors \u201d and \u201c writings,\u201d in this section, are not confined to literary writers and their works, but include, among others, designers, engravers and lithographers, as well as photographers. <em>Burrow-Oiles Litho. Co. </em>v. <em>Barony, </em>111 U. .S. 53; <em>Trade Mark Oases, </em>100 U. S. 82. Picture-posters or show bills, such as these chromolithographs were, are not designed for close inspection or long-continued study, like an oil painting, a steel or wood engraving, or an etching, and they are not to be judged by the same standards. They are intended to catch the eye of the passer on the street, or any one who merely glances at them, and to challenge his attention, \u2014 if possible to compel him to look again, so that ho will observe what is the subject of the poster .and have this .forced upon his mind, and will be attracted by it. Their func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>tion is to illustrate something, and to advertise it by appealing quickly to the imagination, and conveying instantly a strong and favorable impression. Thus, to be successful, they require artistic ability, and above all things creativeness or originality of a high order, but peculiar. They must be designed boldly, and executed on broad lines, with not much attention to detail, so that the spirit of the picture will stand out at once, and almost leap at you, and will not be lost in a mass of details and minor features.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-4\">Such is the ideal picture-poster, a special and peculiar branch of pictorial art, and one into which many gifted artists, highly successful in other fields, have ventured with- greater or less success. Charles Hiatt\u2019s work entitled \u201cPicture Posters,\u201d published in'1895 by George Bell <em>&amp; </em>Sons, London ; \u201c The Modern Poster,\u201d by Alexandre and others, published in 1895 by Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-5\">Certainly it does not lie in the mouth of the pirate, who has stolen and copied them at some expense and considerable risk, to deny that they have merit and value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">I. The designs were proper subjects of copyright and each cf these picture-posters .was a proper subject of copyright, within the language and the spirit of the copyright law. There was abundant evidence of originality of design, of artistic merit, and of practical value and usefulness, as to each of the pictures.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">If any of these qualities was seriously questioned by the de-fence, it became the duty of the court to send\u2019 the case to the jury</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-9\">All of the pictures are new and original designs and involve new and original conceptions and creations. There was enough evidence on this subject to require the case to be submitted to the jury if any question was raised about it, citing, and in some instances distinguishing, as to definition' of author, writings, etc., <em>The Trade Mark </em>Gases; 1\u00d30 U.

As to artistic merit and value. The pictures being original designs, we maintain that they <em>ape </em>of sufficient artistic merit and of sufficient val\u00fae and usefulness to be entitled to copyright. At least there was enough evidence of this to require the case to be submitted to the jury, if any question was raised about it, \u2014 and furthermore- no such question was raised by the defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b272-5\">\u201cIf a copyrighted article has merit and value enough to be the object of piracy, it should also be of sufficient importance to be entitled to protection.\u201d Drone on Copyright, p. 212, cited with approval in <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Tomkins, </em>60 Fed.

The evidence established that these three prints were ordered by B. E. Wallace, proprietor of the circus known as the \u201cWallace Shows,\u201d under contract with him as an advertisement for his show, and they have never been made for anybody else. All of these pictures purported to be representations of acts to be done in the Wallace Shows, and all- were made under a representation by Wallace,-expressed on the face of the pictures, that his show was going to do these things. All these posters contain reading matter indicating that these were pictures of acts to be done in the Wallace Shows, and they all included pictures of Mr. Wallace himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-7\">They were prints and. the copyright inscription was insufficient. But for the provision in the first clause of this act the inscription, \u201cCopyright, 1898. Courier Litho. Co., Buffalo, N.

The inscription prescribed'by section 4962 of the Eevised Statutes'was otherwise indispensable to the maintenance of an action for the infringement of a copyright.

Having thus availed themselves o.f the provisions of this act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>clearly the plaintiffs are not in position to claim that the pictures are not covered by its provisions.

Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 4952, 4956, 4965, amended by act of March 3, 1891, c. 565, 26 Stat. 1109, and act of March 2, 1895, c. 194, 28 Stat. 965. The alleged infringements consisted in the copying in reduced form of three chromolithographs prepared by employes of the plaintiffs for advertisements of a circus owned by one \"Wallace. Each of the three contained a portrait of Wallace in the corner and lettering bearing some slight relation to the scheme of decoration, indicating the subject of the design and the fact that the reality ivas to be seen at the circus. One of the designs was of an ordinary ballet, one of a number of men and women, described as the Stirk family, performing on bicycles, and one of groups of men and women whitened to represent statues. The Circuit Court directed a verdict for the defendant on the ground that the chromolithographs were not ivithin the protection of the copyright law, and this ruling was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals. <em>Courier Lithographing Co. </em>v. <em>Donaldson Lithographing Co., </em>104 Fed. Rep. 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">There was evidence -warranting the inference that the designs belonged to the plaintiffs, they having been produced by persons employed and paid by the plaintiffs in their establishment to make those very things. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>United States, </em>160 U. S. 426, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>435; <em>Colliery Engineer Company </em>v. <em>United Correspondence Schools Company, </em>94 Fed. Rep. 152; <em>Carte v. Evans, </em>27 Fed. Rep. 861. It fairly might be found also that the copyrights were taken out in the proper names. One of them was taken out in the name of the Courier Company and the other two in the names of the Courier Lithographing Company. The former was the name of an unincorporated joint stock association formed under the laws of New York, Laws of 1894, c. 235, and made' up of the plaintiffs, the other a trade variant on that name. <em>Scribner </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>50 Fed. Rep. 473, 474, 475; <em>S. C., sub nom. Belford </em>v. Scribner, 144 U. S. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\">Finally, there was evidence that the pictures were copyrighted before publication. There may be a question whether the use by the defendant for Wallace was not lawful within the terms of the contract with Wallace, or a more general one as to what rights the plaintiffs reserved. But we cannot pass upon these questions as matter of law; they will be for the jury when the case is tried again, and therefore we come at once to the ground of decision in the courts below. That ground was not found in any variance between pleading and proof, such as was put forward in'argument, but in the nature and purpose of the designs.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">We shall do no more than mention the suggestion that painting and engraving unless for a mechanical end are not among the useful arts, the progress of which Congress is empowered by the Constitution to promote. The Constitution does not limit the useful to that which satisfies immediate bodily needs. <em>Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. </em>v. <em>Sarong, </em>111 U. S. 53. It is obvious also that the plaintiffs\u2019 case is not affected by the fact, if it be one, that the pictures represent actml groups \u2014 visible things. They seem from the testimony to have been composed from hints or description, not from sight of a performance. But even if they had been drawn from the life, that fact would not deprive them of protection. The opposite proposition would mean that a portrait by Velasquez or Whistler was common property because others might try their hand on the same face. Others are free to copy the original. They are not free to copy the copy. <em>Blunt </em>v. <em>Patten, </em>2 Paine, 397, 400. See <em>Kelly </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Morris, </em>L. R. 1 Eq. 697; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>L. R. 5 Ch. 279. The copy is the personal reaction of an individual upon nature. Personality always contains something unique. It expresses its singularity even in handwriting, and a very modest grade of art has in it something irreducible, which is one man\u2019s alone. That something he may copyright unless there is a restriction in the words of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">If there is a restriction it is not to be found in the limited pretensions of these particular works. The least pretentious picture has more originality in it than directories and the like, which may be copyrighted. Drone, Copyright, 153. See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Tomkins, </em>60 Fed. Rep. 758, 765. The amount of training required for humbler efforts than those before us is well indicated by Ruskin. \u201c If any young person, after being taught what is, in polite circles, called \u00a3 drawing,\u2019 will try to copy the commonest piece of real <em>work, </em>\u2014 suppose a lithograph on the title page of a new opera air, or a. woodcut in the cheapest illustrated newspaper of the day \u2014 they will find themselves entirely beaten.\u201d Elements, of Drawing, 1st ed. 3. There is no reason to doubt that these prints in their <em>ensemble </em>and in all their details, in their design and particular combinations of figures, lines and colors, are the original work of the plaintiffs\u2019 designer. If it be necessary, there is express testimony to that effect. It would be pressing the defendant\u2019s right to the verge, if not beyond, to leave the question of originality to the jury upon the evidence in this case, as was done in <em>Hegeman v. Springer, </em>110 Fed. Rep. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00a5e assume that the construction of Rev. Stat. \u00a7 4952, allowing a copyright to the \u201c author, inventor, designer, or proprietor . . . of any engraving, cut, print . . . [or] chromo \u201d is affected by the act of 1874, c. 301, \u00a7 3, 18 Stat. 78, 79. That section provides that \u201c in the construction of this act the words \u2018 engraving,\u2019 \u2018 cut \u2019 and \u2018 print \u2019 shall be applied only to pictorial illustrations or works connected with the fine arts.\u201d We see no reason for taking the words \u201c connected with the fine arts \u201d as qualifying anything except the word <em>\u201c </em>works,\u201d- but it would not change our decision if we should assume further that they also qualified \u201c pictorial illustrations,\u201d as the defendant contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>These chromolithographs are \u201c pictorial illustrations.\u201d The word \u201c illustrations \u201d does not mean that they must illustrate the text of a book, and that the etchings of .Rembrandt or \u2022 Steinla\u2019s engraving of the Madonna di San Sisto could not be protected to-day if any man were able to produce them. Again, the act however construed, does not mean that ordinary posters are' not good enough to be considered within its scope. The antithesis to \u201c illustrations or works connected with the fine arts \u201d is not works of little merit or pf humble degree, or illustrations addressed to the less educated classes ; it is \u201c prints or labels designed to be used for any other articles of manufacture.\u201d Certainly works are not the less connected with the fine arts because their pictorial quality attracts the crowd and therefore gives them a real use \u2014 if use means to increase trade and to help to make money. A picture is none the less a picture and none the less a subject of copyright that it is used for an advertisement. And if pictures may be used to advertise soap, or the theatre, or monthly magazines, as they are, they may be used to advertise a circus. Of course, the ballet is as legitimate a subject for illustration as any other. A rule cannot be laid down that would excommunicate the paintings of Degas.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\">Finally, the special adaptation of these pictures to the advertisement of the Wallace shows does not prevent a copyright. That may be a circumstance for the jury to consider in determining the extent of Mr. Wallace\u2019s rights, but it is not a bar. Moreover, on the evidence, such prints are used by less pretentious exhibitions when those for whom they were prepared have given them'up;</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits. At the one extreme some works of genius would be sure to miss appreciation. Their very novelty would make them repulsive until the public had learned the new language in which their author spoke. It may be more than doubted, for instance, whether the etchings of Goya or the paintings of Manet would have been sure of protection when seen for the first time. At the other end, copyright would be denied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>pictures which appealed to a public less educated than the judge. Yet if they command the interest of any public, they have a commercial value \u2014 it would be bold to say that they have not an aesthetic and educational value \u2014 and the taste of any public is not to be treated with contempt. It is an ultimate fact for the moment, whatever may be our hopes for a change. That these pictures had their worth and their success is sufficiently shown by the desire to reproduce them without regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 rights. See <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Tomkins, </em>60 Fed. Rep. <em>758, 765. </em>We are of opinion that there was evidence that the plaintiffs have rights entitled to the protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; the judgment of the Circuit Court is also reversed and the cause remanded to that court with directions to. set aside the verdict and grant anew trial.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b280-6\">Me. Justice HaelaN,</author>\n<judges id=\"AZt\">with whom concurred Me. Justice MoKeNNa,</judges>\n<p id=\"AqhO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Judges Lurton, Day and Severens, of the Circuit Court of Appeals, concurred in affirming the judgment of the District Court. Their views were thus expressed in an opinion delivered by Judge Lurton : \u201c What we hold is this: That if a chromo, lithograph, or other print, engraving,- or picture has no other use than that of a mere advertisement, and no value aside from this function, it would not be promotive of the useful arts, within the meaning of the constitutional provision, to protect the \u2018 author \u2019 in the exclusive use thereof, and the copyright statute should not be construed as including such a publication, if any other construction is admissible. If a mere label simply designating or describing an article to which it is attached, and which has no value separated from the article, does not come within the constitutional clause upon the subject of copyright, it must follow that a pictorial illustration designed and useful only as an advertisement, and having no intrinsic value other than its function as an advertisement, must be equally without the obvious meaning of the Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>It must have some connection with the fine arts to give it intrinsic value, and. that it shall have is the meaning which we attach to the act of June 18,1874, amending the provisions of the copyright law. We are unable to discover anything useful or meritorious in the design copyrighted by the plaintiffs in error other than as an advertisement of acts to be done or exhibited to the public in Wallace\u2019s show. No evidence, aside from the deductions which are to be drawn from the prints themselves, was offered to show that these designs had any original artistic qualities. The jury could not reasonably have found merit or value aside from the purely business object of advertising a show, and the instruction to find for the defendant was not error. .Many other points have been urged as justifying the result reached in the court below. We find it unnecessary to express any opinion upon them, in view of the conclusion already announced. The judgment must be affirmed.\u201d <em>Courier Lithographing Co. </em>v. <em>Donaldson Lithographing Co., </em>104 Fed. Rep. 993, 996.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">1 entirely concur in these views, and therefore dissent from the opinion and judgment of this court. The clause of the Constitution giving Congress power to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited terms to authors and inventors \"\u00a1she exclusive right to their respective works and discoveries, does not, as I think, embrace a mere advertisement of a circus.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Me. Justice MoKenka authorizes me to say that he also dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
