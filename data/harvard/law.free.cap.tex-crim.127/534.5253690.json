In the absence of the statement of facts on the main case, we are not able to discover anything in the statement of facts on the motion for new trial which would authorize a reversal of the judgment. It is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
