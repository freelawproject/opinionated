Under the provisions of article 824, C. C. P., as amended by Acts of 1933, chapter 34 (Vernon\u2019s Ann. C. C. P., arts. 824, 825), such escape makes it obligatory upon this court to dismiss the appeal, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-15\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
