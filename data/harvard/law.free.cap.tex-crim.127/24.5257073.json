As the sheriff was leaving the room with some of the jugs in his arms appellant knocked one of them out of the officer\u2019s arms to the floor. No issue arises under the facts. Appellant did not testify and no evidence was offered in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>behalf. The only question presented for review is the sufficiency of the affidavit and warrant issued thereunder to authorize the search. We see no necessity for setting out at length the affidavit. We have been unable to discover any defect therein. The affidavit appears to be supported by many authorities which will be found cited in Schwartz v. State, 46 S. W. (2d) 985.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
