The statement of facts was filed 150 days after the adjournment of court and one hundred days after the time allowed by the trial court in which to file same. In such a condition, nothing is presented for review. We observe from the record, however, that the court failed to take notice of the Indeterminate Sentence Law. The lowest penalty for the offense charged is two years. The sentence directed appellant\u2019s confinement in the penitentiary for five years. The sentence will be reformed so as to direct appellant\u2019s confinement in the penitentiary for not less than two nor more than five years, and as reformed, the judgment of the trial court is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b276-11\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b276-12\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AWk\">The appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is not accompanied by any certified copy of any order of extension for filing bills of exception.
