No process having been issued for the witness Rooker, who was absent, and for whom a continuance . was sought, \u2014 and the only diligence appearing being that Rooker had promised to come when written to, and that a letter had been so written to him, there was no error in denying appellant\u2019s application for continuance. In each case cited by appellant, due diligence was shown. None here appears. Smith v. State, 97 Texas Crim. Rep., 6; Garlington v. State, 99 Texas Crim. Rep., 331; Jordan v. State, 96 Texas Crim. Rep., 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We do not believe the statement of appellant made to Mr. Estill in Dallas on the night of the fire, was improperly received. Mr. Estill was assistant district attorney of Tarrant County. It was shown that when appellant came to the door of his daughter\u2019s residence Estill asked him some question, and appellant replied \u201cI have been right here all day; I haven\u2019t been out of the house all day.\u201d The bill of exceptions shows that when witness Goodwin began his answer above set out, appellant\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that appellant was under arrest. To this the trial court replied \u201cIf he was I will sustain it.\u201d The district attorney then asked Mr. Goodwin if appellant was under arrest, to which he replied \u201cNo,\u201d \u2014 and then to the district attorney\u2019s question answered as above set out. It is certified in a qualification to this bill not only that no objection was then made to this answer, but upon the cross-examination of the same witness by appellant\u2019s attorney he was asked about what appellant said, and testified that appellant then said to Mr. Estill \u201cI have been here at the house all day.\u201d The court properly overruled appellant\u2019s motion to strike out this : testimony, made after further questioning of witness Goodwin, which developed the fact that Goodwin went to Dallas to \"arrest appellant and would not have. allowed him to go .free had he desired to do so. If it-had been clear that appellant was under arrest, it ,\"would still be. true that Mr. Goodwin testified in response to a question by ..appellant\u2019s counsel to the same state- ; ment without objection as that given in answer to the district . attorney\u2019s question. Many authorities might be cited. See Countee v. State, 119 Texas Crim. Rep., 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Manifestly there .was no error in overruling, appellant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment. The indictment charged that appellant burned a house situated at 906 Lipscomb Street, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>the City of Fort Worth, Tarrant County, which was then and there occupied by him. Plainly the court could not tell at the time the motion to quash was overruled, what testimony would be developed. The indictment charged the offense of arson. However, in view of appellant\u2019s exceptions to the .court\u2019s charge and his asking of a special charge to acquit because of a claimed variance between the testimony to the effect that appellant owned the house and the charge in the indictment which merely alleged that he was the occupant thereof, we will consider together the various questions bearing upon the sufficiency of the indictment and the question of variance. It was alleged and proved that appellant was the occupant of the house in question, and it was proved without controversy that it was situated in the City of Fort Worth, and there was no dispute of the fact that it belonged to appellant at the time of the fire. It is true that in Texas Jurisprudence, vol. 4, at p. 814, appears the statement: \u201cInasmuch as the owner of a house may in certain circumstances destroy the building by fire or explosion, an indictment against an owner or part owner must contain an allegation as to ownership, accompanied by an averment of facts which render him amenable to prosecution.\u201d Mulligan v. State, 25 Texas App., 199, is cited in support of this text. In the opinion in said case it is said: \u201cBut an indictment against an owner or part owner for burning his own house * * * must allege ownership in the accused, and the particular facts which may bring him within the exceptions as amenable to prosecution.\u201d We call attention to the fact that the statement above quoted from the Mulligan Case was dicta, it having been already held by the court in its opinion in that case that the structure destroyed by fire was not a house but a pile of logs. Attention is called to the context to the above quoted excerpt from the Mulligan Case in which it is said that a tenant during his lease would be a part owner * * * and would be the party entitled to possession, \u2014 also that arson is regarded as an offense against the security of the habitation rather than that of the property and true ownership. The quoted excerpt mentioned refers to Tuller v. State, 8 Texas App., 501, examining which we find it is there said that \u201cactual title and true ownership can rarely be a matter for material inquiry\u201d in arson cases, and we also find the following statement: \u201cThe court will not inquire into the tenure or interest of the occupier or person in possession of the house, if in fact it is the dwelling of such person.\u201d We further quote a significant statement of Judge Clark in said opinion as follows: \u201cOur <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>statutes provide that the owner of a house may commit arson by burning it, under certain circumstances, among which is enumerated, when there is within it any property belonging to another. Penal Code, arts. 658, 659. The \u2018owner,\u2019 as herein designated, may be properly regarded as, and better styled, the \u2018occupant.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">We fail to find support in Tuller Case for the statement quoted from the opinion in the Mulligan Case, supra. In Allen v. State, 62 Texas Crim. Rep., 506, appears the following: \u201cIt is sufficient to prove possession of the property by parol testimony, since the offense is directed against the possession and occupancy, rather than against the absolute ownership, and the allegation of ownership is merely to describe and identify the subject of the crime, and the title is not in issue. This has been the holding of this court, so far as we can ascertain by reading the cases, and such is the doctrine announced in State v. Burrows, Houst. Crim. Case (Del.), 74; State v. Meyers, 36 Pacific, 1051; Knights v. State, 76 Am. State Rep., 78; State v. Elder, 21 La. Ann., 157; State v. Jaynes, 78 N. C., 508; State v. Daniel, 28 S. E., 255, and authorities cited by these cases.\u201d In Pinckard v. State, 62 Texas Crim Rep., 602, it is said \u201cIn arson a person in control of a building may be alleged as the owner or occupant of the building.\u201d Again in Nash v. State, 121 Texas Crim. Rep., 15, we said: \u201cArson is directed more against the possession and occupancy than toward the ownership of the destroyed property.\u201d Again, in the same opinion, quoting from Goldsmith v. State, 46 Texas Crim. Rep., 559, appears the following: \u201cIt is sufficient to prove possession of a property by parol testimony, since the offense is directed against the possession and occupancy, rather than against the absolute ownership, and the allegation of ownership is merely to describe and identify the subject of the crime, and the title is not in issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The proposition is discussed and supported by many authorities in the Nash case, that the real purpose of alleging ownership in an indictment for arson is to identify the property, and that actual possession and occupancy is a sufficient circumstance to support an allegation of ownership in such occupant.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">It seems plainly requisite that there must be such description or designation of the house, involved, in an indictment for arson, as that the accused may know from the averments the particular building referred to, but since neither the actual title holder of such building, nor any lessee, tenant or occupant thereof, could have a right to wilfully burn it, if in a city, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>or the property be insured, etc., \u2014 no sufficient reason could be advanced why an allegation of occupance by the accused would not be as sufficient as that of any other phase of ownership pleaded to describe the building, and in our opinion it was and is, and' we have concluded that the holding in the Mulligan Case, supra, or any other opinion in this State to the contrary, if there be any, should be and the same is hereby overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\">Appellant complains because in the argument of the district attorney he asserted to the jury that appellant\u2019s own daughter had made him out a liar, and that was what he was; that is, a man who does not tell the truth is a liar. Said attorney was discussing appellant\u2019s testimony that he did not leave his daughter\u2019s house in Dallas in his car on the afternoon of the fire, and was calling the jury\u2019s attention to the daughter\u2019s testimony and her written statement obtained soon after the fire in which she said that appellant did leave her house in his car on :said afternoon. The cases cited in appellant\u2019s brief would not justify the establishment of a precedent that an attorney might not argue to a jury that the testimony before them made the accused out a liar. In some of the cases cited by appellant the language used was a great deal stronger than that here. In the only one which reflected the use of similar language, the vice in the argument complained of was that the attorney said that of his own knowledge the accused was a liar. This involves a very different principle. Complaints in appellant\u2019s motion for new trial and brief of other argument, in the absence of a bill of exceptions, \u2014 bring nothing before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">By several bills of exception complaint is made of the reception of testimony showing that' insurance policies had been issued to appellant on said' house and its contents prior to the fire. This was objected to because ownership of the house was mot alleged in appellant. In Wilkerson v. State, 119 Texas Crim. Rep., 4; we held proof that the property was insured, admissi.ble to prove motive for the fire, irrespectiv\u00e9 of whether or not \"there was an averment in the indictment that the property was Insured. For the sam\u00e9 purpose we would think it proper to prove that this house was insured, regardless of whether there was an averment of ownership, \u2014 but in our view, as above set ' out, the allegation of occupance in an arson case would render unnecessary further allegation of ownership on facts like these before us, and when the proof shows, \u2014 as it does here, \u2014 that the occupant was also the owner, there could be no doubt of the ^admissibility of the testimony regarding the' insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The testimony of the State was amply sufficient if believed to make out the case. What was found in the house by members of the fire department who answered the alarm, clearly evidenced thorough and careful preparation to destroy the house and contents by fire. Appellant owned the house and furniture. Same were amply covered by insurance. Same were in a city. Appellant\u2019s defense was alibi, \u2014 that he had gone to Dallas several days before the fire, and had not been back to Fort Worth in the interim. State witnesses testified to seeing appellant leave said house in his car about the time smoke began coming from the building. His daughter living in Dallas, and with whom he said he stayed, made a written statement, which was in evidence, in effect that appellant took his car and left her house the afternoon of the fire. There had been rain. Officers saw tracks of a car in appellant\u2019s driveway at Fort Worth and carefully took up a layer of earth containing said tracks and took it to Dallas and compared it with tracks there, made by appellant\u2019s car and testified that they were the same,also that appellant\u2019s car had casings whose tread corresponded to the tracks. We find no reversible error in the record and believe the facts sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b227-7\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b227-8\">MORROW, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ADM\">We have reviewed the record in\" the light of the appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">We have been referred to no additional authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">We have read carefully the various propositions submitted by the appellant by way of argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">We are impressed with the view that the appeal was properly disposed of on the original hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-13\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
