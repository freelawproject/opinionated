The State, by a motion for rehearing, has called our attention to the fact that we inadvertently overlooked the word \u201cspirituous\u201d in the indictment. We have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>examined the indictment and find that it is sufficient in that it does charge the appellant with the unlawful possession for the purpose of sale of spirituous liquors capable of producing intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\">Therefore, the State\u2019s motion for rehearing is granted, the original opinion reversing this case and ordering the prosecution dismissed is withdrawn, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
