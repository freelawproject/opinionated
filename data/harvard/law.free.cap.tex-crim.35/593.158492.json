Schneider\u2019s property, but the words in said letter, \u201cwoe be unto you and yours,\u201d relied on as conveying or imputing such threats, are merely a vague invocation of sorrow, suffering, or other mental distress, which is not an offense against the laws of this State; and because said information fails to charge specifically and particularly, any offense whatever, in that it alleges that the defendant did threaten to do serious bodily injury to one Jules E. Schneider; that she also threatened to do serious bodily injury to the family of said Jules E. Schneider; and that she also threatened to destroy and injure the said Jules E.

The law does not, and cannot, undertake to protect the human mind against the visitations of grief or sorrow, which may be invoked by enemies or evil disposed persons. It does not concern itself with regulating the prayers of the good nor the invocations of the wicked; nor with the curses, unaccompanied with threats to do serious bodily or physical injury, which one person may in rage, or from motives of revenge, heap upon another. It is only with the threat to directly injure the person or property of the citizen, that the law concerns itself. The words in the letter which are relied on as conveying the threat in this prosecution, are, \u201cyou are requested to deposit \u00a71000 on a certain grave; if you fail to comply with our request, make this demand known to the public, or cause the one who goes to get your deposit molested in any manner, shape or form, woe be unto you and yours.\u201d The letter does not contain a single threat to do anything. The words, \u201cwoe be unto you and yours,\u201d do not import a threat. Woe is defined by the lexicographers as being a state or condition of the mind; such as grief, sorrow, misery, dolor, agony, anguish, distress, affliction, suffering. See, Worcester\u2019s Dictionary, \u201cWoe.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-5\">In phrases of denunciation, imprecation, or invocation, woe seems to be a substantive, and in explanations an adjective, but is never used as a verb, never in any sense to express action. See many instances in the Holy Bible, where the word is used as a curse, a denunciation of calamity, or an invocation or calling down from a higher power, of a curse or calamity upon the object or perspn addressed or spoken of. Ezek., 34:2; Id., 30:2; Isaiah, 6:5; Matthew, 23:13.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-6\">The County Court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the letter offered in evidence by the County Attorney, on the ground that the complaint alleges that the defendant sent a letter to Jules E. Schneider, and the letter offered in evidence is plainly addressed to Jules E. Schineoder, and contains nothing to indicate that it was intended for Jules E. Schneider; and on the further ground that the letter offered in evidence does not contain any language which imports or means a threat against Jules E. Schneider, or any other person as is contemplated by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-7\">The statement of facts shows that the letter put in evidence is addressed to \u201cMr. E. Schineoder.\u201d The envelope in which the letter was mailed was directed to \u201cMr. Jules E. Schineoder, 269 Ross Ave, Dallas, Texas.\u201d The affidavit and the information alleges that the defendant sent the letter to \u201cJules E. Schneider.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-8\">The two names are not <em>idem sonans, </em>because the two vowels, i and e, which give the distinctive pronunciation to Schneider, are separated by a consonant, n, in the address of a letter; and the introduction of another vowel, o, makes an entirely different name.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b619-9\"><em>Mcmn Trice, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b619-10\">HENDERSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AM1\">Appellant was convicted on a charge of sending a threatening letter, and her punishment assessed at a fine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>$100 and six months\u2019 imprisonment in the county jail; and from the judgment of the lower court she prosecutes this appeal. The <em>charge </em>in this case is brought under Art. 966, Rev. Penal Code, making it criminal for any one to send to another a letter threatening to kill or in any manner injure the person of another. It will be noted that the statute in question, which is an exact copy of Art. 813, of Willson\u2019s Penal Code, makes it a criminal offense to send or deliver to another a letter threat ening to accuse such other person of a criminal offense, with the view of extorting money; while the last part of said article makes it an offense to send or deliver a letter threatening to kill or in any manner injure, etc., without it being with the view to extort money, etc. The information in this case does not charge that the letter in question threatened to accuse such other person of a criminal offense, with the view of extorting money, but is based on the latter portion of said article, making it an offense simply to send or deliver a letter threatening to kill or injure another. The information, however, while proceeding to charge the offense under the last portion of said article, alleges that the threats were to kill or injure, with the view of extorting money, etc. It was unnecessary that the information should have alleged, in this instance, that the threatening letter was sent with the view of extorting money. Concede, however, that the allegation that it was for the purpose of extorting money could be rejected as surplusage, which is doubtful, yet it must be shown that, before a charge of this character can be sustained, the letter clearly contained a threat to kill or injure such other person, before the prosecution can be sustained. The letter in this case, is- set out in haec verba; and we have examined the same, in order to ascertain the character of threat it contains. The letter, after setting out that the prosecutor, Schnieder, should deposit $1000 in a certain grave in the cemetery, near Dallas, proceeds to state as follows: \u201cWe give you ample time, and that is one week from the date of this note. Should you fail to comply with our request, make this demand known to the public, or cause the one who goes to get your deposit molested in any manner, shape, or form, woe be unto you and yours.\u201d The last sentence, it is assumed, contains the threat intended in this case. It certainly does not contain any specific threat to do violence, but the threat, if any, is to be gathered from the general expression used, \u201cwoe be unto you and yours.\u201d The Century Dictionary defines \u201cwoe\u201d as follows: \u201cGrief, sorrow, misery, heavy calamity;\u201d and it gives a number of illustrations as to how the word \u201cwoe\u201d is used, some of them taken from the Bible. \u201cWoe\u201d is used both in the Old and Hew Testaments, sometimes as prophetic of calamity, or affliction, and sometimes as denunciatory. The language used in this case does not indicate by direction that the writer herself intended to visit upon Schnieder any calamity or affliction. It rather implies that, in case he fails to comply with her request, he will suffer some calamity or affliction, which she invokes will be visited upon him by some higher power; that is, she invokes some trouble or calamity may come upon him, without herself bringing it about. The pleader <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>himself seems to have apprehended this difficulty, because he treats the expression as a threat to do bodily injury to the person of said Schnieder \u25a0and to his family, and to destroy and injure the said Schneider\u2019s property. In our opinion, the threat contained in the letter, in order to have afforded the predicate for the information, should have been more definite and explicit. Appellant also contends that there is a variance between the name of the alleged injured party, as set out in, the information, and that contained in the letter. The information states that the defendant did knowingly send to \u201cJules E. Schnieder a certain letter, of the tenor as follows, to-wit.\u201d The address at the beginning of said letter is \u201cMr. Jules E. Schineoder.\u201d It has heretofore been held by this court, in a case of this character, that the letter must be set out according to its tenor, as in forgery. See, Tynes v. State, <em>17 </em>Tex. Crim. App., 123. If this were a charge of forgery, there would clearly appear a variance between the purport and tenor clause of the information. It should have been alleged in the information, by innuendo, that the sender meant by the address \u201cMr. Jules E. Schineoder,\u201d as contained in said letter, \u201cMr. Jules E. Schnieder.\u201d By such an innuendo, proof would have been been admissible to show that by the use in the address of \u201cMr. Jules E. Schineoder,\u201d was meant \u201cMr. Jules E. Schnieder,\u201d the party whom it is alleged the appellant intended to injure. The judgment is reversed, and the prosecution dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">\n<em>Reversed and Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
