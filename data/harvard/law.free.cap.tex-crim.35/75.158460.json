The purpose of Arts. 1681 and 1682, Rev. Stat., requiring writs of election to issue to the presiding officers of election, is to give notice to such officers, <em>and to them only,-o\u00ed </em>the day of election and of the question to be voted upon, and they are not intended in any way to give notice to the electors, and where all the presiding officers in the county hold the election on the proper day, and for the proper purpose and at the proper place, and no inj ury results by reason of a failure to issue such writs, their issuance is not mandatory, but directory.

If it was error for the election afficers to begin counting the votes before the polls were closed, this was but an irregularity, which should not affect the election. Weil v. Calhoun, 25 Fed. Rep., 865.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-6\">4. The revision and change of election precincts complained of by relator, were made at a regular term of the Commissioners\u2019 Court and in conformity to law. Sayles\u2019 Rev. Stats., Art. 1663a; 6 Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, page 530, Sec. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b103-7\">5. There being no contest pending as to the election, the method adopted by the court for counting the vote and declaring the result, was a proper one. James v. State, 21 Texas Crim. App., 353.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b103-8\">HURT, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AWz\">Relator was arrested for selling whiskey in Fannin County, in violation of the local option law. Applicant applied to the Honorable James Q. Chenoweth, Judge of the County Court of Fannin County, for a writ of habeas corpus, for the purpose of being discharged from arrest, contending that the local option election in Fannin County was void:</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">1. That the Commissioners\u2019 Court had no right to order the election when it was ordered. This contention is settled against relator, not only by the statute, but by the opinion in Ex Parte Segars, 32 Tex. Crim. Rep., 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">2. Because writs of election were not issued to the presiding officers of the various election districts in the county. It is not denied but that the election was held at each voting precinct, that the election was without fraud; nor that it was fair and just and honest. Elections being held at all of the precincts of the county, the fact that the writs were not delivered to the officers should not vitiate the election. The law does not provide that the election shall be void unless such writs are issued to the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">3. That the officers of some of the boxes began to count the vote before the polls were closed, and continued to count the votes until the close of the polls. The statute provides that the votes shall be counted after the polls have closed, but this is not an inhibition against counting the votes before its close. We can see no merit in this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">4. It is not necessary to enter a petition of the qualified voters for an election upon the minutes of the Commissioners\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">5. That the election was void because the order of election directed that the election should be held at the regular voting places; that this was not done after said order was made; that the Commissioners\u2019 Court discontinued one of the voting boxes or election precincts, and created three new voting boxes or election precincts, the election having been held at the voting boxes as so changed and created. The fact is, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the election was ordered, the Valley Greek voting box was discontinued, and Ector, Windom and Lanius were created in its stead.' This was done at the regular term, of the Commissioners\u2019 Court for that year. The Commissioner\u2019s Court had a right to make the change. There is no pretense but that the election was held at the new voting jirecinct.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">6. The Commissioners\u2019 Court did not count the polls, but did add up the tally sheets, and declare the result. This is sufficient, especially in the absence of any evidence tending to show that the result was not as declared by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
