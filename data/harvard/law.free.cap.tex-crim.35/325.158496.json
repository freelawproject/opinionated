Pat Foley, the deceased, had boarded at the hotel for some time, but it seems had been gone a week or more, and had returned on Saturday morning, the 24th of November, 1894. About 10 a. m., on that morning, Foley and one Morgan went to the hotel, both being drunk, and went up to the room which Foley had occupied, and in lying upon the bed, broke it down. Foley left the room soon after, and was found asleep in a room on the second floor, occupied by the dining room girls. One of these girls went down and informed Mrs. Sargent, Avife of defendant, and she said: \u201cVery well, let him be; he won\u2019t hurt anything.\u201d Mrs. Sargent was, and had been, looking after and managing the hotel for several Aveeks, her husband, the defendant, having been sick and unable to attend to business. . That day, Avhen Mrs. Sargent went to the opera, he Avent into the hotel office to see after matters. While in there, he Avas informed that the bed in Foley\u2019s room had been broken down, and instructed Campbell, the night clerk, to go and nail it up. About 2 o\u2019clock, the dining room girls went to their rooms and found Foley asleep; Avoke him up, and Avere trying to get him to go out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>as they wanted to bathe. About this time, Campbell, the night clerk, came along, and one of the girls requested him to put Foley out. Campbell told Foley he was making too much noise. They finally succeeded in getting Foley out of the room, and he followed Campbell up to the third floor, where Campbell had gone to fix up the broken down bed. What occurred between the parties up there, is not known by the witnesses who testified at the trial. The next seen and heard of them, they came down stairs into the office of the hotel on the ground floor, where defendant was sitting, reading a paper. They were quarreling, the noise of their altercation having been heard by two of the dining room girls.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-5\">Pearl O\u2019Neal testified: \u201cThat hearing the fuss, she started down the stairway, and when about half way down, she saw Foley running after Campbell, the night clerk, who was running toward the back door of the office. Sargent, defendant, got up in the office and went into the parlor. Foley came back and went out through the front door on to the street. When Sargent returned to the office from the parlor, he had his pistol in his hand. In from three to five minutes\u2014just a short time\u2014 Foley came back to the front of the hotel, and Sargent was in the office. He said to Foley: \u2018If you come in here I will kill you!\u2019 and Foley called Sargent a son-of-a-bitch, and said: \u2018If you come out here on the street, I will whip you; I can come into your house as long as my trunk is there,\u2019 and saying which, he stepped into the office to within three or four feet of where Sargent was, when Sargent shot him. Foley had nothing in his hands. After the first shot, Foley turned and went out of the office, and witness ran upstairs, and heard another shot when she reached the head of the stairs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-7\">Several witnesses testified to hearing the first shot, and looking in the direction, saw Foley on the sidewalk, about three or four feet from the door of the hotel, and going toward the street; saw a man fire upon him from the door, and the same party fired twice more before Foley got across the street. That the firing of the last three shots seemed to be very deliberate. That Foley had nothing in his hands, and his back was towards the hotel. That he fell at the fourth shot. When he was reached, immediately thereafter, no weapon was found upon him, nor upon the ground near by, nor in the office of the hotel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-8\">Foley was taken to a hospital, where he died the next evening. Before dying, he made a statement of the occurrence, which was reduced to writing by the Deputy County Attorney, R. II. Orr; and, a predicate for the introduction of the statement, as a dying declaration, having been laid, the same was read in evidence, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">\u201cSTATEMENT OF PAT FOLEY.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-10\">\u201cFort Worth, Texas, November 25, 1894. \u201cPresent: Howard Gunnels, Jo Adams, R.

The night clerk said he would tell the old man. The clerk went down and I followed him to the office; he told Sargent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>that I was cutting up with the girls; Sargent told me he wanted my room. I told him he could have it when I got my trunk out of it; that I was under no obligations to him. Sargent then said, \u2018By God, I want you out of here.\u2019 I replied,' \u2018You can\u2019t get me out of here until I get my trunk out.\u2019 He then went to his bed room, saying, as he went, \u2018By God I will get you out of here, I will go and get my gun.\u2019 When I saw him coming I started out of the door and said to him, \u2018You had better not draw a gun on me, or you will get yourself into trouble.\u2019 He replied, \u2018Oh, you son-of-a-bitch.\u2019 I then heard a report and felt a sting in my thumb. My back was to Sargent, and I was going into the street when the first shot was fired. I then heard a second report and a third report, and then I fell. I had no knife or other weapon on me, except a small knife in my pocket, which I did not take out. I didn\u2019t chase the night clerk with a knife, as I have heard he said I did. I don\u2019t owe him for any board, except for two meals and my bed. We were m the hotel office all the time Sargent and I were talking. I had never had any other trouble with Sargent. He had no cause for shooting me that I know anything about. I make this statement voluntarily.

C. Howell told me a threat Foley had made against me\u2014some time I think in August it was, last August\u2014he told me that he had threatened to kill me, \u2018rip my heart out,\u2019 that is the language; that is what Mr. Howell told me; I never spoke to Mr. Foley about that; I was afraid to; the day of the difficulty, I hadn\u2019t been npstairs that day, and I am positive, to the best of my knowledge and belief, I hadn\u2019t been upstairs in three weeks; I never saw the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>witness, S. O. Morgan, in a room upstairs in the hotel, as testified to by him, or had no such conversation with him as he stated; I was not able to go up; not a thing of the kind ever mentioned; I never said that to that man in my life; I think that Foley went away from my house about three weeks prior to this unfortunate occurrence, about three weeks; I was not on watch at the time of this occurrence; I had not been-attending to my business at all, except to buy, and I had got in a condition that they would not come to my house to take orders; I had not been on watch in three weeks; Mrs. Sargent was on watch; the first time I saw Foley that day was about half past one o\u2019clock; he came over to the hotel office as I came from dinner\u2014I had been to dinner, and I came through to get a tooth pick, and he came in the office; he was under the influence of liquor, and so were the two men that were with him; he had liquor enough in him to be ugly; I shook hands with him and passed the compliments of the day; the next time I saw Foley after that, he was following the clerk downstairs into the office; I was seated behind the counter reading the newspaper; just went in there for a moment to pay the bread man; my wife, she was at the opera house, and I just walked m there and just sat down in a chair a moment, and took up a paper and put my glasses on, and the clerk came downstairs first and was mumbling something about a bedstead being broken, and in a moment Foley \u2022came downstairs, and they commenced to jaw and wrangle between themselves, cursing one another; I paid no attention to it at all; I just kept on reading my newspaper, and they quarreled a little bit, and directly Foley came up to the counter and says to.me: \u2018Have you got it in forme?\u2019 I never paid any attention to it and kept right on. He says, \u2018You God damned son-of-a-bitch, have you got it in for me?\u2019 I says, \u2018Ho sir;\u2019 I says, \u2018I can\u2019t have your conduct in my house; you must get out of here;\u2019 and from that I got up. He says, \u2018You got it in for me; God damn your old soul to hell, I will break your neck,\u2019 and I got up and came out to go to the kitchen to get a negro to go to get an officer, and he ran after me and struck at me, and he caught me here by the sleeve with his left hand and tore the sleeve nearly out of my coat. I cannot see out of my right eye at all, and I gave a jerk, and he went on to the clerk, and he had a knife when he went on to the clerk, and when I saw the knife I says, \u2018Then I will get my gun for you right away,\u2019 and I got my gun and came out, and when I got to the door he. passed right along in front of me, going out, cursing me for a son-of-a-bitch; after I got my gun and came back, I did not say anything to him; never said a word to him, because he was going out of the house, 'and he went out and was gone a little bit, and probably two minutes or three minutes\u2014just talking about the unfortunate occurrence amongst ourselves\u2014the two women on the stairs and by the night clerk, and the night clerk says, \u2018He has got a knife and you want to watch him.\u2019' I says, \u2018I know that;\u2019 just at this moment the night clerk went and got his hammer and some nails and went off upstairs to fix the bed-As he went upstairs, that moment Foley came back, and the first thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>he done he' commenced cursing me for a son-of-a-bitch, and wanted me' to come out doors and fight him; I told him I didn\u2019t want to fight; from that he started to come into the house, and I says, \u201cIf you come in here to assault me again I will kill you, if it is the last thing I do.\u201d He says, \u2018You will * * * son-of-a-bitch.\u2019 His knife was then in his hand. When he got right in the house, about four or five feet, he made a dash at me this way, and I shot him\u2014I tried to shoot him, I shot him again at the step, and when he got outside I thought he was trying to shoot me\u2014I knew he had a revolver, and he most always caiv ried it when he was drunk\u2014and I shot him again; I was under the impression that he was trying to shoot me; I did not shoot after he fell; I didn\u2019t know he was hit until after he fell; I cannot see very well out of the other eye; have to use magnifying glasses; I was looking right out in the light, and the smoke blew back into my face whenever I would shoot; just only could see kind of an outline of him after the first shot, until he got out on the edge of the sidewalk, and there I thought he was trying to shoot me; made an effort of that kind and put his hand behind him; from what I could see he was trying to shoot me; could not see anything, just the outline was all you could see.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-4\">Cross-examination.\u2014\u201cI can read pretty well with my glasses. The man was standing with his hands behind him with his knife up his sleeve. I could see that knife between his hand and coat sleeve; his right hand, the one towards Pearl O\u2019Neal. She could not see it at all. When I shot at him one hand was just about here some place, the other just down by his side. When I first shot at him the best I can say, he tried to turn around and then turned back on me again. I could not tell about his face being turned towards the street. The smoke blinded me as I was looking towards the light, and could not say whether it was the case or not. When I fired the second shot I could not see whether Foley\u2019s back or face was turned towards me. I don\u2019t know whether I could see well enough to hit him twice center in the back; I never saw. I did not hear him holler after the third shot. He never hollered at all. I didn\u2019t shoot after he hollered\u2014he never hollered at all. After the fourth shot he didn\u2019t holler. I could not tell where Foley went when he went out of the hall just before he came back. I stepped to the door and called my clerk back. I don\u2019t think the clerk says: \u2018You damn son-of-a-bitch, don\u2019t come back or I will kill you.\u2019 I didn\u2019t go out on the sidewalk; I just stepped with my foot in the door. I didn\u2019t hold it out where Foley could see it. I called the clerk back; told him this was over, come into the house. Never noticed where he went. Before Foley came back the night clerk never said anything to me, only just showed me the hole he jagged in his back. When the night clerk went upstairs he went before Foley came back. I don\u2019t remember him saying\" anything about killing him; I don\u2019t remember that he did. After I had gone into the parlor door and got my pistol, I was standing there'right in the door with my pistol in my hands. Maggie Callahan and Pearl O\u2019Neal were at that time right on the stairs. I did not say in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>presence of Maggie Callahan and Pearl O\u2019Neal, \u2018If he comes back I will kill him.\u201d I said something to him after I saw he had a knife.. I said, \u2018Damn him, I would go and get my gun, if I could not get him out of there any other way, and then went after the gun in my room. I think the deceased had come into the house about four or five feet when I first shot. I never was in the door, and never advanced a step. Never was within four feet of that door. I never stood in the door at all; never stood any closer than four feet. Four feet is as close as I ever was to the door. When Foley made after me with that sleeve business, Maggie Callahan and Pearl O\u2019Neal were on the stairs. They could not see all of it. I went in through the parlor door. I was right in behind the stairway where they stood. I was going towards the kitchen for help. The directions were opposite. I told you that he caught hold of my sleeve and jerked me, and when he done that I turned to go back, and went through the parlor. When I first started, I started to go through the dining room; going away from him. These two women saw me when I got by the parlor door. I was behind the stairway, going into the kitchen. I started away from the counter. I went left oblique, away from him. He jerked me' right in behind the stairway. When Ed. Campbell went out on the sidewalk I think he had one of these little poplar rounds, rocking chair rounds. I think he had that in his hands. At that time Foley had gone. I don\u2019t know where he was at all. I just noticed him going up the street. I never was on the sidewalk, only when I called the clerk. When Foley left the house, after the first shot, I think he shut the knife up and put it in his pocket. I think immediately after the first shot. Thought the motion was made when he first got down. He had it in his right hand. I think he put it in his pocket. There was all just the motion of it there; could not tell whether he shut the knife up or not. He had the knife. The smoke had cleared away then, and when he got out on the sidewalk, I could see. I just saw the motions, what I could see. I thought so\u2014at that moment he was trying to shoot me, too. At that time he was standing kind of sideways.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">Defendant made a motion to quash the indictment. The grounds of the motion were: (1) Said indictment does not appear to have been presented in the proper court. (2) It does not appear from said indictment that same was presented in the District Court of the county where the grand jury was in session. (3) It, the said indictment, does not appear to be the act of a grand jury of the proper county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-7\">The formal part of the indictment is as follows: \u201cThe grand jurors of the State of Texas, duly elected, tried, empaneled, sworn and charged to inquire of offenses committed in Tarrant County, in the State of Texas, upon their oaths do present in and to the District Court of said county, that one Peter Sargent, etc.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-9\">Defendant\u2019s motion for continuance was overruled. And the court\u2019s refusal of the continuance was one of the grounds relied on by defendant in his motion for new trial. Upon this matter, the State filed counter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>affidavits controverting the diligence. A motion was made to strike these controverting affidavits from the record, because they were not restricted to the question of diligence, and the matters pertaining thereto. Exceptions were reserved to the admonitions and instructions given by the court' verbally to the jury in connection with the charge and before reading the charge, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">\u201cBefore reading you the instructions as to the law of the case, I wish to say that I desire to read it deliberately, and to have the jury give close attention to it, and endeavor, so far as they can, to comprehend and understand the same; and after the jury get to their room, that they will examine the same and all of it, until they should be able to say that they understand the same. When jurymen swear that they will a true verdict render, according to the law and evidence, and they are not careful to see that they understand the law as given them by the court, but act in the case, and leave the court room wholly or partially unable to tell, if called on, the substance even of the law as presented, then such jurymen act unlike thinking men, but deal recklessly or carelessly with themselves. For, if the jury fail to grasp the principles or propositions of law, as submitted to them, then it is very uncertain about their being able to find a verdict according to the law and evidence, and more uncertain about their being able to apply the evidence to the law of the case, and thereby be able to see and comprehend that the verdict that they do render is a true verdict, according to the law and the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-6\">The ground of the objection was, that the law requires the court to give all charges to the jury in writing, and because such remarks of the court were calculated to prejudice defendant\u2019s case with the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-7\"><em>Furman &amp; Bowlin, </em>attorneys for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXs\">There being two District Courts in Tarrant County, the Seventeenth and the Forty-eighth, and the law being that the indictment should show in which court it was presented, the indictment in this case should have shown whether it was presented in the Seventeenth or the Forty-eighth District Court.

From the judgment and sentence of the lower court he prosecutes this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The first error complained of by appellant is that the court erred in refusing to quash the indictment in this case. He also brings up the same question on motion in arrest of judgment. The contention of appellant is that the indictment is defective, because it fails to show that it was presented in the proper court, and because it does not appear from said indictment that it was presented in the District Court of the county where the grand jury was in session, and that said indictment does not appear to be the act of the grand jury of the proper county. The indictment shows on its face, according to the authorities, that it was presented by the grand jury of the proper county, and in the proper county. Willson\u2019s Cr. Stats., \u00a7 1951 and authorities; Vanvickle v. State, 22 Tex. Crim. App., 625. The contention that the indictment should have shown on its face in which court of the two District Courts in Tarrant County it was presented is not well taken. The minutes of the court show this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Appellant filed a motion for the continuance of this cause on account of the absence of the witnesses, E. L. Campbell, Charles Nolan and one Hargraves; but it appears that Hargraves subsequently came into court and testified, and so we have only to consider the other two witnesses. As to these, the question presented in the motion for a continuance is also raised in the motion for a new trial. It appears from the record that a subpcena was issued for these witnesses on the 22d of January, 1895, and return was made \u201cServed\u201d as to each of them on the 2d of February following. The case was set for trial on the 4th of February, and on the morning of the 4th was accordingly called for trial, and both these witnesses were absent. Writs of attachment were then issued for them, and the case passed until about 2 o\u2019clock, when a motion for a continuance was presented to the court. On an inspection of the record we are of the opinion that the testimony of each of said witnesses, as set out in the motion for a continuance, was material to the appellant. The motion was, however, overruled, and on the motion for a new trial the overruling of the motion for a continuauce as to these witnesses was involved, and the State filed a controverting or contesting affidavit. Said affidavit, while proposing to controvert the question of dilligence, also contests the materiality of the testimony of the absent witnesses, and that said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>motion was made for delay, and alleges as to said witness, Campbell, that he was absent by the procurement and consent of appellant, and as to the witness, Nolan, that he was a fictitious person. In our opinion the State had the right to do this. Code Crim. Proc., Arts. 560, 565, 781; Norris v. State, 32 Tex. Crim. Rep., 172; Cockerell v. State, 32 Tex. Crim. Rep., 585; Walker v. State, 13 Tex. Crim. App., 619. The court trying the case admitted a great deal of testimony, both affidavits and oral evidence, taking up about 100 pages of the record in this case. Exception was taken to this testimony. Much of it was immaterial. However, as the matters were addressed to the court, and as all the evidence is now before us, we can eliminate such of it as appeared to be immaterial, and it seems the court below also pursued this course. Without reiterating all the testimony from the record which we think has a legitimate bearing upon the issues in this case as to said two witnesses, and after a careful examination thereof, we have reached the conclusion that the issue was fairly presented to the court below, trying, the motion, whether or not the witness Campbell was absent by the procurement and with the consent of appellant. There was evidence pro and con on this issue, and the court below seems to have regarded the absence of said witness with the connivance of the appellant as proved. As to the witness, Nolan, the court heard testimony pro and con as to whether or not he was a real or fictitious person. The State showed by a number of witnesses in a negative way that they did not know of the existence of such a person as Nolan. The officer who had the attachment for said witness on the 4th of February, also shows, by his affidavit, that he applied to appellant\u2019s counsel, and to appellant himself, to know where said witness could be found, and they stated to the officer that they had never seen and did not know such a person, and with all the people in Fort Worth, and the facilities afforded for finding such a person as Nolan, no one could be found who had ever seen said witness except the deputy sheriff, Trigg, who served the subpoena on him, and the record throws such suspicion on this man, Trigg, in connection with this case as to very much weaken our resjiect for his testimony. If such a man existed, some one besides Trigg in all the city of Fort Worth should have known him, and if such an important witness existed it is exceedingly strange that he had not been talked to prior to the trial by as diligent and able counsel as managed the defense in this case. Not even the witness, Thomas, who was employed to talk with the witnesses, knew of his existence. So, to our minds, it is altogether imjirobable that such a person existed or was at Fort Worth at the time this homicide was committed. As to the witness, Campbell, moreover, it appears that on the morning of the 4th, when the attachment was issued and placed in the hands of the deputy sheriff, he inquired of appellant\u2019s counsel as to Campbell. They informed said officer, if he is to be believed, that he need not mind about said witness, that if they wanted him they would let him know later, and this they never did. Said witness was seen by one person as late as 1 o\u2019clock on said Monday, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>and if the officer had been informed by counsel that they still wanted said witness, it is probable that he might have been procured. As to this witness, it also appears that he was used by the State on the habeas corpus trial of this case, and that he was upbraided by appellant\u2019s counsel for making his testimony stronger than he had previously stated it to them. His testimony was in the record. There is some suggestion in the record that this witness was out of the State, and the State offered to permit his testimony to be read. Appellant declined to avail himself of this opportunity. From the evidence that the record affords in this case with regard to these two witnesses, we are of the opinion that the court did not err in setting on foot this investigation to ascertain whether or not the appellant had used diligence in procuring these witnesses, and even in making it as comprehensive as he did, for it is peculiarly within the province of the District Judge, in matters of this sort, to see that the course of justice flows in its appointed channel, uncontaminated by corruption and unobstructed by fraud or villainy. In our opinion, it was competent to show that the witness, Hol\u00e1n, was a fictitious person, for in such event by no amount of diligence could it ever be possible to procure his attendance in court; and it was also competent to show, as to the witness, Campbell, that he had been spirited away by the appellant in this case, for in such contingency it would negative his affidavit, made for the continuance, that said witness was not absent by his procurement or with his consent. The motion for a new trial on this ground was properly overruled, and the court did not err in refusing to grant a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The only exception taken to the admission of evidence is contained in appellant\u2019s third bill of exceptions. It appears that Annie Wilde, a witness for the State, on direct examination, testified that she met Pat Foley about 11 o\u2019clock on the day of the shooting. He. was not doing anything; only standing around. He was intoxicated, and that was the last time she saw him until in the evening. About 1 or 2 o\u2019clock she found him asleep in the dining room girls\u2019 room, on the bed. Said witness was then asked by the State to tell the jury what she did about it, if anything, and she answered, \u201cI went down and told Mrs. Sargent he was up there, and Mrs. Sargent remarked, \u201cVery well. Let him be; he won\u2019t hurt anything.\u201d To this latter testimony the appellant objected. If it be conceded that this testimony was not admissible, yet we fail to discover in what respect it was injurious, to the appellant. This was some time before the homicide, and merely showed the condition of appellant at that time; and what Mrs. Sargent said, \u201cto let him alone,\u201d could serve no purpose, in connection with the testimony in this case, to impair any right of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The court in this case gave a lengthy charge covering murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, manslaughter and self-defense. This charge was furnished appellant\u2019s counsel an hour or more before it was delivered to the jury. They asked no charges, but merely contented themselves with objecting to the court\u2019s charge. A number of errors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>are assigned with reference to the court\u2019s charge, and said charges criticised by appellant\u2019s counsel in an elaborate bill of exceptions. We have examined said bill in connection with the charge given, and fail to discover the errors complained of. Appellant was acquitted of murder in the first degree, and it is not necessary to consider the charge in that regard at all. We have examined the charge on murder in the second degree, and the court\u2019s definition of implied malice, and find no error in connection therewith. Appellant complains that the charge on manslaughter was not a charge on the evidence presenting that phase of the case, but was an abstract charge. It is true, in this connection, the court did not state what, fact or facts in evidence would constitute adequate cause to excite passion sufficient to render the mind of appellant incapable of cool reflection, but he told the jury in a general way that adequate cause \u201cis such cause as would commonly produce a degree of anger, rage, sudden resentment, or terror in a person of ordinary temper, sufficient to render the mind incapable of cool reflection. Any condition of circumstances which is capable of creating anger, rage, sudden resentment, or terror, in a person of ordinary temper, and which actually does produce the same in the person doing the killing, is an adequate cause.\u201d So that the charge left the jury absolutely untrammeled, to review all the evidence in the case in connection with the killing, to determine the adequate cause, and to ascertain whether or not appellant\u2019s mind was influenced thereby. In this we see no error. If another course had been pursued, and particular facts had been singled out, there might have been some complaint that all of the facts which would go to make up adequate cause were not cited in the charge. The \u25a0charge on self-defense was comprehensive, and covered the entire field of the evidence. The court charged both on an assault made on appellant in a manner calculated to cause him to. apprehend danger to his life or serious bodily injury, and also to the effect that, if the jury believed that \u201cthe attack made upon the defendant was not such as to produce a reasonable apprehension of death nor of serious bodily injury in defendant\u2019s mind, but was an attack upon his person of a milder character, or was an unlawful intrusion upon the defendant\u2019s premises after being duly notified that he could no longer remain a guest at the hotel, in such case the defendant would have the right of self-defense,\u201d but before exercising it he would have to resort to all other means except retreating before he would be authorized to slay the deceased. There was a phase of the evidence which presented an assault of this character, and certainly the appellant would not be permitted to complain that the charge of the court authorized him to slay the deceased if he made an unlawful intrusion into his hotel, and in such case he would be authorized to kill the deceased after he had resorted to all other reasonable means to get rid of him, except retreating. This charge was certainly as liberal as the appellant could have asked. Nor did the court err in telling the jury that the appellant\u2019s right of self-defense would continue as long as he was in actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>or apparent danger of an attack by the deceased, although deceased was killed while retreating, but that, if he was in no real or apparent danger after deceased had left the scene of the difficulty and started to retreat, then his right of self-defense ceased. Nor, in this case, was it improper to tell the jury, in effect, that \u201cin determining whether the defendant acted in his necessary self-defense, or in what reasonably appeared to him to be his necessary self-defense, it is the duty of the jury to look at the transaction from what the jury believe from the evidence was the standpoint of the defendant at the time, and consider the same in the light of the facts and circumstances as the jury believed they appeared to the defendant at the time, and not from any other standpoint; but it is for the jury to determine from the evidence what were the appearances to the defendant, and what the standpoint of the defendant was, and in what light he in fact did view the facts and circumstances at the time.\u201d This charge, we believe, was fair, and, in view of the evidence in this case, was a pertinent charge. The appellant insists that the court should have charged the jury, in substance, that if the deceased was making an assault on the appellant with a knife, a deadly Aveapon, then the law would presume that he fully intended to kill the appellant, and that in such event they would give the appellant the benfit of such presumption. As we have said before, the charge of the court on the subject of self-defense presented all the issues of the case fairly, and there was nothing in the evidence to call for such a charge. It appears from the, record in this case that before the court read his charge to the jury, he admonished them to pay particular and careful attention to each word and sentence of the charge, so that they might be advised as to the law of the case. The appellant saved a bill of exceptions to this action of the judge, and insists that, as a part of the charge, the same should have been in writing, and that it was no part of the duty of the judge to so admonish the jury. We do not regard the admonition as any part of the charge of the court. It was the proper admonition, and no word or sentence thereof was calculated to bias the mind of the jury one way or another in relation to the case they were then trying, but merely a suggestion on the part of the court to pay particular and careful attention to his charge. In this there was no error. We have carefully examined the evidence in this case, and believe that the same authorized the finding by the jury that the appellant was guilty of murder in the second degree, and assessing the punishment at twenty years in the penitentiary. The judgment and sentence of the lower court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
