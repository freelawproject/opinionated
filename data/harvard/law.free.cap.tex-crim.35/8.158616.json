Held: In the absence of exceptions to the charge, not to authorize defendant\u2019s conviction upon grounds not alleged, and especially so where there was no proof of other grounds of aggravation than those alleged in the indictment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b32-15\">Appeal from the County Court of Hamilton. Tried before Hon. J. W. Parker, County Judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-16\">This appeal is from a conviction for aggravated assault and battery, wherein the punishment was affixed at a fine of \u00a750 and one month\u2019s imprisonment in the county jail. The indictment contained two counts, one charging an assault and battery, which inflicted serious bodily injury, the other an assault and battery with a piece of iron, a deadly weapon. The evidence showed that defendant beat J. V. Wilson, the injured party, over the head with the coulter of a sulky plow, inflicting several wounds upon him and which rendered him unconscious for some time. Wilson testified, that he did not regain consciousness until he reached home\u2014several miles away\u2014where he had been hauled by a neighbor in a wagon; and that he was unable to do any work for about three weeks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-17\">The principal error complained of on the appeal was as to the charge of the court, which is set out in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-18\">No further statement necessary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>Warren, Main </em>&amp; <em>Grogan, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-5\">R. <em>L.

Railroad Co. v. Holliday, 65 Tex., 512; Millirons v. State, 34 Tex. Crim. R., 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">2. We do not think the contention correct that the charge authorized the conviction of appellant for a violation of the law of aggravated assault on other than the grounds charged in the indictment. In this respect the charge is as follows, to-wit: \u201cAn assault becomes aggravated when a serious bodily injury is inflicted upon the person assaulted, or when committed with deadly weapons, under circumstances not amount-' ing to an intent to murder or maim. * * * Now, if you believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant did, in the county of Hamilton and the State of Texas, at or about the time alleged in the indictment filed herein, commit an aggravated assault and battery upon the person of one J. V. Wilson, you will find him guilty.\u201d This charge recites the grounds of aggravation charged in the two counts set out in the indictment. The charge, construed as a whole, w'e think, sufficiently presents the law of the case, and was not misleading, and did not authorize appellant\u2019s conviction upon any other ground than those charged. There \"was no proof of other ground of aggravation. There were neither requested instructions nor exceptions reserved. Loyd v. State, 19 Tex. Crim. App., 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The evidence fully sustains the conviction, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
