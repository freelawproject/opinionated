The facts connected with the assault are shown in the testimony of the prosecutrix, as follows: \u201cMy name is Alice Hill; I live near Whitt, in Parker County, Texas; I was fifteen years old last March; I have known the defendant, Rube Price, about six years; was at the Rock School House, near Whitt, Texas, on the night of May 31st, 1895, attending writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ing school, conducted by Prof. Falder. After the writing school closed, I, in company with my sister, Maggie Hill, started home; we live about three-fourths of a mile northeast of said school house; we were walking, and went along the public road; the moon was shining, and we could see some distance along said road. We heard somebody talking behind us, and saw two boys, whom I took to be our neighbor boys, Tom Strickle and Burt Owens. When we were within about 100 yards of home, two boys came running up behind us; one of them caught hold of me by the shoulder and by the skirt, and pulled me around. This boy I recognized as the defendant, Rube Price. I did not know the other boy. The defendant had a handkerchief tied around his neck; the other boy kept his hat sorter pulled over his face, and he was smaller than the boy who caxight hold of me. When the defendant caught hold of me, I said to him: \u2018I know who you are, and will make you pay for it.\u2019 The defendant did not say anything at all. The defendant and his companion then turned and went back towards Whitt, and I saw nothing more of them. When my sister and I reached oxxr yard gate, Tom Strickle and Burt Owens came up behind us, and Tom Strickle said to me, \u2018Who done it?\u2019 I replied, \u2018You know who done it.\u2019 We then went into the house, and I reported the assault to my mother. I was crying. This was in Parker County, Texas.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-5\">Mrs. Martin testified: \u201cI am the mother of Alice and Maggie Hill. I live with my children about one mile northeast of Whitt, Tex. I remember the night of May 31st. My two girls, Alice and Maggie Hill, went to writing school on said night. They returned home about 11 o\u2019clock. Alice was crying, and reported the assault to me on her return home.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-7\">Cross-examined: Witness said: \u201cMy name is Mrs. Martin. I have been married twice; my first husband\u2019s naxne was Hill; he is dead now; my second husband\u2019s name was Martin; he is still living, but we do not live together any more. I don\u2019t know where he lives. All I know about said assault is what I heard.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b526-9\">Burt Owens, for the State, said: \u201cI am 13 years old. I was at the Rock School House at writing school on the night of May 31st, 1895. I went home in company with Tom Strickle. We went along the main Poolville road. The moon was shining, and we could see two girls in the road in front of us. They had on white dresses. When about 300 yards from the school hoxise, two boys jumped up from the side of the road, in froxit of us, and went towards the gii'ls. One of them said to us: \u2018Come on, boys, and let\u2019s go and get ourselves some.\u2019 We made no reply. We recognized the boys as Rube Price and Quinn Beavers. In a short time said two boys came back, meeting us in the road, and one of them said to xxs: \u2018Helix us out, boys, and tell them it was Willie Mathis and Arch Crawford. The said two boys went on towards Whitt, and we went on in the direction of home, and caught up with the girls, Alice Hill and Mattie Hill, at their yard gate,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and Tom Strickle said to Alice Hill, \u2018Who done it (?)\u2019 and she replied \u2018You know who done it,\u2019 and we then went on home.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-5\">Defendant objected to, and saved an exception to, the admission of the testimony of the prosecutrix as to the time she reported the assault to her mother. Also to the testimony of Mrs. Martin, the mother, as to the condition and appearance of the girls upon their return home.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-6\">A bill of exceptions was saved by the prosecution to the admission by the court over the State\u2019s objection, of the testimony of Cap Peters, to the effect that \u201che, witness, was acquainted with the voice of Rube Price, and that it was Rube Price\u2019s voice he had heard.\u201d Another bill of exceptions shows that during the discussion of the admissibility of testimony by the prosecutrix, as to the time when she reported the assault to her mother, the trial judge remarked, in the presence and hearing of the jury, \u201cI am not sure but this is a case of assault with intent to rape.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b527-7\"><em>W.

Stat., Art. 496) the many conditions under which an assault becomes aggravated, and the indictment or bill of information must allege the means of aggravation (Marshall v. State, 13 Tex. Crim. App., 492). The circumstances of aggravation must be proven as alleged (Pinson v. State, 23 Texas, 579). In the case at bar, it was alleged in the bill of information, that the acts of the defendant \u201cdid then and there arouse the strongest feeling of shame, mortification and indignation'in the mind of the said Alice Hill.\u201d This allegation was not proven. If the indictment alleges the means of aggravation to be \u201can adult male upon the person of a female,\u201d then it must be proven that the person making the assault was an adult male, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>and the person assaulted was a female. So, in the case at bar, the means of aggravation must be clearly proved; and in this case it was not proven at all; and no verdict for any offense greater than a simple assault is supported by the law and the evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-5\"><em>Mann Trice, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b528-6\">DAVIDSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AQV\">Appellant was convicted of an aggravated assault and battery, and his punishment assessed at sixty days in the county jail and a fine of \u00a725, and from the judgment of the lower court he prosecutes this appeal. A number of errors are assigned. We will only notice such as are likely to occur on another trial of the case. What the prosecutrix may have said to her mother when she reached the house, if admissible, was only admissible as a part of the res gestse of the alleged assault. If it was so closely connected in point of time, and the declarations were spontaneous, and sprang out of the assault, such statements to her mother were admissible; otherwise not. The court\u2019s remarks in that connection, that he was not sure but that the case was an assault with intent to rape, were improper, and ought not to have been made. We believe it was permissible to show by the mother of the prosecutrix her condition and appearance when she returned home, but nothing that she said on the subject was admissible, unless, as before stated, her declarations were a part of the res gestse of the assault. In our opinion, it was also permissible to show by the witness, Cap Peters, that he recognized the defendant by his voice, or he could state his impression on that subject. No objection was made to the information in this case, either by a motion to quash or in arrest of judgment. We have, however, examined the information carefully, to ascertain whether or not it charges the offense of which appellant was convicted, to-wit: an aggravated assault. The language of the information in the charging part is as follows: \u201cDid then and there unlawfully and wilfully, in and upon Alice Hill, make and commit an aggravated assault, and the said Rube Price was then and there a male person, and the said Alice Hill was then and there a female person, and the said Rube Price did then and there use violent and indecent familiarity with and upon the person of the said Alice Hill, and without her consent and against her will, with the intent then and there to have and obtain improper connection and carnal intercourse with her, the said Alice Hill; which, said acts and conduct of the said Rube Price towards the said Alice Hill, made and committed as aforesaid by said Rube Price, did then and there arouse the strongest feelings of shame, mortification, and indignation in the mind of said Alice Hill.\u201d ' Our statute on the subject names ten distinct grounds on which an aggravated assault may be predicated, but the offense charged in the information does not appear to come under either one of the grounds named. The fifth subdivision of article 496 of the Penal Code reads as follows: \u201cAn assault becomes aggravated when committed by an adult male upon the person of a female or child; or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>an adult female upon the person of a child.\u201d The charging part of the information now before us comes nearer the causes set out in said subdivision than under any other, but it will be noticed that there is no allegation that the appellant in this case was an adult male; and the proof shows him to be only 16 years of age, which, according to previous decisions of this court, does not constitute him an adult male person. A number of cases can be found in which it has been said by this court that an indecent assault made by a male person upon a female, with intent.to have carnal intercourse with her against her will, would be an aggravated assault. But in all such cases it will be found that the indictment was a good indictment covering an aggravated assault, either as an indictment for assault with intent to murder, or an indictment for an assault with intent to rape, or an indictment under some one of the subdivisions of the statute constituting an aggravated assault. See, Curry v. State, 4 Tex. Crim. App., 574. We will not dismiss the case, as the information may be good for a simple assault, but it does not charge an \u25a0aggravated assault, and the conviction for such aggravated assault cannot be sustained. The judgment of the lower court is reversed, and the \u2022cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\n<em>Reversed and Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
