Theft\u2014Evidence\u2014Taking Under Mistake.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-14\">On a trial for theft of two head of cattle, where the evidence showed that defendant knew the cattle belonged to Smith, and that, prior to the theft, when Smith proposed to put his brand upon them, defendant urged him not to do so, and told Smith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>that he would protect him in his ownership and possession of the same. Held: To show that defendant could not have taken them under a mistake, or that he believed he had a right to take them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b139-5\">Appeal from the District Court of Frio. Tried below before Hon. M. F. Lowe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">This appeal is from a conviction for the theft of two head of cattle, the property of R. G. Smith, wherein the verdict and judgment assessed the punishment at two years\u2019 imprisonment in the penitentiary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-7\">The testimony shows that the two cows were branded J I on the left hip, and L S on the left side. Smith had driven one of the cows back with other cattle to the pen; he told defendant that inasmuch as he, defendant, had bought the J I brand, he Smith, would put her and the other cow, which he described to defendant, in his, Smith\u2019s, brand. Defendant said he had purchased the J I brand, and that Smith need not change the holding brand on his two cows, as he knew they were Smith\u2019s, and they would not be troubled; that he knew the cows better than Smith did. Smith never saw his cows afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-8\">Joe West testified: That he had gone to Frio County to get two yearlings Dock Lawrence, a brother of defendant, had sold him. Not finding the yearlings, John Lawrence, defendant\u2019s father, told defendant to go with witness into the pasture and get two cows, and that witness could have one of the cows for his yearlings. That they got the cows and necked them, and that he and John Lawrence, defendant\u2019s father, drove them to witness\u2019 house in Atascosa County, some forty miles, and that after reaching there he killed his cow for beef, and John Lawrence killed the other. That when be heard the cows had been stolen he reported the above facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-10\">As to the charge of the court, the complaint was, that the charge was the identical one which the court had given, at a former term, in the companion case of John Lawrence; that the name of this defendant was substituted for that of John Lawrence; and that other erasures and obliterations had been made so as to conform said charge to the facts in this case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b139-11\"><em>John W. Preston, </em>W. <em>T. Merriwether </em>and <em>John T.

If it be conceded that his first bill of exceptions is sufficiently specific to show that the court erased a portion of his charge, it does not set forth the clause or clauses erased. But, if it did this, it does not show that such erasure took place after the charge was read to the jury and filed in the cause, and the court\u2019s qualification of the bill makes it appear that the erasure occurred before it was read to the jury. This being true, there was clearly no error. Boothe v. State, 4 Texas Crim. App., 202; Baker v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 612. It is unnecessary to discuss the effect the court\u2019s action would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>have had, if the erasure had occurred after the charge had been delivered to the jury. The witness West was not an accomplice, under the facts before us. The court, therefore, did not err in failing to instruct the jury in regard to the law applicable to such testimony. One of the stolen cows was turned over to West, in lieu of two yearlings purchased by him of Dock Lawrence, without knowledge on his part that the cattle had been stolen. This is the uncontradicted testimony in the record. The evidence does not indicate or intimate that appellant took the cattle under a mistake, or that he believed he had a right to take them. The testimony is uncontradicted that he knew the cattle belonged to Smith, the alleged owner; that prior to the theft Smith proposed to put his brand upon the cattle taken, and appellant urged him not to do so, and stated to Smith that he knew the cattle better than Smith, and that he would protect him in his possession and ownership of the same. Appellant had bought other cattle having the same brand as the cattle in question, and it seems the entire brand of cattle, except the two animals mentioned in the indictment. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
