D. 1895, a complaint was filed against Martin Steinberger, Jr., (the appellant herein), charging the defendant with the offense of unlawfully and wilfully opening and keeping open a barroom saloon house, an establishment where vinous, malt and intoxicating liquors are sold on a day, the same being an election day, on which an election was being held by lawful authority, for the purpose of electing Governor, etc. Hpon this complaint, the County Attorney filed an information against Martin Steinberger. The cause was tried by a jury; the defendant was convicted, and punishment assessed at a fine of $100. The defendant made a motion for a new trial, also a motion in arrest of judgment; both of said motions were overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-7\">The motion in arrest of judgment is as follows: (1) Because there</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-8\">is a fatal variance between the affidavit for information and the information in this case, to-wit: The affidavit for information charges that Martin Steinberger, Jr., did then and there, etc., and the information charges that Martin Steinberger, late of the County of Archer, etc. (2) Because there is a fatal variance between the affidavit for information, and the information herein, to-wit: The affidavit for information charges that an election was being held by lawful authority, for the purpose of electing \u201ca Governor and other State officers, judges, congressmen and county officers,\u201d and the said information charges that an election was being held by lawful authority, for the purpose of electing \u201ca Governor and other State officers, judges, congressmen, members of the legislature, county and precinct officers.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-9\">At the trial the defendant proposed to prove by the witness, Jacob Martini, that he (Martini) and other persons, some of whom were officers of the election, went to the defendant, after the polls had closed, and requested him to open his saloon so they could get some beer, and that they told him it would not be a violation of the law to open and keep open a saloon after the polls had been closed, and that defendant, at their request, after they had told him it would be no violation of the law for him to open after the polls were closed, did open his saloon, and not before. On objection by the State, this testimony was excluded by the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-10\"><em>Marberry &amp; </em>Taylor, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjD\">The court erred in excluding the evidence of Jacob Martini, to the effect, that he and others told defendant it would be no violation of law to open his barroom after the polls were closed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-11\">1.

Huff, that the man that opened the saloon on election day was Martin Steinberger, Jr., when the defendant was charged as being Martin Steinberger in the information. Because there was a fatal variance between the proof and allegation. Proof that Martin Steinberger, Jr., did, etc., would not support the allegation that Martin Steinberger did, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-4\">The allegation and the piroof must correspond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-5\">In this case the information charges Martin Steinberger with the offense, and the State, over objection of the defendant, proved by the witness, Huff, that Martin Steinberger, Jr., was the party who violated the law.

The complaint alleges that the election was held by lawful authority, for the purpose of \u201celecting a Governor and other State officers, judges, congressmen and county officers.\u201d The information alleges the election was held lawfully, and for the purpose of \u201celecting a Governor and other State officers, judges, congressmen, members of the legislature, county and precinct officers.\u201d A motion in arrest of judgment was made because of a variance between the complaint and the information. There' is no variance. The election as charged in the complaint was for the same precise purpose as that charged in the information. The fact that all of the officers were not named in the complaint, and are named in the information, creates no variance. They both set out a general election; and all of the courts of Texas take judicial knowledge that such an election is for the purpose of electing the officers named in the complaint and in the information. Appellant proposed to prove that parties told him that they wanted beer, and that it was no offense to open the saloon after the polls had closed. This was excluded. All persons are required to know the law. There was no error in excluding this evidence. The complaint charged that \u2018\u2018Martin Steinberger, Jr.,\u201d committed the offense. There were two Martin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Steinbergers\u2014one the father, and the appellant, the son. The information does not state whether it is \u201cjunior\u201d or \u201csenior,\u201d but simply alleges it was \u201cMartin Steinberger\u201d who committed the offense. It was not necessary for the information to state that it was \u201cMartin Steinberger, Jr.\u201d Upon the trial the prosecution proved, however, that it was \u201cMartin Steinberger, Jr.,\u201d who opened the saloon. There is no variance in this matter, and no error pertaining thereto. The verdict of the jury is complained of, because it did not say of what the defendant was guilty, and did not assess any punishment. The punishment assessed was \u00a7100. The jury found the defendant \u201cguilty.\u201d This evidently means \u201cguilty of the offense charged.\u201d There being no error in this record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
