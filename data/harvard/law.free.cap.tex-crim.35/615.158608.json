Code Crim. Proc., Art. 430, subdiv. 2; Thomas v. State, 18 Tex. Crim. App., 213; Bowen v. State, 28 Tex. Crim. App., 498. The court erred in allowing proof to be introduced in support of the second count of the information after the defendant had plead guilty to the first count in said information because the defendant could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>found guilty under both counts, and because these are separate and distinct offenses and not grades of the same offenses, and the defendant having placed himself in jeopardy on the first count could not be placed in jeopardy in the same trial for another and different offense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-5\">The offense of betting at a gaming table and bank kept and exhibited for the purposes of gaming, and the offense of keeping and exhibiting a gaming table and bank for the purposes, are not different degrees of one and the same offense, and neither of these in law include the other, and to be guilty of one of these precludes the possibility of being guilty of the other by one and the same act. The defendant cannot be convicted of more than one offense in one prosecution, nor can he be placed in jeopardy upon two different and distinct offenses in the same prosecution. Art. 714, Code Crim.

The court refused to take this course, but proceeded with the trial on both of the said counts, and the evidence was offered in the case. The court gave a written charge covering both counts in the information. The jury found the defendant guilty under the second count of the information, and assessed his punishment at a fine of $25 and ten days\u2019 imprisonment in the county jail. The appellant complains of this action of the court, and insists that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>had a right to enter his plea of guilty to the first count, and forestall any action on the part of the State as to any prosecution under the second count of the said information. If this were true, it would always be within the power of a defendant, where there were more counts than one in an information or indictment, to enter a plea of guilty to a count charging the smallest offense and the least punishment, and so prevent any trial as to any other count in the information or indictment. We do not understand such to be the rule of the law. It is competent for the State to present together in the same information or indictment two or more of such charges as were contained in this case; and in the case of a plea of guilty to any one count it is proper for the court, as was done in this case, to receive such plea, and then proceed with the trial as to the other counts in the indictment, and submit the whole case to the jury. The evidence in this case, in our opinion, was sufficient to authorize the finding of the j ury on the second count of the indictment. 'The court submitted this count to them, as well as the first count. The action of the court was proper, and the finding of the jury will not be \u2022disturbed. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b641-7\">HENDERSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A20\">On motion for rehearing, appellant contends that the second count of the information, which is the one on which the .appellant was convicted, does not show in what court it was presented. The information, in that respect, shows the beginning of the second \u2022count to be as follows: \u201cAnd the County Attorney presents on said \u25a0date in said county,\u201d etc. On this question appellant refers us to Bowen v. State, 28 Tex. Crim. App., 498. This was a case in which there was but one count, and the indictment does not show in what court the same was presented. Mr. Bishop says, \u201cThat each count must contain the necessary commencement\u2014leaving off the caption\u2014and the conclusion, \u2022as against the statute, or as against the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d He says, \u201cAs a rule, any count from which the commencement is omitted is bad.\u201d \u201cIn practice,\u201d he says, \u201cthe commencement is generally .abbreviated, after the first count, to read, \u2018The jurors aforesaid, on their \u2022oath aforesaid, do further present.\u2019 \u201d See, Bishop\u2019s New Crim. Proc., \u00a7 429. By reference to the same author, it will be seen that, in stating the form of an indictment containing more than one count, the sec\u2022ond count begins as above stated. See, Bishop\u2019s New Crim. Proc., \u00a7 132. So that it would appear that the commencement of this indictment in the second count, according to Mr. Bishop, is sufficient, without stating in what court the same was presented. Our statute on the form of indictments and informations states the requisites as to the beginning and concluding parts of each. See, Rev. Code Crim. Proc., Arts. 439, 466. This does not refer to the counts in an information or .an indictment. It has been held by our court that it is not necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>that each count of an indictment shall contain the concluding part thereof,, \u201cagainst the peace and dignity of the State.\u201d While it has been decided that each count, as to the charging part, is independent of every other count, still the preceding count or counts may be looked to, to-supply auxiliary allegations\u2014to supply defects in the subsequent counts. See, Boren v. State, S3 Tex. Crim. App., 28; Boles v. State, 13 Tex. Crim. App., 650. In West v. State, 21 Tex. Crim. App., 472, it was. held that where the District Attorney abandoned and dismissed the preceding counts, including the first count, and the trial proceeded on a subsequent count, it was not necessary that such subsequent count should begin, \u201cin the name and by the authority of the State of Texas,\u201d but that the first count, though dismissed, could be looked to for this allegation. The court say in that case. \u201cThe commencement and caption are to be considered, not only as a part of the first count, but as part of each and all counts in the indictment, and may be referred to and considered in aid of any count. They constitute a part of the entire indictment.\u201d In Morgan v. State, 31 Tex. Crim. Rep., 1, it is held that the first count may be looked to, on a prosecution of the subsequent count,, to supply the date of the commission of the offense. While it is not-necessary in this case to go to the extent in the last case cited, yet we think, on principle and on authority, there can be no question that, as to a mere matter of form, the first count can be looked to, to help out the-want of an allegation in the subsequent count. As we have seen, by Mr. Bishop, the commencement in the count before us is sufficient; and our own decisions go much further in this respect than does the text-book writer just quoted. We think the second count of the indictment, under which the appellant was convicted, in itself, is sufficient, as against the criticism urged by the appellant, and that, if it were not, we could recinto the first count of the information for the purpose of helping out the defect suggested. The motion for a rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\n<em>Motion Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
