C. Cole, then in the employ of the County Attorney\u2019s office, but not regularly appointed by the District Court to wait upon the grand jury, examined the witnesses for the grand jury, upon which this and the other indictments, were found.

But no person, not even the County Attorney, would be permitted by law, to remain with the grand jury whenever they vote upon the presentment of an indictment. He would have the unquestioned right, however, to remain with them during all the time that the witnesses were being examined, upon which the indictment was based. Hence I conclude that the inhibition \u201cagainst any person being present with the grand jury when they are deliberating upon the accusation against a defendant\u201d refers to the time when the vote is actually taken as to whether the bill shall be returned.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b465-5\">HENDERSON, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aim\">Conviction for permitting faro to be exhibited, for the purpose of gaming, in a house the property of the appellant. Counsel for appellant moved to set aside the indictment, because Mr. Cole, acting as Assistant County Attorney, was present when the grand jury were deliberating upon the accusation against the defendant. Article 523, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provides that, \u201cA motion to set aside an indictment or information shall be based on one or more of the following causes, and no other: * * * (2) Because that some person not authorized by law was present when the grand jury were deliberating upon the accusation against the defendant, or were voting upon the same.\u201d Article 394 provides, \u201cThat the attorney representing the State may come before the grand jury at any time, except when they are discussing the propriety of finding a bill of indictment, or voting upon the same.\u201d We apprehend that \u201cdiscussing the propriety of finding a bill of indictment,\u201d and \u201cdeliberating upon the accusation against the defendant,\u201d mean the same thing. Mr. Webster defines \u201cdeliberating\u201d as the \u201cact of weighing and examining the reasons for and against a choice of measures; careful discxxssion and examinations of the reasons for axxd against a proposition.\u201d Ixi support of his motion, appellant introdxxced Mr. Cole, who swore, \u201cThat he was an attomeyat-law; that he was acting as Assistant County Attorney; that he was present when the grand jury was hearing testimony in the case of Dan A. Stxxai-t; that he examined the witnesses for them, and was present with them dxxring their investigations and deliberations on these cases; that he was not present, however, when they voted on the cases.\u201d The motion is sxxstained by the testimony of this witness, and we presume that he xxnderstood the meaning of the language xxsed. The County Attorney seemed to be satisfied with his testimony, did not question him as to what he meant by \u201cdeliberation and investigations,\u201d and the above is all the evidence before xxs bearing xxpon this subject. It is strange that the Assistant County Attorney would be present before the grand jury when they were deliberating xxpon a bill, when the statute provides explicitly that this shall be a ground for setting aside the indictment. Every bill presented under these circumstances, if a motion is made and sustained by the evidence, as in this case, will have to b\u00e9 set aside. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Convictions obtained under such bills, with such a motion so sustained, will all have to be reversed, and the prosecutions dismissed. The motion should have been sustained, because the statute requires it. The judgment is reversed, and the prosecution dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\n<em>Reversed and Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
