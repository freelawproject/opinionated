The court erred in allowing the County Attorney to amend said certificate of District Clerk transferring said cause to this court because the same was not done regularly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-7\">3. The court erred in overruling defendant\u2019s plea to the jurisdiction No. 2, because the certificate of said District Clerk fails to show the offense for which said defendant was indicted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-8\">Before the County Court can acquire jurisdiction over a defendant indicted there must be a proper transfer from the District Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-9\">The defendant presented a plea to the jurisdiction No. 1, because the indictment was not properly transferred to the County Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-10\">The transfer shows a case against W.

The court granted the State time to perfect the transfer and overruled defendant\u2019s motion No. 1 to quash.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b414-11\">The County Attorney filed an amended transfer where the name of the defendant was corrected, but the offense for which the defendant was placed on trial was not named in the transfer. Defendant filed his. plea to the jurisdiction No. 2, and urged as to his ground that the amended transfer was not proper, and the offense for which the defendant was placed on trial was not named in the transfer. The defendant filed his bill of exceptions. Brumley v. State, 11 Tex. Crim. App., 115; McDonald v. State, 7 Tex. Crim. App., 114; Donaldson v. State,. 15 Tex. Crim. App., 25; Mitten v. State, 24 Tex.

An amended transfer was then filed, properly naming the accused, but which did not name the offense. A second plea to the jurisdiction was then urged, because of this omission to name the offense with which the accused was charged. It was proper to amend the certificate of transfer. It was unnecessary to name the accused on the minutes of the District Court, in noting the presentment of the indictment in that court, and it is not required to make entry on said District Court minutes of the offense charged.

It is not controverted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>the second transfer correctly trap scribes the minutes of the transferring court. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
