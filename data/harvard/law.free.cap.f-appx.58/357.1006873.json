We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">During the proceedings before the Administrative Law judge (ALJ), Alexy testified that the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) Hospital had found him to be disabled. But the ALJ did not request the VA\u2019s medical reports for incorporation into the record. In Social Security cases, the ALJ must fully and fairly develop the record, <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1288 (9th Cir.1996), and incorporate any reports from a VA hospital finding the claimant to be disabled. The VA\u2019s finding of disability must be considered and given great weight. <em>McCartey v. Massanari, </em>298 F.3d 1072, 1076 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">For the reasons stated in <em>McCartey, </em>the ALJ had the burden of obtaining the VA records once Alexy raised the issue by testimony. However, <em>McCartey </em>was decided after Alexy\u2019s hearing, and the ALJ did not here request the VA records. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand this case for a new hearing with instructions to obtain the VA records, as is required by <em>McCartey, </em>which must be considered at the new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">Because review of the VA records may affect the ALJ\u2019s consideration of other issues raised by Alexy, we decline to reach those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
