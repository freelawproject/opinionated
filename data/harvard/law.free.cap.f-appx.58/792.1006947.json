The two appeals were separately briefed and separately argued in this court. However, they will be consolidated for disposition and both appeals will be considered in this Order and Judgment, <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>No. 01-7028, <em>U.S. v. Ralph Douglas Gann</em></p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In an 11-count superseding indictment, Ralph Douglas Gann, hereinafter referred to as Doug Gann, his brother, Thomas Doss Gann, and their mother, Irene Marie Gann, and two others were charged with various drug and drug related violations. Doug Gann went to trial on six of the 11 counts, namely two counts of possessing a firearm while under indictment, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n); two counts of possessing a firearm after a former felony conviction, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); one count of conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; and one count of maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing and using methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1). At the conclusion of the government\u2019s presentation of evidence, the district court dismissed the two counts charging possession of firearms while under indictment, and the remaining four counts were submitted to the jury. The jury found Doug Gann not guilty on the conspiracy charge and not guilty on one of the counts charging possession of a firearm after a felony conviction, but the jury convicted him on the count charging him with maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing and using methamphetamine and on one count charging him with possessing a firearm after a former felony conviction, namely Counts 3 and 10, respectively, of the superseding indictment. He was thereafter sentenced to imprisonment for 240 months on Count 3 and 120 months on Count 10, \u201cthe terms of imprisonment on Counts 3 and 10 ... to run consecutively.\u201d Doug Gann appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">1. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">Pursuant to a search warrant, agents conducted several searches of a residence located at 416 Ridge Drive (\u201cRidge Drive\u201d) in Sallisaw, Oklahoma<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, located in Sequoyah County, Oklahoma, and owned by Doug Gann\u2019s parents, Ralph Wallace Gann, deceased, and Irene Marie Gann, and a trailer house located in Chicken Creek Community (\u201cChicken Creek\u201d), Cherokee County, Oklahoma, owned by Irene Gann. In the affidavits in support of the two applications for a warrant to search the Ridge Drive residence, the affiants, in each instance, stated that in front of the premises to be searched was a mailbox having the numbers \u201c416\u201d and the name \u201cDoug Gann\u201d written on the side. The numbers on the side of the mail box were correct. However, at the time of the suppression hearing it was stipulated by the parties that the part of the affidavits stating that the name of \u201cDoug Gann\u201d was on the side of the mailbox was incorrect, and that the name on the mailbox was actually \u201cRalph Gann.\u201d As indicated, the Gann brothers were \u201cRalph Douglas Gann\u201d and \u201cThomas Doss Gann,\u201d and their deceased father was \u201cRalph Wallace Gann.\u201d Counsel\u2019s first ground for reversal is that in each instance the affiants falsely and deliberately, or recklessly, stated in their respective affidavits that the name \u201cDoug Gann\u201d appeared on the mailbox in front of the Ridge Drive property, and that the false statement was necessary to the finding of probable cause, citing <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978) and <em>Clanton v. Cooper, </em>129 F.3d 1147, 1154 (10th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>1997). Counsel argues that the incorrect statement in each of the affidavits that the name \u201cDoug Gann\u201d appeared on the mailbox conveyed to the issuing state judge the impression that \u201cDoug Gann\u201d owned the residence in question, when, in fact, he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The government\u2019s position is that the mistake was an innocent one, and did not affect the validity of the search warrant which issued thereon because the \u201cincorrect statement\u201d was not necessary to a finding of probable cause. The government argues that a description of premises to be searched is sufficient if it enables the officers to ascertain the place to be searched with reasonable effort and that \u201cpractical accuracy\u201d, rather than \u201ctechnical precision,\u201d controls a determination of whether an affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant adequately discloses the premises to be searched. <em>United States v. Hutchings, </em>127 F.3d 1255, 1258 (10th Cir.1997), <em>United States v. Occhipinti, </em>998 F.2d 791, 799 (10th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">In our view the incorrect statement in the affidavits that the name \u201cDoug Gann\u201d appeared on the side of the mailbox could not have, under the described circumstances, affected the issuing judge in his determination of probable cause. In this regard, we note that in the \u201cprobable cause\u201d section of the first affidavit, the affiant stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that on July 17, 1998, a reliable confidential informant had advised the affiant that persons at the Ridge Drive residence had in their possession a large quantity of white powdery substance represented to be methamphetamine, and that two of the four \u201cpersons\u201d were known as \u201cRalph Douglas Gann\u201d and as \u201cDoss Gann.\u201d In this same vein, a different affiant in support of the second application to search the Ridge Drive residence stated that \u201cwithin the last seventy-two (72) hours\u201d a confidential informant had informed him \u201cthat methamphetamine could be purchased at the above mentioned residence\u201d and that the informant had been given \u201can 8 ball\u201d of methamphetamine and \u201ctold to return with the money later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying Doug Gann\u2019s motion to suppress. The location of the Ridge Drive premises was more than adequately described by a correct street address, directions and mileage indicators. Further, there is no evidence that the misstatement in the affidavit was \u201cfalsely made,\u201d as counsel suggests, and, in any event, the misstatement was not \u201cnecessary to the finding of probable cause\u201d that methamphetamine was being manufactured, distributed or used at the residence located at 416 Ridge Drive. <em>United States v. Tisdale, </em>248 F.3d 964, 973 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">2. Motion for Acquittal on Count 3</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">Counsel next argues that the district court erred in denying Gann\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on Count 3 of the superseding indicting. Count 3 of the superseding indictment charged Ralph Douglas Gann, his brother, Thomas Doss Gann, their mother, Irene Marie Gann, and one Karen Jean Real with knowingly and intentionally maintaining two different places for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing and using methamphetamine, namely the Ridge Drive property and the Chicken Creek property in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1), and that each had \u201caided and abetted\u201d the others in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Counsel\u2019s argument is that the Ridge Drive residence was owned and maintained by Gann\u2019s mother, Irene Gann, and that Doug Gann did not have either dominion or control over the Ridge Drive residence and thus did not \u201cmaintain\u201d a place for the purpose of manufacturing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>distributing or using methamphetamine. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The charge in Count 3 was that from April, 1998, until March, 2000, the four named defendants in that particular count were maintaining both the Ridge Drive and Chicken Creek premises for not only the purpose of manufacturing methamphetamine but also for the purpose of distributing and using methamphetamine. Additionally, each was charged with aiding and abetting the others in such activity at the respective locations. At trial, Terry McGraw, a named defendant in the superseding indictment, (but not a named defendant in Count 3), testified that Doug Gann lived with Karen Real at the Ridge Drive residence. McGraw testified that, during the five-week period that he was associated with the Ganns, he would often take Doug Gann to work, pick him up after work, and go to the Chicken Creek property where they would eat supper and then return Doug Gann to the Ridge Drive residence. Another associate, Steve Smith, testified that Doug Gann lived in the Ridge Drive residence. During the execution of the search warrant at the Ridge Drive premises on July 18, 1998, Doug Gann and Karen Real were on the premises and during all three searches, documents associating Gann with the residence were found. Without belaboring the point, we conclude from our examination of the record that the district court did not err in denying Gann\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal in Count 3 of the superseding indictment interposed at the close of the government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">3. Motion for Acquittal on Count 10</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">Count 10 of the superseding indictment charged that on May 25, 1999, at the Chicken Creek property Ralph Douglas Gann, having previously been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, possessed a firearm, namely, a Glenfield, Model 75C, .22 caliber, rifle, serial number 18397189, which had been transported in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). At the conclusion of the government\u2019s case, counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal on Count 10, contending that the evidence was insufficient to show that Doug Gann \u201cpossessed\u201d the rifle in question. The district court denied that motion, and the jury later convicted Gann on Count 10. On appeal, counsel argues that the district court erred in denying Gann\u2019s motion for acquittal on Count 10. The government\u2019s position is that the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, together with the reasonable inference drawn therefrom, viewed in a light most favorable to the government, was sufficient to show that Gann had \u201cconstructive possession\u201d of the rifle in question, citing <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>107 F.3d 774, 779-80 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">Prior to trial, Doug Gann stipulated to a prior felony conviction. Evidence adduced at trial showed that although Doug Gann \u201clived\u201d in the Ridge Drive property, he spent much time at the Chicken Creek property, which was owned by his mother, Irene Gann. On May 25, 1999, officers searched both the Ridge Drive and Chicken Creek properties. At Ridge Drive officers seized 11 syringes containing methamphetamine, as well as 82 grams of powder methamphetamine. At the Chicken Creek property, a shaving kit was found which contained numerous syringes as well as prescription bottles bearing Doug Gann\u2019s name. On the front porch of the trailer, a case of pseudoephedrine was found. At the time of the search, Doug Gann and his mother, Irene, were both in the living room of the trailer. Leaning against a television set in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the living room was a .22 caliber rifle, which the officers seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">In our view, the district court did not err in denying Gann\u2019s motion for acquittal on Count 10. The totality of the evidence shows that this was a \u201cfamily business,\u201d involving Doug Gann, Doss Gann and Irene Gann, and others, at both the Ridge Drive and Chicken Creek properties. Further, the evidence shows that at the time he was arrested the rifle in question was only a relatively short distance from Doug Gann, in plain view, in the so-called living room of the Chicken Creek property. A conviction under a constructive possession theory will be upheld when there is some evidence to support at least a plausible inference that the defendant had knowledge of and access to the weapon. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>29 F.3d 545, 549 (10th Cir.1994). Under <em>Mills, </em>which was relied on by both parties, the evidence presented is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination, from all the facts and circumstances, that Doug Gann constructively possessed the rifle, even though it was not, so to speak, \u201cin his hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">4. Consecutive Sentences</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">As indicated, the district court sentenced Gann to imprisonment for 20 years on Count 3 and to 10 years imprisonment on Count 10, and ordered that each term should \u201crun consecutively.\u201d Counsel argues that the district court erred in ordering that the two sentences be served consecutively, and that it should have ordered that the two sentences be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">The pre-sentence report set Gann\u2019s offense level at 38 and his criminal history category at VI, the guideline range therefor being 360 months imprisonment to life imprisonment. The defendant filed an objection to that part of the pre-sentence report setting the guideline range at 360 months imprisonment to life. The statutory sentence for a person violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(i), maintaining a place for manufacturing, distributing, or using methamphetamine, shall be a sentence of not more than 20 years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(b). In this regard, we note that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a) provides that where the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum sentence under the applicable guideline range, which is our case, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence \u201cshall be the guideline sentence.\u201d Thus, under the guidelines themselves, the \u201cguideline sentence\u201d for Count 3 is 20 years, the statutory maximum provided for in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(b), and not the \u201cguideline range\u201d of 360 months to life. In line therewith, the district court disregarded the guideline range of 360 months to life and sentenced Gann on Count 3 to 20 years imprisonment, the statutory maximum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">As stated, the district court also sentenced the defendant to 10 years imprisonment on Count 10 and ordered that the two sentences run consecutively. In the district court, the defendant objected to the pre-sentence report\u2019s recommendation that, based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the sentence on Count 10 should run consecutively to the sentence imposed on Count 3, arguing that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c), the sentence on Count 10 should run concurrently with the sentence on Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">On appeal, the defendant\u2019s position is that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c), the sentence in Count 10 should run concurrently with the sentence imposed in Count 3. That provision reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-11\">(c) If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is adequate to achieve the <em>total punishment, </em>then the sentences on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>all counts shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise required by law. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arl\">Conversely, the government\u2019s position is that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the sentence imposed in Count 10 \u201cshall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\u201d That guideline reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">(d) If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the <em>total punishment. </em>In all other respects, sentences on all counts shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise required by law. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2 pertains to sentencing on multiple counts of conviction, which is our case. The commentary thereunder reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">This section specifies the procedure for determining the specific sentence to be formally imposed on each count in a multiple-count ease. <em>The combined length of the sentences (\u201ctotal punishment\u201d) is determined by the adjusted combined offense level. </em>To the extent possible, the total punishment is to be imposed on each count. Sentences on all counts run concurrently, except as required to achieve the total sentence, or as required by law. (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACm\">It is counsel\u2019s position that the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d in the instant case is 20 years, whereas the government contends that the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d is 30 years. Our study of this matter leads us to conclude that the \u201ctotal punishment\u201d in the instant case is 30 years, which is the minimum sentence \u201cdetermined by the adjusted combined offense level,\u201d but is also the total of the statutory m\u00e1ximums authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(b) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2), namely 20 years and 10 years respectively. It is on this basis that we conclude that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d), the district court did not err in ordering that the sentences on Counts 3 and 10 \u201crun consecutively.\u201d <em>See </em>Federal Sentencing Guidelines Handbook, \u00a7 5G1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">5. Offense Level</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.8(a) reads as follows;</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">Renting or Managing a Drug Establishment; Attempt or Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">(2) If the defendant had no participation in the underlying controlled substance offense other than allowing the use of the premises, the offense level shall be 4 levels less than the offense level from \u00a7 2D1.1 applicable to the underlying controlled substance offense, but not greater than level 16.</p>\n<p id=\"AYo\">Counsel argues that since Gann was acquitted on the conspiracy charge the district court erred in fixing Gann\u2019s base offense level at 38 and that, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.8(2), Gann\u2019s base offense level should have been fixed at 16, instead of 38. (A offense level of 16 coupled with a criminal history category of VI sets a guideline range at 46 to 57 months imprisonment.) We are not persuaded by this argument. In Count 3, Gann was not only charged with maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing methamphetamine, but was also charged with maintaining a place for the purpose of distributing and using methamphetamine. In our view, the evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s verdict that Gann was guilty on Count 3 and under such circumstances the district court was not required to fix Gann\u2019s offense level at 16 on the ground that he only allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>the use of the Ridge Drive residence for the manufacture or distribution or use of methamphetamine and had \u201cno participation in the underlying substance offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">6. Minor Participant</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">Mitigating Role</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-7\">Based on the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, decrease the offense level as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">(a) If the defendant was a minimal participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 4 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">(b) If the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-10\">In cases falling between (a) and (b), decrease by 3 levels.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">On appeal, counsel argues that the district court erred in not concluding that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant,\u201d and, as such, entitled to a 2 level decrease in his offense level. In our view, the district court did not commit reversible error in deciding that Gann was not a \u201cminor participant\u201d in this drug operation. In <em>United States v. Lockhart, </em>37 F.3d 1451, 1455 (10th Cir.1994) we said, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) a district court\u2019s determination as to whether a defendant was a minimal or minor participant is reviewed only for \u201cclear error;\u201d (2) a defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was a minor or minimal participant; and (3) a defendant is not entitled to a deduction in his offense level when U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 simply because he is the least culpable among several participants in a joint criminal enterprise. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">No. 01-7029, <em>U.S. v. Thomas Doss Gann</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">Thomas Doss Gann, hereinafter referred to as \u201cDoss Gann,\u201d his brother, Ralph Douglas Gann, hereinafter referred to as \u201cDoug Gann,\u201d their mother, Irene Marie Gann, and Karen Jean Real were jointly tried on various drug and drug related charges. Doss Gann was convicted by a jury of the following charges: Count 1, conspiracy to manufacture, possess and distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; Count 2, attempt to manufacture methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; Count 3, maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing and using methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; Count 5, possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S .C. \u00a7 924(c) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and Counts 7, 9 and 11, possession of a firearm while under indictment in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Doss Gann was sentenced to imprisonment for 240 months on Counts 1, 2 and 3 to be served concurrently and to imprisonment for 60 months on Counts 7, 9 and 11, the latter three sentences to be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with the sentences imposed on Counts 1, 2 and 3. As to Count 5, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 60 months to be served consecutively to \u201call other counts.\u201d Doss Gann appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">1. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">Prior to trial Doss Gann\u2019s brother, Doug Gann, filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized in two searches of the Ridge Drive premises. Doss Gann joined in that motion. A suppression hearing was held and, as indicated above, the district court denied the motion. On appeal, Doss Gann\u2019s first ground for reversal is that the district court erred in denying the motion to suppress. This particular issued was raised in Doug Gann\u2019s appeal, where we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>have held that the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">2. Insufficient Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">Counsel next argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts on Counts 7, 9 and 11. Count 7 charged Doss Gann, Doug Gann and Karen Jean Real with receiving on or about May 25,1999, at 416 Ridge Drive, an Intratec, Model Tec-DC9, 9mm semi-automatic pistol, serial number D050373, and a Winchester, Model 1300, 12 gauge shotgun, serial number L2807437, while under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Count 9 charged the Gann brothers and their mother, Irene, with receiving on or about May 25, 1999, in the Chicken Creek property a Glenfield, Model 75C, .22 caliber rifle, serial number 18397189, while under indictment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Count 11 charged Doss Gann with receiving on February 4, 1999, in Braggs, Muskogee County, Oklahoma, a Taurus, .357 magnum revolver, serial number QA482844 while under indictment, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person who is under indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to ... receive any firearm ... which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">At trial, evidence was introduced that Doss Gann had been charged on July 10, 1998, by information with a felony in a state court in Cherokee County, Oklahoma. However, there was no evidence that any preliminary examination had ever been conducted thereon. Counsel first argues that the filing of a state charge by information, as opposed to an indictment, does not meet the requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(n) that the \u201cperson\u201d be \u201cunder indictment.\u201d However, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(14) provides that \u201cthe term indictment includes an indictment or information in any court under which a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year may be prosecuted.\u201d <em>See United States v. Fillman, </em>162 F.3d 1055 (10th Cir.1998). Counsel\u2019s effort to distinguish <em>Fillman </em>from the present one is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">It is apparently agreed that Doss Gann was first \u201cunder indictment\u201d in a state court of Oklahoma on July 10, 1998, for a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. The charge in Count 7 was that on or about May 25, 1999, he received firearms at the Ridge Drive property while under indictment. Counsel next argues that there is no evidence that Doss Gann \u201creceived\u201d those firearms subsequent to July 10, 1998, the date when he was charged with a felony in an Oklahoma state court. As to Count 9, counsel also argues that there is no evidence that he \u201creceived\u201d the firearm at the Chicken Creek property after July 10,1998. Counsel does not argue that Count 11 is subject to the same objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">There were several searches of both the Ridge Drive property and the Chicken Creek property. The testimony was that on each search <em>all </em>firearms were seized and removed from the premises in question. From that fact, the government argues that the jury could properly infer that the firearms found in the searches of the Ridge Drive property on May 25,1999, and the Chicken Creek property on that same date were \u201creceived\u201d by Doss Gann <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>after July 10, 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree. Further, the evidence indicated that Doss Gann did have a sufficient \u201cnexus\u201d with both properties to establish \u201cdominion and control\u201d over the firearms found therein, and there was evidence that Doss Gann often traded drugs for guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">KELLY, Circuit Judge, with whom SEYMOUR, Circuit Judge joins, concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">Nos. 01-7028, <em>United States v. Ralph Douglas Gann; </em>01-7029, <em>United States v. Thomas Doss Gann.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">I concur in the court\u2019s order and judgment, but write separately to express my concern with the consecutive sentences imposed in Doug Gann\u2019s case (01-7028). Doug Gann argues that because the drug quantity resulting in an offense level 38 (and a guideline range of 360 months to life) was not alleged in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>United States v. Jones, </em>235 F.3d 1231 (10th Cir.2000). This argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Lott, </em>310 F.3d 1231 (10th Cir.2002), where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-8\">The district court\u2019s ability to determine the \u201ctotal punishment,\u201d [under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) ] based on drug quantities determined under a preponderance of the evidence standard, for defendants facing multiple convictions remains untouched by the <em>Apprendi </em>decision, so long as the sentence for a particular count is within the statutory maximum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-11\"><em>See United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 570-71 (9th Cir.) (en banc) (stating that <em>Apprendi </em>is not violated when district court applies Guideline \u00a7 5G1.2(d) to issue consecutive sentences under multiple counts in order to reach an appropriate total sentence under the Guidelines so long as no sentence under any one count exceeds the maximum allowable under <em>Apprendi </em>for that count in the absence of a jury determination of drug quantities that would support an enhanced sentence under that count), <em>cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1105, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-12\"><em>Lott, </em>310 F.3d at 1242-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">Although the <em>Apprendi </em>argument is unavailing, do consecutive sentences required by mandatory application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(d) effectively require a sentence more severe on a particular count than that legislated by Congress? In connection with his <em>Apprendi </em>argument, Doug Gann suggests that the drug quantity associated with his conviction on count 3 resulted in a sentence in excess of the 20-year maximum. Aplt. Br. (01-7028) at 27 (\u201cIf the drug quantity had been lower and provided for a guideline range consistent with the 20-year maximum, without question Appellant would have been entitled to have both counts run concurrent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">District courts are empowered by statute with the discretion to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences when there are multiple counts of conviction. <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>185 F.3d 1108, 1109 (10th Cir.1999). In exercising that discretion, district courts must consider the guidelines, as well as other factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3584(b); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>3553(a)(4) &amp; (5). The guidelines place limits on a court\u2019s discretion to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>520 U.S. 1, 6-7, 117 S.Ct. 1032, 137 L.Ed.2d 132 (1997) (\u201cNormally, a district court has authority to decide whether federal prison terms should run concurrently with or consecutively to other prison sentences. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (vesting power in district court to run most prison terms either concurrently or consecutively); United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5G1.3 (Nov.1995) ... (guiding court\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 3584(a)).\u201d); <em>see also Witte v. United States, </em>515 U.S. 389, 404-06, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">In the context of <em>Apprendi </em>challenges, we have held that \u00a7 5G1.2(d) is a mandatory provision. <em>United States v. Price, </em>265 F.3d 1097, 1109 (10th Cir.2001); <em>see also Lott, </em>310 F.3d at 1243. A defendant must be sentenced in accordance with the combined offense level for multiple counts, and sentences upon multiple counts will be consecutive so as to implement the term called for by the combined offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, cmt. (Nov.2000);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>54 F.3d 1540, 1547 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Ordinarily, sentences on multiple counts run concurrently. 5 Wayne R. LaFave, Jerold H. Israel, &amp; Nancy J. King, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 26.3(f) (2d ed.1999). We have rejected the argument that mandatory application of \u00a7 5G1.2(d) is inconsistent with the statutory discretion provided a court to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences, relying upon our analysis in <em>United States v. Shewmaker, </em>936 F.2d 1124, 1128 (10th Cir.1991). <em>United States v. Green, </em>42 Fed.Appx. 239, 244 n. 7 (10th Cir.2002) (unpublished). In <em>Shewmaker, </em>we noted that \u00a7 3584(a) is a general provision and \u00a7 5G1.3 (requiring consecutive sentences in certain circumstances) is a specific provision that is lawfully promulgated, in part because the operative statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553, 3584, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994, were enacted as part of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and a district court may still depart. <em>Shew-maker, </em>936 F.2d at 1127-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">The guidelines promulgated by the Sentencing Commission must be consistent with Title 18. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(b)(1). Plainly, the Commission was empowered to promulgate guidelines including a determination of \u201cwhether multiple sentences to terms of imprisonment should be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(1)(D). Additionally, those guidelines were to establish incremental penalties for multiple offenses, but also reflect the inappropriateness of consecutive sentences for certain offenses. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(Z )(1), (2). When sentences are run consecutively based upon an implicit determination that the maximum sentence on one count is insufficient pun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>ishment for the conduct related to that count, that undercuts the legislative prerogative to determine sentence length for that particular count. No one would suggest that a district judge could impose a consecutive sentence, rather than a concurrent one, because he was of the view that the offense with the highest statutory maximum provided insufficient punishment for conduct related to that count, in other words, that the statutory penalty should have been greater. But because this issue was not raised or developed in this case, I concur in the panel order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b828-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-6\">. On July 18, 1998, an application for a search warrant to search the Ridge Drive residence was submitted to a state district court in Oklahoma, and, after the warrant was issued, a search was conducted on the same date.
