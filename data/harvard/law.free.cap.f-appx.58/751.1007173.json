R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, Markay\u2019s request for oral argument is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b785-21\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-22\">California state prisoner Jerome Markay appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition for writ of habeas corpus, challenging his conviction for two counts of battery on a non-prisoner. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-23\">Markay first contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to prepare a defense, to interview witnesses, and to object to a witness\u2019 testimony. Because this contention is belied by the record, Markay fails to demonstrate counsel\u2019s performance was outside the wide range of reasonable assistance. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (deciding that a petitioner demonstrates his counsel was ineffective by establishing that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the deficient performance prejudiced his defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-24\">To the extent Markay alleges that his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation was hindered by inadequate library access, this contention fails. Markay fails to demonstrate that any alleged denial of adequate library access by the trial court prejudiced his right to self-representation, since he had his own investigator, access to the law library, permission to interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>witnesses, and was subsequently appointed counsel to represent him. <em>Cf Milton v. Morris, </em>767 F.2d 1443, 1446 (9th Cir.1985) (recognizing that \u201can incarcerated defendant may not meaningfully exercise his right to represent himself without access to law books, witnesses, or other tools to prepare a defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Therefore, the district court properly denied federal habeas relief on Markay\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Woodford v. Visciotti </em>537 U.S. 19, 123 S.Ct. 357, 361, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam) (stating that the federal habeas scheme \u201cauthorizes federal-court intervention only when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 957, 154 L.Ed.2d 855 (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b785-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\">.
