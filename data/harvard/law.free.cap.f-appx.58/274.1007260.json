He brought employment discrimination claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f), and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, alleging that he experienced (1) racial discrimination when he was disciplined for disconnecting a customer\u2019s phone service and (2) gender discrimination when he applied for another position with his employer, but did not obtain it. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Sprint. Harrison appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Legal questions in discrimination actions brought under Title VII and similar statutes are reviewed de novo, while a district court\u2019s underlying factual findings are subject to clearly erroneous review. <em>See Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant Enter., Inc., </em>256 F.3d 864, 871 (9th Cir.2001). A district court\u2019s conclusion whether a plaintiff has satisfied the elements of a prima facie case is reviewed de novo, although the underlying factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Paige v. California, </em>291 F.3d 1141, 1145 n. 3 (9th Cir.2002). Whether a party has complied with the administrative claim requirements of Title VII is reviewed de novo. <em>See Sommatino v. United States, </em>255 F.3d 704, 708 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Harrison alleges that the two-day suspension he received for disconnecting service to one of Sprint\u2019s substantial customers without authorization constituted racial discrimination because other, non-protected class employees committed similar errors but received lesser sanctions. The district court held that the evidence provided by Harrison regarding the discipline received by other employees in supposedly similar disconnections was inadmissible and, even if admissible, found that it was insufficient to establish a prima facie case for Title VII purposes. The district court also held that there was insufficient evidence of intent to discriminate to support Harrison\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim. We agree. Thus, Sprint was entitled to summary judgment because it \u201cshow[ed] that the nonmoving party does not have enough evidence of an essential element of its claim ... to carry its ultimate burden of persuasion at trial.\u201d <em>Nissan Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Fritz Cos., </em>210 F.3d 1099, 1106 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">The district court dismissed Harrison\u2019s gender discrimination claim for lack of jurisdiction because of his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. Although Harrison had filed a charge of gender discrimination with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission, he was instructed to withdraw this charge and instead amend his prior charge of racial discrimination to include the new allegation. Harrison did not amend the first charge. Consequently, the district court properly dismissed this claim for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">Harrison has also alleged that, because in the district court he was proceeding pro se, he was entitled to receive from the trial court specific notice regarding his evidentiary burden in opposing a motion for summary judgment. We have required such notice be given to pro se prisoner plaintiffs, but such notice is not required for other pro se plaintiffs, including Harrison. <em>See Rand v. Rowland, </em>154 F.3d 952, 956 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s Order granting summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
