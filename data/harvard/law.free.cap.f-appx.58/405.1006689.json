R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Plaintiff-appellant Earnest Jack Hill, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, brings this civil-rights action pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). He appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for injunctive relief. This court has appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), which applies to appeals from district court interlocutory orders denying injunctions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">Mr. Hill is an inmate at the United States Penitentiary, Administrative Maximum facility in Florence, Colorado (ADX). He filed the instant action alleging that his conditions of confinement have exacerbated his pre-existing mental problems, in violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Mr. Hill also moved for an injunction requiring defendants to transfer him to a less restrictive environment. After holding an evidentiary inquiry into the effects of solitary confinement on Mr. Hill\u2019s mental condition and considering both parties\u2019 tendered documents, the magistrate judge recommended that the motion be denied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-16\">Based upon the record before the court, and more particularly the history of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Plaintiffs mental health diagnoses and the frequency of his contacts with the mental health staff at ADX, the [magistrate judge did] not find sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Plaintiff is incarcerated under conditions imposing a substantial risk of serious harm. The [magistrate judge] further [found] that Plaintiff has not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">R., vol. 3, doc. 114 at 14. The district court reviewed de novo all portions of the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to which objections were filed, then adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denied the request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The parties are familiar with the underlying facts and we will not repeat them. This court reviews a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s denial of a motion for a preliminary injunction ... for an abuse of discretion, legal error, or clearly erroneous factual findings.\u201d <em>Kikumura v. Hurley, </em>242 F.3d 950, 955 (10th Cir .2001).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">A movant is entitled to a preliminary injunction if he can establish the following: (1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the case; (2) irreparable injury to the movant if the preliminary injunction is denied; (3) the threatened injury to the movant outweighs the injury to the other party under the preliminary injunction; and (4) the injunction is not adverse to the public interest. Because a preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy, the right to relief must be clear and unequivocal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">After carefully reviewing the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, the district court\u2019s order, and the record on appeal, we conclude that Mr. Hill has failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion, legal error, or clearly erroneous factual findings in connection with the denial of his motion for injunctive relief. We AFFIRM for substantially the same reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation dated December 20, 2001, and the district court\u2019s order dated March 25, 2002. We GRANT Mr. Hill\u2019s Motion for Leave to Proceed Without Prepayment of Costs or Fees. We remind Mr. Hill that he is obligated to continue making partial payments until the entire fee has been paid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b440-12\">. Mr. Hill captioned his filing as a \"Renewed Motion for Temporary Restraining-Protective Order.\u201d \"Ordinarily, denial of a temporary restraining order is not appealable. There are, however, at least two exceptions to this general rule.\u201d <em>Populist Party v. Herschler, </em>746 F.2d 656, 661 n. 2 (10th Cir.1984) (citations omitted). This case fits within the exception applicable \u201cwhen the order in reality operates as a preliminary injunction\u201d because an adversary hearing was held. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, we note that the pro se plaintiff, the defendants, the magistrate judge, and the district court all treated the motion as one for preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
