R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Pro se petitioner Peter Anthony Gutierrez (Petitioner) requests a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. He claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his attorney\u2019s failure to advise him regarding how his sentence would be calculated. Because he has not demonstrated \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d we deny his request and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">On March 8, 1996, Petitioner was indicted on four charges: (1) possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); (2) possession of stolen firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j); (3) carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119; and (4) use of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). On April 22, 1996, Petitioner and the government reached a plea agreement under which Petitioner agreed to plead guilty to the first two counts, and the government agreed to dismiss the second two counts and not to initiate additional charges arising out of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">In applying the Sentencing Guidelines to Petitioner\u2019s case, the district court adopted the factual findings contained in the probation officer\u2019s presentence report, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Petitioner had used the illegally possessed firearm during the commission of a carjacking. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez, </em>No. 96-5221, slip op. at 3-4, 117 F.3d 1429 1997 WL 375342 (10th Cir. July 8, 1997). Thus, in considering which offense level to apply, the district court considered conduct relating to the two counts of the indictment \u2014 carjacking and use of a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence \u2014 that had been dismissed as part of the plea agreement between the government and Petitioner. <em>See id. </em>The court sentenced Petitioner to a term of 235 months in prison \u2014 five months shy of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Petitioner challenged his sentence on direct appeal to this court. We affirmed the district court\u2019s sentence, finding Petition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>er\u2019s claims to be wholly frivolous. <em>See id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Petitioner argues that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective during the plea process because he failed to inform Petitioner that the conduct associated with the charges dismissed as part of the plea agreement could be used to impose a higher sentence on the charges to which he pleaded guilty. We find this claim to be without merit. Petitioner was fully advised of the relevant information regarding his potential sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The plea agreement informed Petitioner that \u201cthe maximum statutory sentence under both Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g) (Count One), and Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(j) (Count Two) is imprisonment for a term of ten (10) years, and a fine of up to $250,000.00, or both.\u201d Plea Agreement at 6-7. The agreement stated that the sentence would be imposed in accordance with the Sentencing Guidelines, and that \u201cthe sentence has not yet been determined by the Court, that any estimate of the likely sentence received from any source is a prediction, not a promise, and that the Court has the final discretion to impose any sentence up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. In addition, the plea agreement informed Petitioner that \u201cTHE DEFENDANT FURTHER UNDERSTANDS THAT THE SENTENCE TO BE IMPOSED UPON THE DEFENDANT WILL BE DETERMINED SOLELY BY THE SENTENCING JUDGE.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Petitioner also executed a \u201cPetition to Enter Plea of Guilty and Order Entering Plea\u201d that was filed with the district court. In it Petitioner attested to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASA\">My attorney has informed me my plea of GUILTY could subject me to a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years on Count One, and ten years on Count Two....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">I have been advised by counsel I will be sentenced pursuant to the sentencing guidelines procedure established by Title 18 U.S.C. sections 3553 <em>et seq. </em>I understand sentencing is a matter left exclusively in the province of the Court; and I understand the sentence imposed by the Court may be within the guideline table range provided by law, or for good cause stated the Court may depart therefrom after a review of all relevant facts and circumstances of my case have been considered by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Petition to Enter Plea of Guilty and Order Entering Plea at 4, 6. This document also contained a \u201cCertificate of Counsel,\u201d signed by Petitioner\u2019s lawyer, which said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFB\">I have advised the defendant as to any minimum sentence required by law, and I have advised the defendant as to the maximum sentence possible under the applicable statutes. I have provided the defendant with my estimates concerning his possible sentencing guideline range, and my opinions concerning any possible grounds for upward or downward departure from the guideline range. I have specifically advised the defendant, however, that sentencing is a matter exclusively within the control of the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Our standard of review is set forth in <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>4 F.3d 1567, 1570 (10th Cir.1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">We review a challenge to a guilty plea based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel using the two-part test announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>See Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). Under this test, the defendant must show that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>dard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, and that the deficient performance resulted in prejudice, <em>id. </em>at 691. To show prejudice in the guilty plea context, the defendant must establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>474 U.S. at 59.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Petitioner has failed to show that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Petitioner alleges that \u201c[c]ounsel\u2019s failure to advise [him] that the dismissed charges would be used in the sentence calculation is a clear example of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\u201d Supporting Br. for Application for Certificate of Appealability at 2. He claims: \u201c[D]efense counsel led [him] to believe, by the dismissal of the charges, that the charges would not be used against [him]. Therefore, [he] was tricked and misled into pleading guilty, through misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He asserts that had he known that the charges would be used against him, he would have \u201cpled not guilty and insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In making these assertions, Petitioner neglects key facts. The plea agreement advised Petitioner that he faced a sentence of 10 years on each count to which he pleaded guilty. Moreover, the agreement specifically informed him that the judge was the ultimate decisionmaker in sentencing and that any estimates regarding his sentence made prior to his entering the plea were \u201ca prediction, not a promise.\u201d Plea Agreement at 8. Petitioner himself acknowledged in his petition to the sentencing court that \u201csentencing is a matter left exclusively in the province of the Court.\u201d Petition to Enter Plea of Guilty and Order Entering Plea at 6. Petitioner\u2019s counsel attested that he had told Petitioner of the maximum sentence he faced, provided his \u201cestimates concerning [Petitioner\u2019s] possible sentencing guideline range,\u201d and advised him \u201cthat sentencing is a matter exclusively within the control of the Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Thus, Petitioner was well informed of the consequences of his plea and knew that the court had the authority to sentence him to as much as 20 years in prison. His counsel\u2019s failure to inform him of the specific bases on which his sentence would be calculated is of no moment and does not constitute deficient representation. Petitioner does not allege that his counsel misinformed him that the Sentencing Guidelines would be applied in a certain way or that a lower sentence was likely to be imposed. Had his counsel done so, Petitioner\u2019s claim might well have merit. But there is no indication in either Petitioner\u2019s brief or the record on appeal that counsel misled Petitioner regarding what sentence he would receive. While a pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings are to be construed liberally, <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170, 1172 (10th Cir.1997), this court \u201cwill not supply additional factual allegations ... on [a petitioner\u2019s] behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1173-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">We have reviewed Petitioner\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s order, and the record on appeal. Petitioner\u2019s pleadings fail to satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Therefore, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
