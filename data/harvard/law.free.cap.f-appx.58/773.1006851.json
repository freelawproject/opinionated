The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found that the medical evidence established that Williams had a \u201csevere\u201d physical impairment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but concluded that Williams retained a residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) for medium work and was therefore not eligible for DIB or SSI. In so concluding, the ALJ improperly dismissed an agreed medical examiner\u2019s (\u201cAME\u2019s\u201d) non-exertional limitations and discounted the findings of other examining physicians. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391, and we reverse and remand for payment of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In support of his application for benefits, Williams submitted the medical report of Dr. Watkins, the AME in Williams\u2019 state workers\u2019 compensation proceeding. The ALJ accepted Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion that Williams retained 75% of his prior lifting capacity. However, the ALJ concluded that Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion that Williams\u2019 non-exertional limitations restricted Williams from upward and downward gazing or holding his head in a fixed position for a prolonged period were unsupported by any established pathology or by any findings in Dr. Watkin\u2019s physical examination or x-rays. He further stated that Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion that Williams should not engage in repetitive bending and stooping was also inconsistent with his clinical physical examination and x-ray findings. Further, he found that Dr. Watkin\u2019s diagnostic impression of spinal sprains/strains or soft tissue injuries superimposed on early degenerative arthritis did not support any such limitations, \u201csince any such soft tissue sprains/strains would be expected to have healed well within the 3)4 years between the alleged injury and Dr. Watkin\u2019s examination.\u201d After considering these factors along with the various functional capacity assessments in Williams\u2019 medical records, the ALJ dismissed Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion that Williams could not perform medium work. After careful review of the record, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s rejection of Dr. Watkins opinions regarding Williams\u2019 non-exertional limitations is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">First, in rejecting Dr. Watkin\u2019s limitations on upward and downward gazing and holding the head in a fixed position, the ALJ\u2019s decision did not reference or discuss any \u201cestablished pathology\u201d that would contradict Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion, and it did not address any contradictory findings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>the other physicians\u2019 reports. Dr. WatMn\u2019s own physical examination of Williams revealed a reduced range of motion in the cervical spine and neck, and he noted that Williams\u2019 x-rays showed early degenerative changes in the cervical spine and neck, thereby providing an objective basis for his conclusion. Because the ALJ failed to set forth his reasoning and the evidentiary support for his interpretation of the medical evidence, his rejection of Dr. Watkin\u2019s limitations on Williams\u2019 repetitive forward and downward gazing and fixed-position head-holding is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1102 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Regarding Dr. Watkin\u2019s limitation on repetitive bending and stopping, the ALJ failed to point to any finding in Dr. Watkin\u2019s report to support his conclusion that this restriction was inconsistent with Dr. Watkin\u2019s physical examination and x-ray findings. In fact, Dr. Watkin\u2019s x-ray studies revealed degenerative changes throughout the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine. Moreover, Dr. Watkin\u2019s findings were supported by reports from Williams\u2019 other examining physicians. For example, Dr. Sturman, whose opinion the ALJ did not address, opined that bending, stooping, and crawling should also be proscribed, while Dr. Kent, whose opinion the ALJ appears to have found credible, noted that Williams had a weakness of the lower extremities and that flexion at his waist was limited to bringing his fingertips nine inches from his toes. In addition, Dr. Dombrowski, whose opinion the ALJ improperly dismissed solely because he was hired by Williams\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation attorneys,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> diagnosed cervical disc herniation.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Finally, the ALJ failed to cite any specific physician\u2019s report stating that any soft tissue sprains/strains would have healed well within the 3/6 years between the alleged injury and Dr. Watkin\u2019s examination, and, in direct conflict with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, Dr. Kent also diagnosed a cervical and lumbosacral sprain. Because the ALJ did not resolve these ambiguities in the record and relied on his own lay opinion regarding how long a sprain/ strain would take to heal, his rejection of Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion that Williams could not engage in repetitive bending and stooping was also not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Because the ALJ erroneously rejected Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion regarding Williams\u2019 non-exertional limitations, there was no basis for the ALJ\u2019s decision to reject Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion regarding Williams\u2019 inability to perform medium work. Not only did the ALJ improperly dismiss the medical evidence in support of Dr. Watkin\u2019s non-exertional limitations, but the ALJ also failed to recognize that these limitations were critical to the proper determination of Williams\u2019 RFC. A claimant\u2019s RFC is limited to that necessary to perform sustained work on a regular basis at the particular level of exertion, <em>see Program Policy Statement: Titles II and XVI: Determining Capability to Do Other Work </em>\u2014 the <em>Medical Vocational Rules of Appendix 2: SSR 83-10, </em>1983 WL 31251, *2 (S.S.A.1983), and \u201ca claimant must be able to perform the full range of jobs in a given category.\u201d <em>Tackett, </em>180 F.3d at 1101. When a claimant\u2019s non-exertional limitations significantly restrict the range of work permitted by his exertional limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>tion, these impairments \u201cmay limit the claimant\u2019s functional capacity in ways not contemplated by the [Medical-Vocational] guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1102. Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Dr. WatMn\u2019s additional work limitations were \u201cquite inconsistent with the foundational limitation to no very heavy work\u201d is unfounded and cannot provide support for his conclusion that Williams had an RFC for performing medium work.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Because the ALJ failed to provide adequate reasons for rejecting Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion, we credit that opinion \u201cas a matter of law\u201d and do not remand for the sole purpose of allowing the ALJ to reevaluate Dr. Watkin\u2019s opinion. <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834. Taking Williams\u2019 non-exertional limitations into account, Williams is precluded from performing the full range of medium work and therefore could only have an RFC for performing light or sedentary work. <em>See Tackett, </em>180 F.3d at 1101. Because of Williams\u2019 age and lack of transferable skills, an RFC that corresponds with light or sedentary work entitles him to a finding of disability.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Because the record here has been fully developed and further administrative proceedings would serve no useful purpose, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for entry of judgment directing the payment of benefits. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1292 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that where (1) the ALJ has failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting such evidence, (2) there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of disability can be made, and (3) it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled were such evidence credited, those conditions warrant a remand for an award of benefits rather than for further proceedings). We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for entry of judgment directing the payment of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-8\">. The ALJ made this determination at \"Step Two\u201d of the five-step sequential analysis used for making DIB and SSI eligibility determinations under the Social Security Regulations (\u201cSSRs\"). 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. At Step Three, the ALJ concluded that Williams\u2019 impairment did not meet or equal the criteria of any impairment identified in the appendix to the Social Security Regulations commonly referred to as the \"Listings.\u201d In making this determination, the ALJ concluded that Williams had the RFC to perform medium work with no work at protected heights or around dangerous, unguarded, moving machinery. At Step Four, the ALJ found that Williams was not able to perform his past relevant work and had no transferable skills, but, at Step Five, he determined that there were numerous jobs in the Southern California region that Williams could perform given his vocational profile and RFC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b809-6\">. Although the ALJ may consider the fact that Dr. Dombrowski was retained by Williams\u2019 workers' compensation counsel in determining whether to find Dr. Dombrowski credible, he could not use that fact as the sole basis for rejecting his opinion. <em>See Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 522-23 (9th Cir. 1996); <em>Burkhart v. Bowen, </em>856 F.2d 1335, 1339 (9th Cir.1988); <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 832 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">. Williams was 53 years old when he filed his claim for DIB/SSI. Under SSA regulations, at age 53, Williams is categorized as \"closely approaching advanced age.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1563(d). However, by the December 1995 date of the ALJ\u2019s second and final decision, Williams was 57 years old, which corresponded to a classification of \"advanced age.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1563(e). The regulations provide that \"if you are of advanced age (age 55 or older), and you have a severe impairments) that limits you to sedentary or light work, we will find that you cannot make an adjustment to other work unless you have skills that you can transfer to other skilled or semiskilled work.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1568(d)(4). The ALJ determined that Williams did not have any transferable skills. Because the ALJ is required to use the age categories that apply to a claimant during the period for which the ALJ must determine if the claimant is disabled, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1563(b), and the period of adjudication started on March 17, 1991 and continued until December 27, 1995, Williams would be entitled to a finding of disability in light of his limited RFC for performing light or sedentary work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b810-10\">O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AY0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">I must respectfully dissent from the decision to reverse the district court and to award disability benefits. The Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits may be overturned \u201conly if it is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Apfel, </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999). Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, it is the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that must be upheld. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number><em>Id.; Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In this case, the ALJ rejected the recommendation of an examining physician that the claimant should refrain from repetitive upward and downward gazing or holding his head in a fixed position for a prolonged period of time. The ALJ may reject the <em>uncontradicted </em>opinion of an examining physician for \u201cspecific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830-31 (9th Cir.1995). However, where a treating physician\u2019s opinion is contradicted by a nontreating source, \u201cthe opinion of the nontreating source may itself be substantial evidence; it is then solely the province of the ALJ to resolve the conflict.\u201d <em>Andrews, </em>53 F.3d at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Dr. Watkins\u2019 recommendation is inconsistent with those of a nontreating physician, Dr. Kent, who recommended that the claimant \u201cshould be prophylactically precluded from very heavy lifting to prevent reinjury and/or aggravation of his current complaints.\u201d The recommendations of Dr. Watkins and Dr. Kent conflict, hence it is solely the province of the ALJ to resolve the conflict. <em>See id. </em>In addition, with one notable exception,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> no other examining physician-even those associated with the claimant\u2019s workers compensation claim-imposed the restriction suggested by Dr. Watkins. <em>See Sample v. Schweiker, </em>694 F.2d 639, 642 (9th Cir.1982) (\u201cquestions of credibility and resolution of conflicts in the testimony are functions solely of the Secretary\u201d); Sael<em>ee, </em>94 F.3d at 522 (\u201cThe ALJ is responsible for determining credibility and resolving conflicts in the medical testimony\u201d). It was reasonable for the ALJ to resolve the disputed recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Two other reasons also serve to support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. First, the ALJ determined that Dr. Watkins\u2019 recommendation was inconsistent with the documentary medical evidence. Ample evidence on the record exists to support that conclusion. Second, the ALJ found that Williams was an incredible witness. At the original hearing, the claimant refused to give his date of birth, refused to give any details of his treatment at the Veterans\u2019 Hospital, refused to discuss his current use of medication, refused to say what he could lift and endorsed 10 pounds only after much prompting and cajoling by his attorney.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At its most intense, the pain he testified to \u201cappear[s] to be minimal, remediable with current minimal treatment, and generously considered in reducing his residual functional capacity to any extent.\u201d In making his recommendation, Dr. Watkins specifically relied on the claimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>subjective complaints of pain, and noted that the claimant \u201cdid not appear to put his full effort\u201d into grip and strength tests. Because Dr. Watkins\u2019 recommendation was based on the self-serving complaints of an unreliable claimant, the ALJ could legitimately discount that recommendation. <em>Andrews, </em>53 F.3d at 1043 (\u201c[A]n opinion of disability premised to a large extent upon the claimant\u2019s own accounts of his symptoms and limitations may be disregarded, once those complaints have themselves been properly discounted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">. Dr. Dombrowski, a physician hired by the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation attorneys to provide a litigation report, provided an assessment of the claimant\u2019s functional capacity that the ALJ found was \"ridiculous, completely out of the mainstream of evidence is unsupported by his own report, is polemical in nature, and has no persuasive value.\u201d To the extent the majority suggests otherwise, the ALJ provided sufficient reasons-nay compelling ones-for rejecting Dombrowski's self-serving and unsupported assessment. <em>See Saetee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 523 (9th Cir. 1996) (where a physician\u2019s opinion is solicited by claimant\u2019s counsel, that fact may be used in conjunction with other evidence in the record to question the physician\u2019s credibility and disregard his opinions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-12\">. The district court found other aspects of Williams\u2019 claim for disability benefits were decidedly suspect. For example, Williams submitted two separate versions of a psychiatric evaluation to the ALJ-one long and one short. The \"short\u201d version \"deleted sections containing specific findings and opinions that could, on balance, be construed as more harmful than helpful to Plaintiff\u2019s Workers Compensation case.\u201d Clearly, the ALJ was never meant to see the \"long\u201d version of this report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
