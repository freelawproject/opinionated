The district court dismissed all claims against Masterson and Terry and granted summary judgment for Kirkham. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claims against Masterson and Terry. We reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Kirkham.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">As the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A of the claims against Masterson and Terry. <em>See Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). The retaliation claims properly were dismissed because Turner failed to allege that the retaliatory actions advanced no legitimate penological goal. <em>See Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994). The due process claims were properly dismissed because Turner has an adequate post-deprivation remedy under Arizona law. <em>See id. </em>at 816; <em>Howland v. State, </em>169 Ariz. 293, 818 P.2d 1169, 1172-73 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Barnett, 31 F.3d </em>at 815. In his First Amended Complaint, Turner checked the box for \u201cExcessive force by an officer\u201d in describing count II. This sufficed to plead an excessive force claim under the liberal construction we afford <em>pro se </em>complaints. See <em>Eldridge v. Block, </em>832 F.2d 1132, 1137 (9th Cir.1987). Because Turner pled a claim for excessive force, the district court erred by declining to consider that claim. Summary judgment was inappropriate. We remand to the district court for further proceedings on that claim. Each party shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b358-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
