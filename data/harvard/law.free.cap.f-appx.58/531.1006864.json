PARKER, STRAUB, and B.D. PARKER, Jr., Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b566-4\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the judgment of said district court be and it hereby is VACATED and REMANDED in part and AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Defendant-appellant Wilbur Stakes appeals from the district court\u2019s February 1, 2002 judgment, subsequent to his pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371,1341 and 1344. The court imposed a sentence of 18 months\u2019 incarceration, three years\u2019 supervised release, a $50 special assessment and restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (\u201cF.D.I.C.\u201d) in the amount of $16 million. Stakes appeals his sentence and the restitution amount, arguing that (1) the district court failed to follow the mandatory restitution factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664 and (2) the court erred when it failed to make a particularized finding regarding the scope of defendant\u2019s involvement in the crime when calculating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">Generally, we review a sentencing court\u2019s order of restitution for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Berardini, </em>112 F.3d 606, 609 (2d Cir.1997). However, \u201c[i]n reviewing an order specifying the manner in which a defendant must pay restitution, this Court must first determine whether the sentencing judge considered the factors specified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>302 F.3d 72, 74-75 (2d Cir.2002). Further, <em>Harris </em>tells us that \u201c[i]f we determine that the record does not establish that the sentencing judge considered the factors, we must vacate the restitution order and remand the case for resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">At no point in the sentencing hearing did the court mention the mandatory \u00a7 3664 factors. Nevertheless, the government argues that because those issues were addressed in the defendant\u2019s Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), and the court referred repeatedly to the PSR (albeit with respect to sentencing issues unrelated to restitution), the court must have considered those factors. However, \u201ca court\u2019s mere reading of the report does not indicate that the court considered its contents for these purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(vacating restitution order when record failed to show \u201csome affirmative act or statement allowing the inference that the district court considered the defendant\u2019s ability to pay\u201d) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The government points to a post-sentencing hearing, at which, in response to Stakes\u2019s argument that bail pending appeal should be granted because the restitution order was illegal, the district court stated that it had \u201cconsidered Defendant\u2019s Presentence Report, which states defendant\u2019s net worth to be $138,062, a not inconsiderable sum.\u201d Even assuming that \u00a7 3664(f)(2) permits the district court to give consideration to the mandatory restitution factors after the defendant has already been sentenced and restitution ordered \u2014 a dubious proposition for which the government offers no authority \u2014 the ex post statement in this case referred, at most, to just one of the many factors mandated under \u00a7 3664(f)(2). <em>See United States v. Giwah, </em>84 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir.1996) (vacating restitution order even though district judge \u201cdid consider the defendant\u2019s ability to pay\u201d because nonetheless \u201c[tjhere must ... be a sufficient basis in the record for this court to infer that all of the [statutory] factors have been considered\u201d). We find no evidence in the record indicating that the district court consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ered the mandatory factors, therefore we vacate the restitution order and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Defendant also argues that the court should have made a particularized finding regarding the scope of his involvement in the criminal fraud, relying primarily on <em>United States v. Studley, </em>47 F.3d 569 (2d Cir.1995) (interpreting and applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3). However, Stakes fails to recognize that in <em>Studley, </em>the defendant objected at sentencing to being held responsible for the entire $120,000 amount netted by the telemarketing scam, arguing that \u201cthe actions of the other employees of the telemarketing operation were not \u2018jointly undertaken criminal activity\u2019 within the meaning of section lB1.3(a)(2), and therefore ... he should be hable only for the estimated $ 5,000\u2014 $ 10,000 loss he caused himself.\u201d <em>Studley, </em>47 F.3d at 570. By contrast, at sentencing, Stakes acknowledged that the $16 million loss to the F.D.I.C. was caused by the very conspiracy of which he was convicted \u2014 thereby waiving the issue and rendering <em>Studley </em>factually inapposite. Thus, the district court did not err by declining to make a particularized finding on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">For the reasons we have stated, that portion of the judgment ordering restitution is VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing consistent with \u00a7 3664 and <em>Harris. </em>The other aspects of the judgment are AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
