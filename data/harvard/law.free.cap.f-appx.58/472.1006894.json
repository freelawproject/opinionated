Vernon petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) dismissing his appeal of his removal from a position with the United States Customs Service for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Vernon v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>Docket No. NY-315H-01-0329-1-1, 93 M.S.P.R. 307 (Aug. 29, 2002). Because we agree that Vernon does not have any right to appeal to the Board, we hold that the Board correctly concluded that it did not have jurisdiction and we, therefore, <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-23\">Vernon\u2019s appointment as a Customs Inspector was a Veterans Readjustment Appointment pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 307.103 (which made him a \u201cpreference eligible employee\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108(3)(B)). Vernon was removed while he was serving a one-year probationary appointment with the Customs Service. He had been ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>pointed subject to completion of a one-year trial period beginning July 31, 2000. He received a letter, effective upon receipt, notifying him of termination on July 23, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Vernon argues that the accounts of incidents related in the letter as the basis for his termination are false and that his termination was arbitrary and capricious. He contends that his removal represents violations of his Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment due process rights and that he should have received advance notice of his proposed removal and the opportunity to refute the unfavorable accounts at the basis of his removal. Vernon also argues that his removal constituted a violation of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Vernon specifically acknowledges that he was a probationary employee at the time of his removal and in his appeal to the Board, disavowed having any claim under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-353 (codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301 <em>et </em>seq.) or any claim under the Whistle-blower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12,103 Stat. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The Board has jurisdiction over appeals from certain agency personnel decisions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a), which provides that \u201can employee ... may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.\u201d This makes a petitioner\u2019s status as an \u201cemployee\u201d a prerequisite to having a right of appeal and to Board jurisdiction. Specifically, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511-7513, for purposes of appealing a removal action, a petitioner must be included in one of several possible categories in order to meet the definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d As a preference eligible individual in the excepted service who had completed less than one year of current continuous service, Vernon is not covered by any of the categories in \u00a7 7511(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vernon is, thus, not an \u201cemployee\u201d under \u00a7 7511 and he has no right to appeal. <em>See Horner v. Lucas, </em>832 F.2d 596 (Fed.Cir.1987) (holding that the petitioner was not entitled to the protections of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511(a)(1) and 7513 because under \u00a7 7511(a)(1)(A) the temporary status of his position in the competitive service prevented him from qualifying as an employee). The Board correctly concluded that it had no jurisdiction to reach the merits of any of Vernon\u2019s claims, including both the claims under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and the claims based on collective bargaining agreements. <em>See Pervez v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>193 F.3d 1371 (Fed.Cir.1999) (holding that as an individual with a probationary position in the competitive service, the petitioner was not an \u201cemployee\u201d and, therefore, the Board had no jurisdiction at all over her appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The only other way that the Board may entertain Vernon\u2019s appeal of the removal other than under \u00a7 7511, is if Vernon alleged the removal \u201cwas based on partisan political reasons or marital status.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After alleging termination based on marital status to the Board and the Board finding that he failed to make a nonfrivolous claim, Vernon does not argue this contention before us or suggest that the Board\u2019s finding was erroneous. We consider it, thus, also not a basis for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In sum, the petitioner is correct that he has \u201crights to due process,\u201d but 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511-7513 determine what process is \u201cdue,\u201d and the process due to the petitioner under those statutes does not include a right of appeal to the Board. We must affirm the Board\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">.
