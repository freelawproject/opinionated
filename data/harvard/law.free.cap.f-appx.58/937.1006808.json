Loper pled guilty before a federal court in Pennsylvania to four counts stemming from the January 2001 offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was indicted on two counts in a federal court in Maryland as a result of the October offense; he consented to a transfer of those charges to Pennsylvania, where he pled guilty to both counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court consolidated the cases for sentencing. Loper did not object to the presentence report. The government filed a motion for departure from the statutory mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court found that his cooperation merited a downward departure pursuant to the government\u2019s motion. The court imposed a sentence of 262 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-12\">Loper claims on appeal that the sentence imposed was excessive and an abuse of discretion. He contends that the downward departure was insufficient and that he should not have been sentenced as a career criminal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b972-13\">We have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Our appellate jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) is limited and does not permit us to review the extent of the downward departure granted to Loper. \u2018We have no jurisdiction to review [the appellant\u2019s] appeal from the district court\u2019s discretionary downward departure of his sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Khalil, </em>132 F.3d 897, 898 (3d Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Parker, </em>902 F.2d 221, 222 (3d Cir.1990). We will review for plain error the remaining three claims which involve issues concerning which Loper failed to make an objection before the District Court. <em>See United States v. Wolfe, </em>245 F.3d 257, 260-61 (3d. Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-14\">First, Loper claims that the District Court, in sentencing him, should have made a greater downward departure under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). He al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>leges that the court failed to account for various factors in formulating its departure, including his mental state and the judicial economy accomplished by the transfer of the Maryland charges. We will dismiss Loper\u2019s appeal on this issue because we are without jurisdiction to review the extent of the District Court\u2019s downward departure. <em>See Khalil, </em>132 F.3d at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">We further reject Loper\u2019s contention that the sentence imposed by District Court was \u201cexcessive.\u201d Loper claims that the court erred in sentencing him as a career criminal, given the timing and circumstances of his prior offenses. We disagree. To qualify as a career offender, the defendant must be at least eighteen years old at the time of the offense of conviction, the offense of conviction must be a felony (either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense), and the defendant must have at least two prior felony convictions that were either crimes of violence or controlled' substance offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Loper clearly met the qualifications of a career offender. He was older than eighteen years of age when he committed the instant offenses, both robbery and attempted robbery are \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1, and he had two qualifying prior felony convictions (an aggravated assault in 1990 and a simple assault in 1994). <em>See </em>PSR at K 72, 74. We find no error in the District Court\u2019s classification of Loper as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Loper also contends that he was improperly convicted under Section 924(c) of carrying a firearm during the Pennsylvania offense. He now claims that he never used or carried such a weapon. Loper, however, pled guilty to carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. He admitted before the District Court that he carried a loaded handgun in the waistband of his pants when he entered the bank. Loper has not demonstrated plain error as to this conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\">Finally, Loper claims that the District Court erred by failing to properly weigh his allegedly minor role in the Maryland robbery. We agree with the District Court that Loper was not entitled to a role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. Loper would only have been entitled to a reduction in the offense level if his role demonstrated substantially less culpability than that of the average participant. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>250 F.3d 811, 819 (3d Cir.2001). In making this fact-specific determination, the relevant factors are \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s awareness of the nature and scope of the criminal enterprise; (2) the nature of the defendant\u2019s relationship to the other participants; and (3) the importance of the defendant\u2019s actions to the success of the venture.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>250 F.3d at 819 (citations omitted). On review of the record, it is clear that Loper had a substantial role in the Maryland robbery. His allegation that his co-defendant Holloway was more culpable is unavailing. For instance, Loper held a handgun to a teller\u2019s head, took money from the vault, and followed the planned escape. We find no error in the fact that the District Court did not categorize Loper as a minor participant in that robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b972-8\">. Loper was charged with the following in the January offense: (1) conspiracy to commit bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371; (2) attempted bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d); (3) carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and (4) possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b972-9\">. Loper was charged with the following in the October offense: (1) armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), (d), &amp; (f); and (2) carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b972-15\">. As a result of his conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in the Pennsylvania offense, and because Loper was subsequently found guilty for the Maryland offense under Section 924(c), Loper faced substantial mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b972-16\">. Given the fact that Loper has addressed multiple issues within the umbrella of these two claims, we will consider the issues as the Government has subdivided them in its brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
