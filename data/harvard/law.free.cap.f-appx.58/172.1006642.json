Specifically, Holloway contends that Transportation breached its duty to defend Holloway in a New York state court action brought by Robert S. Zeeman and companies under his control (\u201cZeeman\u201d), and therefore must indemnify Holloway for the settlement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Zeeman\u2019s claims. As set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Holloway is an Ohio corporation which manufactures, sells and distributes sportswear. Transportation issued a commercial general liability policy to Holloway. Beginning in 1994, Holloway had retained Zeeman as its buying agent in Asia. In 1996, Zeeman began working with one of Holloway\u2019s direct competitors, Hartwell Sports, Inc. Upon learning of this relationship in 1997, Holloway (believing Zeeman had breached an agreement to be Holloway\u2019s agent exclusively) stopped payment on a commission check and withheld other sums Zeeman claimed were owed to him. Holloway also began to deal directly with the Asian manufacturers with whom Zeeman had been working on Holloway\u2019s behalf. In 1998, Zeeman sued Holloway in state court in New York; shortly thereafter, Holloway filed suit against Zeeman in federal district court in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Zeeman\u2019s claims against Holloway in the New York action included a cause of action entitled \u201cTortious Interference with Economic Advantage.\u201d In this cause of action, Zeeman alleged that Holloway \u201cinterfered with the economic relations between [Zeeman] and its manufacturing sources by unfairly and improperly contacting said customers, sources and contacts directly,\u201d and that \u201c[b]y virtue of the dishonest, improper and unfair acts taken by [Holloway], ... [Zeeman\u2019s] economic relations with their customers and contacts have been irretrievably harmed.\u201d Holloway contends that these allegations triggered Transportation\u2019s duty to defend it in the New York action, by virtue of provisions in the policy whereby the insurer agrees to defend any suit alleging \u201cpersonal injury\u201d or \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d Holloway tendered its defense of the New York action to Transportation, which refused the tender. Holloway instituted the current action for a declaratory judgment regarding Transportation\u2019s obligations under the policy. Both of the underlying actions have been resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">Grants of summary judgment are reviewed <em>de novo. McLean v. 988011 Ontario, Ltd., </em>224 F.3d 797, 800 (6th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">The instant action for a declaratory judgment was filed in federal district court in Ohio. Under Ohio law, in order to determine whether an insurer must assume the defense of an insured, one looks initially to the complaint filed against the insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR1\">[W]here the pleadings unequivocally bring the action within the coverage afforded by the policy, the duty to defend will attach.... However, where the insurer\u2019s duty to defend is not apparent from the pleadings in the case against the insured, but the allegations do state a claim which is potentially or arguably within the policy coverage, or there is some doubt as to whether a theory of recovery within the policy coverage had been pleaded, the insurer must accept the defense of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-13\"><em>City of Willoughby Hills v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>9 Ohio St.3d 177, 459 N.E.2d 555, 558 (1984). The rationale behind allowing the insurer\u2019s duty to defend to arise subsequent to the filing of the complaint in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>volves the development of notice pleading; \u201c[t]hus, the insurer\u2019s obligation to defend will continue until the claim is confined to a theory of recovery that the policy does not cover.\u201d <em>Great American Ins. Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>85 Ohio App.3d 815, 621 N.E.2d 796, 798-99 (1993). An insurer has no duty to defend, however, where there is no possibility of coverage. <em>See Wedge Prods., Inc. v. Hartford Equity Sales Co., </em>31 Ohio St.3d 65, 509 N.E.2d 74, 75 (1987) (finding no possibility of coverage where insured was accused of committing intentional tort, but policy covered only unexpected or unintended bodily injuries). Insurers may also defend under a reservation of rights, thereby preserving any policy defenses they may have, and file a declaratory judgment action in order to determine their obligations under the policy. <em>Stoller v. Fidelity and Guaranty Ins. Underwriters, Inc., </em>No. WD-87-64, 1988 WL 81809, *4 (Ohio App.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The insurance policy Transportation issued to Holloway provided that the insurer would \u201cpay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018personal injur/ or \u2018advertising injury\u2019 to which this insurance applies,\u201d and that the insurer had the \u201cright and duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages.\u201d The policy further clarified that \u201c[t]his insurance applies to: \u2018Personal injury\u2019 caused by an offense arising out of your business, excluding advertising, publishing, broadcasting or telecasting done by or for you; [and] \u2018[advertising injur/ caused by an offense committed in the course of advertising your goods, products or services.\u201d Both \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury\u201d are defined as arising out of, among other offenses, \u201c[o]ral or\u2019 written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services.\u201d Holloway points out that Zeeman\u2019s claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage <em>can </em>be based on defamation or disparagement, either of which constitutes \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury.\u201d Reasoning that the plain language of the policy conditions the duty to defend upon the type of <em>injury </em>alleged, rather than the cause of action or legal theory pled, Holloway concludes that this claim \u201carguably\u201d or \u201cpotentially\u201d comes within the policy coverage, triggering Transportation\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In granting summary judgment to Transportation, the district court concisely dismissed Holloway\u2019s argument that the tortious interference claim constituted \u201cadvertising injury.\u201d The court also rejected the inference Holloway sought to draw (in arguing that \u201cpersonal injury\u201d was alleged) from Zeeman\u2019s reference to Hollowa/s \u201cdishonest, improper and unfair\u201d contacts with the Asian manufacturers, finding that the complaint alleged injury by virtue of Holloway\u2019s circumvention of Zeeman, rather than by defamation or disparagement, and thus there was no possibility of coverage which triggered Transportation\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The court bolstered this conclusion by citing <em>Motorists Mutual Insurance Co. v. National Dairy Herd Improvement Ass\u2019n., Inc., </em>141 Ohio App.3d 269, 750 N.E.2d 1169 (2001). In that case, the Ohio court of appeals addressed the question of whether an insurer was required to defend its insured against antitrust allegations, due to policy coverage of claims for defamation or disparagement under personal and advertising injury provisions. The trial court had held that the insurer had no duty to defend, and, on appeal, the insured argued that this was error because \u201cthe factual allegations of the complaint in the [underlying] case asserted that [the insured] ... conspired to engage in conduct that at least arguably or potentially would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>under the Advertising Injury and Personal Injury provision of the Motorists policy constitute libel, slander, or disparagement. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1172. In rejecting this argument, the court of appeals declared that \u201c[t]he complaint clearly states causes of action for antitrust and monopoly, not for defamation and disparagement,\u201d and proceeded to review the various elements of the latter claims under New York law. <em>Id. </em>at 1175. The court also reviewed the underlying complaint, finding that in \u201ceighty paragraphs of allegations, [it] does not contain a single allegation that [the insured] published a false statement about the ... plaintiffs to a third party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Most importantly, the court of appeals rejected the insured\u2019s argument that the claims for defamation and disparagement were <em>implied, </em>in that the \u201cfactual allegations of the [underlying] complaint only makes sense as a charge that defendants prevented plaintiff from effectively competing with them by disparaging their product and services to customers and potential customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The court clarified that \u201c[w]e will not ... impose a duty to defend based on allegations outside the complaint, where the complaint does not state a claim that arguably triggers coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1176. Thus, courts \u201cneed not stretch the allegations beyond reason to impose a duty on the insurer. To do so would effectively impose an absolute duty on the insurer to provide a defense to the insured regardless of the cause of action stated in the complaint.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Given the factual similarities between <em>Motorists Mutual </em>and the instant case, it provides clear precedent, unrebutted by Holloway, for rejecting Holloway\u2019s argument that because a tortious interference claim <em>can </em>be based on defamation or disparagement, such a claim alleges \u201cadvertising\u201d or \u201cpersonal\u201d injury and thus triggers the duty to defend. Holloway has cited no provision of the underlying complaint which arguably recounts any defaming or disparaging statement. Accordingly, the district court was correct in concluding that Transportation had no duty to defend Holloway or indemnify it and in awarding Transportation summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
