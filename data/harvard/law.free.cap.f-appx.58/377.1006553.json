Yang, </em>519 U.S. 26, 30-31, 117 S.Ct. 350, 136 L.Ed.2d 288 (1996). Such an exercise of discretion \u201cnecessitates a balancing of an alien\u2019s undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations present to determine whether a grant of relief is in the best interests of this country.\u201d <em>Matter of Tijam, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 408 (BIA 1988). To satisfy the abuse of discretion standard of review, the IJ and BIA must take into account all relevant factors without acting in an arbitrary, illegal, or irrational fashion. Ca<em>sem v. I.N.S., </em>8 F.3d 700, 702 (9th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Braun v. I.N.S., </em>992 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-25\">The IJ and BIA did not err by considering Sandoval\u2019s initial entry fraud when balancing the factors in favor of and against a waiver. <em>Matter of Tijam, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 408; <em>Yang, </em>519 U.S. at 30-31, 117 S.Ct. 350. Both Sandoval\u2019s own attorney and the government\u2019s attorney on cross-examination explored the circumstances surrounding his initial entry fraud during the hearing. Sandoval did not object to this inquiry nor appeal the IJ\u2019s consideration of Sandoval\u2019s initial entry fraud to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Contrary to Sandoval\u2019s argument, the IJ did not apply an extreme hardship test to his waiver request. The IJ enumerated both the positive and negative equities and balanced the relative merits of each. The IJ\u2019s decision to deny Sandoval a waiver of deportation, adopted by the BIA, was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b411-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-22\">. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 re-designated Section 241 as Section 237. Because Sandoval\u2019s deportation proceedings began before April 1, 1997, and the BIA issued its final order after October 1, 1996, IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules apply and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. See IIRIRA \u00a7\u00a7 306(c)(1) and 309(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
