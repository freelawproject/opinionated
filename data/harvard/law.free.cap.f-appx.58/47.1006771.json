Alderman appeals from the district court\u2019s order and judgment entered March 8, 2002, granting defendants Inmar Enterprises, Incorporated\u2019s and Carolina Coupon Clearing, Incorporated\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing Alderman\u2019s complaint against defendants under the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and under North Carolina state law for wrongful termination in violation of North Carolina public policy. <em>Alderman v. Inmar Enter., Inc., </em>201 F.Supp.2d 532 (M.D.N.C.2002). In addition, the district court declined to exercise supplemental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>jurisdiction over defendants\u2019 counterclaim for conversion against Alderman which it thus dismissed without prejudice. We are not concerned, however, with the dismissal of the counterclaim as neither party appeals from that dismissal. We review the district court\u2019s order <em>de novo, see Higgins v. E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988), and thus will affirm if we determine that there is no dispute as to any material fact and defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">After a careful review of this matter we are in agreement with the district court that defendants are entitled to summary judgment and we affirm essentially for the reasons the district court set forth. We emphasize only that even if Alderman satisfied the <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), burden-shifting process to the extent that defendants were obliged to set forth legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for their employment termination decision, she did not produce a basis for a court to conclude that defendants\u2019 asserted reasons were pretextual. She cannot meet this burden simply by disagreeing with her employers\u2019 assessment of her. As this court indicated in <em>Hawkins v. PepsiCo, Inc., </em>203 F.3d 274, 280 (4th Cir.2000), \u201c[W]e have repeatedly held that in a wrongful discharge action it is the perception of the decision maker which is relevant, not the self-assessment of the plaintiff.\u201d (Internal brackets and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
