We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-28\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Jenkins\u2019 excessive force claim because Jenkins failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the force was not applied in a good faith effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>to maintain or restore discipline and was instead used maliciously to cause him harm. <em>See Johnson v. Lewis, </em>217 F.3d 726, 733 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 320-21, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986)). The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Jenkins\u2019 due process claim because Jenkins did not raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether his confinement in administrative segregation was an atypical and significant hardship in relation to ordinary prison life. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Jenkins\u2019 motions to compel discovery. <em>See Mabe v. San Bernadino County, </em>237 F.3d 1101, 1112 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Jenkins\u2019 motion to recuse the district court judge because Jenkins failed to present adequate evidence of bias or prejudice. <em>See Kulas v. Flores, </em>255 F.3d 780, 783, 787 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Jenkins\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Jenkins\u2019 motion for sanctions is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b789-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
