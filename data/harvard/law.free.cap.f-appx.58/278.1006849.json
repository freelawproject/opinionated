We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">While the district court found triable issues existed as to the reasonableness of Bradshaw\u2019s arrest, it nonetheless granted summary judgment, finding that the officers were immune from suit. A police officer is immune from \u00a7 1983 liability unless (i) \u201cthe officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right;\u201d and (ii) \u201cthe right was clearly established,\u201d i.e., \u201cit would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); <em>see also Estate of Ford v. Ramirez-Palmer, </em>301 F.3d 1043, 1050 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Resolving, as did the district court, all disputed facts in Bradshaw\u2019s favor, <em>Estate of Ford, </em>301 F.3d at 1045, the first <em>Saucier </em>prong is met. Bradshaw alleges that the police handcuffed and arrested him for resisting an officer under California Penal Code \u00a7 148(a) after he approached his car while disputing an illegal tow.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Fourth Amendment prohibits arrest unless police have probable cause to believe a crime has been or is being committed. <em>Beck V. Ohio, </em>379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964). An unprovoked arrest would thus violate a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Bradshaw\u2019s claim fails the second <em>Saucier </em>prong, however, because it would not have been clear to a reasonable officer that the conduct here was unlawful. The California Vehicle Code authorizes private property owners to cause vehicles to be towed from their property so long as warning signs are posted, Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 22568(a), and vests police officers with the power to enforce this provision. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 40000.1; Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 830.1; <em>see also People v. McKay, </em>27 Cal.4th 601, 117 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 41 P.3d 59, 74 (2002). The undisputed facts establish (1) Bradshaw\u2019s car was parked in a ten-minute loading zone longer than ten minutes; (2) signs warning motorists were posted; and (3) the apartment manager authorized the car to be towed. Thus, the officers could reasonably believe the tow was proper; they had a duty to enforce it and the peace, generally; and that Bradshaw\u2019s walking to the car after an extended disagreement with the police was a move to obstruct the tow or worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-14\">Bradshaw contends that the tow was unlawful because warning signs were placed at only two of the property\u2019s four entrances, in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7 22568(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even if the signs in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>fact failed to meet the Vehicle Code\u2019s requirements, the officers\u2019 belief in the legal sufficiency of the signs posted at the remaining entrances, as well as the signs demarcating the loading zone, was neither plainly incompetent nor a knowing violation of the law. <em>See Hunter v. Bryant, </em>502 U.S. 224, 228, 112 S.Ct. 534, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) (\u201cThe qualified immunity standard gives ample room for mistaken judgments by protecting all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\u201d). Because any mistake as to the legality of the tow was reasonable, the officers are entitled to immunity. <em>See Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Bradshaw also contends that summary judgment is inappropriate because the resolution of his claim hinged on credibility determinations within the province of the jury, and because the district court failed to construe all facts in his favor. The district court, however, resolved all disputed facts and credibility issues in Bradshaw\u2019s favor before properly determining that the officers are immune from suit. As it stated in its order, the district court assumed that Bradshaw\u2019s version of the facts is correct. Thus, there are no material issues as to credibility that require a jury determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-9\">. It appears from the district court\u2019s order that Bradshaw withdrew his claims against the City of El Cajon. In any event, Bradshaw does not allege that the police officers were acting pursuant to a city policy; thus there would be no liability under <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-15\">. While we do not discuss the facts at length, they are eerily reminiscent of the impetus for Conrad Hensley\u2019s fictional descent from the life of a working middle class man to that of a fugitive on the run, recounted in Thomas Wolfe\u2019s 1998 novel, <em>A Man in Full.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b313-16\">. Bradshaw also contends that the tow operator\u2019s offer, which the police encouraged, to drop the car from his truck for a fee violated Cal. Veh.Code \u00a7 22568(h), which requires the property owner\u2019s authorization for such an offer. Because the appropriateness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>tow operator\u2019s offer would affect neither the validity of the tow under \u00a7 22568(a) nor the officer's perception that Bradshaw was impeding the tow, it is irrelevant to his \u00a7 1983 claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
