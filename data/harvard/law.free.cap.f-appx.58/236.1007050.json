Bogar appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for the Western District of Arkansas after he pleaded guilty to distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court sentenced appellant to 144 months imprisonment, 3 years supervised release and a $3,500 fine. For reversal appellant argues the district court erred in applying an increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a firearm in connection with the offense. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-21\">We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s application of the increase. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>280 F.3d 835, 853 (8th Cir.) (standard of review), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 931, 122 S.Ct. 2606, 153 L.Ed.2d 793 (2002). The evidence introduced at sentencing showed that there had been drug activity at Bogar\u2019s residence, and officers searching the residence found a .357 Magnum pistol stuffed into a couch, near Bogar and a quantity of crack cocaine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment. (n.3) (firearm adjustment should be applied if weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that weapon was connected with offense); <em>United States v. Macklin, </em>104 F.3d 1046, 1048 (8th Cir.) (holding no clear error in applying in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>crease, given proximity of firearms to drugs, ease with which defendants could access firearms, ongoing drug trafficking at residence, and likely need for defendants to protect drugs and cash found at residence), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 891, 118 S.Ct. 229, 139 L.Ed.2d 161 (1997). Even if Bogar did not actually possess the gun \u2014 as he contends \u2014 he was present when his son tried to hide it in the couch, and both the gun and the drugs were found in his residence. <em>See United States v. Payne, </em>81 F.3d 759, 762 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-15\">.
