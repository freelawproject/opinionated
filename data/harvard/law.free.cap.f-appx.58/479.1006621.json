American Management Systems, Inc. (AMS) opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-22\">AMS filed suit against the United States challenging the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board\u2019s termination of the contract between the Thrift Board and AMS for default. The contract related to AMS\u2019s development of an automated record keeping system for the Thrift Saving Plan (TSP). The United States moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the nonappropriated funds doctrine, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517(a), arguing that the TSP contract was not financed from general federal revenues, but rather funded out of private monies placed in the Thrift Savings Fund. AMS opposed the motion, advancing several independent reasons why the nonappropriated funds doctrine did not apply. The Court of Federal Claims denied the motion to dismiss on one ground and did not address AMS\u2019s remaining arguments. The trial court subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>certified its order for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">This court has complete discretion to grant or deny a petition for permission to appeal. <em>In re Convertible Rowing Exerciser Patent Litigation, </em>903 F.2d 822 (Fed. Cir.1990). In this case, we are not convinced that immediate interlocutory review of the trial court\u2019s order is warranted. We are particularly persuaded by AMS\u2019s argument that immediate interlocutory review may not advance the ultimate termination of the litigation because our decision on appeal, either affirming or reversing, would not decide the ease. If we affirmed, the case would continue. If we reversed, the trial court would still be required to consider AMS\u2019s remaining arguments regarding jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The United States\u2019 petition for permission to appeal is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
