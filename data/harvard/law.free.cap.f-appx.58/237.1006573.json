During the plea hearing defense counsel predicted a sentencing range of 70 to 87 months; the magistrate judge<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>edged counsel\u2019s expertise with the Sentencing Guidelines, and stated that counsel\u2019s prediction was not binding but was a \u201cpretty good indicator of what\u2019s likely to happen.\u201d The later-calculated range was 77 to 96 months, and the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> imposed a sentence of 90 months imprisonment and <em>2 </em>years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the guilty plea was rendered involuntary because Mr. Lupian-Barajas was led to believe he would be sentenced within a lower Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We disagree, noting that the magistrate judge informed Mr. Lupian-Barajas of the statutory maximum sentence, and clearly warned him that the district court was not bound by defense counsel\u2019s prediction. <em>See United States v. Granados, </em>168 F.3d 343, 345 (8th Cir.1999) (defendant\u2019s reliance on attorney\u2019s mistaken impression about length of sentence is insufficient to render plea involuntary as long as court informed defendant of maximum possible sentence). Upon reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-17\">. The Honorable Paul A.
