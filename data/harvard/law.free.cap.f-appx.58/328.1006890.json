The estate also claims that it was entitled to offset the value of the Monte Vista property with the amount of the debt encumbering that property when calculating the gross estate. The Commissioner determined that the estate was not entitled either to the marital deduction or to the loan offset. The Tax Court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s findings, and ordered the estate to pay $ 144,-980 in taxes. We affirm the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The tax code allows a \u201cmarital deduction\u201d for \u201cany interest in property which passes or has passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse....\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 2056(a). An interest \u201cwill be regarded has having \u2018passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse\u2019 only if the assignment or surrender was a bona fide recognition of enforceable rights of the surviving spouse in the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2056(c)-2 (d)(2). \u201cIf the assignment or surrender was pursuant to a decree rendered by consent, or pursuant to an agreement not to contest the will or not to probate the will, it will not necessarily be accepted as a bona fide evaluation of the rights of the spouse.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Under the terms of the will, decedent\u2019s wife was entitled to 8/8ths of the decedent\u2019s property. The estate claims that, in recognition of these rights, decedent\u2019s wife claimed the property located within the United States and surrendered her interest in the remainder of the residual estate. The estate, however, has failed to offer evidence to demonstrate the value of the residual estate and therefore has failed to carry its burden of establishing that it was entitled to the deduction. <em>See Merkel v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>192 F.3d 844, 852 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cDeterminations made by the Commissioner in a notice of deficiency normally are presumed to be correct, and the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that those determinations are erroneous.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">The estate has also failed to demonstrate that it was entitled to include less than the full value of the Monte Vista property in decedent\u2019s gross estate. The estate asserts that it was entitled to subtract the amount of the loan secured by the Monte Vista property from the property\u2019s value when calculating the gross estate. This argument fails, however, because decedent was personally hable for the debt under the terms of the loan. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2053-7 (providing full value of property must be included in gross estate if decedent was personally hable for loan).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b363-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
