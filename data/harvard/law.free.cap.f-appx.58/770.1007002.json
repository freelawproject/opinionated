Taylor appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, challenging his jury trial conviction of attempted murder while personally using a firearm, and related offenses. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-23\">Taylor first contends that the prosecution\u2019s peremptory challenges of four African-American prospective jurors were based upon impermissible group bias in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Even if Taylor establishes a prima facie case of racial discrimination, Taylor fails to demonstrate that the state court erred in finding that the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for exercising his peremptory strikes were legitimate. <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1045, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (\u201cTo secure habeas relief, petitioner must demonstrate that a state court\u2019s finding of the absence of purposeful discrimination was incorrect by clear and convincing evidence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1), and that the corresponding factual determination was \u2018objectively unreasonable\u2019 in light of the record before the court.\u201d); <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 769, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (per curiam) (holding that a \u201clegitimate reason\u201d for exercising peremptory strikes \u201cis not a reason that makes sense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>but a reason that does not deny equal protection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Taylor next contends that he was denied a fair trial based upon the admission of gang affiliation evidence. Because the gang evidence was admitted to establish motive, a material issue in this case, the state court did not err in finding the evidence admissible. <em>United States v. Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 49, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984) (deciding that gang membership was \u201csufficiently probative of ... possible bias ... to warrant its admission into evidence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>46 F.3d 885, 889 (9th Cir.1995) (recognizing that gang evidence is admissible as proof of motive).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Taylor\u2019s last contention is that the prosecution improperly elicited evidence of his post-arrest silence, in violation of <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976) (holding that \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of petitioners\u2019 silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings, violate[s] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d). A review of the transcripts demonstrates that the prosecutor used Taylor\u2019s post-arrest statements to impeach Taylor, rather than to elicit evidence of his silence. Accordingly, Taylor fails to demonstrate that the prosecutor committed any misconduct. <em>See McKenna v. McDaniel, </em>65 F.3d 1483, 1492 (9th Cir. 1995) (deciding that there was no <em>Doyle </em>error because the defendant did not remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Therefore, the district court properly denied federal habeas relief on Taylor\u2019s claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 123 S.Ct. 357, 361, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam) (stating that the federal habeas scheme \u201cauthorizes federal-court intervention only when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 957, 154 L.Ed.2d 855 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b804-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b805-8\">.
