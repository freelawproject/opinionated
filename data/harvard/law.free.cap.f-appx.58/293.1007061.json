Shortly thereafter, OMD received a notice from the Oregon Department of Transportation (\u201cODOT\u201d) that its billboard was in violation of the OMIA. OMD requested a contested case hearing regarding the notice of violation. OMD subsequently erected four more billboards and received violation notices for each billboard. After engaging in discovery in federal court, and before any merits rulings, ODOT moved to dismiss the case on a number of grounds including <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). The district court determined that <em>Younger </em>barred its review of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Under <em>Younger, </em>federal courts must abstain from enjoining state proceedings when \u201c(1) the state proceedings are ongoing; (2) the proceedings implicate important state interests; and (3) the state proceedings provide an adequate opportunity to raise federal questions.\u201d <em>Fresh Int\u2019l Corp. v. Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., </em>805 F.2d 1353, 1357-58 (9th Cir.1986) (citing <em>Middlesex County Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 73 L.Ed.2d 116 (1982)). OMD challenges the district court\u2019s conclusions with regard to the first and third prongs. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">With respect to the first prong, ODOT\u2019s state administrative proceedings were \u201cinitiated \u2018before any proceedings of substance on the merits [took] place in federal court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fresh Int\u2019l, </em>805 F.2d at 1358 (quoting <em>Hicks v. Miranda, </em>422 U.S. 332, 349, 95 S.Ct. 2281, 45 L.Ed.2d 223 (1975)). When the sole issue in federal court litigation has been whether abstention is appropriate, \u201c[n]o proceedings have occurred on the merits and therefore no federal proceedings on the merits will be terminated by application of <em>Younger </em>principles.\u201d <em>Middlesex, </em>457 U.S. at 437.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">OMD argues that if any state proceedings were ongoing, they were in relation only to the first sign. But this argument ignores that administrative violation notices had been issued for all of the signs. In addition, OMD\u2019s constitutional challenge to the OMIA is properly characterized as facial, and the relief sought, had OMD prevailed in federal court, would have been an injunction prohibiting ODOT from removing any of the signs. <em>See Green v. City of Tucson, </em>255 F.3d 1086, 1097 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (making interference with state court proceedings a predicate for <em>Younger </em>abstention); <em>see also Beltran v. California, </em>871 F.2d 777, 782 (9th Cir.1988) (finding <em>Younger </em>abstention appropriate where two of five state court proceedings were pending). We also reject OMD\u2019s claim that the contested case hearing was not judicial in nature. Neither ODOT\u2019s discretion to reject the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation nor the Oregon Court of Appeals\u2019 review for substantial evidence renders the hearing non-judicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>With regard to the third prong of <em>Younger, </em>abstention is inappropriate only when \u201cprocedural laws bar presentation of the claims.\u201d <em>Dubinka v. Judges of the Superior Court, </em>23 F.3d 218, 224 (9th Cir. 1994). As long as \u201cconstitutional claims may be raised in state-court judicial review of the administrative proceeding,\u201d <em>Younger </em>is satisfied. <em>Ohio Civil Rights Comm\u2019n v. Dayton Christian Sck, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 619, 629, 106 S.Ct. 2718, 91 L.Ed.2d 512 (1986). Oregon law directs appellate courts to remand to the agency for a correct interpretation of law if the court determines that the agency violated the constitution. Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 183.482(8)(b)(C). Such a requirement satisfies <em>Dayton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Finally, OMD\u2019s claim that the OMIA falls under the \u201cflagrantly and patently\u201d unconstitutional exception to <em>Younger </em>fads; OMD did not raise this claim before the district court, and it is therefore forfeited. Moreover, the exception for \u201cflagrantly and patently\u201d unconstitutional statutes is extraordinarily narrow. <em>See Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 40-41 (abstaining despite prior invalidation of act under which the federal plaintiff was indicted). The OMIA does not satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b328-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
