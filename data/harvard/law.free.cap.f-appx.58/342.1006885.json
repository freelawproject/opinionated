United States, </em>586 U.S. 545, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002). <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>314 F.3d 430, 437-38 (9th Cir. 2002) (rejecting argument that <em>Harris </em>overruled <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) and <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The testimony of the government expert witness on narcotics value that his duties involved investigation of drug smuggling organizations was not impermissible organization structure testimony within the meaning of <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>237 F.3d 1008 (9th Cir.2001) or <em>United States v. Pineda-Torres, </em>287 F.3d 860 (9th Cir. 2002). There is no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have construed a cursory reference to the expert\u2019s existing duties to imply that Beas-Nunez was a member of such an organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Beas-Nunez\u2019s objections to various portions of the government\u2019s closing argument are also without merit. The statements of which Beas-Nunez complains did not constitute impermissible vouching or expressions of personal opinion, but were arguments supported by the record or reasonable inferences therefrom. <em>See United States v. Atcheson, </em>94 F.3d 1237, 1244 (9th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Necoechea, </em>986 F.2d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir.1993). Moreover, the statements are reviewed for plain error, and, even if they were improper, we cannot conclude that they prejudiced Beas-Nunez or resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Molina, </em>934 F.2d 1440, 1446 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Finally, there was no error in admitting Beas-Nunez\u2019s un-Mirandized inculpatory questions to Agent Behm. The district court did not err in finding that these statements were not in response to interrogation, but were spontaneous, volunteered statements by Beas-Nunez. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301-03, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980); <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 477, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Agent Behm\u2019s conduct in gathering biographical information was not the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of questioning Beas-Nunez about the crime. <em>Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 303, 100 S.Ct. 1682.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b377-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
