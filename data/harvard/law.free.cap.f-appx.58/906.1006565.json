He now appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Between October 1997 and December 1998, White and a friend bought a large number of evergreen trees with counterfeit checks. On May 15, 2001, White pled guilty to two counts of bank fraud. <em>As </em>part of his plea agreement, the government agreed that White had accepted responsibility as of the date of the plea agreement and qualified for a two-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(a) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">On October 17, 2001, at White\u2019s sentencing hearing, a Secret Service Special Agent testified that on August 17, 2001, White had been arrested for a bail violation after he was found in possession of four counterfeit credit cards and one counterfeit driver\u2019s license: The government argued that White was no longer entitled to the two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. After oral argument, the District Court advised White of his Fifth Amendment rights and invited him to make a statement with respect to the counterfeit credit cards and license or anything else he wanted the Court to know. Among other things, White explained that on August 17, he was on his way out of his house to dispose of the counterfeit objects when he was arrested. The District Court found that White had not accepted responsibility for his conduct because he had not voluntarily terminated or withdrawn from criminal conduct or associations, and sentenced White to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-15\">White contends that the District Court erred by (1) compelling him to testify to allegedly incriminating relevant conduct as a condition precedent to determining whether he had accepted responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1 in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights, and (2) concluding that he had failed to renounce his criminal associations as a basis for finding that he had not accepted responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a district court\u2019s factual determinations with respect to acceptance of responsibility under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>146 F.3d 161, 167 (3d Cir.1998). We have plenary review of constitutional questions and of the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>166 F.3d 558, 560 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Section 3El.l(a) provides for a two-level reduction in the defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\u201d Among other factors, the sentencing court may consider whether there has been \u201cvoluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations.\u201d \u00a7 3E1.1, Application Note 1(b). We have held that Application Note 1(b) applies not only to the offense for which the defendant was convicted, but also to related conduct. <em>United States v. Frierson, </em>945 F.2d 650, 656 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">White first argues that the District Court violated his Fifth Amendment right to be free from compelled self-incrimination. After advising White of his Fifth Amendment rights, the District Court informed him that it would consider the government\u2019s evidence that he had been found with counterfeit access devices and arrested for a violation of bail and that he had an opportunity to make a statement about that or anything else he wanted the District Court to consider. White never asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege. \u201c[Requiring a defendant to accept responsibility in order to obtain a sentence reduction is not a threat to impose punishment for an assertion of the [Fifth Amendment] privilege.\u201d <em>Frierson, </em>945 F.2d at 661. Moreover, the District Court neither required White to make a statement nor conditioned the two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, either expressly or by implication, on his making a statement. Because the District Court did not compel White to admit possession of the counterfeit access devices, his Fifth Amendment rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Second, White argues that the District Court erred in concluding that he had failed to renounce his criminal associations as a basis for finding that he had not accepted responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. The defendant bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to a sentence reduction. <em>United States v. Muhammad, </em>146 F.3d 161, 167 (3d Cir.1998). \u201cContinued criminal activity, even differing in nature from the convicted offense, is inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.... [A] sentencing judge may ... consider unlawful conduct committed by the defendant while on pretrial release awaiting sentencing as well as any violations of the conditions of this pretrial release in determining whether the court should grant a reduction in the offense level for acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>United States v. Ceccarani, </em>98 F.3d 126, 130-31 (3d Cir.1996). A court \u201cmay consider uncharged conduct in determining whether and how to apply upward or downward adjustments.\u201d <em>United States v. Pollard, </em>986 F.2d 44, 47 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">In finding that White had not renounced his criminal associations, the District Court credited the Special Agent\u2019s testimony that White was discovered with several counterfeit access devices after entering into his plea agreement and was arrested for violating the conditions of his bail. Had a jury found that White possessed these counterfeit access devices, he would have been guilty of access device fraud under 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4106(a)(3). The government need not show that he <em>used </em>the counterfeit devices, for the knowing possession of an access device constitutes commission of the offense. If an actor has in his possession at least two such devices, he or she is presumed to know that they are counterfeit. 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 4106(a.l)(l). Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>White\u2019s possession of the counterfeit devices is relevant criminal conduct that the District Court properly considered in determining whether he had accepted responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">White also contends that the District Court did not make a specific finding that it disbelieved his testimony that he was just about to dispose of the counterfeit devices when he was arrested, and that, in any event, this testimony was never contradicted by the government. As stated above, however, mere possession of the devices was sufficient to constitute criminal conduct, regardless of how White intended to use them in the future. The District Court did not err in finding that on the basis of his continued involvement in relevant criminal conduct, White had not accepted responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b941-12\">. Although White initially argued that he was entitled to a 3-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, he has acknowledged that the plea agreement only provided for two points.
