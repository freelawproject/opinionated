On appeal, Sniderhan contends that the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) improperly rejected his treating physician\u2019s opinion regarding the severity of his disability and his residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d). Additionally, Sniderhan contends that the ALJ\u2019s rejection of his testimony was not supported by substantial evidence or based on correct legal standards. The parties are familiar with the facts, so they are not recited here except as necessary to explain our judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order upholding a denial of social security benefits. <em>Pagter v. Massanari, </em>250 F.3d 1255, 1258 (9th Cir.2001). We will uphold the decision of the Commissioner if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on correct legal standards. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">Sniderhan argues the ALJ improperly rejected his treating physician\u2019s opinion with regard to the severity of his disability and his RFC. We disagree. A treating physician\u2019s opinion is not necessarily conclusive as to the ultimate issue of a disability and may be rejected so long as the ALJ provides \u201cclear and convincing\u201d reasons for doing so. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 751 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-15\">In rejecting Dr. Marsh\u2019s opinion and making his own RFC assessment, the ALJ properly provided clear and convincing reasons, which were supported by substantial evidence. For example, the ALJ referred to Dr. Baldwin\u2019s opinions, which reported that Sniderhan had improved, was \u201cdoing well,\u201d and was performing light yard work. Additionally, the ALJ explained that despite Dr. Marsh\u2019s opinion that Sniderhan was disabled, other reports from Dr. Marsh were consistent with Dr. Baldwin\u2019s reports, in that both indicated Sniderhan could perform light-duty work. The ALJ\u2019s decisions to credit the opinion of Dr. Baldwin over the opinion of Dr. Marsh and to make his own RFC assessment were supported by clear and convincing reasons, were supported by substantial evidence, and were free of legal error. Thus, we find that the ALJ did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-16\">Sniderhan also contends that the ALJ improperly rejected his testimony. An ALJ may reject a claimant\u2019s testimony as not credible by providing specific findings as to what testimony is not credible and identifying what evidence undermines the claimant\u2019s testimony. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995). Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>trary to Sniderhan\u2019s assertion, the ALJ also provided clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Sniderhan\u2019s testimony. This was done by addressing Sniderhan\u2019s complaints, such as depression and headaches, and noting the inconsistencies between Sniderhan\u2019s testimony and the record. The ALJ then determined that Sniderhan\u2019s complaints of pain were not credible to the extent alleged. Further, substantial evidence exists in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s findings. Therefore, the ALJ properly rejected Sniderhan\u2019s subjective pain testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Because the ALJ\u2019s determinations were supported by clear and convincing reasons and substantial evidence, including the step-five determination that Sniderhan is not disabled because he can perform light-duty work, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b315-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
