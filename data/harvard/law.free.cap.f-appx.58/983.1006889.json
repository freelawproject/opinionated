Taylor also appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-16\">Parties in a civil action are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-17\">The district court\u2019s order denying relief on Taylor\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was entered on the docket on September 10, 2002. Taylor\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on November 13, 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Taylor failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-18\">With regard to the denial of the Rule 59(e) motion, Taylor has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Taylor v. Condon, </em>No. CA-01-2727-3-20-BC (D.S.C. filed Oct. 11, 2002, entered Oct. 17, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-19\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1018-13\">. For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1018-20\">. Although Taylor filed a Rule 59(e) motion, his motion did not toll the appeal period because it was filed more than ten days after entry of the district court's final judgment. Fed.
