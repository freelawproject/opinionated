We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-22\">The record supports the district court\u2019s finding that Flores proeedurally defaulted his federal fair trial claim by failing to fairly present it to the Montana Supreme Court. <em>See Lyons v. Crawford, </em>232 F.3d 666, 668 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[T]he petitioner must make the federal basis [of the claim] explicit either by citing federal law or the decisions of federal courts, even if the federal basis of a claim is \u201cself-evident,\u201d or the underlying claim would be decided un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>der state law on the same considerations that would control resolution of the claim on federal grounds.\u201d) (internal citations omitted) <em>as amended by </em>247 F.3d 904 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Johnson v. Zenon, </em>88 F.3d 828, 829 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that a petitioner has not exhausted his state remedies as to a federal claim, if in his state petition he has merely asserted, without reference to federal constitutional law, that he was denied a fair trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Alternatively, Flores contends that even if the fair trial issue was not fairly presented, the Montana Supreme Court <em>sua sponte </em>considered the claim as arising under the fair and impartial trial clause of the U.S. Constitution. A review of the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the matter does not support this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b380-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
