Petitioner contends that Copart violated the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (STAA) by firing him as a truck driver. The STAA prohibits terminating an employee for refusing to operate a vehicle when that employee \u201chas a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle\u2019s unsafe condition.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(a)(l)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">An administrative law judge (ALJ) agreed with Petitioner and ordered his reinstatement with back pay. On appeal the Board rejected the ALJ\u2019s decision and dismissed Petitioner\u2019s complaint. An applicable STAA regulation required the Board to adopt the ALJ\u2019s findings if those findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.109(c)(3). Because substantial evidence supported dispositive findings by the ALJ, we reverse the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Petitioner worked as a salvage hauler for Copart from January 11, 1999, until March 4, 1999, when Copart terminated him for refusing to drive his truck. His job was to drive one of Copart\u2019s \u201chaulers\u201d (a large truck with the capacity to hold three wrecked vehicles on its decks while towing a fourth vehicle), load wrecked vehicles onto the hauler, return the vehicles to Copart\u2019s facility, and unload them. Co-part then auctioned the wrecked vehicles on behalf of insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">To load a vehicle onto the hauler, the driver operates controls at the side of the truck that raise and tilt the hauler\u2019s deck by means of a hydraulic ram. With these controls the driver can also operate three hydraulically driven winches. Each winch is attached to a cable. The driver attaches the cable to the vehicle he is loading, tilts the deck of the hauler using the ram, and, using the winch attached to the cable, pulls the vehicle onto the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">The condition of the winches, ram, and cables on Petitioner\u2019s truck is central to this case. On the morning Petitioner was terminated, his truck was at the Frontier International repair shop undergoing brake repairs. Petitioner arrived at Frontier at about 7:45 a.m. to pick up the truck but was told that it would not be ready until 10 a.m. He then drove to Copart and spoke with his supervisor, Dan Cupp, Co-part\u2019s yard manager. Petitioner testified that he informed Cupp that the brakes had not yet been repaired, and that no work had been done on the cables or the ram and winches, which had been reported to be leaking. According to Petitioner, he told Cupp that the truck was unsafe and had been \u201cpushed to the limit,\u201d Tr. 96, reminded him that the cables had previously been designated for replacement, and expressed concern that the cables could \u201csnap anytime.\u201d Tr. 105. Cupp replied that only the brakes would be repaired that day, and told Petitioner that he could either clean out cars in the yard or go home and wait for the brake repairs to be completed. Petitioner decided to return to Frontier to wait for the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">On the way to Frontier, he stopped at a truck stop and called Craig Gille, Copart\u2019s General Manager. Petitioner testified that he told Gille of his concerns that the ram, winches, and cables would not be repaired before he was dispatched, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Gille replied that he would discuss the matter with Cupp and get back to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Petitioner arrived at Frontier shortly after 10 a.m. to determine the status of the repairs. When the work had not been completed by 10:45 a.m., he went home and made an appointment to have the windshield on his personal vehicle repaired. At 12:30 p.m. Gille called Petitioner at home and told him that the brakes had been repaired and the truck was ready to drive. Petitioner\u2019s version of the remainder of the conversation was as follows: He asked Gille whether the leaks or cables had been repaired. Gille replied that they had not, but were scheduled to be repaired in a few days. Gille also said that, according to Cupp, the leaks and cables were not safety concerns. Petitioner countered that the truck was \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d without those repairs. Tr. 101. Gille told Petitioner to return to work and drive the truck or he would be terminated. Petitioner reiterated his concerns about the safety of the cables and the leaks, and also told Gille that he had scheduled someone to come to his house that afternoon to repair his personal vehicle. Gille then terminated Petitioner for refusing to drive the truck. (Copart\u2019s witnesses testified that Petitioner did not raise safety concerns prior to his termination.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">II. Prior Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Petitioner filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, alleging that he was fired in violation of the STAA because his refusal to drive the truck was based on a reasonable apprehension of serious injury as a result of the truck\u2019s unsafe condition. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(a)(l)(B)(ii). After an initial investigation the Secretary issued findings concluding that Copart had not violated the STAA in discharging Petitioner. Petitioner objected to the findings and requested a hearing under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">A one-day de novo hearing was then held before an ALJ on May 10, 2000. Following the hearing, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision and Order (RDO) concluding that Petitioner\u2019s termination violated the STAA. Specifically, the ALJ found that Petitioner had a reasonable apprehension of serious injury due to the unsafe condition of (1) the truck\u2019s cables and (2) hydraulic leaks on the truck\u2019s winches and ram.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">On appeal the Board issued a Final Decision and Order (FDO) reversing the ALJ. The Board concluded that there was not substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the ALJ\u2019s findings that it was reasonable for Petitioner to apprehend serious injury with respect to either the cables or the leaks. Accordingly, it rejected the ALJ\u2019s RDO and dismissed Petitioner\u2019s complaint. Petitioner then sought review in this court under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706 and 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">A. <em>The STAA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">Under the STAA it is unlawful for an employer to \u201cdischarge an employee ... [who] refuses to operate a vehicle because ... the employee has a reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public because of the vehicle\u2019s unsafe condition.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31105(a)(l)(B)(ii). \u201c[A]n employee\u2019s apprehension of serious injury is reasonable only if a reasonable individual in the circumstances then confronting the employee would conclude that the unsafe condition establishes a real danger of accident, injury, or serious impairment to health. To qualify for protection, the employee must have sought from the employer, and been unable to obtain, correction of the unsafe condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 31105(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Thus, to establish a claim under this section, Petitioner must show that (1) he refused to operate his truck because he was apprehensive of an unsafe condition on the truck; (2) his apprehension was objectively reasonable; (3) he sought to have Copart correct the condition; and (4) Co-part failed to do so. <em>See Brink's, Inc. v. Herman, </em>148 F.3d 175, 180 (2d Cir.1998). Elements 1 and 2 are the only matters that the parties address in their briefs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">B. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We review the Board\u2019s final order in accordance with the standards of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706. We must sustain the Board\u2019s decision unless it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d or \u201cunsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (E). <em>See BSP Trans, Inc. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>160 F.3d 38, 46 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In turn, under STAA regulations the Board must consider the ALJ\u2019s factual findings \u201cconclusive\u201d if those findings are \u201csupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.109(c)(3). Thus, although under \u00a7 31105(c) of the STAA we are authorized to review only the Board\u2019s decision, in reviewing that decision</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahq\">we must also determine whether under the STAA [regulations, the Board] was bound by the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact. If there was substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s findings, then the [Board\u2019s] refusal to treat them as conclusive was contrary to [29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.109(c)(3)] and [its] decision must be set aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\"><em>Castle Coal &amp; Oil Co. v. Reich, </em>55 F.3d 41, 44 (2d Cir.1995); <em>accord BSP Trans, Inc., </em>160 F.3d at 46. In other words, \u201cif we determine that the ALJ\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence, we must reverse the [Board] and order that the ALJ\u2019s decision be adopted; this is so even if the [Board\u2019s] decision was also based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Brink\u2019s, Inc., </em>148 F.3d at 179. (We note that the parties do not challenge the validity of the regulation mandating deference to the ALJ\u2019s findings if those findings are supported by substantial evidence. At least one commentator, however, has questioned whether the regulation conflicts with the APA. <em>See </em>Ronald M. Levin, <em>The Year in Judicial Review, 1997-1998, </em>51 Admin. L. Rev. 389, 398 (1999) (\u201cNormally, when an agency head and ALJ disagree, the issue is whether the agency head\u2019s position rests on substantial evidence. And the STAA provided that judicial review should be in accordance with the APA. It is not clear that an agency can alter this review standard by regulation; indeed, neither the text nor the administrative history of the Secretary\u2019s regulation had directly stated an intention of doing so.\u201d) (footnotes omitted.) We express no view on the matter.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">We must therefore determine whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Petitioner had a reasonable apprehension of serious injury as a result of the truck\u2019s unsafe condition. \u201cSubstantial evidence requires more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance, and is satisfied by such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept to support the conclusion.\u201d <em>Ray v. Bowen, </em>865 F.2d 222, 224 (10th Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). But the determination of whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision \u201cis not simply a quantitative exercise, for evidence is not substantial if it is overwhelmed by other evidence or if it really constitutes mere conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the \u201csubstantiality of evidence must take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.\u201d <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">C. <em>Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">After examining the entire record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Petitioner had a reasonable apprehension of serious injury with respect to the truck\u2019s cables. Since the Board did not adopt this finding, as required by 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1978.109(c)(3), its decision was not in accordance with law and must be reversed. <em>See BSP Trans, </em>160 F.Sd at 46; <em>Castle Coal, </em>55 F.3d at 44. We need not consider whether the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding the leaks are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The Board\u2019s focus in its FDO was on whether it would have been reasonable for Petitioner to fear danger from the cables. Therefore, we begin with that issue. Petitioner needed to convince the ALJ that a reasonable person could believe that the cables posed a significant danger. <em>See </em>49 U.S.G. \u00a7 31105(a)(l)(B)(ii) (employee must prove a \u201creasonable apprehension of serious injury\u201d); <em>Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Reich, </em>38 F.3d 76, 83 (2d Cir.1994) (apprehension of danger can be reasonable even if post-incident inspection shows no safety defect).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Petitioner\u2019s evidence on the condition of the cables included (1) a Copart survey of the truck on February 4, 1999 (one month before his termination); (2) his own testimony; and (3) testimony by the two men who replaced the cables the day after his termination. During the survey of Petitioner\u2019s truck, Jim Powell, Copart\u2019s National Fleet and Safety Manager, inspected the truck, rated its various components according to Copart\u2019s rating scale, and made handwritten comments on Copart\u2019s \u201cTruck Survey\u201d form. Copart\u2019s rating scale is printed on the form: \u201cRating: 3=Meets Standard in ALL Areas; 2=Generally Good, Needs Some Improvement; l=Not Meeting Standards, Needs Immediate Attention; N/A=Not Applicable; R=Not Rated During the Inspection.\u201d Resp\u2019t Ex. 5. Powell assigned a \u201c3\u201d rating to 21 components on Petitioner\u2019s truck, a \u201c2\u201d to 4 components, and a \u201c1\u201d to 10 components. He rated the truck\u2019s \u2018Winch and Cables\u201d a \u201c2,\u201d with the comment \u201cAdd T latch to hooks/ # 3 winch replace cable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Powell testified that his notation \u201creplace cable\u201d meant that the cable should be replaced at the next scheduled 8,000 mile service. He assumed that replacement would occur in one or two months, depending on the truck\u2019s driving history. The record contains no mileage figures for the truck, but reveals that apart from the cables, all components that received a \u201c2\u201d rating were repaired on either February 24 or February 26. The cables were replaced on March 5, the day after Petitioner\u2019s termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Petitioner testified that the cables needed replacement and could have \u201csnap[ped] anytime.\u201d Tr. 105. He explained that under \u201cideal conditions\u201d a cable can last three months, but that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apk\">when you\u2019re hauling salvage vehicles, you\u2019re messing with mangled metal.... With a job like this, when you\u2019re hauling wrecked vehicles, [a cable] could [snap] in three weeks, because ... there\u2019s times where wheels are crunched and frames are bent under.... [Y]ou never know what you\u2019re picking up from day to day. So they\u2019re just pulling against one another, metal against the rope cable, and rope as in wire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">Tr. 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">He illustrated that point by describing an incident when a cable snapped while he was hauling a wrecked vehicle for Copart. Petitioner testified that on January 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>1999, two cables on his truck needed replacement, but only one was replaced. That same day the cable that was not replaced snapped:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">I was picking up the very first vehicle. I was pulling it to the top, which [sic] it\u2019s under pretty intense pressure. It snapped____As soon as it let go, it came whipping straight back towards me. I hit the ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">Tr. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Petitioner received corroboration from Bill Vincent and Joey Tipton, the Industrial Splicing Co. repairmen who replaced the cables on Petitioner\u2019s truck on March 5. They testified that the cables were in \u201cbad shape,\u201d Tr. 63, 80, had \u201cbent wires and broken strands and kinked cables,\u201d Tr. 63 (Tipton), were \u201csmashed or broken in some places, [with] kinks, burs, broken wires, et cetera,\u201d Tr. 78 (Vincent), and were in danger of breaking. Tr. 63, 79. Vincent stated that the cables \u201ccould break today [or] ... two days from now.... It could be any time.\u201d Tr. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The ALJ credited this evidence, explicitly finding Petitioner, Tipton, and Vincent to be believable witnesses. According to the ALJ, their testimony, coupled with evidence of Copart\u2019s February 4 survey, established that the cables were in disrepair on March 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">The Board rejected the ALJ\u2019s finding regarding the condition of the cables. It based its rejection on Copart\u2019s evidence and on its own assessment of Petitioner\u2019s evidence as incredible. According to the Board, both Petitioner and the ALJ had \u201cfundamentally] misunder[stood]\u201d Co-part\u2019s February 4 survey and rating system, since \u201c[a] \u20182\u2019 rating, such as Powell gave to the winehes/cables item, signified that there was no current defect needing repair, but that the item should be dealt with at the next routine maintenance\u2014 which usually occurred at 8,000 mile intervals.\u201d FDO at 14. The Board pointed to Powell\u2019s testimony that while one of the cables had shown signs of wear during the inspection, it was not unsafe.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-13\">The Board did not explain, however, why the ALJ was required to credit Powell\u2019s testimony. Nor, more importantly, did it explain why Powell\u2019s assessment of the cables\u2019 condition on February 4 had to hold true on March 4, particularly when (1) Copart failed to produce mileage records for the truck and (2) the fact that the other components rated as \u201c2\u201d had been replaced in late February suggests that the truck had indeed traveled 8,000 miles since Powell\u2019s inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-14\">As further evidence that the cables were not defective, the Board relied on the testimony of Keith Mitchell, the service manager of the Frontier repair shop, which worked on the truck\u2019s winches the day of Petitioner\u2019s termination. Mitchell stated that (1) in order to repair the winches it was necessary to remove the cables; (2) it was Frontier\u2019s practice to inspect the cables and to notify the customer of any safety problems; and (3) nothing was brought to his attention regarding the cables on Petitioner\u2019s truck. But Mitchell did not testify that he personally inspected the cables on the date in question, and he agreed that Frontier does not specialize in cable repair but leaves that \u201cup to the cable specialists.\u201d Tr. 231. And again, the Board did not explain why the ALJ was required to believe Mitchell\u2019s testimony, which the ALJ found to be \u201cclearly not credible in some areas.\u201d RDO at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-15\">As for the testimony of Tipton and Vincent, who were cable specialists and personally inspected the cables shortly after Petitioner\u2019s termination, the Board completely discounted then\u2019 assertions that the cables were in \u201cbad shape,\u201d believing that the testimony \u201cproperly cannot be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>any weight ... [because] neither of them could recall [Petitioner\u2019s] truck.\u201d FDO at 15. The Board noted that both had erroneously testified that Petitioner\u2019s truck had five cables, when in fact it had only three. We disagree, however, that this error in recall in itself so undermined their credibility that the ALJ could not rely on their testimony that the cables were defective. Although their memories had dimmed regarding the number of cables on Petitioner\u2019s truck, evidence at the hearing could reasonably be viewed as explaining how they could still recall the cables\u2019 condition. According to Vincent, Petitioner returned to the shop to discuss the condition of the cables shortly after he replaced them, and soon thereafter asked Vincent to write down his impressions of the cables. The record also contains written statements by Vincent and Tipton dated July 1999, which attest to the cables\u2019 disrepair.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">In its brief on appeal the Board notes an additional weakness in Tipton\u2019s testimony, one not addressed in its decision. Tipton testified that the cables on Petitioner\u2019s truck had <em>three </em>broken wires per cable strand, but he also testified that it is <em>five </em>broken wires per cable strand that presents a safety concern. This testimony, however, is not necessarily inconsistent with Tipton\u2019s conclusion that the cables were dangerous, since Vincent testified without contradiction that broken wires <em>or </em>kinks make a cable dangerous, and both repairmen testified that the cables were kinked on the day that they were replaced. In any event, Tipton and Vincent each insisted that the cables were in bad shape.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In short, the Board has failed to persuade us that there was not substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that the cables were defective when Petitioner was terminated. The Board erred in rejecting that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">As for the dangerousness of defective cables, Petitioner relied in part on his own testimony. Petitioner described the \u201cfrightening\u201d incident in January 1999 in which he claimed that a snapped cable had nearly \u201ctaken off a limb,\u201d and remarked, \u201cI\u2019ve seen it where people have lost limbs. I\u2019ve seen it where people have been decapitated with a snapped cable.\u201d Tr. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">In addition, Tipton and Vincent testified about the dangers of defective cables. Tipton stated that if a cable snapped it could hurt, and possibly kill, a person standing nearby. Vincent concurred, stating that a cable could break and \u201churt the driver or anyone behind it.\u201d Tr. 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">This testimony, if believed, is substantial evidence that defective cables are dangerous. The ALJ credited the testimony. The Board, however, did not, relying on the testimony of Copart\u2019s engineer Powell, and dismissing Petitioner\u2019s account of the \u201csnapping cable incident\u201d as \u201cinherently incredible.\u201d FDO at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">Powell testified that the truck\u2019s winches were designed to pull a maximum of 4,800 pounds, while the cables attached to them could pull 15,000 pounds. The Board construed this testimony to mean that \u201cabsent significant failure of the cable, the winch would fail under a much lower load than would the cable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. The Board\u2019s interpretation of Powell\u2019s testimony is not, however, inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that defective cables are dangerous; indeed, it supports the determination that a \u201csignificant\u201d cable failure can pose a danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">The Board\u2019s rejection of Petitioner\u2019s account of the \u201csnapping cable incident\u201d was based in part on his failure to provide \u201cdetails that might have lent credibility to his claim.\u201d FDO at 18. But Copart never attempted to impeach Petitioner on this point by asking questions that could have elicited such details. Nor did Copart pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>duce documents that could have confirmed or disproved that a cable had indeed snapped on one of its trucks in January 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The Board\u2019s rejection of Petitioner\u2019s story was also based on testimony by Powell. According to the Board, Powell stated that the \u201cincident could not have happened as [Petitioner] described it, because when a cable snaps the end attached to the winch would fly back in the direction of the winch \u2014 which would be in the direction of the cab of the truck and not to the side where [Petitioner] claimed to have been standing.\u201d Id. Powell\u2019s actual testimony, however, was more equivocal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">Q: So if the cable snapped, would the person operating the controls be in any danger of being hit by a snapped cable? [Powell]: I <em>have yet to see </em>a snapped cable like that do that, come back and whip at a person. <em>It would typically go </em>straight up and right toward the winch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH0\">Tr. 280 (emphasis added). Moreover, Powell\u2019s experience with towing was limited. Although he was an engineer and had five-years\u2019 experience designing trucks and equipment for a utility company, he had been employed by Copart for only one year and had never driven a tow truck. Also, he admitted that tow truck drivers do not always lift vehicles in the manner he described, but must also, for example, use the cables to lift bumpers or sheet metal to make a vehicle accessible.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The Board likewise rejected Petitioner\u2019s assertion that he had <em>\u201cseen it where </em>people have been decapitated with a snapped cable.\u201d FDO at 17,18 (emphasis added). It viewed his statement with \u201cenormous scepticism\u201d since Petitioner failed to provide details or corroboration. <em>Id. </em>at 18. But again, Copart failed to seek such details by questioning Petitioner about his claim. More importantly, Petitioner plausibly contends on appeal that he was merely testifying that he had <em>heard </em>about such incidents occurring, not that he had personally witnessed a decapitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">In addition, the Board implicitly rejected testimony by Tipton and Vincent that a snapped cable could injure, even kill, a driver or bystander. As previously noted, the Board refused to accord their testimony \u201cany weight\u201d because they were confused about the number of cables on Petitioner\u2019s truck. Yet regardless of how the Board viewed the reliability of Tipton\u2019s and Vincent\u2019s testimony about the <em>condition </em>of the cables on Petitioner\u2019s truck, their knowledge of the danger from broken cables was not challenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Thus, we are unpersuaded that substantial evidence did not support the ALJ\u2019s finding that defective cables posed a significant danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Finally, with respect to the subjective requirement for relief under the STAA\u2014 Petitioner\u2019s actual fear that the cables were dangerous \u2014 Petitioner testified to that fear. A former coworker, Larry Glass, corroborated Petitioner. Glass testified that he had overheard Petitioner tell his supervisors on March 4 that the truck was unsafe due to its \u201cfrayed and worn and kinked\u201d cables. Tr. 30. The ALJ expressly found Petitioner and Glass to be credible witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">To be sure, there is strong impeaching evidence in the record. Despite Petitioner\u2019s assertions that he feared danger from the cables, he surprisingly failed to document his concern. Copart drivers are required to list all vehicle defects on a Driver\u2019s Vehicle Inspection Report (DVTR) form and submit the foim at the end of each shift. Yet his reports never expressed any concerns about the cables, despite his reports of problems with the truck\u2019s brakes, winches, and ram, including such reports on March 1 and 2. He could offer no explanation for this omission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">Q: But what I am trying to get from you, Mr. Dalton, ... [if] the brakes were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>significant enough to put them on this driver inspection report and mark they were a safety concern, wasn\u2019t the cable just as much of a safety concern to you as these brakes were, if you were afraid it was going to snap and could kill somebody and decapitate someone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">And if so, why was it not on your driver inspection report on March 1 or March 2?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">[Petitioner]: That\u2019s a good question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">Q: Should it have been?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">[Petitioner]: I should have, from the onset, written down everything from the go and never \u2014 I should have never, ever not written it down, because I wouldn\u2019t have been in the position that I was in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC6\">Tr. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">While this evidence calls into question Petitioner\u2019s alleged fear that the cables were dangerous, we do not believe that it is so damning that it \u201coverwhelms\u201d the other evidence in his favor, rendering that evidence insubstantial. <em>See Bowen, </em>865 F.2d at 224 (\u201cevidence is not substantial if it is overwhelmed by other evidence\u201d). Everyone makes foolish omissions from time to time. Nor do we find that the remaining evidence in the record undermines the ALJ\u2019s finding that Petitioner feared serious injury from the cables.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">In sum, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s findings regarding Petitioner\u2019s reasonable fear of danger from the cables. Under its own regulations, the Board was required to adopt those findings. Its failure to do so was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">We REVERSE the decision of the Board and REMLAND for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-30\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
