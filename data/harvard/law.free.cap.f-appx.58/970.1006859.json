Jackson now appeals. His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing whether the district court erred in determining that a 1991 conviction for \u201cAssault on a Law Officer\u201d was a crime of violence within the meaning of the Sentencing Guidelines, but stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Jackson was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but declined to do so. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">The federal sentencing guideline applicable to a \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction provides a base offense level of twenty if the defendant has one prior felony conviction that is a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (2000). Jackson concedes that, at the time of the offense, it constituted a felony for purposes of the sentencing guidelines. The term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a), as \u201cany offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or ... otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d The determination as to whether an offense is a crime of violence is a question of law that this court reviews de novo. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>215 F.3d 470, 472 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">The offense occurred when Jackson resisted arrest for violating a local loitering ordinance; according to the presentence report, Jackson \u201cassaulted Officer D.T. Moore ... by hitting him with his fist.\u201d We find that the district court correctly held that this offense is a crime of violence within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">We have reviewed the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that' a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
