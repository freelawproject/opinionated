The District Court sentenced George Rhodis to 21 months in prison, a $50,000 fine, restitution of $99,317, and a three-year term of supervised release. On appeal, George Rhodis challenges (1) the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction, (2) the District Court\u2019s conscious avoidance jury instruction, and (3) the District Court\u2019s calculation of the tax loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">In analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and consider whether <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Anglin, </em>169 F.3d 154, 159 (2d Cir.1999). We thus consider the evidence in its totality and draw all reasonable inferences in the Government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Autuori, </em>212 F.3d 105, 114 (2d Cir.2000). George Rhodis challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the conclusions that (1) he knowingly signed the false returns in question and (2) he conspired to defraud the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">The Government\u2019s evidence established that, from 1993 through 1995, tax returns allegedly signed by George Rhodis failed to report approximately $700,000 in interest and real estate rental income. \u201cThe fact that an individual\u2019s name is signed to a return, statement, or other document shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence for all purposes that the return, statement, or other document was actually signed by him.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6064; <em>see also United States v. Kim, </em>884 F.2d 189, 195 (5th Cir. 1989) (applying 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6064 in criminal prosecution for tax evasion). Moreover, numerous documents upon which George Rhodis\u2019s signature appeared \u2014 including amended tax returns, a settlement agreement, and a loan application \u2014 were admitted into evidence without objection as to the authenticity of the signatures. Indeed, George Rhodis\u2019s counsel himself introduced the amended tax returns containing his signatures. A jury may com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>pare a known handwriting sample with another sample to determine if the handwriting in the latter is genuine. Fed. R.Evid. 901(b)(3). Thus, the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find that the signatures on the false tax returns belonged to George Rhodis.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">With regard to the sufficiency of the evidence of a conspiracy to defraud the United States, George Rhodis was intimately involved in the affairs of the two Roosevelt Avenue Corporations in which he and his brother, John, were partners. George Rhodis personally negotiated leases with tenants, asked tenants to make their rent checks out to him, collected rent, and told the brothers\u2019 secretary to deposit rent proceeds into his, George Rhodis\u2019s, personal accounts. The Government\u2019s evidence included, among other things, (1) numerous rent checks made out to, and endorsed by, George Rhodis, and (2) tax returns, signed by George Rhodis, that did not report the income that had been deposited into his personal accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The Government\u2019s evidence also established that in 1992 George Rhodis signed a loan application that reported the monthly income generated by the Roosevelt Avenue Corporations to be substantially higher than the amounts reported on the tax returns that he signed from 1993 through 1995. Moreover, at an albeit unrelated meeting with the brothers\u2019 accountant, Christos Tzelios, George Rhodis did not take advantage of an opportunity to tell Tzelios that the Roosevelt Avenue Corporations\u2019 financial records \u2014 upon which Tzelios depended to prepare the corporate tax returns \u2014 were unreliable and did not show income that was being diverted into the brothers\u2019 personal accounts. Finally, George Rhodis was party to the brothers\u2019 settlement agreement with Mireya DeLaRosa, which resulted from \u2014 among other things \u2014 her threat to tell the Internal Revenue Service about the brothers\u2019 fraudulent filings. This proof afforded a sufficient factual predicate to support George Rhodis\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">A conscious avoidance jury instruction is appropriate when (1) the element of knowledge is in dispute and (2) the appropriate factual predicate for the charge existed. <em>United States v. Ferrarini, </em>219 F.3d 145, 154 (2d Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1037, 121 S.Ct. 1998, 149 L.Ed.2d 1001 (2001). Both at trial and on appeal, George Rhodis has asserted that he lacked sufficient knowledge of the falsity of the tax returns. For example, in his opening statement at trial, George Rhodis\u2019s counsel told the jury that \u201cthe evidence will show ... Mireya Cuba DeLaRosa, ... took advantage of two people who were living in the state of Florida, and unfortunately were not paying keen attention to the conduct of a woman who held herself out to be ... a person who was familiar with handling accounting, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and reconciliations, financial analysis____\u201d Transcript, March 27, 2001, p. 156-57. Thus, George Rhodis himself placed the element of his knowledge in dispute at the start of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">A sufficient factual predicate exists if \u201cthe evidence is such that a rational juror may reach [the] conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the defendant \u201cwas aware of a high probability of the fact in dispute and consciously avoided confirming that fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>983 F.2d 455, 458 (2d Cir.1993). As catalogued above, the Government provided ample evidence that George Rhodis personally participated in the operations of the Roosevelt Avenue Corporations and diverted income from them that he did not report on his personal returns. The discrepancy between the income reported on the 1993-1995 tax returns and the income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>asserted on the 1992 loan application, combined with the degree of George Rhodis\u2019s involvement in the Roosevelt Avenue Corporations, afforded a basis for concluding that either he knew the tax returns to be false or else that he \u201cwas aware of a high probability [that he was filing false tax returns] and consciously avoided confirming that fact.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>983 F.2d at 458. Consequently, we see no error in the District Court\u2019s decision to give a conscious avoidance instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Although George Rhodis adopts his brother\u2019s claim that the jury could have mistakenly applied the conscious avoidance charge to the conspiracy count, it is clear from the record that the conscious avoidance charge took place in the context of the District Court\u2019s discussion of the substantive offenses, not the conspiracy. Moreover, despite George Rhodis\u2019s claims that the charge\u2019s language was confusing and imputed John Rhodis\u2019s knowledge to George, upon a careful review of the record as a whole, we find that the charge\u2019s language was proper and sufficiently distinguished the issue of George Rhodis\u2019s knowledge from that of his brother. <em>See United States v. Koh, </em>199 F.3d 632, 641 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Finally, George Rhodis challenges the District Court\u2019s calculation of the tax loss. At sentencing, the District Court calculated the United States\u2019 tax loss by first adding (1) $144,206 in unreported interest income from 1993 and (2) $565,202, the difference between the gross income fraudulently claimed for 1993-1995 and the gross income subsequently reported for that period on amended tax returns. The District Court then multiplied the sum by 28 percent, arriving at a total tax loss of $200,652. The District Court did not use the net income figures of the amended tax returns and thus did not count the $20,800 in additional deductions listed on one corporation\u2019s amended 1993 tax return. In addition to challenging the interest income figure, George Rhodis contends that he should not be accountable for $2,018 of tax loss due to DeLaRosa\u2019s failure to file individual tax returns during the years she managed the Roosevelt Avenue Corporations. George Rhodis also adopts his brother\u2019s argument on appeal that the District Court should have taken into account the deductions reported on the amended 1993 tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines and reviews the District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Sisti, </em>91 F.3d 305, 310 (2d Cir.1996). When \u201cthe amount of tax loss [is] uncertain[,] the guidelines contemplate that the court will simply make a reasonable estimate based on the available facts.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.1, comment 1. Here, the relevant financial records were, as George Rhodis\u2019s nephew testified, a \u201ctotal mishmash\u201d in 1996 and \u201cstill not organized\u201d by the time of the trial. (Transcript, April 12, 2001, pp. 1484, 1608.) There was evidence that interest had been paid in 1993 and testimony that no interest payments had been missed, and the District Court\u2019s calculation of the unreported interest income was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Likewise, the District Court did not err in attributing to George Rhodis the $2,018 in tax loss stemming from DeLaRosa\u2019s failure to file income tax returns for the period she managed the Roosevelt Avenue Corporations. The Sentencing Guidelines state that, in a jointly undertaken criminal activity, the foreseeable acts of one participant are attributable to a co-participant for sentencing purposes. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). The brothers paid DeLaRosa in cash and entrusted her with the diversion of unreported funds into their personal accounts. DeLaRosa never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>received a W-2 or a 1099 from 95-45 Roosevelt Avenue Corporation, the corporation for which she technically worked. Indeed, the false tax returns at issue never reported salary or wage payments to De-LaRosa. Finally, at John Rhodis\u2019s suggestion, DeLaRosa did not file income tax returns for 1994 and 1995. Thus, DeLaRosa\u2019s failure to file income tax returns was foreseeable, and the consequent tax loss of $2,018 was properly attributable to George Rhodis.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">When calculating tax loss, district courts must give defendants the benefit of legitimate deductions. U.S.S.G \u00a7 2T1.1; <em>United States v. Martinez-Rios, </em>143 F.3d 662, 671 (2d Cir.1998). Here, however, the District Court apparently gave neither John nor George Rhodis the benefit of deductions claimed on the amended 1993 return. Since the record is unclear as to whether the District Court considered the deductions illegitimate or failed to consider them at all, we remand so that the District Court can clarify its calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the matter is REMANDED for reconsideration of any effect of the 1993 deductions on the sentence, and the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED in all other respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
