Breyer, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b353-13\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">The Social Security Commissioner denied Robert Krieger\u2019s application for Title II Social Security disability benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 <em>et seq., </em>and Title XVI Supplemental Security Income disability benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1381 <em>et seq., </em>for emphysema and bipolar disorder. Krieger appealed to an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who ruled that Krieger was able to perform jobs available in significant numbers in the national economy and therefore was not disabled under the Social Security Act. The ALJ also ruled that because Krieger was not disabled on or before the date his insurance status expired, he was not entitled to receive disability insurance benefits. The district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-18\">We review the district court\u2019s judgment de novo, and independently determine \u201cwhether the Commissioner\u2019s decision (1) is free of legal error and (2) is supported by substantial evidence,\u201d <em>Smolen v. Chafer, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1279 (9th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 601 (9th Cir.1989)), such that a \u201creasonable mind might accept [the evidence] as adequate,\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-19\">Krieger challenges the ALJ\u2019s findings at steps three and five of the five-step sequential inquiry required by the Social Security regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(b)-(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">At step three, the ALJ determined that neither Krieger\u2019s bipolar disorder nor his pulmonary disease met a disability listing, based on his assessment of Krieger\u2019s credibility and his finding that Krieger\u2019s pulmonary disease would not be severe in the absence of his marijuana use. Our review of the record reveals that the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination was supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>substantial evidence: Krieger had a history of discounting the significance of his marijuana use; Krieger\u2019s claims that his physical capabilities, concentration, and memory were severely restricted were contradicted by the testimony of the examining psychologist; and no objective medical evidence substantiated his claim that he suffered blackouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The ALJ\u2019s determination regarding Krieger\u2019s marijuana use was not in error. <em>See </em>Public Law 104-121, \u00a7 105 (amending the Social Security Act definition of disability, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2), to provide that \u201c[a]n individual shall not be considered to be disabled for purposes of this title if alcoholism or drug addiction would (but for this subparagraph) be a contributing factor material to the Commissioner\u2019s determination that the individual is disabled\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The Social Security Administration\u2019s Emergency Teletype does not change our analysis. Administrative materials carry the force and effect of law only if they \u201c(1) [prescribe substantive rules-not interpretive rules [or] general statements of policy ... and, (2) conform to certain procedural requirements.\u201d <em>Moore v. Apfel, </em>216 F.3d 864, 868 (9th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Fifty-Three Eclectus Parrots, </em>685 F.2d 1131, 1136 (9th Cir.1982)). The teletype was not published in the Federal Register or the Code of Federal Regulations, <em>see Moore, </em>216 F.3d at 869, nor was it \u201cintended to create substantive rights in third parties ... or to paralyze the [Administration] by conditioning the exercise of ... authority on the satisfaction of several requirements,\u201d <em>United States v. Alameda Gateway, Ltd., </em>213 F.3d 1161, 1168 (9th Cir.2000). <em>McNatt v. Apfel, </em>201 F.3d 1084 (9th Cir. 2000), does not persuade us otherwise, as that case dealt with the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of a binding regulation. <em>See Moore, </em>216 F.3d at 869 (concluding that in <em>McNatt </em>\u201c[i]t was the Federal Regulation that had the force and effect of law,\u201d not the internal manual). Finally, the ALJ\u2019s determination regarding the negative effect of Krieger\u2019s marijuana use was supported by the medical expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The ALJ\u2019s determination at step five that Krieger could work in jobs present in significant numbers in the national economy was also supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ\u2019s hypothetical questions were \u201cbased on medical assumptions supported by substantial evidence in the record that reflects all the claimant\u2019s limitations.\u201d <em>Osenbrock v. Apfel, </em>240 F.3d 1157, 1165 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">Finally, although Dr. Grossman\u2019s testimony regarding Krieger\u2019s physical limitations could cast doubt on Krieger\u2019s ability to sustain regular employment, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion was not unreasonable, nor can it be said that the outcome would necessarily have changed had the ALJ given greater weight to Dr. Grossman\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b353-21\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
