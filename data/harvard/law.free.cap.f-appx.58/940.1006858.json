The plea agreement recommended a three-level reduction in the defendant\u2019s offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The pre-sentence report, however, recommended against an adjustment for acceptance of responsibili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>ty. Peppers\u2019s probation officer based the recommendation on two misconducts that Peppers incurred while incarcerated prior to sentencing. The first misconduct was for \u201cthreatening a[ ] [correctional] employee or their family.\u201d The second was issued after Peppers tested positive for, and admitted to smoking, marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the District Court considered Peppers\u2019 objection to the pre-sentence report\u2019s recommendation. According to Peppers\u2019 attorney, the reduction was warranted because Peppers\u2019 plea had spared the government the time and expense of a trial. With respect to the misconduct for marijuana, Peppers\u2019 attorney asked the District Court to take into account his dependency on drugs, and argued that defendants who test positive for marijuana while on pretrial release are regularly not denied a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The District Court also considered the government\u2019s recommendation that the reduction be granted, and heard testimony from one of the federal agents to whom Peppers provided information about other criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The District Court elected to follow the recommendation in the pre-sentence report, and denied the reduction for acceptance of responsibility, concluding that \u201cit [is] very, very difficult to give someone acceptance of responsibility when they absolutely flaunted the law in becoming involved with drugs after the plea and awaiting sentencing.\u201d Peppers contends the District Court erroneously followed its own \u201cstandard practice\u201d instead of the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">The sentencing judge has considerable latitude to weigh factors supporting or denying an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>161 F.3d 171, 197 (3d Cir.1998) (stating that sentencing court is free to consider evidence both consistent and inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility). Peppers avers the District Court only considered the misconduct stemming from his marijuana use. At the inception of the sentencing hearing, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-9\">My standard practice has been that when someone is awaiting sentence and particularly is awaiting sentence in a prison \u2014 although that additional factor may not necessarily change my position \u2014 ... I have refused in the past to give acceptance of responsibility with someone that has become involved with drugs while awaiting. Do you wish to argue?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">Accordingly, Peppers contends that it is impossible to tell if the District Court properly balanced the factors for and against an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. He asks that we vacate the sentence and remand for re-sentencing. <em>See United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238 (3d Cir.1998) (holding that if the legal basis for the district court\u2019s sentencing ruling cannot be determined from the record, the appropriate remedy is to remand to permit the district court to state basis for its ruling).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-12\">Whether the District Court properly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 is a question of law subject to plenary review. <em>United States v. Ceccarani, </em>98 F.3d 126, 129 (3d Cir. 1996). We find that the District Court followed the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">The District Court\u2019s statement that its \u201cstandard practice\u201d had been to deny acceptance of responsibility to persons involved in illegal drug use prior to sentencing does not establish that it failed to weigh the factors for and against adjustment in Peppers\u2019 case. Furthermore, the District Court invited arguments to the contrary from defendant, which were pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>sented. The Commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 sets forth a panoply of factors that a district court may consider as indicative of acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 1. The testimony and arguments provided during the sentencing hearing implicated two of the factors: \u201c(a) truthfully admitting the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction, and truthfully admitting or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 IB 1.3 (Relevant Conduct); [and] (b) voluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct or associations.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. l(a)(b). The District Court\u2019s reference to past \u201cstandard practice\u201d suggests that it regarded a continued course of criminal conduct as a significant factor in assessing whether a defendant had truly accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct. The court\u2019s explanation that Peppers \u201cabsolutely flaunted the law in becoming involved with drugs after the plea and awaiting sentencing\u201d was the basis for its ruling. The record adequately reflects the District Court\u2019s reliance upon factors for and against acceptance of responsibility set forth in the official Commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Accordingly, the decision to deny \u201cacceptance of responsibility\u201d was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-14\">. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) provides, \"[i]\u00a3 the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, decrease the offense level by two levels.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b974-15\">. The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b974-25\">. The plea agreement into which Peppers entered reserved the government\u2019s right to recommend the maximum sentence, and provided that the court\u2019s failure to grant the reduction would not void the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
