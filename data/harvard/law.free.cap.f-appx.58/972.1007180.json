Taylor\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396,18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but contends on Taylor\u2019s behalf that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Taylor has filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he challenges the district court\u2019s sentencing guidelines calculation. Taylor also argues that his sentence violates <em>Apprendi. </em>Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-27\">Taylor first objects to a three-level increase in his offense level, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing \u2022 Guidelines Manual </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) (2000), for brandishing a firearm. Taylor contends the enhancement violates <em>Apprendi </em>because brandishing was not alleged in the indictment. This argument is without merit. Taylor\u2019s sentence was well within the statutory twenty-year maximum, and is unaffected by <em>Apprendi. See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201-02 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">Taylor next objects to the district court\u2019s consideration of dismissed conduct in determining his sentencing range. This court has repeatedly upheld such consideration of dismissed conduct. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Barber, </em>119 F.3d 276, 284 (4th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we find the enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-6\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm Taylor\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
