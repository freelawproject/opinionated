The Honorable Jed S. Rakoff, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-11\">Petitioner Florencio Palaguachi appeals the denial by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Sifton, <em>S.J.) </em>of his petition for habeas corpus, asserting a due process violation based on newly discovered evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Petitioner was convicted in November 1991 following a jury trial in Supreme Court, Kings County, of six counts of the first degree rape of his daughter, Jenny Palaguachi, and sentenced to six concurrent terms of 6 to 18 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-15\">On direct appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed the conviction. <em>People v. Palaguachi </em>210 A.D.2d 436, 620 N.Y.S.2d 429 (2d Dep\u2019t 1994). Leave to appeal was denied by the New York Court of Appeals. <em>People v. Palaguachi </em>85 N.Y.2d 912, 627 N.Y.S.2d 335, 650 N.E.2d 1337 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-16\">Petitioner, proceeding pro se, then moved in February 1998, in Supreme Court, Kings County, for an order vacating his judgment of conviction pursuant to N.Y.Crim. Pro. Law \u00a7 440.10(l)(g) on the ground of newly discovered evidence. Petitioner attached to his motion two notarized letters from Jenny Palaguachi dated December 9, 1996, and February 10, 1998, in which Jenny claimed a partial memory loss of the events in question and requested the release of her father. In response, the State obtained and submitted an affirmation by Jenny, purporting to \u201cclarify what was stated in the notarized 1996 and 1998 letters written by myself ... and offered to this Court by my father as support for his motion.\u201d A47. In this affirmation, Jenny stated that she \u201ctestified truthfully to the best of my ability\u201d at trial, although she no longer remembers \u201cmany details about what happened between myself and my father any more.\u201d A47. In June 1998, Supreme Court Justice Michael R. Juviler, who had presided over petitioner\u2019s trial, denied the motion, finding that in light of Jenny\u2019s affirmation that she testified \u201ctruthfully\u201d at trial, petitioner had not presented \u201cnew evidence,\u201d in the form of a recantation. A17. The Appellate Division denied petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>On September 20,1999, petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, asserting a variety of claims including a due process claim based on newly discovered evidence (the same letters presented to the state court). After the State challenged the timeliness of all of petitioner\u2019s claims except the newly discovered evidence claim, petitioner withdrew his other claims, leaving only the claim based on newly discovered evidence. A7.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">In February 2000, petitioner submitted to the District Court an unsworn letter by Jenny to the New York State Division of Parole, stating that petitioner \u201cis an innocent man, [who] never violated (rape) me or anyone else.\u201d A49. In May 2000, petitioner submitted a third notarized affidavit by Jenny, now 19 years old, in which she expressly recanted her trial testimony. This affidavit states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">I am submitting this statement based on the truth, asking to the court to set a side [sic] my father\u2019s conviction due to false statements made during his trial. During my father\u2019s trial dated between September to October, 1991. I was a child of 10 years old and I did not understand what was actually taking place. I was very young and the things I stated in court were all fabricated due to the district attorney coaching me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">A50.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">The District Court first determined (correctly) that because the recantation affidavit had never been submitted to state court, petitioner\u2019s claim was unexhausted. A20. Notwithstanding this determination, however, the District Court, as authorized by Congress in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AED-PA), <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2), turned to the merits and denied the petition. \u201cAn application for a writ of habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding the failure of the applicant to exhaust the remedies available in the courts of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court determined that Jenny\u2019s recantation was not credible in light of the evolution of her statements, the type of crime involved, which is \u201cof the type one would ordinarily try to repress,\u201d her guilt over her father\u2019s continued incarceration and her expressed motivation to maintain a relationship with him. A23. The District Court, however, issued a certificate of appealability \u201con the issue of whether petitioner\u2019s due process rights were abridged.\u201d A24.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">Petitioner appealed to this \u25a0 court and, shortly thereafter, also filed another motion pursuant to N.Y.Crim. Pro. Law \u00a7 440.10(l)(g) to vacate his conviction in Supreme Court, Kings County. The court denied this motion without an evidentiary hearing, also finding that Jenny\u2019s recantation lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-10\">Petitioner contends that the District Court\u2019s denial on the merits was erroneous, because out of concerns of federalism and comity it should have allowed the state court to first consider the claim. We disagree since 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2) expressly authorizes a federal court to deny an unexhausted claim on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">Having reviewed the record, we conclude, for substantially the same reasons given by the District Court, that petitioner did not make out a credible claim of witness recantation. <em>See Sanders v. Sullivan, </em>863 F.2d 218, 222 (2d Cir.1988) (noting that a \u201ccredible recantation\u201d is a prerequisite to establishing a due process violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
