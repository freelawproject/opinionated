Rios-Barboza contends that his sentence in excess of the two-year maximum set forth in 8 U. S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) violates the due process requirement articulated in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in that elements necessary to impose the enhanced sentence \u2014 the fact that an alien has been removed and suffered an aggravated felony before removal \u2014 were neither pled in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Acknowledging that this court has rejected his argument, <em>see United States v. Castillo-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1020, 1024-25 (9th Cir.2001) (rejecting contention that Apprendi\u2019s recidivism exception is somehow inapplicable to an aggravated felony enhancement under \u00a7 1326 because removal must have been <em>subsequent </em>to an aggravated felony conviction), Rios-Barboza states that he raises the issue in order to preserve it in the event the Supreme Court overrules contrary authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b780-36\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
