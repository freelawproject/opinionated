The cellmate later attacked McKinney. Peters moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that he was entitled to qualified immunity. The district court denied this motion; Peters brings an interlocutory appeal challenging that denial. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We review de novo \u201cthe district court\u2019s determination on summary judgment that [Peters] cannot invoke qualified immunity as a bar to civil litigation.\u201d <em>Martinez v. City of Oxnard, </em>270 F.3d 852, 855 (9th Cir.2001). In evaluating whether Peters is entitled to qualified immunity, we must accept as true the facts as McKinney alleges they exist, looking only to his complaint. <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001); <em>Martinez, </em>270 F.3d at 855.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We must answer \u201cthis threshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right?\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (quoting <em>Siegert v. Gilley, </em>500 U.S. 226, 232, 111 S.Ct. 1789, 114 L.Ed.2d 277 (1991)). Then, \u201cif a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties\u2019 submissions, the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Two years before the attack on McKinney, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] prison official\u2019s \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to a substantial risk of serious harm to an inmate violates the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 828, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">McKinney\u2019s complaint and the attached exhibits allege (1) an objectively substantial risk of serious harm (2) of which Peters was subjectively aware but chose to disregard. <em>See Id. </em>at 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970; <em>Estate of Ford v. Ramirez-Palmer, </em>301 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, assuming the facts alleged as true, McKinney\u2019s right to a cell transfer was clearly established in this case, and \u201cit would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation [Peters] confronted.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b319-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
