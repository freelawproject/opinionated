Diaz claims that the state trial court had denied him his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial when it improperly excluded his family members from the courtroom during the trial testimony of an undercover officer. The Appellate Division ruled that Diaz\u2019s claim was \u201cunpreserved for appellate review since the defendant failed to object when the court, following a hearing, granted the People\u2019s application for closure.\u201d <em>People v. Diaz, </em>265 A.D.2d 489, 696 N.Y.S.2d 705, 705 (N.Y.App.Div.1999) (mem.). Leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals was denied on December 6, 1999. <em>People v. Diaz, </em>94 N.Y.2d 861, 704 N.Y.S.2d 537, 725 N.E.2d 1099 (1999). The district court denied Diaz\u2019s petition on the basis of the procedural default. <em>Diaz v. Donnelly, </em>No. 00-CV-1851, 2000 WL 1364350 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a petition for writ of habeas corpus <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Ponnapula v. Spitzer, </em>297 F.3d 172, 179 (2d Cir.2002) (citation omitted). In deciding a habeas petition we \u201cwill not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). New York applies a contemporaneous objection rule that requires an objection to a ruling \u201cat the time of such ruling or instruction or at any subsequent time when the court had an opportunity of effectively changing the same.\u201d N.Y.Crim. Proc. Law \u00a7 470.05(2). Under this rule, a party must have brought an issue to the trial court\u2019s attention \u201cat a time and in a way that gave [the court] the opportunity to remedy the problem and thereby avert reversible error,\u201d and \u201cfairly apprise[d] the court and the opposing party of the nature and scope of the matter contested.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Lewis, </em>188 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir.1999) (citation omitted); <em>see also Osborne v. Ohio, </em>495 U.S. 103, 124-25, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 109 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">As Diaz argues, New York courts have enforced a \u201cspecial concern\u201d about excluding family members from the courtroom, requiring reasons documented in the record for barring them. <em>People v. Nieves, </em>90 N.Y.2d 426, 660 N.Y.S.2d 858, 683 N.E.2d 764, 766 (N.Y.1997); <em>see also In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 271-72, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948); <em>English v. Artuz, </em>164 F.3d 105, 108 (2d Cir.1998). We recently have held that a \u201cheightened showing\u201d must be made for the exclusion of family members. Yung v. Walker, 296 F.3d 129, 136 (2d Cir.2002). In any event, defense counsel never apprised the court that he objected to barring the family members from the court, and in fact, never even mentioned the word \u201cfamily.\u201d When the court asked about closing the court for the <em>Hinton </em>hearing, the prosecutor answered that she wanted to bar the family members from the hearing, but she never mentioned barring them specifically for the trial. <em>See People v. Hinton, </em>31 N.Y.2d 71, 334 N.Y.S.2d 885, 286 N.E.2d 265 (1972). Defense counsel objected, and the court then sought to clarify the nature of the defendant\u2019s objection by asking which application the defendant objected to \u2014 closing the court for the <em>Hinton </em>hearing or for trial. Defense counsel asked the judge to deny the prosecutor\u2019s application to close the court \u201cwith respect to ... any part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the trial,\u201d generally citing the right to a fair and open trial under the constitutions of the United States and New York. He then admitted that he was \u201cnot quite sure [he] understood] what [was] going on.\u201d The court explained that it would rule on the <em>Hinton </em>hearing first, and asked whether counsel consented to excluding the two family members for the hearing. Defense counsel acceded \u201cfor the purposes of the hearing.\u201d Defense counsel did not ask the undercover officer any questions, and in particular, asked no questions about why the two family members should be excluded. When counsel stated at the end of the hearing that he wanted \u201cto rely on the record,\u201d that record included nothing to put the court on notice about the special concern for barring family members or about the sufficiency of the evidence for closing the court for the officer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">When the court granted the motion for sealing the courtroom from the general public, it offered explanations that pertained only to the general public. The court did not indicate explicitly that the family members were excluded, and defense counsel did not ask to clarify whether the court had excluded them. Given this record, it is not clear whether the court actually had barred the defendant\u2019s family, nor whether the court was aware that its ruling would have this practical effect. Even if the court had excluded the two family members, defense counsel never gave the trial court an opportunity to correct the problem, nor the prosecution a chance at trial to respond to the defense\u2019s arguments against excluding them. Accordingly, we conclude that the New York Appellate Division had a \u201cfair and substantial basis\u201d for ruling that Diaz\u2019s public trial claim was unpreserved because he failed to object when the court granted the application for closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Finally, Diaz argues that New York courts do not apply the contemporaneous objection rule \u201cevenhandedly,\u201d as required by <em>Garcia </em>to constitute an independent and adequate state procedural bar. <em>Garcia, </em>188 F.3d at 77. The district court thoroughly evaluated the cases offered by Diaz in support of this claim, and properly concluded that the claim was \u201cunpersuasive.\u201d <em>See Donnelly, </em>2000 WL 1364350, at *7-*8 &amp; n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
