On direct appeal, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed, <em>see Freeman v. State, </em>331 Ark. 130, 959 S.W.2d 400 (1998), and Freeman\u2019s petition for postconviction relief was denied, as was his August 2000 petition to reinvest the trial court with jurisdiction to consider a petition for a writ of error coram nobis, <em>see Freeman v. State, </em>No. CR 97-640, 2000 WL 1476656, at *1 (Ark. Oct. 5, 2000) (unpublished per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-25\">In October 2001, almost a year after the denial of his August 2000 petition, Freeman filed this 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, raising, as he did in the August 2000 petition, a claim under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). Freeman argued equitable considerations should toll the one-year statute of limitations application to section 2254 petitions, because the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>dence underlying his <em>Brady </em>claim established he was actually innocent. Even assuming the statute of limitations did not begin to run until Freeman obtained the <em>Brady </em>evidence in March 2000, and the limitations period was tolled during the pendency of the state court proceeding from August through October 2000, Freeman still waited nearly seventeen months to pursue his claims in federal court. Given Freeman\u2019s failure to show wrongdoing by the State prevented him from bringing a timely petition, his reliance on actual innocence to invoke equitable tolling is misplaced. <em>See Flanders v. Graves, </em>299 F.3d 974, 978 (8th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 1361, 155 L.Ed.2d 263 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> dismissing Freeman\u2019s petition as time-barred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-14\"> The Honorable J. Thomas Ray, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by consent of the parties under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
