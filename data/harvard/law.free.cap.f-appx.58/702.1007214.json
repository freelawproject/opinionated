He was subsequently turned over to United States immigration officials stationed at the Vancouver International Airport and returned to the United States. We disagree with Yoon\u2019s argument. Although the economic and diplomatic reach of the United States may extend internationally, its territorial and jurisdictional reach does not. The Vancouver International Airport is no more a part of the United States than the Tower of London. It is true that Yoon originally in 1999 entered the United States on a tourist visa, and overstayed it. But Yoon left the United States on April 13, 2001 and his status as a removable alien cannot be disputed on this record. <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 525-526 (9th Cir.2000) (if <em>hozada </em>requirements are not met we overturn the Board\u2019s decision only if \u201c[t]he facts are plain on the administrative record\u201d). Yoon\u2019s claims of deprivation of due process by ineffective assistance of counsel fail because Yoon was not prejudiced by the actions of his former counsel who admitted his arriving alien status and admitted that Yoon was an alien, who by fraud, sought to gain admission into the United States. <em>Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999) (prejudice results when \u201cthe performance of counsel was so inadequate that it may have affected the outcome of the proceedings\u201d). Here, Yoon was a re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>movable alien, and the concessions byYoon\u2019s attorney did not prejudice Yoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b737-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-11\">. 8 U.S.C. 1225(a)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-12\">(1) Aliens treated as applicants for admission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-13\">An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been interdicted in international or United States waters) shall be deemed for purposes of this chapter an applicant for admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 235.1(c)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-16\">(2) An alien present in the United States who has not been admitted or paroled or an alien who seeks entry at other than an open, designated port-of-entry, except as otherwise permitted in this section, is subject to the provisions of section 212(a) of the Act and to removal under section 235</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b737-17\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(D provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-18\">(I) who is not in possession of a valid unexpired immigrant visa, reentry permit, border crossing identification card, or other valid entry document required by this chapter, and a valid unexpired passport, or other suitable travel document, or document of identity and nationality if such document is required under the regulations issued by the Attorney General under section 1181(a) of this title ... is inadmissible.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
