The Government established that, from 1993 through 1995, John Rhodis failed to report approximately $700,000 in interest and real estate rental income. The District Court sentenced John Rhodis to 36 months in prison, a f\u00edne of $75,000, restitution of $99,317, and a three-year term of supervised release. On appeal, John Rhodis challenges the District Court\u2019s (1) conscious avoidance jury instruction, (2) two-level sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice, and (3) calculation of the tax loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">At trial the Government established that John Rhodis participated in a scheme to file false tax returns. The scheme involved the failure to report the income generated by the Roosevelt Avenue Corporations, in which John and his brother, George, were business partners. The Government\u2019s evidence showed that John Rho-dis worked with the finances of the corporations, handling such tasks as dealing with tenants, negotiating leases, and reviewing financial records. John Rhodis told tenants to make out rent checks in his name, and these checks were deposited into personal accounts over which John Rhodis had complete control. In addition, John Rhodis instructed the corporations\u2019 bookkeeper that cash deposits into these accounts should not exceed $10,000 per day so that the IRS would not be notified. There also was testimony that John Rho-dis instructed the corporations\u2019 bookkeeper to maintain an accurate set of rental receipts, including those rental checks diverted into the personal accounts, and to conceal the accurate records from the corporations\u2019 tax preparer. Moreover, the Government\u2019s evidence established that in 1992 John Rhodis signed a loan application that reported the monthly income generated by the Roosevelt Avenue Corporations to be substantially higher than the amounts reported on their tax returns from 1993 through 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In view of the overwhelming evidence of John Rhodis\u2019s direct participation in the tax avoidance scheme, any error with respect to the conscious avoidance charge would have been harmless. For the same reason, John Rhodis\u2019s assertion that his lawyer was ineffective in the manner in which he objected to the conscious avoidance charge would fail to meet the requirements of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">We similarly disagree with the contention that the District Court\u2019s two-level sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice was erroneous. This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines and reviews the District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Sisti, </em>91 F.3d 305, 310 (2d Cir.1996). The District Court found that John Rhodis (1) had signed a false affidavit accusing the Government\u2019s main witness, Mireya DeLaRosa, of forging a $10,000 check and (2) had given his son, Nicholas, this false affidavit for Nicholas to submit to the Government during a criminal tax investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">The evidence established that, after De-LaRosa\u2019s departure, Nicholas managed his father\u2019s office and consulted with his father on business and legal matters. De-LaRosa threatened to go to the authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>with incriminating information about the Rhodises\u2019 finances, and John Rhodis told Nicholas that DeLaRosa had forged a $10,000 check. Nicholas sent John Rhodis an affidavit to that effect for John to sign. John Rhodis signed the affidavit and sent it back to Nicholas. Nicholas testified that, in response to a government investigation, he prepared a submission containing his father\u2019s false affidavit. Nicholas further testified that he had shown this submission to his father. At no point did John Rhodis inform the government investigators that his affidavit was false. Given this evidence, the District Court\u2019s factual finding that John Rhodis had, in effect, induced his son submit a false affidavit in response to a government investigation is not clearly erroneous. Consequently, the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice was proper where, as here,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-4\">(A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1; <em>see also United States v. Fredette, </em>15 F.3d 272, 276 (2d Cir.1994) (finding use of false affidavit in attempt to \u201cderail ... investigation and prosecution\u201d sufficient for \u00a7 3C1.1 sentence enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">At sentencing, the District Court calculated the tax loss by first adding (1) $144,206 in unreported interest income from 1993 and (2) $565,202, the difference between the gross income fraudulently claimed for 1993-1995 and the gross income subsequently reported for that period in amended tax returns. The District Court then multiplied the sum by 28 percent, arriving at a total tax loss of $200,652. The District Court did not use the net income figures of the amended tax returns and thus did not count the $20,800 in additional deductions listed on one corporation\u2019s amended 1993 tax return. In addition to challenging the interest income figure, John Rhodis argues that the District Court should have taken into account the deductions reported on the amended tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">When \u201cthe amount of the tax loss [is] uncertain[,] the guidelines contemplate that the court will simply make a reasonable estimate based on the available facts.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.1, comment 1. Here, the relevant financial records were, as John Rhodis\u2019s son testified, a \u201ctotal mishmash\u201d in 1996 and \u201cstill not organized\u201d by the time of the trial. (Transcript, April 12, 2001, pp. 1484, 1608.) With regard to the unreported interest income from 1993, there was evidence that interest had been paid and testimony that no interest payments had been missed. We therefore conclude that the District Court\u2019s calculation of the unreported interest income was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2T1.1, determination of a tax loss contemplates affording the defendant the benefit of legitimate deductions. <em>United States v. Martinez-Rios, </em>143 F.3d 662, 671 (2d Cir.1998). However, the District Court in its sentencing analysis apparently did not give John Rhodis the benefit of deductions claimed on the amended 1993 return. Since the record is unclear as to whether the District Court considered the deductions illegitimate or failed to consider them at all, we vacate John Rhodis\u2019s sentence and remand so that the District Court can clarify its calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">We have considered appellant\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Court\u2019s judgment of conviction is hereby AFFIRMED and its sentence is hereby VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
