On appeal, Osorio argues that the district court abused its discretion in ordering restitution because the government was not a victim of Osorio\u2019s crime. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A), the district court has authority to order restitution for, inter alia, any violation of Title 18, which includes the section to which Osorio pled guilty, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(1) &amp; (2). Despite the fact that Osorio\u2019s cooperation agreement with the government indicated that he had \u201cno official status, implied or otherwise, as Agent or employee of DEA,\u201d the district court found that he was acting on behalf of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) because he had been acting under the DEA\u2019s direction when he falsely told the DEA that he had collected only $18,000 on behalf of a drug dealer rather than the actual amount of $85,000. The district court determined that because he had been acting as an agent of the government, it was appropriate to order restitution to the government of the $67,000 that Osorio had kept for himself. Osorio argues that because the money came from a drug dealer and not from the government, the government could not be considered a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">Whether the government qualifies as a victim of Osorio\u2019s offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(2) is a question of law which we review <em>de novo. </em>Section 3663(a)(2) defines a victim as a \u201cperson directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.... \u201d The federal and state government can be a \u201cvictim\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663. <em>United States v. Helmsley, </em>941 F.2d 71, 86 (2d Cir.1991). The district court found that before Osorio received the $85,000, he made an agreement with the DEA that he would turn over the money to the DEA. We find that the government was a victim because it was \u201charmed as a result of\u2019 Osorio\u2019s false statement regarding how much money he had received: If Osorio had told the truth, the government would have received $85,000 rather than approximately $18,000. Thus, the district court did not err in ordering restitution of the $67,000 that Osorio was able to retain as a result of his false statement to the DEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
