Pugh also appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. <em>See Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-21\">Pugh\u2019s first amended complaint alleged that a letter he sent to his brother through the prison mail system was returned by the United States Postal Service in retaliation for grievances Pugh had filed at an unspecified time. The district court properly dismissed this claim because Pugh failed to allege facts demonstrating a link between his grievances and the returned mail. <em>See Pratt v. Rowland, </em>65 F.3d 802, 807 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that prisoner must establish link between exercise of constitutional rights and allegedly retaliatory action).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-22\">The district court properly dismissed Pugh\u2019s claim that the prison interfered with his mail because Pugh\u2019s allegations were vague and conclusory. <em>See Pena v. Gardner, </em>976 F.2d 469, 471 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-23\">Pugh\u2019s claim that the prison did not process his grievance lacks merit because according to documents attached to Pugh\u2019s motion to vacate judgment, Pugh\u2019s grievance was not filed because it was untimely. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 351-53, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>(requiring prisoner to demonstrate that a non-frivolous legal claim has been frustrated or impaired).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Because Pugh failed to demonstrate any basis for relief from judgment, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion to reconsider. <em>See School Dist. No. 1J, Multnomah County v. ACandS, Inc., </em>5 F.3d 1255, 1262-63 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">We deny Pugh\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal. <em>See Wood v. Housewright, </em>900 F.2d 1332, 1335-36 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b385-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
