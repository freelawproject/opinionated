Newburn contends that the images were excludable under Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b) and 403 because they did not prove a material fact and were unfairly prejudicial. However, while Newburn registered his objection to the introduction of the images prior to trial, he chose to mention them in his own direct testimony. The Supreme Court unambiguously held in <em>Ohler v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 753, 120 S.Ct. 1851, 146 L.Ed.2d 826 (2000), that \u201ca party introducing evidence cannot complain on appeal that the evidence was erroneously admitted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 755. <em>Ohler </em>held that a defendant may not \u201cshort circuit\u201d the government\u2019s right to decide whether to use evidence against the defendant by offering the evidence himself and \u201cstill preserve its admission as a claim of error on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758. This is precisely what Newburn attempted to do in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
