In the initial decision, the administrative judge determined that Ta-mayo was not entitled to a CSRS survivor annuity because her late husband\u2019s service was pursuant to a series of excepted indefinite appointments. <em>See Casilang v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>248 F.3d 1381 (Fed.Cir.2001) (Executive Order 10,530 kept in place exclusion of nonpermanent employees from CSRA until new regulations promulgated in 1956); <em>Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>48 F.3d 514 (Fed.Cir.1995) (upholding OPM\u2019s statutory interpretation that indefinite appointments are excluded from Civil Service Reform Act coverage as reasonable and consistent with the governing statute, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-19\">Tamayo argues in her response that her case differs from <em>R\u00f3sete </em>because her late husband\u2019s employment was \u201cconverted\u201d into covered service by the 1956 CSRA. We conclude that this and Tamayo\u2019s remaining arguments fall within the holdings of <em>R\u00f3sete </em>and <em>Casilang.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-20\">Tamayo\u2019s petition seeks review of issues that were conclusively decided in <em>R\u00f3sete. </em>This court has denied suggestions for rehearing en banc in <em>R\u00f3sete </em>and in dozens of other cases that argued that <em>R\u00f3sete </em>was wrongly decided. Thus, any further attempts to argue the merits of <em>R\u00f3sete </em>are deemed frivolous and an abuse of the judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>cial process. Furthermore, if Tamayo files another document with this court and, upon review, it is determined that the arguments are frivolous, this court will consider the imposition of monetary sanctions. <em>See In re Solerwitz, </em>848 F.2d 1573, 1575 (Fed.Cir.1988) (counsel sanctioned for filing and maintaining frivolous appeals in air traffic controller cases that presented legal issues and fact patterns indistinguishable from those presented and decided in the precedents represented by the lead cases); <em>see also Pillay v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., </em>45 F.3d 14, 17 (2d Cir.1995) (appellate court has inherent authority to dismiss appeal as frivolous when appeal presents no arguably meritorious issue for consideration).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">(1) Tamayo\u2019s petition for review is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">(2) Tamayo\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">(4) If Tamayo files another document with this court and, upon review, it is determined that the arguments are frivolous, this court will consider the imposition of monetary sanctions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
