R.App. P. 34(f). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Plaintiff David Wayne Landry was denied a loan from the Farm Service Agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) because the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) characterized his site as a wetland, ineligible for the requested loans. A hearing officer reviewed and affirmed the wetland characterization. The Director of the National Appeals Division (NAD) of the USDA (the \u201cDirector\u201d) upheld the hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Plaintiff brought suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma challenging the NRCS\u2019s wetland determination and the Director\u2019s subsequent approval. <em>See Landry v. Cooper, </em>No. 97-596-S (E.D.Okla. May 4, 1998) <em>(\u201cLandry I\u201d). </em>The district court found that \u201cthe NRCS\u2019s wetland determination was supported by substantial evidence and was not otherwise arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of the agency\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. It also found, \u201c[T]he NRCS\u2019s determination that no exemption applies ... is ... supported by the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. As a result, both the NRCS determination and the Director\u2019s decision were upheld. This court affirmed. <em>Landry v. Cooper, </em>No. 98-7077, 1999 WL 136936 (10th Cir. Mar.15,1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">Plaintiff brought a second action challenging the Secretary of the USDA\u2019s failure to implement a decision of the National Appeals Staff. Plaintiff asserted that the decision, if implemented, would have allowed the USDA to issue him a loan. <em>See Landry v. Glickman, </em>No. 99-165-S (E.D.Okla. July 7, 1999) <em>{\u201cLandry II\u201d). </em>The district court found the suit barred because, in accordance with <em>Landry I, </em>the property was a wetland and the Secretary was prohibited from making loans to disturb wetlands. Plaintiffs appeal was dismissed as untimely. <em>Landry v. Glickman, </em>No. 99-7130 (10th Cir. Feb. 3, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">In October 2000 Plaintiff filed a third action asking the court to find that he was entitled to a wetland exception that would have allowed him to secure a USDA loan. <em>See Landry v. Glickman, </em>No. CIV-00-546-S (E.D.Okla. May 29, 2001) <em>{\u201cLandry III\u201d). </em>The district court dismissed the case on the basis of res judicata. The Tenth Circuit affirmed. <em>Landry v. Veneman, </em>No. 01-7121 (10th Cir. May 30, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">Plaintiff then filed the current action, <em>Landry v. Smith, </em>No. CIV-01-711-S (E.D.Okla. Apr. 11, 2002) <em>{\u201cLandry IV\u201d), </em>challenging the manner in which his loan application was processed and the Director\u2019s approval of the hearing officer\u2019s determination. Again, the district court dismissed the case on the basis of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">On appeal Plaintiff claims that the district court erred when it (1) granted Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss without first requiring an answer to be served, and (2) exercised subject matter jurisdiction despite Plaintiffs alleged failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. In his reply brief he also argues that res judicata does not apply because each action challenged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the conduct of a separate agency. He contends that Defendants\u2019 answer brief \u201cis another attempt to re-litigate it\u2019s [sic] affirmative defense of res judicata against [Plaintiffs] previously [sic] claims, thereby continuing to burden and abuse the judicial process by filing frivolous affirmative defenses. ...\u201d Aplt. Reply Br. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>County of Santa Fe v. Public Serv. Co. of N.M., </em>311 F.3d 1031, 1034 (10th Cir.2002). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">I. The Pre-Answer Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Rule 12(a) gives a federal governmental defendant 60 days in which to answer a plaintiffs complaint. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(3)(A)-(3)(B). In this case the governmental defendants never answered Plaintiffs complaint. Instead, they moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The district court granted their motion. Plaintiff asserts that Defendants defaulted when they failed to answer his complaint within the 60-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The 12(b)(6) defense may be raised in a pre-answer motion. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b). \u201cUnless a different time is fixed by court order, the service of a [12(b)(6) ] motion ... alters the[ ] period[ ] of time [for filing an answer].\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(4). \u201c[I]f the court denies the motion ..., the [answer must] be served within 10 days after notice of the court\u2019s action.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(4)(A). If the court grants the motion, as it did here, the plaintiffs action is dismissed, and an answer is no longer necessary. Thus, Defendants did not default.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">II. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Plaintiff claims that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and that therefore the court in this action, as well as the courts in the three previous actions, lacked subject matter jurisdiction. Because Plaintiff failed to raise this issue in the district court, we consider it only to the extent that it implicates jurisdiction in this case. <em>See Sac and Fox Nation v. Hanson, </em>47 F.3d 1061, 1063 (10th Cir. 1995). Whether the courts in <em>Landry I, Landry II, </em>and <em>Landry III </em>had subject matter jurisdiction, while potentially relevant to the application of the doctrine of res judicata, has no bearing on jurisdiction in this case. Accordingly, we do not address whether jurisdiction was present in Plaintiffs earlier actions. We are concerned solely with the district court\u2019s jurisdiction in <em>Landry TV.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">The district court\u2019s power to review the Director\u2019s decision derived from 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6999, which reads, \u201cA final determination of the [National Appeals] Division shall be renewable and enforceable by any United States district court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with chapter 7 of Title 5.\u201d Under this statute the district court had subject matter jurisdiction if the Director\u2019s decision was \u201cfinal.\u201d The Supreme Court has explained the finality requirement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-13\">As a general matter, two conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be final: First, the action must mark the consummation of the agency\u2019s decision-making process \u2014 it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal consequences will flow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-14\"><em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 177-78, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 137 L.Ed.2d 281 (1997) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The NAD decision at issue here explicitly states, \u201cThis concludes the administrative appeal of this case.\u201d ROA at 15. Moreover, it appears to dispose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Plaintiffs claims fully. Plaintiff does not explain in what way the NAD decision was not final or how he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. We therefore conclude that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to resolve Plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">III. Res Judicata</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Because he did not raise the issue until his reply brief, we need not address Plaintiffs argument that the elements of res judicata have not been established. <em>Stump v. Gates, </em>211 F.3d 527, 533 (10th Cir.2000). In any event, the issue was thoroughly and correctly addressed in the district court\u2019s orders in <em>Landry III </em>and <em>Landry IV.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
