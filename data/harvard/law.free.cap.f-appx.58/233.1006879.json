Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b268-12\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">In 1992, Diana Suvannunt accepted a two-year staff fellowship with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. When her fellowship was cut short in August 1993, Suvannunt sued the FDA, claiming that she had been discriminated against because of race, sex, and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">Suvannunt\u2019s allegations focused on the behavior of her supervisor, Larry Maturin, and of a laboratory co-worker, Ravinder Reddy. She claimed that Maturin had improperly placed Reddy in charge of the project on which she was working; that Maturin did not allow her (but did allow Reddy) to attend a technical training seminar; that Maturin did not meet his obligation to give her an annual performance appraisal; that Reddy sexually harassed her by touching and grabbing her arm; that Maturin took away her office keys and office telephone without justification; and that her appointment was unjustly terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>burden-shifting analysis, a plaintiff alleging Title VII discrimination needs to show that (1) she is a member of a protected group; (2) she was meeting her employer\u2019s legitimate expectations; (3) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) other employees who are not members of the protected group were treated more favorably. If the defendant can nevertheless articulate a non-discriminatory reason for the action, the plaintiff must show that reason to be pretextual. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. </em>Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973); <em>Gordon v. United Airlines, Inc., </em>246 F.3d 878, 885-86 (7th Cir.2001). Proceeding under this method, the district court analyzed each of Suvannunt\u2019s claims and concluded that she had failed to meet her burden. The court therefore granted summary judgment for the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Suvannunt now insists that the court\u2019s conclusions were incorrect and biased. She devotes her brief to reciting the numerous slights and injustices she says she suffered at the FDA, and to expressing her disagreement with the court\u2019s resolution of her claims. But general assertions of error are not enough, even for a pro se litigant. <em>See Anderson v. Hardman, </em>241 F.3d 544, 545 (7th Cir.2001). To prevail on appeal, Suvannunt needs to demonstrate that she actually did meet the requirements of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test. Her brief contains no such analysis and therefore fails to call into question the district court\u2019s conclusion. To cite just one example, Suvannunt begins her brief by listing a number of incidents that she believes contributed to a hostile work environment, but she neither addresses nor refutes the district court\u2019s conclusion that the complained-of behavior \u201ccannot be described as so severe or pervasive that it altered the conditions of [her] employment and created an abusive working environment.\u201d Each of Suvannunt\u2019s other assertions of error similarly fails to present a meaningful argument. Finding no obvious error in the district court\u2019s order, we AFFIRM the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
