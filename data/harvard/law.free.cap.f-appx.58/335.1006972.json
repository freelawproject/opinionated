We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recount them in detail except as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u201c[A] trial court has the discretion to deny a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate a default judgment if (1) the plaintiff would be prejudiced if the judgment is set aside, (2) defendant has no meritorious defense, or (3) the defendant\u2019s culpable conduct led to the default. This tripartite test is disjunctive.\u201d <em>Hammer v. Drago (In re Hammer), </em>940 F.2d 524, 525-26 (9th Cir.1991) (internal citations omitted). This means that the district court may deny the motion if any one of the three factors is true. <em>American Ass\u2019n of Naturopathic Physicians v. Hayhurst, </em>227 F.3d 1104, 1108 (9th Cir.2000). The burden is on the movants to show that these circumstances are met. <em>TCI Group Life Ins. Plan v. Knoebber, </em>244 F.3d 691, 696 (9th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Cassidy v. Tenorio, </em>856 F.2d 1412, 1415 (9th Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion or clearly err in ruling that appellants\u2019 conduct was culpable and that they were therefore not entitled to relief under Rules 55(c) and 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Gleichman failed to comply with the court orders to arrange for new counsel or proceed pro se. Gleichman even failed to appear at a hearing on the plaintiffs motion to strike the defendants\u2019 answer that was conducted <em>after </em>she finally (and improperly) sent an ex parte letter to the judge stating that she would henceforth represent herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Likewise, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that appellants failed to establish a meritorious defense. In her declaration accompanying her motion to set aside default/default judgment, Gleichman states only the following: \u201cI believe I have a meritorious defense to this lawsuit, as previously set forth in my answer to the complaint filed with the Court, and I want to proceed so that this matter can be decided on the merits.\u201d Although Gleichman\u2019s reply to the motion contains a bit more elaboration, it, too, was insufficient. It consisted of legal conclusions devoid of factual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">We grant appellee\u2019s request for its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in connection with this appeal. The determination of an appropriate amount of fees on appeal is referred to the court\u2019s special master, Appellate Commissioner Peter L. Shaw, who shall conduct whatever proceedings he deems appropriate, and who shall have authority to enter an order awarding fees. <em>See </em>9th Cir. R. 39-1.9. The order is subject to reconsideration by this panel. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b369-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
