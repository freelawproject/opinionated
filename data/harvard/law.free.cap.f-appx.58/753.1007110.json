We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-21\">Alcocer contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdicts, because there was no proof that the handgun he used was operable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s ruling de novo, <em>Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 484 (9th Cir.2000), and conclude that this contention lacks merit. Based on the victim\u2019s testimony, a reasonable fact finder could have concluded that the firearm was loaded and that Alcocer expected it to fire. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 324, 326, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (articulating standard for evaluating sufficiency of the evidence for habeas review, and rejecting requirement that prosecution disprove all contrary theories). The state courts\u2019 conclusions were neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson, </em>and the district court properly denied the petition. <em>See Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 123 S.Ct. 357, 361, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b787-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-24\">. The state points out that the only aspect of operability Alcocer presented to the California Supreme Court was whether the firearm was loaded. We are permitted, however, to reject petitioner\u2019s unexhausted claim on the merits. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
