We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Sprague, </em>135 F.3d 1301, 1304 (9th Cir.1998), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Guideline Amendment 591, concerning the selection of offense gmdelines, does not provide grounds for modifying Savage\u2019s sentence because the district court\u2019s original sentencmg fully complied with that Amendment. GMdeline Amendment 599, concerning the application of specific offense characteristics when a weapon was used, also does not provide grounds for modifying Savage\u2019s sentence, because Savage was sentenced as a career offender, and thus his total offense level would have been 34 whether or not the enhancement at issue was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The district court\u2019s demal of Savage\u2019s motion was therefore correct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (allowing modification when a sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d); <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>98 F.3d 510, 513 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam) (affirmmg the demal of a motion to modify when the amendment at issue had no effect on the defendant\u2019s sentencing range).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b761-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
