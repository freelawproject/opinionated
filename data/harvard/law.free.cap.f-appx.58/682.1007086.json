We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress and for clear error its factual findings. <em>United States v. Summers, </em>268 F.3d 683, 686 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">Contrary to Burks\u2019 contention, the district court\u2019s factual findings were not clearly erroneous because they were consistent with the testimony of Officer Johnson. <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>291 F.3d 1091, 1100 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The district court properly concluded that the officers did not seize Burks in violation of the Fourth Amendment because a reasonable person in Burks\u2019 position would have believed he was free to leave. <em>See Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (holding a seizure does not occur where a police officer approaches an individual and asks a few questions without any indicia of force or aggression); <em>Summers, </em>268 F.3d at 686-87 (holding that no investigatory stop occurred when police partially blocked the suspect\u2019s car and asked several times for, identification because the suspect could have left on foot).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-19\">We deny all pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b717-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
