We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of Dowdle\u2019s habeas petition, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, <em>See Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-25\">Dowdle contends that his \u00a7 2254 petition was filed within the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\u2019s (AEDPA) one-year limitation period based on the date he diligently acquired the predicate facts necessary to support his petition. We conclude that the district court\u2019s factual findings concerning the \u201ctrigger date\u201d for the running of the statute of limitations were not clearly erroneous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) (commencing one-year time limit on \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence\u201d); <em>Hasan v. Galaza, </em>254 F.3d 1150, 1154 n. 3 (9th Cir. 2001) (stating the statute of limitations begins to run when the prisoner knows the important facts, not when the prisoner recognizes their legal significance). For this reason, based on the facts contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>record, an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Dowdle\u2019s petition as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b799-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
