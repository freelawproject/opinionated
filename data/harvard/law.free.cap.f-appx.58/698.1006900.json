The Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals (\u201cIRS\u201d) approved a levy against Appellant for unpaid taxes. Appellant sought review of this administrative determination in federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-10\">The district court gave two independent justifications for its decision to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. First, the district court found that it lacked jurisdiction pursuant to the statutory scheme. Second, the district court found that the United States did not waive sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">On appeal, Appellant focuses primarily on the merits of his claim rather than the jurisdictional question. Appellant\u2019s arguments lack merit because they are either improper at this stage of the proceedings or frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">STANDARD <em>OF </em>REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is subject to de novo review. <em>See McGraw v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 997, 1001 (9th Cir.2002). The court\u2019s factual findings relevant to its determination of subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Peninsula Communications, </em>287 F.3d 832, 836 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b733-17\">While Appellant raises a number of arguments on the merits of his case, the only real issue before this court is whether the district court properly dismissed the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, it properly refrained from deciding the merits and dismissed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-18\">Appellant alleges that the district court had federal question jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. He asserts that the federal question arises under 1) 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.102, which provides that employment taxes are not within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court, and 2) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), which sets forth procedures and jurisdiction for judicial review following a tax levy hearing. These procedures include judicial review of the determination:</p>\n<p id=\"b733-19\">The person [against whom the tax levy determination has been made] may, within 30 days of a determination under this section, appeal such determination\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-20\">(A) to the Tax Court (and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-21\">(B) if the Tax Court does not have jurisdiction of the underlying tax liability, to a district court of the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>If a court determines that the appeal was to an incorrect court, a person shall have 30 days after the court determination to file such appeal with the correct court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Thus, if the Tax Court has jurisdiction with respect to the underlying subject matter, the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction over an action seeking judicial review of a tax levy determination following a hearing. When the underlying taxes are income taxes, the Tax Court has such exclusive jurisdiction. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.102(b)(1)\u00a9.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Appellant asserted that the underlying tax liability involved employment taxes. There is no evidence that suggests that the Appellant is liable for employment taxes. The district court found Appellant\u2019s assertion \u201cfrivolous and without merit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertion, the district court found that the underlying tax liability concerned unpaid income taxes. The district court based its finding on several pieces of evidence that demonstrated the unpaid taxes were income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">Finding that the underlying taxes were income taxes, the district court applied 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1) and dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The district corut also referred to a decision of another court that came to an identical conclusion in a similar case. <em>True v. Commissioner, </em>108 F.Supp.2d 1361 (M.D.Fla.2000) (district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a Section 6330 appeal involving income tax as opposed to employment tax).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">Because the underlying taxes are income taxes, the Tax Court has exclusive jurisdiction. Therefore, the district court properly dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
