We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, we review de novo, <em>Wildman v. Johnson, </em>261 F.3d 832, 836 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-26\">Aranda contends that he was improperly induced to plead guilty because the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>judge coerced him and failed to inform him of relevant law. Considering the totality of circumstances, including the substantially reduced sentence offered in exchange for the guilty plea, and Aranda\u2019s statements in open court indicating his understanding of the consequences of his plea, we conclude that the plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>See Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 749, 751, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Aranda also contends that his trial counsel coerced him and failed to inform him of relevant law, and was therefore ineffective. The record shows that the alleged coercion Aranda complains of was merely advice. <em>Cf. Iaea v. Sunn, </em>800 F.2d 861, 867 (9th Cir.1986). We have considered Aranda\u2019s remaining claims of deficient performance and conclude they are without merit. Moreover, Aranda fails to show prejudice, because he has not shown that, but for his counsel\u2019s conduct, he would have opted for a trial and risked a sentence three to four times greater than the one he received. <em>See Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58-59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b801-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
