Khalil appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order affirming the denial of disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. In his January and April 1999 applications and subsequent documents, Khalil alleged disability since October 1998 from pain and medication side effects related to Hepatitis C, stomach problems, and fatigue. After an August 2000 hearing, where a medical expert and a vocational expert (VE) testified, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Khalil\u2019s history of kidney stones, hernia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, diverticulum, Hepatitis C, and major depressive disorder with anxious features precluded him from performing his past relevant work, but also determined that he could perform jobs the VE had identified in response to a hypothetical the ALJ posed, which took into account Khalil\u2019s limited English skills. We conclude the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and affirm. <em>See Mittlestedt v. Apfel, </em>204 F.3d 847, 850-51 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">First, the ALJ did not err by discounting the opinion of Khalil\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Wahlid Mikhail, that Khalil could not work. Dr. Mikhail, who was not treating Khalil for Hepatitis C and who was not a psychiatrist, had treated Khalil for only a brief time and he was the only physician who opined that Khalil was permanently disabled or who recommended restrictions precluding all work. <em>See Prosch v. Apfel, </em>201 F.3d 1010, 1012-13 (8th Cir.2000) (noting that social security \u201cregulations provide that a treating physician\u2019s opinion regarding an applicant\u2019s impairment will be granted \u2018controlling weight,\u2019 provided the opinion is \u2018well-supported by medically acceptable ... diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] record.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">Second, the ALJ\u2019s determinations that Khalil\u2019s depression was not disabling and that a psychological consultative examination was not required were proper. Khalil and Dr. Mikhail associated Khalil\u2019s depression with medication that he was no longer taking. Khalil further associated his depression with abdominal pain that reportedly was controlled by medication. In addition, Khalil did not seek treatment from a mental health professional until July 2000 and he first alleged disabling depression at the August 2000 hearing. <em>See Naber v. Shalala, </em>22 F.3d 186, 189 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[A]n ALJ is permitted to issue a decision without obtaining additional medical evidence so long as other evidence in the record provides a sufficient basis for the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(4) (1993))); <em>cf. Smith v. Shalala, </em>987 F.2d 1371, 1375 (8th Cir.1993) (concluding that ALJ properly discounted psychiatrist\u2019s opinion in part because claimant had not alleged disabling mental impairment in benefits application and had not previously sought or been referred for mental health treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">Third, the ALJ gave multiple, valid reasons for finding that Khalil was not credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ble. \u201cWhere adequately explained and supported, credibility findings are for the ALJ to make\u201d and we will not disturb them on review. <em>Lowe v. Apfel, </em>226 F.3d 969, 972 (8th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Tang v. Apfel, </em>205 F.3d 1084, 1087 (8th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Finally, we decline to consider Khalil\u2019s new argument about his limited English skills. <em>See Misner v. Chater, </em>79 F.3d 745, 746 (8th Cir.1996) (noting that arguments raised for first time on appeal will not be considered unless appellant can show manifest injustice would result). Nor will we consider the new records Khalil attached to his brief and we therefore deny his motion to supplement the record. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2000); <em>Delrosa v. Sullivan, </em>922 F.2d 480, 483-84 (8th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Accordingly, while there is some evidence in the record to support Khalil\u2019s claim, <em>see Baker v. Heckler, </em>730 F.2d 1147, 1150 (8th Cir.1984) (\u201cAn administrative decision is not subject to reversal merely because substantial evidence would have supported an opposite conclusion.\u201d), we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-11\">.

Mason, late a United States Magistrate Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
