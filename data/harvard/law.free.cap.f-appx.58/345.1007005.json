United States, </em>529 U.S. 753, 760, 120 S.Ct. 1851, 146 L.Ed.2d 826 (2000) (\u201ca defendant who preemptively introduces evidence of a prior conviction on direct examination may not on appeal claim that the admission of such evidence was error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-26\">Moreover, even if Barron did not waive the issue and we were to assume that the district court erred by permitting the gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>eminent to cross-examine Barron about the conviction, any error was undoubtedly harmless. The focus on the prior conviction was minimal, and the government made no reference to it in closing argument. <em>See United States v. HernandezMiranda, </em>601 F.2d 1104, 1109 n. 10 (9th Cir.1979) (\u201cThe extent to which the Government relies upon the inadmissible prior offense evidence is a factor which can be considered in deciding whether reversible error resulted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The money laundering jury instruction, read as a whole, did not conflict with the indictment or relieve the prosecution of its burden of establishing that the proceeds were derived from the manufacture and sale of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Barron\u2019s motion for a mistrial as a result of juror misconduct. The judge questioned each juror about the improper discussions and concluded that the incident did not rise to the level of misconduct that would warrant a mistrial. The trial judge is in the best position to determine whether the misconduct was prejudicial, <em>United States v. Klee, </em>494 F.2d 394, 396 (9th Cir.1974), and nothing in the record compels reversal of the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b379-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
