We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After de novo review, <em>Gregory v. Widnall, </em>153 F.3d 1071, 1074 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-22\">The gravamen of Ardalan\u2019s action is that she has learned that the defendants engaged in a pattern of fraudulent conduct designed to defeat her earlier employment discrimination action, <em>Ardalan v. Caldera, </em>No. CV-99-20465-JW (N.D.Cal.), <em>aff'd, </em>24 Fed.Appx. 827 (9th Cir.2001) <em>(\u201cArdalan </em>/\u201d). The district court properly dismissed Ardalan\u2019s action on res judicata grounds because all of the claims alleged therein had either been fully and fairly litigated in her prior district court action, or could have been litigated in that action. <em>See In re Imperial Corp. of Am., </em>92 F.3d 1503, 1506 (9th Cir.1996). In addition, Ardalan failed to demonstrate that the defendants fraudulently concealed any of the allegedly newly discovered evidence from her. <em>See Costantini v. Trans World Airlines, </em>681 F.2d 1199, 1202-03 <em>&amp; </em>n. 12 (9th Cir.1982). Finally, contrary to Ardalan\u2019s contention, in dismissing <em>Ardalan I, </em>the district court considered the merits of that action, including her allegations of obstruction of justice by the defendants. <em>See In re Imperial Corp., </em>92 F.3d at 1506.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ardalan leave to amend because amendment would be futile. <em>See Ashelman v. Pope, </em>793 F.2d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir.1986) (en banc). Ardalan\u2019s contention that the district court did not review her pleadings prior to dismissing her action is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b384-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
