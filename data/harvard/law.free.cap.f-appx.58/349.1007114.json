We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-22\">In contrast to Soliai\u2019s assertion, the district never stated during the plea colloquy that it would base Soliai\u2019s sentence on the overall weight of the mixture rather than on the weight of methamphetamine (actual) within the mixture. At the colloquy, the district court stated merely that it interpreted the indictment as charging possession of a methamphetamine mixture under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) instead of charging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>possession of methamphetamine (actual) under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). The district court\u2019s purpose in identifying the appropriate charge at the colloquy was to determine the relevant statutory minimum sentence, which is ten years for \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) but only five years for \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), not to establish any parameters for determining Soliai\u2019s base guideline level.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">We also reject Soliai\u2019s argument that his base guideline level must be determined according to the overall weight of the mixture. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Note (B); <em>United States v. Bressette, </em>947 F.2d 1361, 1362 (9th Cir.1991). Thus, the district court did not err in determining Soliai\u2019s base offense level according to the weight of methamphetamine (actual) rather than the weight of the mixture.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b383-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
