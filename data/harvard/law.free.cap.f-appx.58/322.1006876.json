Meskill, Senior Circuit Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Gregorio Robles-Ponce appeals from a judgment of conviction for violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952 and \u00a7 960, entered after a conditional guilty plea reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress marijuana discovered in a border search of his 1989 Ford van at the Calexico Port of Entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">At the hearing on Robles-Ponce\u2019s suppression motion, no testimony was taken. The District Court ruled that, assuming all of the Defendant\u2019s allegations of intrusiveness to be true, the non-routine border search doctrine requiring reasonable suspicion did not apply to the search of Robles-Ponce\u2019s vehicle because it applied only to searches of a person\u2019s body. Without making any factual findings concerning the degree of intrusiveness the search posed or the existence of reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a non-routine search, the District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">Robles-Ponce claims that <em>United States v. Molina-Tarazon, </em>279 F.3d 709 (9th Cir. 2002), decided shortly after his conviction, requires that we reverse the District Court and suppress the evidence. <em>Molinar-Tarazon </em>involved a border search of a motor vehicle and held that non-routine border searches can apply to \u201csome searches of inanimate objects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713. The Court acknowledged that the critical factor in determining whether a border search was routine or non-routine was the degree of intrusiveness the searched posed, and provided a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered in making that determination. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">The government\u2019s attempts to distinguish <em>Molina-Tarazon </em>or diminish its impact are unpersuasive. Robles-Ponce\u2019s claim that the evidence must be suppressed is, at best, premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-18\">We vacate the judgment and remand to the District Court for farther proceedings in light of <em>United States v. Molinar-Tarazon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b357-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
