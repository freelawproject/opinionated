California, </em>386 U. S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Randall\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no arguable issues for review, and a motion to withdraw as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>counsel of record. Randall has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In the plea agreement, Randall waived his right to appeal the conviction and sentence. Having independently reviewed the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, 488 </em>U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we are satisfied that the plea agreement, including the waiver of the right to appeal, was entered knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Aguilar-Muniz, </em>156 F.3d 974, 976 (9th Cir.1998). We therefore enforce the waiver, grant the motion to withdraw, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b756-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
