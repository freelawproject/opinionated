We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Badgett\u2019s claim that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated by Oregon\u2019s Ballot Measure 11 as unexhausted and procedurally defaulted. <em>See O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 845, 119 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999) (holding that to comply with the exhaustion doctrine a petitioner must complete \u201cone full round\u201d of the state\u2019s appellate process); <em>Reese v. Baldwin, </em>282 F.3d 1184, 1190 (9th Cir. 2002) (concluding that habeas claims that were not fairly presented to the Oregon courts on direct appeal were procedurally defaulted).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Judge Kleinfeld concurs in the judgment but would affirm on the merits. <em>See Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1069-70 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that \u201cMeasure 11, as applied to [juvenile petitioner], does not violate ... the protection against cruel and unusual punishment of the Eighth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b718-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-17\">. All other issues presented by Badgett in this appeal are beyond the scope of the certificate of appealability (\"COA\u201d), and we do not consider them. <em>See United States v. Christakis, </em>238 F.3d 1164, 1168 n. 5 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that because petitioner failed to file motion for broader certification under Circuit Rule 22-1 (d), the appeal was confined to the sole issue within the original COA).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
