Weast entered a guilty plea to both counts, under <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), and was sentenced to thirty-two months incarceration. Weast\u2019s counsel has filed an appeal under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Weast has filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">First, Weast argues the district court erred in denying him an offense level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. We review a district court\u2019s determination of whether a defendant is entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. Ruhe, 191 </em>F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999). Weast\u2019s claim is meritless. Weast entered a late guilty plea and denied liability for conduct related to his offenses. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.l(h), n. 6) (2000); <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1005 (4th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>31 F.3d 1304, 1315 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>882 F.2d 902, 905-06 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-17\">Second, Weast argues the district court erred in failing to grant him a downward departure for providing substantial assistance to the Government. We review this claim for clear error. <em>United States v. Conner, 930 </em>F.2d 1073, 1076-77 (4th Cir. 1991). Weast\u2019s claim is meritless. Weast cannot establish that at sentencing he had provided substantial assistance to the Government sufficient to warrant a downward departure, or that there was a basis for departure absent the Government\u2019s USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. USSG \u00a7 5K1.1; USSG \u00a7 5K1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 184-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Francois, </em>889 F.2d 1341, 1343-45 (4th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-18\">Third, Weast alleges he was subjected to prosecutorial misconduct. These claims are meritless. Weast cannot establish the Government erred by failing to move for a downward departure. USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. Additionally, Weast cannot establish his statements to the police were altered, or that his criminal history calculation ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>versely effected his sentence. USSG \u00a7 4A1.1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Fourth, Weast claims his sentence violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We review this claim for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). This claim is meritless. Weast\u2019s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum, and consequently, he cannot establish his sentence is erroneous. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472 (2000); USSG \u00a7 2B5.1(b); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 201 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393,149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Fifth, Weast claims his trial counsel was ineffective. The record does not clearly establish Weast\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective, and consequently, this claim must be raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1096, 120 S.Ct. 837, 145 L.Ed.2d 704 (2000); <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the Weast\u2019s convictions and sentence. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. We deny counsel\u2019s pending motion to withdraw from the case. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
