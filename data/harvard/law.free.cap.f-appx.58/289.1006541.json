Wallace appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissal of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">An employer may be liable for the sex discrimination committed by a supervising employee. <em>See Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998). But an employer may assert an affirmative defense in some circumstances. <em>Id. </em>The affirmative defense is available so long as no \u201ctangible employment action\u201d was taken against the employee. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">There was none here. Wallace claims that she was \u201cconstructively discharged\u201d because she felt compelled to resign due to the County\u2019s alleged refusal to transfer her to a different job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An employee is constructively discharged if \u201ca reasonable person in [the employee\u2019s] position would have felt that [the employee] was forced to quit because of intolerable and discriminatory working conditions.\u201d <em>Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co., </em>25 F.3d 1459, 1465 (9th Cir.1994) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The conditions causing the constructive discharge are measured at the time of the employee\u2019s departure. <em>See id.; see also Montero, </em>192 F.3d at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">At the time Wallace left the County, she knew that the County had responded promptly and vigorously to her complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And the County told Wallace that she could seek a transfer to another position under a new supervisor, an option that Wallace did not pursue. Given these circumstances, no reasonable person would have felt compelled to quit. <em>See Montero, </em>192 F.3d at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">Because Wallace was not constructively discharged, there was no tangible employment action. The County may therefore assert the affirmative defense articulated in <em>Faragher. </em>The <em>Faragher </em>defense re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>quires (1) that the employer exercise reasonable care to prevent and promptly correct sex harassment and (2) that the \u201cplaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\u201d <em>Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 807. The County meets the first requirement of <em>Faragher </em>because it had in place a sex harassment policy and promptly initiated a thorough investigation when Wallace filed her complaint. <em>See Montero, </em>192 F.3d at 862-63. And because Wallace did not complain about her supervisor\u2019s behavior for nearly two years, failed to participate in the investigation of her allegations, and did not pursue the option of transferring to another position, the second element of the <em>Faragher </em>defense is satisfied. <em>See id. </em>at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The District Court correctly held that the <em>Faragher </em>affirmative defense shields the County from liability in this case and properly granted summary judgment to the County on Wallace\u2019s sex discrimination claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The District Court\u2019s dismissal of Wallace\u2019s retaliation claims was also proper. To prove a claim for retaliation, \u201ca plaintiff must show (1) involvement in a protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action and (3) a causal link between the two.\u201d <em>Brooks v. City of San Mateo, </em>229 F.3d 917, 928 (9th Cir.2000). Wallace was not constructively discharged, as discussed above, and did not suffer any other \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b324-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\">. Whether \"constructive discharge\u201d constitutes a \"tangible employment action,\u201d and therefore ruins the affirmative defense, is an open question in the Ninth Circuit. <em>See Montero v. Agco Corp., </em>192 F.3d 856, 861 (9th Cir.1999). We do not resolve this question, though, because Wallace was not constructively discharged. <em>See id. </em>(acknowledging the open question but allowing the affirmative defense because the plaintiff was not constructively discharged).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b324-15\">. The district court properly disregarded Wallace's declaration opposing the County's motion for summaiy judgment to the effect that she had reported the harassing behavior long before the investigation took place, because these statements contradicted her prior deposition testimony. <em>See Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co., </em>952 F.2d 262, 267 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\">. Wallace briefly argues that because the County raised the <em>Faragher </em>defense for the first time when moving for summary judgment the affirmative defense should have not been available. Because Wallace \"has not argued that [she] suffered prejudice due to [the County's] tardy assertion of this defense, the [Faragher] defense is not waived.\u201d <em>Paine v. City of Lompoc, </em>265 F.3d 975, 981 n. 1 (9th Cir.2001); <em>see also Camarillo v. McCarthy, </em>998 F.2d 638, 639 (9th Cir.1993). Also, Wallace failed to object below to the County's assertion of the <em>Faragher </em>defense. We normally do not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Peterson v. Highland Music, Inc., </em>140 F.3d 1313, 1321 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
