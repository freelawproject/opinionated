The facts and proceedings are familiar to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">A determination of whether the discretionary function exception to the FTCA applies is reviewed de novo. <em>See McGraw v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 997, 1001 (9th Cir.2002), <em>amended by </em>298 F.3d 754 (9th Cir.2002). The court\u2019s factual findings relevant to its determination of subject matter jurisdiction are reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Peninsula Communications, Inc., </em>287 F.3d 832, 836 (9th Cir.2002). All uncontroverted factual assertions regarding jurisdiction are taken as true, while all contested assertions must be construed in favor of the plaintiff. <em>See McGraw, </em>281 F.3d at 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">To consider whether the action taken by the San Carlos Irrigation Project District \u2014 or not taken, as is the case here \u2014 is a matter of choice, the court must look to the regulations governing Native American electric power utilities, 25 C.F.R. Part 175 \u00a7\u00a7 175.1 to 175.62 (1997). These regulations state that a utility shall \u201c[cjonstruct and operate facilities in accordance with accepted industry practice.\u201d 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 175.24(b). Although \u201caccepted industry practice\u201d is not defined in the regulations, \u00a7 175.24(b) places a specific, mandatory obligation on the government. The definition of accepted industry practice can be easily ascertained by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Plaintiffs have submitted an affidavit from engineer Robert E. Witter that the accepted industry practice requires \u201cplac[ing] warning markers at the site of any aircraft strike.\u201d The government, which bears the burden of proof that the discretionary function applies, has neither disputed this affidavit nor offered any evidence at all. As all uncontroverted factual assertions regarding jurisdiction must be taken as true, the district court must assume, on the current record, that accepted industry practice is as plaintiffs maintain. The application of the discretionary function exception at this stage is unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">As the government failed to meet its burden under 12(b)(1), the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction was erroneous. The grant of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is REVERSED and REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
