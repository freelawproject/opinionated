The government\u2019s statements regarding other individuals and a larger smuggling organization were based upon reasonable inferences from the evidence introduced at trial from both parties. <em>United, States v. Ramirez-Lopez, </em>315 F.3d 1143, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Moreover, even if we were to assume it was improper, it was not \u201cplain\u201d error. The cases relied on by Calvillo-Reyes involve the presentation of <em>expert testimony </em>on the structure of <em>drug trafficking organizations; </em><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> no case has yet applied this rationale to the alien-smuggling context, nor has any case suggested that the prosecution cannot allude to a larger organization in closing argument if the evidence supports such an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">We also cannot say that the government\u2019s argument prejudiced CalvilloReyes. Nothing about the government\u2019s argument contradicted Calvillo-Reyes\u2019s theory of defense (that he was an unknowing pawn who had been duped by his female passenger); the jury heard Calvillo-Reyes\u2019s explanation and obviously rejected it. There was also substantial circumstantial evidence of Calvillo-Reyes\u2019s guilt, including the numerous lies he offered to officials at the port of entry, the implausibilty of much of his testimony, and the extreme unlikelihood a driver of a vehicle with a three-gallon gas tank, reeking of gas fumes, would not know that the vehicle had been altered. Any error did not affect Calvillo-Reyes\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Johnson v.
