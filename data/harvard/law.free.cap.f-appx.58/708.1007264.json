Hardiman contends that the statute of limitations should have been statutorily and/or equitably tolled to render his petition timely under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b743-20\">In June 1991, Hardiman was convicted in Los Angeles County of one count of first-degree murder with personal use of a firearm and two counts of attempted murder. He was sentenced on July 19, 1991, to twenty-five years to life in state prison, plus two consecutive terms of twenty-five years to life. Hardimaris convictions were affirmed by the California Court of Appeal on February 3, 1994, and his petition for review before the California Supreme Court was denied on June 1,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-21\">Almost two years later, commencing on April 30, 1996, Hardiman filed a series of three mandamus petitions in the California state courts. Hardiman was seeking a court order requiring his trial counsel to turn over his case file and any other materials pertaining to his case. Hardiman\u2019s final petition for mandamus, before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>California Supreme Court, was denied on March 26,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">On April 18, 1997, Hardiman signed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a habeas petition to be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. That petition was denied on May 9, 1997, and Hardiman\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied on June 10, 1997. Approximately one year and eight months later, on February 5,1999, Hardiman filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the California Court of Appeal. The appellate court denied Hardiman\u2019s petition on February 5, 1999, holding that Hardiman had no explanation for the lengthy delay in filing the petition and that the petition lacked merit in any case. On June 14, 1999, Hardiman filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the California Supreme Court, which was denied on October 27,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Hardiman signed his initial petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the federal district court on March 26, 2000, but the petition was not filed until September 25, 2000. Hardiman\u2019s first amended petition was also signed on March 26, 2000, but was not filed until September 26, 2000. Respondent moved to dismiss the first amended petition on December 27, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">On April 27, 2001, Magistrate Judge James McMahon filed a report and recommendation (\u201cR&amp;R\u201d) that the district court grant the motion to dismiss Hardiman\u2019s petition as untimely. Hardiman filed his objections to the R&amp;R on May 23, 2001. The district court filed an order adopting the R&amp;R on June 18, 2001, and entered judgment dismissing Hardiman\u2019s petition on June 20, 2001. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-13\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">Hardiman\u2019s claim of timeliness founders principally on one central point: the unavailability of statutory tolling during the period in which his mandamus petitions were pending in the California courts. Petitions for writ of mandate do not toll the limitations period because they are not \u201capplication^] for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claims\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2244(d)(2). <em>Hardiman v. Galaza, </em>Civil No. CV 00-10294-LGB, opinion at 6 (C.D.Cal. Apr. 27, 2001) (citing <em>Sorce v. Artuz, </em>73 F.Supp.2d 292, 297 (E.D.N.Y.1999)) (hereinafter \u201cDist. Ct. Op.\u201d). We agree. <em>See also Moore v. Cain, </em>298 F.3d 361, 367 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Hodge v. Greiner, </em>269 F.3d 104, 107 (2d Cir.2001).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">The magistrate judge calculated that Hardiman\u2019s limitations period ran, untolled, from April 24, 1996,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> through April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>18, 1997, the date on which Hardiman signed his petition for habeas corpus to be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court: a period of 359 days, six days short of the one-year limitation period. Even if we agree that Hardiman was entitled to tolling of the entire period between April 18, 1997, and October 27, 1999, while Hardiman\u2019s habeas petitions were pending in the California courts, Hardiman would have had only through November 2, 1999, to file his federal habeas petition. However, Hardiman did not file his federal petition until, at the earliest, March 26, 2000<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014approximately five months too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Hardiman\u2019s claim of equitable tolling is also unavailing. Equitable tolling of the filing deadline for a habeas petition is available \u201conly if extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.\u201d <em>Lott v. Mueller, </em>304 F.3d 918, 922 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1107 (9th Cir.1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The burden of demonstrating extraordinary circumstances lies with the petitioner. <em>See United States v. Marolf, </em>173 F.3d 1213, 1218 n. 3 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Hardiman argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling under <em>Whalem/Hunt v. Early, </em>233 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc). In <em>Whalem/Hunt, </em>this Court held that the unavailability of a copy of AEDPA in the prison law library where the petitioner was incarcerated could constitute either (1) an \u201cimpediment\u201d to the petitioner\u2019s filing of a habeas petition, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(B), or (2) grounds for equitable tolling of the one-year limitation period. <em>Id. </em>at 1148. In his own declaration, however, Hardiman stated that he had knowledge of the \u201cnewly amended procedural rules governing the AEDPA\u201d at least as of March 1999. Thus, even if we were to credit Hardiman\u2019s claim that he was ignorant of AEDPA until March 1999, and that the prison libraries lacked copies of AEDPA until that time, this still leaves an additional delay of approximately one year between the date Hardiman had gained access to a copy of AEDPA and the date he signed his habeas petition. Moreover, if Hardiman did in fact learn of the AEDPA rules in March 1999, there should have been no impediment to filing his federal petition in the six days he had remaining on the limitations period between October 27 and November 2, 1999. Even taking Hardiman entirely at his word, the period between November 2, 1999 and March 26, 2000 is unaccounted for, and cannot be tolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">Hardiman is ineligible for either statutory or equitable tolling of the period during which his mandamus petitions were pending in state court. Moreover, even if the prison law libraries were in fact deficient in the manner Hardiman describes, they do not establish his entitlement to equitable tolling for a period sufficient to render his federal habeas petition timely. Accordingly, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b743-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">. Hardiman was acting pro se before the district court. Because he was in prison, the \u201cprison mailbox rule\u201d applies to the calculation of the date on which his petition was filed. <em>Hardiman v. Galaza, </em>Civil No. CV 00-10294-LGB, opinion at 6 (C.D.Cal. Apr. 27, 2001) (citing <em>Saffold v. Newland, </em>224 F.3d 1087, 1091 (9th Cir.2000)); <em>see also Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 270-71, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Although the docket reflects that the petition was filed on May 5, 1997, in light of the prison mailbox rule we will deem the petition \u201cfiled\u201d as early as the date on which it was signed, April 18, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b744-10\">. The <em>Hodge </em>court pointed out that a prisoner always has the option of filing a habeas petition in a timely manner and then seeking additional discovery or documentation. Should the additional information provide grounds for additional claims, the petitioner may always seek to amend the petition. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) (leave to amend pleading \"shall be freely given when justice so requires\u201d); <em>Bonin v. Calderon, </em>59 F.3d 815, 845 (9th Cir.1995) (noting that district court\u2019s \"denial of a motion for leave to amend pursuant to Rule 15(a) is reviewed for abuse of discretion and in light of the strong public policy permitting amendment\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b744-19\">. A petitioner's one-year limitation period is deemed to run one year from AEDPA\u2019s effective date of April 24, 1996. <em>Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct. (Beeler), </em>128 F.3d 1283, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>1287 (9th Cir.1997), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Calderon v. United States Dist. Ct. (Kelly), </em>163 F.3d 530 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b745-14\">. As the magistrate judge noted, there was no explanation in the record for the six-month gap between the date Hardiman signed his petition and the date it was deemed filed in the district court. Dist. Ct. Op. at 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
