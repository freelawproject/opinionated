An administrative law judge denied benefits, concluding that Drea was not disabled because his daily \u201cactivities [were] consistent with an individual capable of performing medium work activities.\u201d After the Social Security Administration\u2019s Appeals Council denied review, Drea sought review in the district court, which affirmed, finding that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision. We agree that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">For more than 34 years, Drea, who is now 63 years old, worked for the Chrysler Corporation performing medium level, semi-skilled work. Drea retired in October 1993, more than one year after being diagnosed with colon cancer, because he was \u201c[j]ust too tire[d].\u201d The only mention of fatigue in the record prior to Drea\u2019s retirement appears in March 1993 when he complained to his treating physician that he was tired. At his next checkup, however, he informed his doctor that he had \u201c[n]o complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-15\">Drea did not stay retired long. During the summers of 1995, 1996, and 1997, he earned extra money employed as a seasonal fork truck driver for a canning company. His duties required him to stand for an hour, walk for an hour, sit for six hours, and lift up to fifty pounds. When he was working at the canning company, he worked forty-hour work weeks for about four months. Drea has not worked since his seasonal position ended in September 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">After moving to Cazenovia, Wisconsin, in 1996, Drea began seeing a general practitioner Dr. Thomas Richardson, and in December 1996 told Richardson that he was feeling fatigued. Subsequent tests revealed that Drea\u2019s liver function levels were slightly elevated. Drea\u2019s next visit to Dr. Richardson occurred in November 1998 (in connection with Drea\u2019s application for disability benefits), and blood work again revealed elevated liver function and glucose levels. Although noting that Drea was \u201cbasically healthy\u201d despite possible fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>tigue, Dr. Richardson expressed concern that Drea may have hemochromatosis (a disorder where the body absorbs too much iron) and a carbohydrate intolerance. Dr. Richardson referred Drea to Dr. Russell Jacoby, a gastroenterologist, for further testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">A Rest Questionnaire submitted by the patient from Dr. Richardson\u2019s office in November 1998 (again in connection with Drea\u2019s application) suggested that Drea\u2019s fatigue significantly limited his ability to move and lift. According to Dr. Richardson, Drea could not climb, crouch, stoop, or crawl, but he could occasionally kneel and balance. Further, Dr. Richardson stated that Drea could lift twenty pounds only occasionally and five pounds frequently and could walk or stand only for one hour and sit for a total of two hours in one-hour intervals. Richardson concluded that the Drea \u201crequires complete freedom to rest frequently without restriction\u201d and that his fatigue problem limited his reaching, handling, and pushing/pulling ability. Dr. Richardson stated that he based his evaluation solely on \u201cmedical findings\u201d of \u201cfatigueability [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">After examining Drea in December 1998 upon referral from Dr. Richardson, Dr. Jacoby stated that Drea complained of fatigue for the past six to seven months. He further noted that hemochromatosis is \u201cless likely\u201d as a diagnosis. Tests that Jacoby performed in January 1999 showed fatty infiltration of Drea\u2019s liver and a possible diagnosis of Hepatitis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Dr. Pat Chan, a state physician reviewing Drea\u2019s application for disability, contacted Dr. Richardson about the Rest Questionnaire. In notes from this conversation, Chan stated that doctors had ruled out hemochromatosis in February 1999 (although Drea argues that this is incorrect) and that Dr. Richardson informed her that he completed the Rest Questionnaire based on Drea\u2019s subjective complaints. Dr. Chan then submitted a written question to Dr. Richardson regarding Drea\u2019s fatigue, and he responded that the Hepatitis test was a false positive and that Drea instead may suffer from autoimmune hepatitis (a disorder where the body\u2019s own immune system attacks the liver; Hepatitis C, by contrast, is caused by a virus that attacks the liver). Dr. Chan opined in a February 1999 report that Drea could occasionally lift fifty pounds, frequently lift twenty-five pounds, and sit, stand, or walk for six out of eight hours a day. Dr. Chan noted her disagreement with Dr. Richardson\u2019s evaluation, which she says was \u201cbased solely on claimant\u2019s report of fatigue and is not supported by any objective findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">In his 1998 disability application and at his 1999 hearing, Drea explained how his fatigue limited his ability to function. Until about 1997 or 1998 (the record is not specific), Drea helped feed the cattle on his brother\u2019s farm, which took about an hour a day, but after that his fatigue forced him to take a nap. Since he stopped working on the farm, Drea arises between 7:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m., but has to take a morning nap because he would become exhausted after his morning activities of playing cribbage with his wife, buying a newspaper across the street from his home, and reading the newspaper. According to the record, Drea also ran errands for his wife, did light housework, tended his garden, and bowled, but his fatigue would force him to rest after about an hour of performing these activities. Despite his fatigue, Drea could drive locally and occasionally visited with friends for a couple hours. Finally, he testified that because of fatigue, he could sit for only three hours, stand for an hour, and occasionally lift twenty-five pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>The ALJ concluded that Drea did not qualify as being disabled under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i)(l), 428. First, the ALJ found that Drea had not performed substantial gainful activity since November 1, 1993, despite Drea\u2019s seasonal employment in 1995, 1996, and 1997. Second, the ALJ determined that Drea had a severe, medically determinable impairment because he suffered from \u201csevere elevated liver function and [has] a history of colon cancer.\u201d Third, the ALJ noted that these impairments did not equal an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Subpart P, Appendix 1. Fourth, the ALJ found that Drea could perform his past relevant work at Chrysler. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ gave controlling weight to Dr. Chan\u2019s February 1999 report; the ALJ reasoned that the Rest Questionnaire submitted by Dr. Richardson was based on Drea\u2019s subjective complaints and was not \u201cconsistent with the record and with the objective medical evidence.\u201d Further, the ALJ gave little weight to Drea\u2019s subjective complaints of fatigue because the medical evidence did not support the extent of his subjective symptoms and his daily activities were consistent with someone capable of performing medium work.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">We will uphold an ALJ\u2019s decision denying disability benefits if the ALJ applied the proper legal standard and substantial evidence supported the decision. <em>Steele v. Barnhart, </em>290 F.3d 936, 940 (7th Cir.2002); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence \u201crequires no more than such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Powers v. Apfel, </em>207 F.3d 431, 434 (7th Cir.2000) (internal quotation omitted). When we review an ALJ\u2019s decision, we accept the ALJ\u2019s findings of facts and will not reweigh the evidence. <em>Id. </em>The issue on appeal is whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding at step four that Drea could perform his past relevant work. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920 (detailing five-step analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Drea first argues that the ALJ erred by not crediting Dr. Richardson\u2019s opinion that Drea could not perform his past relevant work. An ALJ must give controlling weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion on the claimant\u2019s medical condition unless the opinion is not well-supported by medical findings or is inconsistent with other record evidence. <em>Clifford v. Apfel, </em>227 F.3d 863, 870 (7th Cir.2000); see <em>also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2). We have held, however, that an ALJ may give less weight to a doctor\u2019s report that is based solely on the claimant\u2019s \u201cown statements about his functional restrictions at the time of the examination.\u201d <em>Diaz v. Chater, </em>55 F.3d 300, 308 (7th Cir.1995); see <em>also Dixon v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 1171, 1178 (7th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn ALJ may properly reject a doctor\u2019s opinion if it appears to be based on a claimant\u2019s exaggerated subjective allegations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Here, substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Dr. Richardson\u2019s opinion in the Rest Questionnaire. Initially, Dr. Richardson informed Dr. Chan that he completed the questionnaire based solely on Drea\u2019s symptoms as reported by Drea, and thus, the ALJ could infer that the questionnaire might not accurately reflect Drea\u2019s limitations. Secondly, Dr. Richardson cited no objective medical findings to substantiate his proposed limitations; for example, on the questionnaire, he listed \u201cfatigueability [sic]\u201d as a \u201cmedical finding.\u201d He provided no objective findings even though the questionnaire specifically asked the treating doctor to \u201c[i]dentify the particular medical findings [i.e., physical exam findings, x-ray findings, lab test results, history, symptoms (including pain), etc.] which support [his] assessment of any limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tions.\u201d In light of Dr. Richardson\u2019s reliance on Drea\u2019s subjective complaints rather than medical evidence, the ALJ did not err when he discredited Dr. Richardson\u2019s opinion and gave controlling weight to Dr. Chan\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Drea next argues that the ALJ improperly discredited his subjective accounts of fatigue, failed to discuss his fatigue as a symptom of an objective medical condition, and \u201cenhanced and enlarged the extent to which the ... activities were performed by the claimant.\u201d An ALJ may consider a claimant\u2019s testimony less credible if the medical evidence does not support the symptoms to the extent alleged, <em>see Powers, </em>207 F.3d at 435-36 (\u201cThe discrepancy between the degree of pain attested to by the witness and that suggested by the medical evidence is probative that the witness may be exaggerating her condition.\u201d), and if doctors did not find it necessary to prescribe medication to control symptoms, <em>see id. </em>at 435 (holding that it is not patently wrong for the ALJ to consider \u201cthe absence of drugs prescribed for severe pain\u201d). Further, when assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, the ALJ may rely on inconsistencies between the claimant\u2019s daily activities, subjective complaints, and the medical evidence. <em>Zurawski v. Halter, </em>245 F.3d 881, 887 (7th Cir.2001). In doing so, however, the ALJ must explain why the evidence is inconsistent. <em>Id. </em>Because an ALJ is best positioned to judge credibility, we reverse an ALJ\u2019s credibility determination only if it was \u201cpatently wrong.\u201d <em>Powers, </em>207 F.3d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Drea\u2019s subjective complaints of fatigue is supported by substantial evidence. The medical evidence does in some way support Drea\u2019s position-the ALJ acknowledged elevated liver functions may lead to fatigue-but Drea failed to introduce evidence into the record showing that his fatigue is sufficiently debilitating or that it prevents him from demonstrating that he is unable to perform at a medium work level. Drea\u2019s medical records reflect that he complained to doctors about his fatigue on only three occasions-March-April 1993, December 1996, and October/November 1998-and in the intervening time, he worked seasonally and on his brother\u2019s farm. The record also demonstrates that Drea\u2019s fatigue appeared to be intermittent-in 1993 Drea reported to doctors that he was doing well after previously complaining of fatigue. Further, the ALJ properly considered, and found significant, under <em>Powers </em>that Dr. Richardson did not prescribe medication for Drea\u2019s fatigue, which indicated that Drea\u2019s fatigue was not as severe as he claimed. Finally, Drea\u2019s complaints of fatigue are undermined by his failure to seek medical attention for extended periods of time. <em>See Luna v. Shalala, </em>22 F.3d 687, 691 (7th Cir.1994) (ALJ may find claimant\u2019s complaints exaggerated when claimant fails \u201cto seek further medical assistance\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In addition, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Drea could perform medium work was not \u201cpatently wrong.\u201d First, although Drea claims that fatigue has prevented him from working at a medium level since November 1, 1993, the ALJ noted that Drea had performed medium level work at the canning factory in 1995, 1996, and 1997, and helped around his brother\u2019s farm until approximately 1997 or 1998. Drea responds that he stopped his seasonal work \u201cbecause of extreme fatigue,\u201d but the ALJ noted that Drea stopped working because the canning season ended, not because of his fatigue, proving that Drea could perform medium work despite his claims of disabling fatigue. Second, Drea worked full eight-hour shifts at the canning company without rest breaks, contrary to the conclusions that Dr. Richard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>son made on the Rest Questionnaire that Drea be given complete freedom to rest. Thirdly, Drea\u2019s activities between 1993 and 1999 of gardening, yard work, and bowling involved crouching, stooping, kneeling, and balancing, actions inconsistent with Dr. Richardson\u2019s responses in the Rest Questionnaire that Drea never or only occasionally perform these functions. This evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Drea\u2019s fatigue, considered in light of the record, does \u201cnot reflect an individual so impaired as to be incapable of engaging in any substantial gainful activity,\u201d which the ALJ found to be medium work.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Finally, Drea argues that the ALJ should have consulted a vocational expert to \u201cassess how Mr. Drea\u2019s non-exertional impairment would affect the occupational base.\u201d An ALJ, however, need not consult a vocational expert if substantial evidence supports the finding that the alleged nonexertional limitation does not significantly impact the claimant\u2019s ability to perform a full range of work. <em>Zurawski, </em>245 F.3d at 889; <em>Luna, </em>22 F.3d at 692. As discussed above, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Drea\u2019s fatigue was not disabling, and the ALJ could conclude that whatever fatigue Drea in fact suffered would not significantly impact his ability to perform medium work. Thus, the ALJ did not err by not consulting a vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
