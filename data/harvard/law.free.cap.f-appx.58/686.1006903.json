The Hempflings allegedly suffered carbon monoxide poisoning as a result of the government\u2019s negligence. The district court ruled that Hempfling\u2019s claims were barred by the discretionary function exception to the Act. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-14\">As the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary. We review the district court\u2019s application of the discretionary function exception <em>de novo. Marlys Bear Medicine v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 1208, 1213 (9th Cir.2001). The exception preserves sovereign immunity under the Act for claims that are \u201cbased upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a federal agency or an employee of the Government, whether or not the discretion involved be abused.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(a) (2002). The government bears the burden of proving that the exception applies. <em>Marlys Bear Medicine, </em>241 F.3d at 1213.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-15\">A two-part test is used to evaluate whether the exception applies. First, the court determines if the challenged conduct \u201cinvolves an element of judgment or choice\u201d for the acting employee. <em>Berkovitz v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 531, 536, 108 S.Ct. 1954, 100 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988). If the conduct does involve judgment, then the exception applies if the judgment is \u201cbased on considerations of public policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court focuses on \u201cthe nature of the actions taken and on whether they are susceptible to policy analysis.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaubert, </em>499 U.S. 315, 325, 111 S.Ct. 1267,113 L.Ed.2d 335 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-16\">The government fails the second prong of the <em>Berkovitz </em>test because the record contains no indication that the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>ment\u2019s allegedly negligent inspections of the Hempflings\u2019 unit were susceptible to policy analysis. Under the terms of the contracts, the Hempflings\u2019 unit was required to comply with the Uniform Building Code. <em>See also </em>40 U.S.C. \u00a7 619(a)(2001). Whatever responsibilities the government may have delegated to its contractors, it contractually reserved for itself the obligation to inspect its contractors\u2019 activities. While this reservation of responsibility represented a policy choice, the negligent performance of that responsibility did not. <em>See Marlys Bear Medicine, </em>241 F.3d at 1215; <em>Camozzi v. Roland/Miller and Hope Consulting Group, </em>866 F.2d 287, 290 (9th Cir.1989). Because the record does not show that the manner in which the government performed inspections was \u201cpolicy-based or susceptible to policy analysis,\u201d there is no basis for applying the discretionary function exception to the government\u2019s alleged negligence in inspecting the Hempflings\u2019 unit. <em>See Marlys Bear Medicine, </em>241 F.3d at 1216. The dismissals of Hempfling\u2019s Second and Third Amended Complaints were therefore erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
