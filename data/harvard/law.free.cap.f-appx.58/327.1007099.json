INS, </em>314 F.3d 1076, 1078 (9th Cir.2002). The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-25\">The BIA abused its discretion in not finding that Chen\u2019s absence was the result of exceptional circumstances. Ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes an \u201cexceptional circumstance\u201d justifying the reopening of a deportation made <em>in absentia. In re Grijalvar-Barrera, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 472, 473 (BIA 1996). Chen\u2019s former attorney\u2019s instruction to Chen to go home instead of attending the hearing, coupled with the attorney\u2019s failure to inform the court of Chen\u2019s necessary absence, constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id,.; see also Fajardo v. INS, </em>300 F.3d 1018, 1022 n. 8 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that it is difficult to imagine how an attorney\u2019s failure to inform his client of the need to appear at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>deportation hearing would not constitute an exceptional circumstance excusing the absence).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">We also grant Chen\u2019s petition to reopen in light of our recent holding in <em>Singh, </em>295 F.3d at 1037 (finding exceptional circumstances where there was a misunderstanding as to the time of the deportation hearing and the petitioner was the beneficiary of an approved visa petition). We therefore GRANT the petition for review, and REMAND the case to the BIA for consideration of the merits of Chen\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b361-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
