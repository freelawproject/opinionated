Brickman brought this diversity case alleging fraud, breach of contract, and other state-law causes of action in connection with her purchase of a home from the Scheitlins. In our view, disputed issues of fact precluded the granting of summary judgment. We reverse the district court and remand for trial, and we reverse the order granting attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Lawson v. Washington, </em>296 F.3d 799, 803 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recount them in detail. Under California law, a seller of real estate has a duty to disclose any known facts that will materially affect the \u201cvalue or desirability of the property\u201d if the seller \u201calso knows that such facts are not known to, or within the reach of the diligent attention and observation of the buyer.\u201d <em>Lingsch v. Savage, </em>213 Cal.App.2d 729, 735, 29 Cal.Rptr. 201 (1963). Brickman came forward with evidence that the Scheitlins knew, but failed to disclose to Brickman, that the sewer line did not work properly, and that water pooled against the back of the house due to improper drainage.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">California Civil Code \u00a7 1102 requires a seller to disclose all significant defects that are known to the seller. An \u201cas is\u201d sale puts the buyer on notice that she is taking the property \u201cwith all its obvious and patent defects,\u201d but it does not absolve the seller of the duty to disclose concealed defects of which he is aware. <em>Loughrin v. Superior Court, </em>15 Cal.App.4th 1188, 1196, 19 Cal.Rptr.2d 161 (1993). What the buyer and seller each knew, or should have known, is a critical fact. Brickman came forward with evidence that the Scheitlins knew of, and failed to disclose, serious latent problems with the sewer line and the drainage \u2014 problems of which Brick-man says she was unaware. Although Brickman had obtained a property inspection report prior to completing the purchase, that is not the end of the matter. Whether Brickman, armed with her inspection report, knew or should have known of the existence of these problems, and especially of their extent, is a fact-intensive inquiry, one that, in our view, is not resolvable by summary judgment on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Because we reverse the grant of summary judgment on the merits, we also reverse the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b317-12\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">The Plaintiffs purchased the residential property in question \u201c \u2018AS IS,\u2019 in its present physical condition.\u201d In addition to the specific disclosures made by the sellers in their disclosure statement, the parties expressly agreed that \u201cinspection reports completed pursuant to the contract of sale\u201d would \u201csatisfy [sellers\u2019] disclosure obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">Plaintiffs subsequently commissioned a comprehensive inspection encompassing \u201cthe grounds, including evidence of soil erosion and surface drainage patterns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">Ms. Brickman acknowledged that the inspector pointed out drainage problems at the exterior of the home, and recommended consulting a \u201cqualified plumbing contractor\u201d to determine the \u201cneed to re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>pipe the entire house.\u201d With that knowledge, it cannot be said that the sewer and drainage problems referenced by the majority were \u201cnot known to, or within the reach of the diligent attention and observation of the buyer.\u201d <em>Alexander v. McKnight, </em>7 Cal.App.4th 973, 977, 9 Cal. Rptr.2d 458 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The majority\u2019s analysis in this case unfortunately fosters a \u201csee no evil\u201d approach on the part of the buyer. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
