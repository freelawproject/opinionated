We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the denial of a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Bermudez first contends his mental incompetence prevented him from filing a timely federal petition. Bermudez\u2019s contention fails, because he was able to file petitions in state court during the years prior to his \u00a7 2254 petition, and because his evidence refers to mental health problems after he filed his \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See id. </em>at 1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Bermudez next contends that he deserves equitable tolling because he is illiterate, indigent, ignorant of the law, and was not provided Spanish legal materials. Assuming these problems to be true, they would not constitute extraordinary factors preventing timely filing, especially in light of Bermudez\u2019s ability to file petitions in state court. <em>See Hughes v. Idaho State Bd. of Corrections, </em>800 F.2d 905, 909 (9th Cir.1986) (holding pre-AEDPA that illiteracy of pro se petitioner was not a sufficient objective, external factor amounting to \u201ccause\u201d for failure to present claim to state supreme court).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b303-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
