Hammons sought the award following his acceptance of a Rule 68 offer of judgment to settle a counterclaim in a declaratory judgment action. As explained below, in the circumstances of this case the court properly declined to award fees, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">Hammons owns a neighborhood tavern known as Charlie Bob\u2019s Bar, Inc. (\u201cCharlie Bob\u2019s\u201d), in Kanawha County, West Virginia. On January 14, 1999, two patrons of Charlie Bob\u2019s, William Keith Medford and Michael Robinson, were involved in a fistfight outside the establishment, and Med-ford was injured. As a result, on September 8, 1999, Medford sued both Robinson and Charlie Bob\u2019s in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (the \u201cMedford Suit\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-16\">At the time of the altercation, Charlie Bob\u2019s was insured by First Financial Insurance Company (\u201cFirst Financial\u201d) under a commercial general liability policy. After Medford filed suit, Hammons notified First Financial and requested that it defend and indemnify Charlie Bob\u2019s in the Medford Suit. First Financial, however, took the position that its policy did not provide coverage against Medford\u2019s claims, and it refused to defend or indemnify Charlie Bob\u2019s.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-17\">Following First Financial\u2019s denial of coverage, Hammons retained counsel to represent Charlie Bob\u2019s in the Medford Suit. Thereafter, Medford dismissed his claims against Charlie Bob\u2019s and substituted Hammons, personally, as a defendant. In response, Hammons notified his homeowner\u2019s insurer, Liberty Mutual Insurance Group (\u201cLiberty Mutual\u201d), of the Medford Suit, and he requested that Liberty Mutual defend and indemnify him therein. Liberty Mutual agreed to provide Hammons with a defense to the Medford Suit, but it did so with a reservation of its rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-18\">Hammons retained counsel in November 2000 to assess whether the First Financial policy provided coverage for the claims made against him in the Medford Suit, and whether First Financial was obligated to provide defense and indemnity. On No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>vember 6, 2000, Hammons demanded of First Financial that it defend and indemnify him in the Medford Suit. In response, First Financial agreed to defend Hammons, but it did so with a reservation of its rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">On January 31, 2001, First Financial filed this declaratory judgment action against Hammons, d/b/a Charlie Bob\u2019s, Inc. (the \u201cFirst Financial Suit\u201d), in the district court for southern West Virginia, seeking a declaration that it was not obligated to defend or indemnify Hammons in the Medford Suit. Hammons counterclaimed against First Financial, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>breach of contract and breach of common law good faith and fair dealing. In his Counterclaim, Hammons sought from First Financial, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201call damages arising from Plaintiffs breach of contract pursuant to <em>Hayseeds, Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas., </em>177 W.Va. 323, 352 S.E.2d 73 (1986).\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">On April 8, 2001, two months after the filing of the First Financial Suit, the Med-ford Suit was settled. Following the settlement, First Financial, on November 5, 2001, filed a Rule 68 offer of judgment in the First Financial Suit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The offer of judgment provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">First Financial Insurance Company offers to allow judgment to be taken against it in this matter in the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000). This offer is made pursuant to the provisions of Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and will be deemed withdrawn unless you serve a written notice of acceptance of the offer within ten (10) days of the date that it was served to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">On November 14, 2001, Hammons accepted the offer of judgment. Pursuant thereto, judgment was entered against First Financial in the district court on November 19, 2001, in the sum of $10,000, plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">Thereafter, on November 30, 2001, Hammons moved the district court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in the First Financial Suit, maintaining that he had substantially prevailed in his action against First Financial and that he was thus entitled to such fees under <em>Hayseeds. </em>In response, First Financial asserted that its offer of judgment encompassed all relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>sought in Hammons\u2019s Counterclaim, including Hammons\u2019s <em>Hayseeds </em>claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. First Financial maintained that Hammons could not \u201crecover outside the Rule 68 Judgment the damages [he] specifically and repeatedly demanded in [his] Counter-claim.\u201d On December 21, 2001, the court denied Hammons\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>First Fin. Ins. Co. v. Hammons, </em>Order, No. 2:01-0096 (S.D.W.Va. Dec. 21, 2001). Hammons moved to vacate that ruling, asserting that he had not been permitted to reply to First Financial\u2019s objections. After permitting and considering Hammons\u2019s reply, the court again denied Hammons\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees, and it entered the order from which Hammons now appeals. <em>First Fin. Ins. Co. v. Hammons, </em>Order, No. 2:01-0096 (S.D.W.Va. Feb. 1, 2002) (the \u201cOrder\u201d). We possess jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">While we generally review a decision awarding or denying attorneys\u2019 fees for abuse of discretion, <em>Hitachi Credit Am. Corp. v. Signet Bank, </em>166 F.3d 614, 631 (4th Cir.1999), when, as here, such a ruling is premised on a legal interpretation of a procedural rule, our review is de novo. <em>See Camacho v. Mancuso, </em>53 F.3d 48, 51 (4th Cir.1995) (concluding that the proper standard of review for the interpretation of a federal rule is de novo); <em>see also Jason D.W. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>158 F.3d 205, 208 (5th Cir.1998) (\u201c[interpretation of Rule 68 is an issue of law that we review de novo.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Hammons asserts that the court erred in denying his motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. He contends that the offer of judgment was ambiguous with respect to attorneys\u2019 fees because it failed to specify whether it included such fees. The ambiguity, he insists, must be construed against the offer- or, First Financial.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">Hammons is correct that, as a general proposition, an ambiguous Rule 68 offer of judgment should be construed against the offeror. <em>See Nordby v. Anchor Hocking Packaging Co., </em>199 F.3d 390, 391 (7th Cir. 1999) (holding that \u201cany ambiguities in a Rule 68 offer must be resolved against the [offeror]\u201d); <em>Nusom v. Comh Woodburn, Inc., </em>122 F.3d 830, 833 (9th Cir.1997) (concluding that \u201cthe \u2018usual rules of contract construction\u2019 apply to a Rule 68 offer of judgment\u201d and \u201c[therefore, ambiguities are construed against the offeror\u201d (citation omitted)). Ambiguities in a Rule 68 offer \u201cmust be resolved against the defendant, ... not only because the defendant drafted the offer but also because the plaintiff is being asked to give up his right to a trial.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Nordby, </em>199 F.3d at 391-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">An offer of judgment that is silent with respect to attorneys\u2019 fees may well be ambiguous, depending on the circumstances of the case, because the term \u201c \u2018judgment\u2019 can mean either the substantive relief ordered, ... or that plus attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392. In this case, however, we find no ambiguity in First Financial\u2019s offer of judgment. The award of attorneys\u2019 fees was the primary substantive relief that Hammons sought in his Counterclaim; and the offer of judgment plainly encompassed all damages asserted therein. <em>See </em>Offer of Judgment, <em>First Fin. Ins. Co. v. Hammons, </em>No. 2:01-0096 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>(S.D.W.Va. Nov. 5, 2001) (\u201cFirst Financial ... offers to allow judgment to be taken against it <em>in this matter </em>in the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">In Count II of his Counterclaim, Hammons specifically sought attorneys\u2019 fees when he demanded \u201call damages arising from Plaintiff\u2019s breach of contract pursuant to <em>Hayseeds.\u201d </em>A <em>Hayseeds </em>claim may well be unique to West Virginia, and its assertion in the Counter-claim compels the conclusion that the offer of judgment encompassed attorneys\u2019 fees. In its <em>Hayseeds </em>decision, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia explained that, in the American system of civil justice, \u201cit is generally held that, in the absence of a statutory or contractual provision providing for such recovery, attorneys\u2019 fees may not be recovered in an action on an insurance policy.\u201d 352 S.E.2d at 78. As Justice Neely observed, however, \u201ccases between policy-holders and insurers [are] one of the prominent instances where the American rule concerning attorneys\u2019 fees works badly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the court ruled that \u201cwhenever a policyholder must sue his own insurance company, ... and the policyholder substantially prevails in the action, the company is liable for the payment of the policyholder\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80. Thus, a <em>Hayseeds </em>claim is comprised, in substantial part, of attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We agree with the district court that \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees were not something sought outside of the pleadings,\u201d but instead \u201cconstituted a large part of the relief sought in the [Counterclaim] itself.\u201d Order at 3. The court aptly observed that, where \u201cattorneys\u2019 fees are actually a part of the substantive relief sought in [the] judgment, then using the word \u2018judgment\u2019 alone in an offer to settle the matter creates no ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. As such, the offer of judgment made by First Financial was, in this setting, unambiguous: the \u201cjudgment\u201d that First Financial offered encompassed the <em>Hayseeds </em>claim for attorneys\u2019 fees that Hammons had advanced in his Counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-12\">. Medford alleged in his Complaint that Hammons, as owner and operator of Charlie Bob's, \u201cdid or should have foreseen that the assault against [Medford] would occur because ... Michael Robinson had been involved in similar altercations on prior occasions and has a reputation in the community for violent behavior, particularly when intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">Further, Medford alleged that \"[o]n the date of the assault, [Hammons] negligently served intoxicating beverages to Michael Robinson when he was intoxicated, even though [he]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-19\">knew or should have known that doing so increased the danger that Michael Robinson would act in a violent manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-20\">. In using the term \"coverage,\u201d we refer both to the duty of an insurer to defend and to its duty to indemnify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b66-21\">. When an insurer defends its insured under a \"reservation of rights,\u201d the insurer reserves its right to discontinue the defense and to deny indemnification if it thereafter determines that a policy exclusion applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b67-7\">. Specifically, the Counterclaim sought damages \"pursuant to <em>Hayseeds,\" </em>as well as \u201cpunitive, compensatory and general damages, including pre- and post-judgment interest, attorneys' fees, costs and expenses.\u201d Notwithstanding this broad <em>ad damnum </em>clause, the crux of a <em>Hayseeds </em>claim is its attorneys' fees component. In <em>Hayseeds, </em>the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia specifically held that, when an insured \"must sue his own insurance company over any properly damage claim, and the [insured] substantially prevails in the action, the company is liable for the payment of the [insured\u2019s] reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d 352 S.E.2d at 80. As a corollary thereto, such an insured is also entitled to damages caused by \u201cthe delay in settlement, as well as an award for aggravation and inconvenience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, while Hammons sought broad common law damages, the claim that uniquely brought his suit within the <em>Hayseeds </em>rubric was that for attorneys' fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b67-14\">. Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-15\">At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins, a party defending against a claim may serve upon the adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken against the defending party for the money or property or to the effect specified in the offer, with costs then accrued. If within 10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party serves written notice that the offer is accepted ... the clerk shall enter judgment. ... If the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the costs incurred after the making of the offer. Fed.R.Civ.P. 68.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\">. Courts have also recognized that \"a plaintiff who receives a Rule 68 offer is in a difficult position because the offer has a binding effect when refused as well as when accepted.\u201d <em>Webb v. James, </em>147 F.3d 617, 621 (7th Cir. 1998) (noting plaintiffs potential liability for costs after rejecting an offer of judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b69-7\">. The presence of the <em>Hayseeds </em>claim in Hammons\u2019s Counterclaim distinguishes this proceeding from one in which a plaintiff\u2019s principal claim seeks injunctive relief or damages. Such a plaintiff may ordinarily recover attorneys\u2019 fees only by way of a supplemental claim pursuant to a fee-shifting statute. <em>See, e.g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (providing for awards of attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs who bring successful civil rights actions); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205 (providing for awards of attorneys' fees to plaintiffs who bring successful claims pursuant to Americans with Disabilities Act); 5 U.S.C \u00a7 552(a)(4)(E) (providing for awards of attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs who bring successful claims pursuant to Freedom of Information Act). By contrast, a plaintiff asserting a <em>Hayseeds </em>claim is seeking attorneys\u2019 fees as part and parcel of his principal recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b69-12\">TRAXLER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AhZ\">concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">I agree with my colleagues that the circumstances of this case leave no doubt that the offer of judgment included attorney\u2019s fees. I submit this separate opinion only because in my judgment the offer was unambiguous and would have included attorney\u2019s fees whether there was an explicit claim for them in the pleadings or not.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
