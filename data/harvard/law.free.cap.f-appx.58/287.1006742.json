We hold that Johnson\u2019s shed was not so intimately tied to his home as to be protected by the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">Because the parties are aware of the facts, we do not recite them here. Under <em>United States v. Dunn:</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAB\">[C]urtilage questions should be resolved with particular reference to four factors: [1] the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, [2] whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home, [3] the nature of the uses to which the area is put, and [4] the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">We use these four factors as a tool to consider \u201cwhether the area in question is so intimately tied to the home itself that it should be placed under the home\u2019s \u2018umbrella\u2019 of Fourth Amendment protection.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXj\">Johnson\u2019s shed was 40-50 yards from his residence, behind a fenced-in dog kennel, and down an unmanicured slope. The shed\u2019s proximity from Johnson\u2019s home weighs against a finding that the shed is within his curtilage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, Johnson had taken affirmative steps toward enclosing over 90% of his house, which did not include the shed. Although one could walk from the house to the shed without crossing through a fence, one must walk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>around the fenced-in dog kennel and down a lull to do so. Furthermore, the only thing preventing the house from being fenced in all the way was where it connected with the driveway. Each of these facts weighs against Johnson\u2019s contention that his shed was within his home\u2019s curtilage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Nothing in the record suggests that Johnson used the area between his house and the shed \u201cfor intimate activities of the home.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Johnson used the shed to grow marijuana \u2014 not an everyday domestic use, to be sure. Additionally, nothing around the shed objectively put the officers on notice that the shed was used for domestic life purposes. Finally, Johnson took no steps toward decreasing the shed\u2019s visibility.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The shed neither sits behind a fence nor is it blocked by a physical structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Because each of the four factors in <em>Dunn </em>weighs against a finding that the shed falls within the curtilage of Johnson\u2019s home, we hold that the shed is not so intimately tied to his home as to be protected by the Fourth Amendment. Therefore, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b322-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-13\">. 480 U.S. 294, 107 S.Ct. 1134, 94 L.Ed.2d 326 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-14\">. <em>Id. </em>at 300 (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-15\">. <em>Id. </em>at 301 n. 4 (focusing on \"whether the area in question harbors those intimate activities associated with domestic life and the privacies of the home\u201d).
