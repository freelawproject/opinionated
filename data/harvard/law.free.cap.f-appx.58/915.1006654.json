He was sentenced to sixty-eight months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release. Thomas appeals two issues related to the District Court\u2019s denial of his motions to suppress evidence: whether the Court erred in concluding that officers\u2019 initial stop of Thomas constituted a permissible investigatory detention and not an arrest; and whether it erred in refusing to order the Government to disclose the identity of a confidential informant. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">On the afternoon of November 5, 2001, Sergeant Michael Nolan of the Erie Police Department received a call from a confidential informant who had provided information to Nolan on multiple prior occasions. The informant told Nolan that \u201cSpeedy\u201d Stepp intended to shoot a man named Beason (one of several in the area) in retaliation for stealing drugs. The informant, calling from a cellular telephone, stated that he currently was observing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>Stepp walking in \u201cthe Hood\u201d \u2014 an area of Erie known for its high incidence of violent drug-related activity \u2014 while openly holding a gun and looking for Beason. The informant excitedly told Nolan that Stepp had been joined in the street by Thomas, that a confrontation was imminent, and that police were needed on the scene immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Nolan called the police radio dispatcher, who advised all officers in the area that a shooting was about to occur. En route, officers in a patrol car passed another car driven by one of the Beasons, who pointed frantically behind him toward the area he had just driven from, the same area where the informant said Stepp and Thomas were located. Five police officers arrived at the designated intersection (two cars with two officers each and one officer on a bicycle patrol), and encountered three men: Stepp, Thomas, and Robert Tarver. The officers drew their weapons and told the men to stop, put their hands in the air, and get on the ground. Stepp and Tarver immediately complied, but Thomas continued to walk toward the officers. Thomas partially raised his right hand, but repeatedly dropped it to his side. Thomas eventually got down, but kept dropping his right hand. Concerned that Thomas may be reaching for a concealed weapon, one officer decided to pat Thomas down. As the officer knelt over Thomas, his knee felt a metal object in Thomas\u2019s back pocket. The officer reached inside the pocket and withdrew a loaded handgun. The other two suspects were patted down as well, but no additional weapons were found. Thomas and Stepp were arrested and brought to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">At the station, Nolan again patted down Thomas. Nolan had arrested Thomas only two months before and during a pat down at that time discovered that Thomas had hidden a plastic bag with crack cocaine in his buttocks. During this later pat down of Thomas, Nolan felt Thomas clench his legs and buttocks. Nolan ordered Thomas to expose his buttocks, and Thomas reached behind himself and removed a plastic bag containing crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">At trial Thomas moved to suppress the crack cocaine and to reveal the identity of the confidential informant. The District Court denied both motions. Thomas then entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">n.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">Thomas argues that his initial encounter with the police amounted to an arrest, not an investigatory stop, as found by the District Court. The latter, known as a <em>Terry </em>stop, requires only that the police have a reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts that a crime has been committed, <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), whereas the arrest of a suspect requires that the police have probable cause to do so, a more stringent standard. <em>Baker v. Monroe Township, </em>50 F.3d 1186, 1192 (3d Cir.1995). We review the District Court\u2019s factual findings as to the circumstances of the officers\u2019 stop and pat down of Thomas for clear error, and exercise plenary review of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the police conduct did not constitute a <em>de facto </em>arrest. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>53 F.3d 616, 618 (3d Cir.1995). Because we agree with the District Court that the officers\u2019 actions did not transform the <em>Terry </em>stop into an arrest, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether there was probable cause. <em>See id. </em>at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">When making an investigatory stop, police officers \u201cmay take such steps as are \u2018reasonably necessary to protect their personal safety and to maintain the status quo during the course of the stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>235, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985)). \u201cUnder the <em>Terry </em>cases, the reasonableness of the intrusion is the touchstone, balancing the need of law enforcement officials against the burden on the affected citizens and considering the relation of the policeman's actions to his reason for stopping the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Baker, </em>50 F.3d at 1192). Relevant to the specific context of this case is our prior acknowledgment that \u201c[t]here is no per se rule that pointing guns at people, or handcuffing them, constitutes an arrest.\u201d <em>Baker, </em>50 F.3d at 1193 (citing cases). The \u201cuse of guns and handcuffs must be justified by the circumstances,\u201d however, and \u201cwe must look at the intrusiveness of all aspects of the incident in the aggregate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Thomas concedes that no single police <em>action- </em>\u2014 e.g., pointing weapons at him, ordering him to the ground, handcuffing him \u2014 is dispositive to demonstrate unreasonableness. Instead he argues that, in combination, the officers\u2019 conduct went far beyond what was necessary to protect their safety and maintain the <em>status quo. </em>This is especially so, contends Thomas, because the officers\u2019 response was based solely upon the unreliable information of a confidential informant. For example, the informant had told Nolan that Stepp was walking around the Hood while openly carrying a gun, yet no gun was observed by the officers upon arrival.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">We are unpersuaded. Factors that may justify an investigative stop to search for weapons \u201cinclude the time of day, the \u2018high-crime\u2019 nature of the area, an informant\u2019s tips that persons might be armed, furtive hand movements, flight or attempted flight by the person sought to be detained, and a pressing need for immediate action.\u201d <em>United States v. Laing, </em>889 F.2d 281, 286 (D.C. Cir.1989) (citing <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 147-48, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972)). Here, a confidential informant that Erie police had relied on in the past called Nolan and stated that he currently was observing a man brandishing a gun while walking through an area known for its high incidence of violent drug activity. The informant told the police that he believed a murder was about to occur. Police driving to the scene to investigate passed the intended victim, who motioned frantically to the area where the informant said the suspects were located. Upon arrival, Thomas alone did not heed police commands to stop walking. He refused to raise his hands, and made gestures that could be interpreted as reaching for a weapon. We have no doubt that the officers\u2019 actions, viewed individually or collectively, were reasonably necessary to protect their personal safety and maintain the <em>status quo. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the stop and pat down of Thomas did not rise to the level of an arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-8\">Thomas\u2019s second argument on appeal involves the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to disclose the identity of the confidential informant, a decision we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>3 F.3d 673, 679 (3d Cir.1993). The Supreme Court in <em>Roviaro v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957), explained the standard for determining whether an informant\u2019s identity should be revealed. \u201c[Pjrotecting an informant\u2019s identity serves important law enforcement objectives, most significantly, the public interest in encouraging persons to supply the government with information concerning crimes.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>3 F.3d at 679 (citing <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 59). The Government\u2019s privilege to withhold disclosure is not limitless, however. \u201cWhere the disclosure of an informer\u2019s identity, or of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the privilege must give way.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiles, 658 F.2d </em>194, 196 (3d Cir.1981) (quoting <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 60-61).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">Thus we are to apply a balancing test to weigh these competing considerations. \u201c[0]nce a defendant sets forth a specific need for disclosure the court should balance \u2018the public interest in protecting the flow of information against the individual\u2019s right to prepare his defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 62). The inquiry is case specific, \u201ctaking into consideration the crime charged, the possible defenses, the possible significance of the informer\u2019s testimony, and other relevant factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Roviaro, </em>353 U.S. at 62).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">Examining those factors here, we conclude that Thomas has not shown a specific need for disclosure that outweighs the public interest in allowing informants to remain confidential. As an initial matter, we note (as did the District Court) that the Supreme Court has indicated that a defendant\u2019s need to learn the identity of an informant is less compelling in a pretrial suppression hearing than at trial. <em>See McCray v. Illinois, 386 </em>U.S. <em>300, 312, 87 </em>S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967). In this specific context, moreover, the significance of the informant\u2019s testimony to Thomas\u2019s ability to prepare his defense was quite limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">Thomas\u2019s asserted need for disclosure is that the information provided by the informant was not corroborated by Nolan or anyone else. Thomas thus argues it is crucial that he be permitted to probe the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge and veracity. The District Court found, and we agree, that there is nothing for Thomas to gain by cross-examining the informant on his statements that led to the <em>Terry </em>stop. Although the arrest after the stop and pat down revealed that he was carrying a gun, the charge on which Thomas ultimately was prosecuted \u2014 possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine \u2014 resulted from the seizure at the Erie police station. The informant provided no information that Thomas had secreted illegal drugs on his person, nor was the informant present at the station when Nolan made this discovery. In other words, the informant was not, as Thomas asserts, the one person responsible for his arrest and prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">Furthermore, even assuming that Thomas had established a pressing need for access to the informant\u2019s identity, the District Court found credible both the informant\u2019s reliability and concern for his safety should his identity be disclosed. Thomas provides no persuasive reason to disturb this conclusion. We therefore hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Thomas\u2019s motion to reveal the confidential informant\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">For the reasons stated, we shall affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
