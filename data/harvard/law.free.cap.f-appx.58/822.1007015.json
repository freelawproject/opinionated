Maggard, a state inmate appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) allowing him to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Because Mr. Maggard has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-19\">Mr. Maggard was convicted by a jury in Kansas state court of two counts of arson. He was sentenced to two consecutive terms of five to ten years imprisonment, which was then doubled under the Kansas Habitual Criminal Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-4504, to consecutive terms of ten to twenty years. On direct appeal, the Kansas Court of Appeals (\u201cKCOA\u201d) affirmed Mr. Maggard\u2019s conviction but remanded the case for resentencing because, in the court\u2019s view, the trial court imposed a habitual criminal increase without competent evidence of Mr. Maggard\u2019s prior convictions. On remand, the trial court imposed the same sentence but \u201cwithout articulating a statutory basis for its discretionary conclusion,\u201d <em>State v. Maggard, </em>No. 71,558 (Kan. Ct.App. Feb 3, 1995) (quoted at R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Doc. 8 at 6), and so the case was again remanded by the KCOA for resentencing. Finally, the trial court resentenced Mr. Maggard to the same term, and the KCOA affirmed the sentence in 1998. <em>State v. Maggard, </em>24 Kan.App.2d 868, 953 P.2d 1379 (1998). Mr. Maggard\u2019s post-conviction appeal to the Kansas state courts was unsuccessful, <em>Maggard v. State, </em>27 Kan.App.2d 1060, 11 P.3d 89 (2000), and he filed a request for federal habeas relief in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">Mr. Maggard raised four claims before the federal district court and reasserts them on appeal: (1) the failure to bring him to trial within the time provisions of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (\u201cIAD\u201d), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2, violated his constitutional rights, (2) the trial court\u2019s failure to conduct an evidentiary hearing prior to introduction of prior bad acts evidence violated his due process rights, (3) ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, and (4) ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">We have carefully reviewed Mr. Maggard\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s thorough disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Petitioner\u2019s brief raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a COA. For substantially the same reasons as set forth by the district court in its order of April 22, 2002, R. Doc. 8, we cannot say \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">In particular, Mr. Maggard relies upon <em>New York v. Hill, </em>528 U.S. 110, 120 S.Ct. 659, 145 L.Ed.2d 560 (2000), as supporting the notion that a violation of the IAD is cognizable under \u00a7 2254. The case came to the Supreme Court from the New York Court of Appeals, and held that defense counsel could waive a defendant\u2019s speedy trial rights under the IAD. <em>Hill, </em>528 U.S. at 114. It does not directly or by implication suggest that an IAD violation is cognizable under \u00a7 2254. Even if we were to so find, Mr. Maggard has not alleged facts sufficient to support a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Absent here is any showing of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d that drive the IAD violations \u2014 if in fact they occurred\u2014 to the level of depriving Mr. Maggard of some constitutionally protected right. <em>Greathouse v. United States, </em>655 F.2d 1032, 1034 (10th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">So also Mr. Maggard\u2019s objections to the trial court\u2019s admission of prior bad-acts evidence do not rise to the level of denial of a constitutional right, and mere errors of state law cannot form the basis for habeas relief. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (\u201c[F]ederal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.\u201d) (citations omitted). This court will not, as a general matter, revisit state court evidentiary rulings \u201cunless the rulings in question rendered the trial so fundamentally unfair as to constitute denial of federal constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Moore v. Marr, </em>254 F.3d 1235, 1246 (10th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Finally, Mr. Maggard\u2019s ineffective assistance claims were rejected by the Kansas Supreme Court due to a procedural bar, and, because the decision of the state court rested on an \u201cindependent and adequate\u201d state procedural ground, this Court cannot review it absent a showing of \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cprejudice.\u201d <em>See Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (\u201cIn ah cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law.\u201d). Moreover, petitioner has failed to satisfy the \u201cprejudice\u201d prong of the test for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel insofar as nothing in the record indicates that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceedings would have been different but for Mr. Maggard\u2019s counsels\u2019 alleged transgressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Accordingly, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b857-20\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
