R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">Plaintiffs-appellants, Everett and Betty Allen, appeal the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of defendants-appellees, City of Henryetta, Oklahoma, and Henryetta Public Works, on their complaint brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse and remand this case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">In August 1999, Everett Allen was terminated from his position as Chief of Police of Henryetta, Oklahoma, by the City Manager. The City Manager\u2019s authority to terminate Allen was based on Okla. Stat. tit. 11, \u00a7 10-113(1), which provides that a city manager has the power to \u201c[a]ppoint, and when necessary for the good of the service, remove, demote, lay off or suspend all heads of administrative departments and other administrative officers and employees of the city except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Allen claims he had a protected property interest in his employment as Chief of Police, and that his termination violated his right to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment because it was without cause and he did not receive a post-termination hearing. The district court granted defendants summary judgment on Allen\u2019s procedural due process claim, concluding that, under \u00a7 10-113(1), the City Manager could terminate Allen without cause or a hearing. The district court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Allens\u2019 state-law claims for wrongful termination and loss of consortium, and the court dismissed both the federal and state claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-15\">It is undisputed that Allen was a member of the Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System (System), <em>see </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 11, \u00a7 50-101, <em>et seq., </em>at the time of his termination. According to \u00a7 50-123(B), \u201c[n]o member [of the System] may be discharged except for cause.\u201d In addition, under \u00a7 50-123(A), as a participating municipality in the System, the City of Henryetta is required to \u201cestablish a board of review to hear appeals concerning the discharge of members,\u201d and, under subsection (B), \u201c[a]ny member who is discharged may appeal to the board of review.\u201d \u00a7 50-123(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-16\">On their face, \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B) appear to create a property interest in a member\u2019s employment. However, in <em>Rains v. City of Stillwater, </em>817 P.2d 753, 756 (Okla.Ct.App.1991), the Oklahoma Court of Appeals held that the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision in \u00a7 50-123(B) created a property interest \u201conly in the pension and retirement benefits granted pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>statutes governing the [System], and not in continued employment itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201c[t]he statute only creates a legitimate expectation that <em>benefits </em>will continue absent discharge for cause,\u201d <em>id., </em>and it \u201ctherefore does not affect a city\u2019s right to terminate an officer\u2019s employment pursuant to its own charter,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">In opposing defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Allen attempted to distinguish <em>Rains </em>on the ground that he had exercised his option under a separate provision of the System, <em>see </em>\u00a7 50-111.3, to postpone his retirement from the police force and defer receipt of his pension benefits for five years. As a result of exercising his deferred pension option, Allen claimed he was statutorily entitled to continue his employment as Chief of Police for a five-year period, and he claimed that a property interest in his employment had therefore been created. The district court rejected Allen\u2019s argument regarding his deferred pension option, concluding that <em>Rains </em>controlled the issue of whether \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B) created a property interest in his employment, and that Allen\u2019s exercise of the deferred pension option under \u00a7 50-111.3 had no bearing on that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">After the parties had fully briefed this appeal, the Oklahoma Supreme Court decided <em>In re City of Durant, </em>50 P.3d 218 (Okla.2002). In <em>Durant, </em>a terminated police officer who was a member of the System claimed that \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B) required the city that employed him to convene a board of review to hear an appeal of his discharge and determine whether he was fired for cause. The Oklahoma Supreme Court agreed, and the court overruled <em>Rains </em>and held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">Section 50-123 is not ambiguous, and it is clearly intended to protect policemen who are members of the [System] from arbitrary discharge from employment. Contrary to the City\u2019s assertions that these members are at-will employees, the statute restricts the reason for their discharge to \u201cfor cause\u201d and ensures that all members will have a right to appeal the discharge from employment. This accords members a legitimate expectation of continued employment until \u201ccause\u201d for discharge is shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">We hold that section 50-123 protects a member\u2019s right to continue in his employment in the absence of a showing of cause, and the board of review has the authority to pass on the merits of the discharge decision.... To the extent <em>Rains </em>states the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision creates an interest only in a member\u2019s pension and retirement benefits, and not in the continued employment itself, it is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 221-22, 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">After the Allens filed a supplemental brief informing this court of the Oklahoma Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Durant, </em>we ordered defendants to file a supplemental brief addressing <em>Durant. </em>In their supplemental brief, defendants argue that <em>Durant </em>is distinguishable from the circumstances in this case. We disagree, and we conclude that the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on Allen\u2019s procedural due process claim must be reversed in light of <em>Durant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b490-13\">First, defendants argue that police chiefs such as Allen are employees at will who can be terminated without cause, citing <em>Hall v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>617 P.2d 196, 200 (Okla.1980) and <em>Lane v. Town of Dover, </em>761 F.Supp. 768, 770-71 (W-D.Okla.1991), <em>aff'd, </em>951 F.2d 291 (10th Cir.1991) (per curiam). Defendants reliance on <em>Hall </em>and <em>Lane </em>is misplaced. In both <em>Hall </em>and <em>Lane, </em>the courts held that \u00a7 10-113(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>does not provide police officers with a property right in their employment, and the courts applied this rule to the police chiefs who were the plaintiffs in those cases.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Hall, </em>617 P.2d at 198-200; <em>Lane, </em>761 F.Supp. at 770-71. But neither court addressed the entirely separate issue of whether police officers who are members of the System have a property right in their employment by virtue of \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B). In addition, in <em>Durant, </em>the Oklahoma Supreme Court specifically acknowledged its holding in <em>Hall. See Durant, </em>50 P.3d at 221. However, the court concluded that \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B) take precedence over \u00a7 10-113(1) in cases involving police officers who are members of the System since \u00a7 10-113(1) expressly provides that it is limited to situations which are not \u201cotherwise provided by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Second, defendants argue that <em>Durant </em>is distinguishable because the police officer in <em>Durant </em>lost his ability to participate in the System as a result of his termination. By contrast, defendants claim that \u201c[n]othing in the City\u2019s termination of Mr. Allen deprived him of participation in the [System].\u201d Aplee. Supp. Br. at 3. This argument is without merit because the court in <em>Durant </em>did not base its decision on the fact that the terminated officer\u2019s pension rights had been adversely impacted. Instead, the court based its holding on the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B), <em>see Durant, </em>50 P.3d at 221-22, and the court only noted, without any specific discussion of the issue, that the officer had alleged he was no longer able to participate in the System as a result of his termination, <em>see id. </em>at 220.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, even if <em>Durant </em>requires that a police officer\u2019s pension rights must be adversely affected by a termination decision before he is entitled to the protections of \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B), we hold that Allen\u2019s rights under the System were sufficiently impacted by virtue of the fact that his five-year deferred pension option, and all of the benefits under the System that were derived therefrom, were cut short as a result of his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Finally, defendants claim that, even if <em>Durant </em>is controlling, they \u201cshould be able to show that [they] afforded Mr. Allen the process which was due him and that he waived his right to appeal the decision of the City Manager.\u201d Aplee. Supp. Br. at 4. We agree that defendants should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the opportunity to pursue these issues on remand, and we leave their resolution to the district court. In addition, the court will need to again consider whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Allens\u2019 state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The judgment of the district court is REVERSED, and this matter is REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\">. In their supplemental brief, defendants also argue that <em>Durant </em>involved a regular police officer, as opposed to a chief of police, and defendants claim that, under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 51-102(1), a chief of police does not possess the same rights as a regular police officer. This argument is without merit because \u00a7 51-102(1) is part of the Oklahoma municipal code provisions that govern collective bargaining issues among paid fire and police departments, and it has nothing to do with the issues in this case. Further, there is no indication in <em>Durant </em>or in any of the other pertinent Oklahoma decisions that \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B) somehow provide greater protections to regular police officers than to police chiefs. Thus, we conclude that <em>Durant\u2019s </em>interpretation of \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B) applies with full force and effect to terminated police chiefs such as Allen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b491-10\">. In <em>Durant, </em>the court concluded its analysis by noting that its interpretation of \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B) was supported by its prior decision in <em>Ruddell v. City of Jenks ex rel. Dashner, 556 P.2d 999, </em>1003 (Okla.1976) (holding, under prior statute, that terminated police officer had right to appeal termination decision to board of review where officer alleged substantial damage to his pension rights). <em>See Durant, </em>50 P.3d at 223. However, the court simply cited <em>Ruddell </em>as a case where pension rights were \"involved,\u201d and the court did not state that a termination decision must have an adverse impact on a police officer\u2019s pension rights before the protections of \u00a7 50-123(A) and (B) are triggered. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
