After the case was removed to federal court, Doc. 1 (08 C 869), Thorncreek Management, LLC, filed an intervenor complaint, Doc. 69 (08 C 869), and Thorncreek II counterclaimed against the Village and filed third-party claims against Village officials, Doc. 102 (08 C 869). In February 2008, Thorncreek Apartments III, LLC, and Thorncreek Management filed' suit in federal court against the Village and its officials. Doc. 1 (08 C 1225). And in July 2008, Thorn-creek Apartments I, LLC, and Thorncreek Management filed a materially identical suit in federal court. Doc. 1 (08 C 4303). For ease of reference, and unless otherwise indicated, the Thorncreek entities and Atlantic will be referred to collectively as \u201cThorncreek,\u201d the Village parties will be referred to collectively as \u201cthe Village,\u201d Thorncreek\u2019s claims and counterclaims will be referred to simply as \u201cclaims,\u201d and all docket entries will be to Case 08 C 1255. A two-week jury trial has been set for April 7, 2014. Doc.189.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Thorncreek\u2019s claims against the Village, which are brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1986, and Illinois law, arise from the Village\u2019s denial of Thorncreek\u2019s requests for licenses to operate a multifamily dwelling, denial of \u201ccertificates of occupancy\u201d required to house new tenants, promulgation and allegedly discriminatory enforcement of an electricity ordinance, and denial of a conditional use permit for Thorncreek\u2019s leasing office. Put simply, Thorncreek alleges that the Village targeted it because the vast majority of its tenants were African-American. Now before the court are the Village\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Doc. 142, and Thorncreek\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment as to liability, Doc. 140. By agreement of the parties, the summary judgment proceedings in all three cases (08 C 869, 08 C 1225, and 08 C 4303) have been consolidated for decision in 08 C 1225 before the undersigned judge. For the following reasons, Thorncreek\u2019s motion is denied, and the Village\u2019s motion is granted in part and denied in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">\u201cWith cross summary judgment motions, [the court] constructs] all facts and inferences therefrom in favor of the party against whom the motion under consideration is made.\u201d <em>In re United Air Lines, Inc., </em>453 F.3d 463, 468 (7th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because Thorncreek\u2019s motion will be denied summarily and only the Village\u2019s motion will be considered on the merits, the following sets forth the material facts as favorably to Thorncreek as the record and Local Rule 56.1 permit. <em>See Hanners v. Trent, </em>674 F.3d 683, 691 (7th Cir.2012); <em>Mays v. BNSF Ry. Co., </em>2013 WL 4804839, at *1 (N.D.Ill. Sept. 9, 2013). That the court at this juncture must assume the truth of those facts should not be taken as an endorsement thereof. <em>See Smith v. Bray, </em>681 F.3d 888, 892 (7th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>A. The Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">The Village is a municipality in Illinois. Lawrence Kerestes has been the Village Building Commissioner since 1984 and Director of Community Development since 2004. Tom Mick has been the Village Manager since January 2005. Mae Brandon, Bonita Dillard, Gary Kopycinski, Kenneth W. Kramer, Robert McCray, and Georgia O\u2019Neill are Village Trustees. John A. Ostenburg has been the Village President since 1999. Sheila McGann is the Village Clerk. Thorncreek is a limited liability company that at all relevant times owned and operated a complex of rental townhomes in Park Forest; the complex includes 632 units and is divided into sectors commonly known as Areas F, G, and H. David Clapper is a principal of Thorn-creek, and Pat Clapper works for Thorn-creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">B. The Village Code</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Thorncreek has from time to time applied under the Village Code for licenses to operate multifamily dwellings in the Village. Section 22-468(a) of the Code states that the \u201capplicant shall be required to demonstrate the applicant\u2019s qualifications ... either by previous or other experiences or by submitting a plan of management and operation to be approved by the village building commissioner.\u201d Doc. 157-5 at 76. Section 22-468(b) states that the Village Manager shall review each application and that where the \u201capplication [is] for a renewal of a license,\u201d the renewal shall be issued if \u201cthe applicant is deemed to have made a good faith effort to comply with\u201d the Code. <em>Ibid. </em>Section 22-469 states that \u201crenewal [of such licenses] is required on an annual basis.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Section 22-472 provides that multifamily dwelling license applications must \u201cset forth the race, sex, marital status, age -or national origin of the occupants of the rental units.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77. Mick, the Village Manager, typically would delegate the review of such applications to other departments. Doc. 150-5 at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">Section 18-255 of the Code provides that a dwelling unit may not be occupied until the Building Commissioner issues a certificate of occupancy for the unit. Doc. 149-1 at 31. The Commissioner issues certificates of occupancy after the Commissioner or a designee inspects dwellings to ensure that there are no Code violations. <em>Ibid. </em>A temporary certificate may be issued if the inspection reveals violations, provided that the unit\u2019s owner takes steps to ensure abatement of the violations. <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">C.Events in 2005</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">The Village began to focus on Thorn-creek in 2005, when 90-95% of Thorn-creek\u2019s residents were African-American. The Village disliked the predominantly African-American makeup of Thorncreek and wanted to reduce the number of African-American residents. According to testimony from Kerestes, the Building Commissioner, the Village was concerned that Thorncreek\u2019s racial makeup was \u201chighly skewed,\u201d believed that there were \u201ctoo many blacks living in Thorncreek Apartments as opposed to the rest of the community,\u201d and preferred that there be \u201cfewer black people\u201d at Thorncreek. Doc. 150-7 at 39-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">On September 16, 2005, Mick emailed the Trustees about a meeting with Thorn-creek representatives at which he had conveyed his \u201cfeelings about the ... quality of [Thorncreek\u2019s] tenants\u201d and asserted that the \u201ctenants [are] draining our community\u2019s businesses, schools and local government services.\u201d Doc. 157-1 at 16-17. Three months earlier, Mick had emailed the Trustees and Ostenburg, the Village President, to say that a recent court ruling \u201cmight [be] another tool in our arsenal if we can\u2019t convince [David] Clapper nicely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>part with his property:\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. On September 30, 2005, Mick\u2019s assistant wrote a memorandum to Mick stating in relevant part: \u201cStaff met with management ... from Thorn Creek Townhouses to offer suggestions ... that- will enable them to attract a more diverse resident base.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31. On October 4, 2005., Mick reported to the Trustees that Thorncreek was taking steps to \u201cdiversify [its] tenant base\u201d by arranging to advertise in a Hispanic-edition magazine. Doc. 151-10 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The Village routinely cited minor or manufactured infractions during unit inspections at Thorncreek as grounds for not issuing certificates of occupancy. Inspectors scratched varnish and claimed there was flaking, pulled a toilet from the wall, cited units as having inoperable furnaces without conducting testing, and kicked bricks to crumble mortar. The Village\u2019s Chief Building Inspector denied certificates of occupancy on the ground that certain trees oh the property were diseased or dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Thorncreek submitted its license ren\u00e9wal application for 2005 without providing demographic information about its tenants. On March 24, 2005, Kerestes wrote to Pat Clapper expressing \u201cserious concern\u201d about Thorncreek operating without a business license, stating that Thorn-creek\u2019s application was missing \u201cthe required Fair Housing\u201d form and was thus incomplete, and warning that additional inspections of ready units would be contingent upon inspectors not finding any housing code violations. Doc. 157-1 at 8. Thorncreek protested that providing demographic information would violate state and federal anti-discrimination laws, but stated that it had \u201cneither the funds nor the time to contest the ordinance,\u201d agreed to collect and provide such information, and asked that it be allowed to do so as,to new residents rather than existing ones. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. On March 31, 2005, the Village agreed to allow Thorncreek to provide the information on a rolling basis. <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">On November 8, 2005, Mick emailed the Trustees and Ostenburg to report that Thorncreek had requested more inspections per week. Mick stated that he told Thorncreek that he \u201cwould like them to start leveraging other properties in their portfolio to do millions of dollars in property upgrades\u201d and that \u201cVillage staff would be glad to bring interested developers ... that would be willing to huy tracks of property.\u201d Doc. 157-1 at 38. On December 16, 2005, Mick reported to the Trustees that Thorncreek was \u201closing revenue with no occupancy\u201d due to a high vacancy rate and that he had told Thorncreek that he wanted multimillion dollar property upgrades .and was willing to consider providing. more inspections if Thorncreek paid for them. <em>Id. </em>at 45. In. the meantime, Thorncreek applied, to. Lehman Brothers Bank for a refinancing-loan for Area F.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">On December 6, 2005, Keretes advised the Trustees to pass an ordinance that would require operators of multifamily dwellings to upgrade a unit\u2019s electrical service to a minim\u00fam of 100 amperes upon a change of occupancy. Doc. 150-8 at 27-28. Kerestes told the Trustees that the ordinance was necessary to address technical and safety concerns. <em>Ibid.; </em>Doc. 150-7 at 33-34. On December 12, 2005, the Trustees enacted Ordinance No. 1835, which implemented Kerestes\u2019s recommendation. The ordinance did not affect Areas F and H, whose units all had at least 100-ampere electrical service. The units in Area G, by contrast, had. 60-ampere service. In a March 2006 letter to Mick, Pat Clapper wrote: \u201cThe electrical upgrades to the \u2018G\u2019 Courts place a serious financial burden upon us.... To the extent the electrical upgrades can be made within each unit, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>will make [them] prior to each new resident moving in.\u201d Doc. 146-9 at 3. At her deposition, Pat Clapper testified that as of 2008, Thorncreek \u201chad not done anything with the electrical\u201d because, the upgrade \u201cwasn\u2019t necessary\u201d from a safety perspective. Doc. 150-3 at 33.,</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Another housing complex in the Village, Autumn Ridge Apartments, had 60-am-pere electrical service in its 304 apartment units and 80 townhomes. The owner of Autumn Ridge, Andrew Brown, told Mick in December 2007 that compliance with Ordinance No. 1835 was \u201cessentially economically impossible\u201d for Autumn Ridge and \u25a0 that \u201cwe cannot afford to pay for compliance.\u201d Doc. 154-1 at 2. Brown stated that Autumn Ridge had a different means of providing heating and cooling to its residents and that there was no need for an electrical upgrade. <em>Ibid. </em>The Village agreed not to enforce the ordinance against Autumn Ridge for ten years to allow it to phase in the upgrades. Doc. 155-4 at 40. The agreement was made orally and informally between Brown and Mick because a formal variance from the Village \u201cwas [not] going to be forthcoming.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Autumn Ridge was never denied a license, even when it had not yet complied with the electrical ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 38. And the Village did not refuse to issue certificates of occupancy or to conduct inspections as a result of Autumn Ridge\u2019s noncompliance with the ordinance. <em>Id. </em>at 39. Thorncreek received no such exemption from the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">D. Events in 2006 and 2007</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">On January 25, 2006, Thorncreek submitted one renewal application on behalf of all three properties for a 2006 multifamily dwelling license. On January 27, 2006, Kerestes wrote to Mick, stating that \u201cit appears that we do not hav[e] any reason not to issue the- license and will do so.\u201d Doe. 147-14 at 2. On March 9, 2006, Kerestes emailed Mick, reporting that Lehman Brothers had expressed its \u201cserious concern\u201d about the lack of a license and stating: \u201cI have the feeling the loan is not going to be issued.\u201d Doc. 157-1 at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">In a March 2006 meeting with Pat Clapper, Kerestes stated that the racial profile of Areas F, G, and H changed drastically soon after it was acquired by Thorncreek. Kerestes also said that simply remedying the existing Code violations would -not allow Thorncreek to obtain a 2006 business license and that the Village \u201cwanted a plan that would include a lot more capital improvements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66-67. Kerestes told Mick that he had told Thorncreek that \u201conly after an acceptable plan has been submitted[ ] would the Village consider issuance of the management license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. Kerestes added: \u201cI believe they [Thorncreek] are extremely concerned about not getting their loan.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis omitted). At another March 2006 meeting, Kerestes told Pat Clapper that since David Clapper had acquired Thorn-creek, the racial makeup of Park Forest had changed from \u201c58% white, 39% black\u201d to \u201c90% black and 10% white\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll this change was first observed in Thorn Creek.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72. Kerestes added that the improvements at Thorncreek sought by the Village would draw a \u201cbetter clientele\u201d to the complex. <em>Id. </em>at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">On March 14, 2006, Pat Clapper submitted a revised Management Plan for all three Thorncreek properties. Doc. 146-9 at 2-4; Doc. 150-3 at 25. In so doing, she stated that \u201c[w]e have yet to receive a [2006] license or a written statement as to why we are not entitled to a license.\u201d Doc. 146-8 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">On April 19, 2006, in a letter sent by Mick and copied to Ostenburg, the Trustees, and Kerestes, the Village formally denied Thorncreek\u2019s 2006 renewal applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>tion \u201cpending correction of the outstanding maintenance code violations that exist on the property,\u201d which were listed in an attachment to the letter. Doc. 146-10 at 2-10. On May 5, 2006, Pat Clapper wrote to Mick and Kerestes, asking again for a license renewal. The letter offered to escrow 125 percent of the estimated costs of remedying the Code violations identified in Mick\u2019s letter, claimed that there were no outstanding Code violations when Thorn-creek submitted its 2006 application, and stated that Lehman Brothers would provide refinancing for Area F only if Thorn-creek possessed a license at the time of closing. Doc. 157-2 at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">On May 9, 2006, Mick wrote to Ostenburg regarding the unrenewed license and a donation that' Thorncreek had made to the Village, stating at one point: \u201cPerhaps my thoughts are getting clouded with my disdain for David Clapper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. On June 22, 2006, the Village Attorney wrote to Kerestes and Mick, noting that Thorn-creek \u201carguably shows good faith to bring Area F into compliance,\u201d but that Thorn-creek did not address Areas G and H and that a consolidated application had been submitted for all three areas. <em>Id. </em>at 21. On June 23, 2006, Mick wrote to Pat Clapper, stating that her May 5 letter was inadequate because it did not address violations in Areas G and H. Doc. 147-1 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">On October 31, 2006, Mick wrote to Pat Clapper, stating that the Village would issue a license for Area F \u201cprovided that a separate application for license is submitted for each of the three Areas.\u201d Doc. 147-2 at 2. On November 3, 2006, the Village issued Area F a 2007 license. In early 2007, Area F was sold to a third party. Doc. 159 at \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">On January 29, 2007, copying Mick and the Village attorney, Kerestes informed Pat Clapper that Areas G and H were out of compliance because they had not submitted applications, which he said- had been \u201csent out to\u201d Thorncreek on November 30, 2006. Doc. 147-3 at 2. As a result, Mick stated, \u201cthe village cannot approve any Certificates of Occupancy\u201d and \u201cany inspections would be pointless.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In fact, the Village had not sent Thorncreek the application' forms that Kerestes claimed were sent. Doc. 152-3 at 2; Doc. 159 at \u00b6 37. Thorncreek ultimately submitted a 2007 application for Areas G and H, including a Management Plan and a Fair Housing form. Doc. 152-3 at 2. On May 7, 2007, the Chief Building Inspector emailed Kerestes to say that she recommended issuing Thorncreek a license for Area H. Doc. 157-3 at 61. Kerestes forwarded Fisher\u2019s email to Mick, noting that \u201c[i]t appears as though Area H may be acceptable to issue the license\u201d but that Area G had still not complied with the electrical ordinance. <em>Ibid. </em>No business license was. issued for Area G or Area H.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">In February 2007, Thorncreek applied for a conditional use permit to use a residential townhome located in Area G as a leasing office for Areas G and H. Doc. 147-5. In early March 2007, Kerestes requested additional information regarding plans and upgrades to the leasing office. Doc. 147-6.\u2019 In late March 2007, Pat Clapper responded to the information request, stating' that some upgrades would be made and that others would be made \u201cwhere required.\u201d Doc. 147-7. Then, in early May 2007, Pat Clapper submitted a revised petition for a conditional use permit. Doc. 147-8. On June 5, 2007, the Village Plan commission met to discuss the permit. Doc. 153-2. On August 31, 2007, Mick emailed the Trustees, noting that the conditional use permit was scheduled for consideration at a September 4 board meeting, and stating that the petition could be denied for any of several reasons. Doc. 153-4. At the September 4 meeting, Os<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>tenburg noted that there was little, if any, support for the conditional use permit and that the item would not be placed on the agenda at a subsequent meeting. Doc. 153-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">E. Events in 2008</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">In an email to the Trustees on February 22, 2008, Mick reported that Thorncreek was trying to sell Area H and remarked: \u201cIt is my hope that they are successful in their endeavor. Perhaps the Village\u2019s collective efforts (Troubled Building and Property Task Force, citing them, pursuing action in local court, denying their Business Office relocation into the G-Courts, cutting off change of occupancy inspections in the G-Courts due to no updating of electrical service to 100 AMP service, etc.) are beginning to have the desired effect we were seeking. That is, we hope to find as many ways as possible to help them see that their business practices are neither appreciated by the Village and the residents as a whole nor are we willing to stand idly by and let them continue to be a drain on our community.\u201d Doc. 151-6 at 3-4. The same day, Mick wrote an email to the Village Police Chief regarding search warrants executed at Thorncreek units and whether Thorncreek had conducted criminal background checks on the residents involved. Mick asked Fleming whether he could share details on the individuals involved with Thorncreek, stating: \u201cI enjoy shoving it up their ass in a firm but diplomatic and professional manner.\u201d Doc. 151-8 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">In April 2008, Thorncreek\u2019s lenders foreclosed on Areas G and H. Doc. 157-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">I. Thorncreek\u2019s Summary Judgment Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Thorncreek\u2019s brief in support of its summary judgment motion, Doc. 144, cites to raw record materials rather than to its Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) statement, Doc. 141. It has long and repeatedly been held that this practice violates Local Rule 56.1. <em>See Jacobeit v. Rich Twp. High Sch. Dist. 227, </em>2012 WL 1044509, at *2 (N.D.Ill.

The Seventh Circuit characterized this remark as \u201cdicta,\u201d and expressed skepticism as to its precedential value, in <em>Triad Associates, Inc. v. Robinson, </em>10 F.3d 492, 498 n. 5 (7th Cir.1993). In so doing, the Seventh Circuit observed that <em>Village of Arlington Heights </em>(1) did not actually deny standing to the plaintiff corporation on the ground that a corporation cannot be the direct target of racial discrimination, and (2) in fact \u201cdid \u2018not decide whether the circumstances of this case would justify permitting [the plaintiff] to assert the constitutional rights of its prospective minority tenants\u2019 because in the case there was \u2018one individual plaintiff who has demonstrated standing to assert these rights as his own.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Vill. of Arlington Heights, </em>429 U.S. at 263-64, 97 S.Ct. 555) (Seventh Circuit\u2019s alterations omitted).

Other federal appellate decisions likewise have held that an equal protection claim lies for corporations and individuals targeted because of their association with members of a suspect class. <em>See Young Apartments, Inc. v.

Although Jupiter\u2019s alleged animosity toward its Hispanic residents is at the heart of this claim, Young Apartments seeks to remedy its own injury. Courts have routinely found that a business has standing to bring \u00a7 1983 claims against state officials who are harming its business by discriminating against its customers. This rule of law is based on the uncontroversial principle that it is unconstitutional for a state actor, motivated by discriminatory animus, to interfere with an individual\u2019s right to contract or associate with members of a protected class.\u201d) (citing cases); <em>Baytree of Inver</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>rary Realty Partners v.

This claim requires proof that the Village had a \u201cracially discriminatory intent or purpose\u201d to treat Thorncreek differently because its tenants were predominantly African American. <em>City of Cuyahoga Falls v.

The strict scrutiny standard applies to this claim. <em>See Srail, </em>588 F.3d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">In the equal protection section of its initial brief, the Village does not dispute that race-based equal protection claims are subject to strict scrutiny and does not contend that its actions survive strict scrutiny; rather, staking its defense on the premise that Thorncreek is limited to a class-of-one claim, the Village argues only that its actions had a rational basis. Doc. 156 at 22-35. Accordingly, the Village has forfeited for summary judgment purposes any argument that its actions could survive strict scrutiny. <em>See Costello v. Grundon, </em>651 F.3d 614, 635 (7th Cir.2011) (\u201cAs the moving party, the [defendant] had the initial burden of identifying the basis for seeking summary judgment.\u201d); <em>Sublett v.

Waukegan Pub. Sch. Disk 60, </em>924 F.Supp.2d 940, 954 (N.D.Ill.2013). It is true that the Village devoted two paragraphs to strict scrutiny in its reply brief, Doc. 164 at 8-10, but arguments presented for the first time in a reply brief are forfeited. <em>See Narducci v. Moore, </em>572 F.3d 313, 324 (7th Cir.2009) (\u201cthe district court is entitled to find that an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief is forfeited\u201d); <em>Cromeens, Holloman, Sibert, Inc. v.

City of Waukegan, </em>946 F.Supp.2d 780, 788, 2013 WL 2243089, at *6 (N.D.Ill. May 21, 2013). In any event, even putting aside the Village\u2019s forfeiture, the record would permit a reasonable jury to find that the Village targeted Thorncreek for selective enforcement and other mistreatment because of, and not just despite, its predominantly African-American population. <em>See Grutter v. Bollinger, </em>539 U.S. 306, 330, 123 S.Ct. 2325, 156 L.Ed.2d 304 (2003) (holding that \u201coutright racial balancing ... is patently unconstitutional\u201d); <em>Heame v.

The class-of-one doctrine \u201crecognizes that the Equal Protection Clause may give[] rise to a cause of action on behalf of a 'class of one\u2019 where the plaintiff d[oes] not allege membership in a class or group <em>if </em>the plaintiff can show that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\u201d <em>D.B. ex rel. Kurtis B. v. Kopp, </em>725 F.3d 681, 685 (7th Cir.2013) (quoting <em>Olech, </em>528 U.S. at 564, 120 S.Ct. 1073) (some internal quotation marks omitted) (Seventh Circuit\u2019s alterations and emphasis). \u201cStated differently, [the class-of-one theory] holds that the Equal Protection Clause protects] individuals against purely arbitrary government classifications, even when a classification consists of singling out just one person for different treatment for arbitrary and irrational purposes.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">The Village first argues that Thorncreek has failed to identify a \u201csimilarly situated\u201d entity that received better treatment with respect to dwelling licenses and enforcement of the electricity ordinance. Doc. 156 at 21-22. Recognizing Thorncreek\u2019s position that it was similarly situated to Autumn Ridge, the Village points to the \u201cphysical differences\u201d between the two complexes, noting that Autumn Ridge consists of 80 townhomes and 304 apartment units in four mid-rise buildings, while Thorncreek consists of three complexes with 632 apartment units and no mid-rise buildings. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 22. The Village\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. Thorncreek and Autumn Ridge are similarly situated in all material respects; they are both large complexes with hundreds of units, and they both are subject to the same electricity ordinance and other regulatory requirements. <em>See Swanson v. City of Chetek, </em>719 F.3d 780, 784 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201cTo achieve clarity [in a class-of-one case], courts look to the treatment of similarly situated individuals: if all principal characteristics of the two individuals are the same, and one received more favorable treatment, this may show there was no proper motivation for the disparate treatment.\u201d). Because the record would allow a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>reasonable jury to find that the Village enforced the electricity ordinance with far more vigor against Thorncreek than against Autumn Ridge, Thorncreek has established for summary judgment purposes that it was treated worse than a similarly situated residential complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">The Village also argues that the record indisputably establishes that it had a rational basis for its decisions regarding Thorncreek. Doc. 156 at 22-27. The standard governing the \u201cno rational basis\u201d element of class-of-one equal protection claims remains in flux in this Circuit. In <em>Del Marcelle v. Brown County Corp., </em>680 F.3d 887 (7th Cir.2012) (en banc), the Seventh Circuit split three ways on that question, with no opinion garnering a majority. As a panel recently summarized the outcome in <em>Del Marcelle:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b881-5\">Some members of the court thought the plaintiff should be required to plead and prove that the disparate treatment was motivated by personal ill will or other illegitimate purpose;' that is, a purpose unrelated to public duty. <em>See id. </em>[at 889] (Posner, J.) (plurality opinion) (writing for four members of the court). Others expressed the view that personal animus or other improper motive is not an element of the claim but just one way to prove that the defendant\u2019s action lacked a rational basis. <em>See id. </em>at 913\u2014 14 (Wood, J., dissenting) (writing for five members of the court). One member of the court concluded that motive or intent \u201chas no role at all\u201d in class-of-one litigation. <em>See id. </em>at 900 (Easterbrook, C.J., concurring in the judgment).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b881-6\"><em>D.B. ex rel. Kurtis B., </em>725 F.3d at 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">There is no need to choose sides here, as Thorncreek\u2019s class-of-one claim survives summary judgment even under the most stringent standard (the one set forth in Judge Posner\u2019s opinion) because the record would permit a reasonable jury to find that the Village\u2019s disparate treatment of Thorncreek was motivated by personal ill will. Mick\u2019s emails to the Trustees revealed his desire to make David Clapper \u201cpart\u201d with his property, expressed his \u201cdisdain\u201d for David Clapper, and stated that he \u201cenjoyfs] shoving it up [Thorn-creek\u2019s] ass.\u201d This evidence suggests that personal animus grounded Mick\u2019s and the Village\u2019s adverse treatment of Thorncreek and David Clapper, and thus is sufficient to establish the \u201cno rational basis\u201d element of Thorncreek\u2019s class-of-one claim. <em>See Hanes v. </em>Zurich, 578 F.3d 491, 492, 494-95 (7th Cir.2009) (refusing to dismiss a class-of-one claim alleging that the police unconstitutionally arrested only the plaintiff during disputes with his neighbor, reasoning that the plaintiff had alleged personal animus); <em>Mathers v. Wright, </em>636 F.3d 396, 400-01 (8th Cir.2011) (holding that the plaintiff stated a class-of-one claim because the defendant\u2019s isolation of plaintiff and refusal to teach her was alleged to have been motivated by personal animus).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-9\">Accordingly, the class-of-one claim survives summary judgment. In closing, it bears mention that the Village might have argued that Thorncreek\u2019s class-of-one claim is fundamentally incompatible with its race-based equal protection claim and that Thorncreek cannot proceed with both. <em>Cf. Castillo v. FBOP, </em>2006 WL 1764400, at *7 (D.N.J. June 23, 2006) (stating that the plaintiff \u201ccannot have it both ways, that is, alleging that he is a member of a suspect class and yet claiming that he is in the \u2018class of one\u2019 \u201d). The merits of that argument will not be addressed because the Village did not make it, resulting in a forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">2. Section 1985 Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">Section 1985(3) of Title 42 provides a cause of action to a party injured when \u201ctwo or more persons .... conspire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>... for the purpose of depriving ... any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3); <em>see Hartman v. Bd. of Trs. of Cmty. Coll. Dist. No. 508, </em>4 F.3d 465, 469 (7th Cir.1993). In opposing Thorncreek\u2019s \u00a7 1985 claim, the Village invokes the \u201cintra-corporate conspiracy\u201d doctrine. Doc. 156 at 28. The doctrine provides that \u201cmanagers of a corporation jointly pursuing its lawful business do not become \u2018conspirators\u2019 when acts within the scope of their employment are said to be discriminatory,\u201d <em>Travis v. Gary Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc., </em>921 F.2d 108, 110 (7th Cir.1990), and applies with full force to government entities like the Village, <em>see Wright v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Children &amp; Family Servs., </em>40 F.3d 1492, 1508 (7th Cir.1994); <em>Allen v. City of Chicago, </em>828 F.Supp. 543, 564 (N.D.Ill.1993) (\u201cboth [the mayor and the commissioner] and the unnamed city aldermen are members of the same municipal corporation, <em>i.e., </em>the City of Chicago\u201d). Thorncreek implicitly concedes that Defendants are all part of the same municipal corporation, but seeks refuge in two recognized exceptions to the doctrine. Doc. 160 at 27-28. Those exceptions apply: (1) where \u201ccorporate employees are shown to have been motivated solely by personal bias\u201d; and (2) when there exists an \u201cextensive discriminatory conspiracy\u201d that \u201cwas part of some broader discriminatory pattern ... permeating] the ranks of the organization\u2019s employees.\u201d <em>Hartman, </em>4 F.3d at 470-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The record would permit a reasonable jury to find that the second exception applies. Viewed with all factual disputes resolved and inferences drawn in Thorn-creek\u2019s favor, the record shows that the Village was displeased with the number of African-Americans residents at Thorn-creek and responded with actions designed to disfavor Thorncreek. Those actions were committed and approved by numerous Village officials, including Mick, Kerestes, Ostenburg, the inspectors, and the Trustees. This fact pattern qualifies as an \u201cextensive discriminatory conspiracy\u201d that \u201cpermeat[ed] the ranks of the [Village\u2019s] employees.\u201d <em>Ibid.-, see Doe 20 v. Bd. of Educ. of Cmty. Unit Sch. Dist.

The Village\u2019s only argument for summary judgment on the \u00a7 1986 claim is that Thorncreek has no viable federal equal protection claim or \u00a7 1985 claim. Doc. 156 at 29. Because Thorncreek\u2019s federal equal protection and \u00a7 1985 claims survive summary judgment, the Village\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>4. Illinois Equal Protection Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b883-4\">The Village argues that because equal protection claims under the Illinois Constitution are governed by the same standard as federal equal protection claims, and because Thorncreek\u2019s federal equal protection claims are meritless, summary judgment should be granted on the Thorncreek\u2019s Illinois equal protection claims as well. Doc. 156 at 27. Illinois equal protection claims generally are governed by the same standard as federal equal protection claims, <em>see Jarabe v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, </em>172 Ill.2d 345, 216 Ill.Dec. 833, 666 N.E.2d 1, 3 (1996) (\u201cThis court uses the same analysis in assessing equal protection claims under both the federal and the state Constitutions.\u201d), though the Supreme Court of Illinois recently suggested that the state equal protection clause may be more expansive than its federal counterpart, <em>see Hope Clinic for Women, Ltd. v. Flores, </em>2013 IL 112673, 372 Ill.Dec. 255, 991 N.E.2d 745, 764-65 (Ill.2013). Accordingly, because Thorn-creek\u2019s federal equal protection claims survive summary judgment, so do the Illinois claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">5. ICRA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">The ICRA provides in relevant part that \u201c[n]o unit of State, county, or local government in Illinois shall ... subject a person to discrimination ... on the grounds of that person\u2019s race.\u201d 740 ILCS 23/5(a)(1); <em>see Jackson v. Cerpa, </em>696 F.Supp.2d 962, 964 (N.D.Ill.2010) (holding that the ICRA \u201cmerely created a new venue in which plaintiffs could pursue ... discrimination actions that had been available to them in the federal courts\u201d) (quoting I<em>ll. Native Am. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Univ. of Ill. Bd. of Trs., </em>368 Ill.App.3d 321, 305 Ill.Dec. 655, 856 N.E.2d 460, 467 (2006)). The Village argues that the individual defendants may not be held liable under the ICRA because the statute applies only to a \u201cunit of ... local government.\u201d Doc. 156 at 43-44. Thorncreek does not respond to this argument, Doc. 160 at 38-39, thus forfeiting the point. <em>See Milligan v. Bd. of Trs. of S. Ill. Univ., </em>686 F.3d 378, 386 (7th Cir.2012); <em>Alioto v. Toum of Lisbon, </em>651 F.3d 715, 721 (7th Cir.2011); <em>Humphries v. CBOCS W., Inc., </em>474 F.3d 387, 407 (7th Cir.2007) (\u201cWe agree with the district court\u2019s determination that [the plaintiff] waived (forfeited would be the better term) his discrimination claim by devoting only a skeletal argument in response to Cracker Barrel\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>553 U.S. 442, 128 S.Ct. 1951, 170 L.Ed.2d 864 (2008). The Village\u2019s argument is correct on the merits in any event. <em>See Neuman v. United States, </em>2007 WL 3407442, at *3 (S.D.Ill. Nov. 15, 2007) (ICRA \u201cprovides a cause of action against only three potential parties: the State of Illinois, its counties, and its local governments\u201d). Accordingly, the ICRA claim may proceed only against the Village.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">The Village also argues that Thorncreek cannot pursue an ICRA claim because it is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Doc. 156 at 44. The Village states the argument without offering any support, and thus must be understood to have incorporated by reference the \u201cstanding\u201d argument it made in opposition to Thorncreek\u2019s race-based equal protection claim. That argument fails for the reasons set forth in Section II.A.1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\">B. Due Process and Takings Claims (Counts II, III, VII, IX)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">Thorncreek also alleges that the Village\u2019s use of its regulatory apparatus to interfere with Thorncreek\u2019s use of its land and property violated the substantive and procedural due process guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>States Constitution and article I, \u00a7 2, of the Illinois Constitution, and the Takings Clauses of the Fifth Amendment (as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment) of the United States Constitution and article I, \u00a7 15, of the Illinois Constitution. Doc. 17 at \u00b6\u00b6 145-188, 204-207, 213-221. The Village seeks summary judgment under the ripeness doctrine set forth in <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, </em>473 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985), arguing that Thorncreek has not sought and been denied compensation at the state level. Doc. 156 at 29-30, 36-38. Because the Village is right that <em>Williamson County </em>bars Thorncreek\u2019s takings and due process claims, there is no need to reach the Village\u2019s merits arguments on those claims, <em>Id. </em>at 30-35, 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">In <em>Williamson County, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court articulated a special ripeness doctrine for constitutional property rights claims which precludes federal courts from adjudicating land use disputes until: (1) the regulatory agency has had an opportunity to make a considered definitive decision, and (2) the property owner exhausts available state remedies for compensation.\u201d <em>Muscarello v. Ogle Cnty. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>610 F.3d 416, 422 (7th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Forseth v. Vill. of Sussex, </em>199 F.3d 363, 368 (7th Cir.2000)); <em>see also Gamble v. Eau Claire Cnty., </em>5 F.3d 285, 286 (7th Cir.1993) (\u201cthe landowner cannot complain that his constitutional right has been denied until he exhausts his remedies for obtaining a compensation award or equivalent relief from the state\u201d). The doctrine applies not only to takings claims, but also to substantive and procedural due process claims that challenge the government\u2019s regulatory interference with the plaintiffs use of its land. <em>See Forseth, </em>199 F.3d at 369 (\u201cwe have yet to excuse any substantive due process claim in the land-use context from <em>Williamson\u2019s </em>ripeness requirements\u201d); <em>Hager v. City of W. Peona, </em>84 F.3d 865, 869 (7th Cir.1996) (\u201cThe exhaustion requirement of <em>Williamson County </em>applies whether plaintiffs claim an uncompensated taking, inverse condemnation, or due process violation. That plaintiffs have sued for \u2018inverse condemnation\u2019 with a reference to due process, whether substantive or procedural, therefore does not alter our analysis.... [The plaintiffs] must first pursue their claims, whether in the form of a takings challenge or a due process claim, .in Illinois state court.\u201d) (footnote and internal citations omitted); <em>River Park, Inc. v. City of Highland Park, </em>23 F.3d 164, 167 (7th Cir.1994) (\u201c[A] property owner may not avoid <em>Williamson </em>by applying the label \u2018substantive due process\u2019 to the claim. So too with the label \u2018procedural due process.\u2019 Labels do not matter. A person contending that state or local regulation of the use of land has gone overboard must repair to state court.\u201d) (citation omitted). The doctrine also applies to state law takings and due process claims. <em>See B. Willis, C.P.A., Inc. v. BNSF Ry. Corp., </em>531 F.3d 1282, 1298 n. 19 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cIn this case, because all of Willis\u2019 federal and state claims stem from the Oklahoma eminent domain proceedings, <em>Williamson </em>County\u2019s ripeness rule applies,, requiring Willis to conclude the state condemnation proceedings before those claims will be ripe for adjudication in federal court.\u201d); <em>Hamed v. City of Belleville, </em>2010 WL 3359460, at *4 (S.D.Ill. Aug. 23, 2010) (holding under <em>Williamson County </em>that \u201cPlaintiffs takings claims, whether labeled as a Fifth Amendment takings elaim, a state inverse condemnation claim, or a due process [claim], are not ripe for adjudication\u201d). There is an exception to the doctrine \u201cif state law does not provide relief,\u201d but the Seventh Circuit has held that \u201cIllinois provides ample process for a person seeking just compensation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number><em>Muscarello, </em>610 F.3d at 422 (citing 735 ILCS 30/10-5-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">The applicability of the <em>Williamson County </em>doctrine to Thornereek\u2019s takings claims is beyond any reasonable dispute. Thorncreek argues, however, that the doctrine does not apply to its due process claims because those claims \u201cpresent genuine disputes as to whether the [Village] violated [Thorncreek\u2019s] constitutional rights to follow the Village\u2019s ordinances with respect to granting business licenses \u2014 a property interest.\u201d Doc. 160 at 29. Thorncreek\u2019s description of its due process claims is accurate; the Village is alleged to have wrongfully applied its ordinances against Thorncreek, with the result that Thorncreek has been hindered in its pursuit of its residential real estate business. Yet Thorncreek\u2019s conclusion is wrong; its due process claim is precisely the sort of due process claim that falls within the scope of the <em>Williamson County </em>doctrine. <em>See Unity Ventures v. Lake Cnty., </em>841 F.2d 770, 774-75 (7th Cir.1988) (holding that although the plaintiffs raised a substantive due process claim, not a takings claim, <em>Williamson County </em>still applied).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Thorncreek also contends that <em>Williamson County </em>is inapposite because no \u201cfinal decision\u201d was made by the Trustees regarding its applications, particularly its application for a conditional use permit. Doc. 160 at 29. That argument fails as well. In <em>River Park, </em>the plaintiff argued that the defendant municipality would not give it a final decision on its zoning application. 23 F.3d at 165.- The Seventh Circuit held that <em>Williamson County </em>still applied, reasoning: \u201cIllinois provided [the plaintiff] with ample means to contest the runaround it was receiving at the hands of [the municipality]. If because the City refused to make a formal decision the standard means were cut off, the common law writ of certiorari remained. The opportunity to apply for that writ is enough----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 167 (citing <em>Graff v. City of Chicago, </em>9 F.3d 1309, 1323-25 (7th Cir.1993) (en banc)); <em>see also Covington Ct., Ltd. v. Vill. of Oak Brook, </em>77 F.3d 177, 179 (7th Cir.1996) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Finally, Thorncreek contends that in Case 08 C 869 \u2014 where the Village sued Thorncreek first \u2014 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a) required Thorncreek to bring its due process and takings claims as compulsory counterclaims. Doc. 160 at 29-30, 32. Rule 13(a) provides that \u201c[a] pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that \u2014 at the time of its service \u2014 the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a). Even if Thorn-creek\u2019s due process and takings claims in Case No. 08 C 869 were compulsory counterclaims, <em>Williamson County </em>defeats them. The Rules Enabling Act provides that the Rules \u201cshall not ... modify any substantive right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072(b). <em>Williamson County </em>interprets the Fifth Amendment, and its ripeness doctrine has been described by the Seventh Circuit as implicating Article Ill\u2019s limits on the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. <em>See Flying J Inc. v. City of New Haven, </em>549 F.3d 538, 544 (7th Cir.2008) (\u201c[t]he point of <em>Williamson County </em>is that there is no case or controversy within the meaning of Article III until the plaintiff has pursued all available remedies in state court\u201d). Accordingly, the demands of <em>Williamson County </em>could not possibly be negated where takings and due process claims otherwise within its scope are brought by a counter-plaintiff under Rule 13(a) rather than a plaintiff under Rule 7(a)(1). <em>See Sibbach v. Wilson &amp; Co., </em>312 U.S. 1, 9-10, 61 S.Ct. 422, 85 L.Ed. 479 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>(1941) (in rejecting a constitutional challenge to Civil Rules 35 and 37, holding that \u201cCongress has undoubted power to regulate the practice and procedure of federal courts, and may exercise that power by delegating to this or other federal courts authority to make rules <em>not inconsistent with the </em>statutes or <em>Constitution of the United States </em>\u201d) (emphasis , added); <em>cf. FDIC v. Wilson\u2019s Famous Blue Ribbon Meats, Inc., </em>835 F.Supp. 245, 246 (E.D.Pa. 1993) (dismissing a compulsory counterclaim due <em>to </em>the counterclaimant\u2019s failure to exhaust the administrative remedies required by statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">C. <em>Monell </em>Claims Against the Village</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Thorncreek seeks to hold the Village liable for the alleged misconduct of its officials under the municipal liability doctrine of <em>Monell v. Department of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). To state a <em>Monell </em>municipal liability claim, a plaintiff must show \u201cthat an official policy or custom not only caused the constitutional violation, but was the moving force behind it.\u201d <em>Estate of Sims ex rel. Sims v. Cnty. of Bureau, </em>506 F.3d 509, 514 (7th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cAn official policy or custom may be established by means of [1] an express policy, [2] a widespread practice which, although unwritten, is so entrenched and well-known as to carry the force of policy, or [3] through the actions of an individual who possesses the authority to make final policy decisions on behalf of the municipality or corporation.\u201d <em>Rice ex rel. Rice v. Corr. Med. Servs., </em>675 F.3d 650, 675 (7th Cir.2012); <em>see also Milestone v. City of Monroe, </em>665 F.3d 774, 780 (7th Cir.2011). Resolving all disputes in Thorncreek\u2019s favor, the record establishes at least the second means of showing an official policy or custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Although there was no explicit Village policy that only a certain proportion of African-Americans was acceptable within a given housing complex, the record allows the conclusion that there was implicit understanding in Village government that Thorncreek had too many African-Americans. <em>See Thomas v. Cook Cnty. Sheriff\u2019s Dep\u2019t, </em>604 F.3d 293, 303 (7th Cir.2010) (\u201c[T]he plaintiff must demonstrate that there is a policy at issue rather than a random event. This may take the form of an implicit policy ... or a series of violations to lay the premise of deliberate indifference.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Kerestes testified to his understanding of the Village\u2019s desire for fewer African-Americans at Thorncreek, and he told Pat Clapper the Village was requiring Thorncreek to make capital improvements in an effort to attract non-African-American tenants. Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Thorncreek, Village officials concocted Code violations at Thorncreek to put pressure on it and David Clapper. Mick informed the Trustees that Thorncreek was taking steps to \u201cdiversify its tenant base\u201d by advertising in a Hispanic-edition magazine. And in his email to the Trustees reporting on Thorncreek\u2019s efforts to sell Area H, Mick remarked that \u201c[p]erhaps the Village\u2019s collective efforts ... are beginning to have the desired effect we were seeking,\u201d with the effect being to convey to Thorncreek that the Village is not \u201cwilling to stand idly by and let [Thorncreek] continue to be a drain on our community.\u201d Doc. 151\u2014 6 at 3-4. This evidence is sufficient to show that the Village had \u201ca widespread practice\u201d of discriminating against Thorn-creek due to its predominant African-American population, \u201cwhich, although unwritten, is so entrenched and well-known as to carry the force of policy.\u201d <em>Rice ex rel. Rice, </em>675 F.3d at 675; <em>see also Davis v. Carter, </em>452 F.3d 686, 692 (7th Cir.2006); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number><em>Cannon v. City and Cnty. of Denver, </em>998 F.2d 867, 877-78 (10th Cir.1993) (holding that the plaintiffs had adduced evidence that police harassed anti-abortion protesters with enough frequency to create a fact question regarding whether the alleged harassment amounted to a widespread practice under Monell).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">D. Defenses Asserted by the Individual Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The Village asserts three defenses on behalf of the individual defendants, which are considered in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">1. Official Capacity Claims Against the Individual Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">First, the Village maintains that the official capacity suits against the individual defendants should be dismissed because they are redundant of the <em>Monell </em>claims against the Village. Doc. 156 at 39. The Village is correct. A suit against a municipal official in her official capacity is the equivalent to a suit against the municipality. <em>See Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 165-66, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985) (\u201cOfficial-capacity suits ... generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent. As long as the government entity receives notice and an opportunity to respond, an official-capacity suit is, in all respects other than name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.\u201d) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>Sow v. Fortville Police Dep\u2019t, </em>636 F.3d 293, 300 (7th Cir.2011) (\u201can official capacity suit is another way of pleading an action against an entity of which the officer is an agent\u201d). The official capacity claims accordingly are dismissed. <em>See Budd v. Motley, </em>711 F.3d 840, 843-44 (7th Cir.2013); <em>Robinson v. Sappington, </em>351 F.3d 317, 339-40 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Jungels v. Pierce, </em>825 F.2d 1127, 1129 (7th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">2. Absolute Legislative Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Second, the Village contends that the Trustees and Ostenburg (the Village President) enjoy absolute immunity because their alleged conduct was undertaken in a legislative capacity. Doc. 156 at 39-40. (Absolute immunity is also sought for McGann, the Village Clerk, but she is sued in her official capacity only, Doc. 159 at \u00b6 7, and the official capacity claims have been dismissed.) \u201c[A]bsolute immunity shields a legislator\u2019s conduct even when that conduct is based on improper motives. Absolute immunity, however, only applies to those legislators acting in their legislative capacity. Courts have granted absolute legislative immunity to legislators for various activities which include: (1) core legislative acts such as introducing, debating, and voting on legislation; (2) activities that could not give rise to liability without inquiry into legislative acts and the motives behind them; and (3) activities essential to facilitating or preventing the core legislative process.\u201d <em>Biblia Abierta v. Banks, </em>129 F.3d 899, 903 (7th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>see also Bogan v. Scott-Harris, </em>523 U.S. 44, 54, 118 S.Ct. 966, 140 L.Ed.2d 79 (1998) (\u201cAbsolute legislative immunity attaches to all actions taken in the sphere of legitimate legislative activity.\u201d) [internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Bagley v. Blagojevich, </em>646 F.3d 378, 391 (7th Cir.2011). Therefore, \u201can ordinance adopted through the legislative process, and having the force of law, is covered by legislative immunity no matter the motives of those who proposed, voted for, or otherwise supported the proposal.\u201d <em>Benedix v. Vill. of Hanover Park, </em>677 F.3d 317, 318 (7th Cir.2012). Absolute legislative immunity does not apply to \u201cacts that are ministerial or administrative in nature,\u201d and \u201cthe official seeking absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that such immunity is justi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>fied for the function in question.\u201d <em>Heyde v. Pittenger, </em>633 F.3d 512, 517 (7th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\">Applying these principles to this case, absolute legislative immunity attaches to the Trustees\u2019 and Ostenburg\u2019s involvement in the enactment of the electricity ordinance and other provisions of the Village code. <em>See Biblia Abierta, </em>129 F.3d at 903-04 (holding that absolute legislative immunity applies to an alderman\u2019s introducing and voting for a municipal ordinance); <em>Reed v. Vill. of Shorewood, </em>704 F.2d 943, 952-53 (7th Cir.1983) (same); <em>see also Bagley, </em>646 F.3d at 393 (\u201clegislative immunity attached to a county executive\u2019s role of transmitting a budget' from the department of public works to the county board, which enacted the budget\u201d) (citing <em>Nisenbaum v. Milwaukee Cnty., </em>333 F.3d 804, 808 (7th Cir.2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Absolute immunity also applies to the alleged failure to bring to a vote Thorncreek\u2019s petition for a conditional use permit for the leasing office in Area G. <em>See Biblia Abierta, </em>129 F.3d at 905-06 (holding that absolute legislative immunity covers the defendant aldermans\u2019 requests to postpone a zoning hearing). The Vil lage itself does not and could not seek immunity for either of these actions. <em>See Capra v. Cook Cnty. Bd. of Review, </em>733 F.3d 705, 710-11, 2013 WL 4441929, at *4 (7th Cir. Aug. 21, 2013) (municipalities do not have absolute legislative immunity even where municipal officers do); <em>Reed, </em>704 F.2d at 953 (\u201cthe municipality\u2019s liability for [the] acts [of municipal policymakers] extends to acts for which the policy-making officials themselves might enjoy absolute immunity- because the acts were legislative or judicial in character\u201d). And Mick and Kerestes do not- seek absolute immunity for their role in those legislative activities, although the argument might have been available to them.. <em>See Kensington Volunteer Fire Dep\u2019t, Inc. v. Montgomery Cnty., </em>684 F.3d 462, 471 (4th Cir.2012) (holding that absolute legislative immunity protected from liability the county executive for submitting a budget to the county council and the county fire chief for giving allegedly misleading testimony to the council regarding the budget).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Absolute legislative immunity does not protect the Trustees or Ostenburg to the extent they are sued for their involvement in the discriminatory enforcement of the electricity ordinance or other Code provisions. <em>See Rateree v. Rockett, </em>852 F.2d 946, 950 (7th Cir.1988) (holding that \u201c[a]bsolute immunity ... only applies to those legislators acting- in their legislative capacity. Administrative or executive acts of legislators are not protected.\u201d); <em>see also Alexander v. Holden, </em>66 F.3d 62, 65 (4th Cir.1995) (same). The Village contends that the Trustees did not have sufficient involvement in enforcing municipal law against Thorncreek to justify holding them liable. Doc. 156 at 40. That is a merits argument, not an immunity argument. And it fails as a merits argument, at least on summary judgment, because the record includes facts sufficient to allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the Trustees had the requisite level of involvement in the Village\u2019s alleged misconduct to support liability against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">3. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Third, the Village argues that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. Doc. 156 at 40-42. Because the takings and due process claims have been dismissed, it is necessary to consider qualified immunity only as to the federal equal protection and \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1986 claims. \u201cThe doctrine of qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages when their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number><em>McAllister v. Price, </em>615 F.3d 877, 881 (7th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009)). \u201cWhen confronted with a claim for qualified immunity, [the court] must address two questions: whether the plaintiffs allegations make out a deprivation of a constitutional right, and whether the right was clearly established at the time of defendant\u2019s alleged misconduct.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">Stripped of its boilerplate, the Village\u2019s entire discussion of qualified immunity consists of these two sentences, which track the two questions just referenced: \u201cFor reasons set forth within this memorandum of law, the Defendants maintain that the Plaintiffs have failed to show a violation of a constitutional right. Further, existing law for plaintiffs\u2019 various constitutional claims is not clearly established with respect to the alleged wrongdoing in this case.\u201d Doc. 156 at 41-42. The first sentence is wrong; as shown in Section II.A, <em>supra, </em>Thorncreek has adduced evidence sufficient to show that the Village violated its equal protection rights. The second sentence states a conclusion without providing reasoning or authority, so the Village\u2019s argument on the \u201cclearly established\u201d prong of qualified immunity is forfeited. <em>See Arlin-Golf, LLC v. Vill. of Arlington Heights, </em>631 F.3d 818, 822 (7th Cir.2011) (where the party \u201ccited no relevant legal authority to the district court to support the proposition ... the argument is waived\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Qualified immunity would have been denied even putting aside forfeiture. It has been settled law for decades that the Equal Protection Clause bars government action aimed at restricting the housing choices of racial minorities or targeting those who provide housing to racial minorities. <em>See Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 151-52, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) (\u201cFew principles of law are more firmly stitched into our constitutional fabric than the proposition that a State must not discriminate against a person because of his race or the race of his companions, or in any way to compel or encourage racial segregation.\u201d); <em>Shelley v. Kraemer, </em>334 U.S. 1, 20-21, 68 S.Ct. 836, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948); <em>Young Apartments, </em>529 F.3d at 1039-46 (citing cases); <em>Scott, </em>716 F.2d at 1415-17 (citing cases); <em>Des Vergnes, </em>601 F.2d at 17 (citing cases). Likewise, it has long been settled that government action aimed at rank \u201cracial balancing\u201d is unconstitutional. <em>See Grutter, </em>539 U.S. at 330, 123 S.Ct. 2325; <em>Heame, </em>185 F.3d at 775. It is true that the standard governing class-of-one equal protection, claims is unsettled in the Seventh Circuit, <em>see Bond v. Atkinson, </em>728 F.3d 690, 693, 2013 WL 4511469, at *3 (7th Cir.2013), but that does not warrant qualified immunity on Thorncreek\u2019s class-of-one claim because the claim survives even under the most stringent standard articulated by the various <em>Del Marcelle </em>opinions, <em>see Billington v. Vill. of Armington, </em>498 Fed.Appx. 572, 574 (7th Cir.2012). Finally, while the <em>Village of Arlington Heights </em>dictum referenced above might possibly indicate that a corporation\u2019s ability to press a race-based equal protection claim is not clearly established, the Seventh Circuit has squarely held in materially identical circumstances that \u201cuncertainty as to the eventual plaintiffs standing to bring suit, no matter how objectively reasonable at the time of the conduct in question, cannot be the basis for qualified immunity.\u201d <em>Triad Assocs., </em>10 F.3d at 498-99; <em>see also Kurowski v. Krajewski, </em>848 F.2d 767, 774 (7th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe Constitution creates rules that apply to all governmental actors, however, no matter what judges will do to implement them. In some cases no one will have standing to sue. There is nonetheless a rule of law, which all parts of the government must observe.\u201d) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">For the foregoing reasons, Thorncreek\u2019s summary judgment motion is denied and the Village\u2019s summary judgment motion is granted in part and denied in part. All official capacity claims against the individual defendants are dismissed, as is the ICRA claim against the individual defendants. McGann is terminated as a party defendant because she has been sued only in her official capacity. The Trustees and Ostenburg are immune for any liability for their role in enacting municipal ordinances. Defendants are granted summary judgment on the state and federal due process and takings claims. Subject to the foregoing limitations, Thorncreek\u2019s federal and state equal protection claims, conspiracy claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1986, and ICRA claim will proceed to trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
