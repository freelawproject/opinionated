(\u201cHouston American\u201d), John F. Terwilliger, James J. Jacobs, John P. Boylan, Orrie Lee Tawes III, and Stephen Hartzell\u2019s motion to dismiss (instrument #53; memorandum, # 54) the Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cAmended Complaint\u201d) of Lead Plaintiffs Paul Spitzberg and Stephen Gerber, pursuant to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d) and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6). Plaintiffs seek to recover damages and pursue remedies under \u00a7\u00a7 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 78t(a) respectively,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Securities Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) Rule 10b-5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5), promulgated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>thereunder, against Houston American and some of its officers and directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">After carefully reviewing the Amended Complaint, the briefs, and the applicable law, although the adequacy of the pleading is a close question, for the reasons stated below the Court finds that Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Standards of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) provides, \u201cA pleading that states a claim for relief must contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d When a district court reviews a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), it must construe the complaint in favor of the plaintiff and take all well-pleaded facts as true. <em>Randall D. Wolcott, MD, PA v. Sebelius, </em>635 F.3d 757, 763 (5th Cir.2011), <em>citing Gonzalez v. Kay, </em>577 F.3d 600, 603 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">\u201cWhile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, ... a plaintiff\u2019s obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitle[ment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.... \u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (citations omitted). \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1965, <em>citing </em>5 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1216, pp. 235-236 (3d ed.2004) (\u201c[T]he pleading must contain something more ... than ... a statement of facts that merely creates a suspicion [of] a legally cognizable right of action\u201d). <em>\u201cTwombly </em>jettisoned the minimum notice pleading requirement of <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 ... (1957) [\u201ca complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief\u2019], and instead required that a complaint allege enough facts to state a claim that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>St. Germain v. Howard, </em>556 F.3d 261, 263 n. 2 (5th Cir.2009), <em>citing In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d), <em>citing Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1974). \u201c \u2018A claim has facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montoya v. FedEx Ground Package System, Inc., </em>614 F.3d 145, 148 (5th Cir.2010), <em>quoting Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1940, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). The plausibility standard is not akin to a \u201cprobability requirement,\u201d but asks for more than a \u201cpossibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Dismissal is appropriate when the plaintiff fails to allege \u201c \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\u2019 \u201d and therefore fails to \u201c \u2018raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montoya, </em>614 F.3d at 148, <em>quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. </em>at 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"AGR\">In <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1940, the Supreme Court, observed \u201cthe tenet that \u201conly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss,\u201d a determination involving \u201ca context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d \u201c[T]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>do not suffice\u201d under Rule 12(b). <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1949. The plaintiff must plead specific facts, not merely eonclusory allegations, to avoid dismissal. <em>Collins v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, </em>224 F.3d 496, 498 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cDismissal is proper if the complaint lacks an allegation regarding a required element necessary to obtain relief ....\u201d <em>Rios v. City of Del Rio, Texas, </em>444 F.3d 417, 421 (5th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>549 U.S. 825, 127 S.Ct. 181, 166 L.Ed.2d 43 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\u201cRule 12(b) is not a procedure for resolving contests about the facts or the merits of a case.\u201d <em>Gallentine v. Housing Authority of City of Port Arthur, Tex., </em>919 F.Supp.2d 787, 794 (E.D.Tex.2012), citing 5A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d </em>\u00a7 1356, at 294 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">As noted, on a Rule 12(b)(6) review, although generally the court may not look beyond the pleadings, the Court may examine the complaint, documents attached to the complaint, and documents attached to the motion to dismiss to which the complaint refers and which are central to the plaintiffs claim(s), as well as matters of public record. <em>Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. v. Barclays Bank PLC, </em>594 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.2010), <em>citing Collins, </em>224 F.3d at 498-99; <em>Cinel v. Connick, </em>15 F.3d 1338, 1341, 1343 n. 6 (5th Cir.1994). <em>See also United States ex rel. Willard v. Humana Health Plan of Tex., Inc., </em>336 F.3d 375, 379 (5th Cir.2003) (\u201cthe court may consider ... matters of which judicial notice may be taken\u201d). Taking judicial notice of public records directly relevant to the issue in dispute is proper on a Rule 12(b)(6) review and does not transform the motion into one for summary judgment. <em>Funk v. Stryker Corp., </em>631 F.3d 777, 780 (5th Cir.2011). \u201cA judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 201(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">In addition to Rules 8(a) and 12(b)(6), fraud claims must also satisfy the heightened pleading standard set out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b): \u201cIn allegations alleging fraud ..., a party must state with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person\u2019s mind may be alleged generally.\u201d A dismissal for failure to plead with particularity as required by this rule is treated the same as a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Lovelace v. Software Spectrum, Inc., </em>78 F.3d 1015, 1017 (5th Cir.1996). The Fifth Circuit interprets Rule 9(b) to require \u201cspecificity as to the statements (or omissions) considered to be fraudulent, the speaker, when and why the statements were made, and an explanation of why they were fraudulent.\u201d <em>Plotkin v. IP Axess, Inc., </em>407 F.3d 690, 696 (5th Cir.2005). <em>See also Southland Sec. Corp. v. INSpire Ins. Solutions, Inc., </em>365 F.3d 353, 362 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cTo satisfy Rule 9(b)\u2019s pleading requirements the plaintiffs mustjspecify the statements contended to be fraudulent, identify the speaker, state when and where the statements were made, and explain why the statements were fraudulent.\u2019\u201d) <em>(quoting Williams v. WMX Technologies, Inc., </em>112 F.3d 175, 177-78 (5th Cir.1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 966, 118 S.Ct. 412, 139 L.Ed.2d 315 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">\u201cWhen a corporation is alleged to have made false representations, the court must [identify and] look to \u2018the state of mind of the corporate official or officials who make or issue the statement.\u2019 It follows that \u2018[a] corporation can be held to have a particular state of mind [e.g., fraudulent intent] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>when that state of mind is possessed by a single individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>7-Eleven Inc. v. Puerto Rico-7 Inc., </em>Civ. A. No. 3:08-CV-00140-B, 2008 WL 4951502, *2 (N.D.Tex. Nov. 19, 2008), <em>quoting Southland Sec. Corp., </em>365 F.3d 353, 366-67 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Private litigants who bring securities fraud claims must also satisfy the pleading requirements of the PSLRA before any discovery is allowed. \u201cTo state a securities fraud claim under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, plaintiff must plead (1) a misstatement or omission, (2) of a material fact, (3) made with scienter, (4) on which the plaintiffs relied,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (5) that proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries.\u201d <em>Southland, 365 F.3d </em>at 362. For a misrepresentation to be material, \u201cthere must be a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d. <em>Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 231-31, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988). \u201cThe appropriate inquiry is whether, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact or prediction without a reasonable basis \u2018is one [that] a reasonable investor would consider significant in [making] the decision to invest, such that it alters the total mix of information available about the proposed investment.\u2019\u201d <em>Rubinstein v. Collins, </em>20 F.3d 160, 168 (5th Cir.1994), <em>quoting Krim v. BancTexas Group, </em>989 F.2d 1435, 1445 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">For false statements of a material fact <em>or </em>a misleading omission of material fact, Plaintiffs must \u201cspecify each statement alleged to have been misleading and the reasons why the statement is misleading, and if an allegation regarding the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>ment or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2). <em>See also ABC Arbitrage Plaintiffs Group v. Tchuruk, </em>291 F.3d 336, 351 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cTo summarize, a plaintiff pleading a false or misleading statement or omission as the basis for a section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 securities fraud clam must, to avoid dismissal pursuant to Rule 9(b) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-4(b)(1) and 78u-4(b)(3)(A): (1) specify each statement alleged to have been misleading, <em>ie., </em>contended to be fraudulent; (2) identify the speaker; (3) state when and where the statement was made; (4) plead with particularity the contents of the false representations; (5) plead with particularity what the person making the misrepresentation obtained thereby; and (6) explain the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, <em>ie., </em>why the statement is fraudulent. Additionally, under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l), for allegations made on information and belief, the plaintiff must: (7) state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed, <em>i.e., </em>set forth a factual basis for such belief.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Plaintiffs must also \u201cstate with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that defendants acted with the required state of mind,\u201d scienter, i.e., \u201cnot merely simple or even inexcusable negligence,\u201d but instead a mental state embracing \u201cintent to deceive, manipulate, or \u2018defraud,\u2019 or that \u2018severe recklessness\u2019 in which the danger of misleading buyers or sellers ... is either known to the defendant or is so obvious that the defendant must have been aware of it.\u2019 \u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2); <em>Southland Sec. Corp. v. INSpire Ins. Solutions, Inc., </em>365 F.3d 353, 366 (5th Cir.2004), <em>quoting Broad v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>642 F.2d 929, 961-62 (5th Cir.1981) <em>(en </em>banc). To determine whether a plaintiff has adequately pleaded scienter under the PSLRA, all facts must be evaluated collectively, not in isolation, and the \u201ccourt must take into account plausible inferences opposing as well as supporting a strong inference of scienter.\u201d <em>Ind. Elec. Workers\u2019 Pension Trust Fund IBEW v. Shaw Group, Inc., </em>537 F.3d 527, 533 (5th Cir.2008), <em>citing Tellabs, Inc. v.. Makor Issues &amp; Rights, Ltd., </em>551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S.Ct. 2499, 168 L.Ed.2d 179 (2007). \u201c[T]he inference that the defendant acted with scienter need not be irrefutable, i.e., of the smoking-gun genre, or even the most plausible of competing inferences .... Yet the inference of scienter must ultimately be \u2018cogent and compelling,\u2019 not merely \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018permissible\u2019 \u201d that Defendants acted with intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud or with s\u00e9vere recklessness in making the challenged statements. <em>Id., quoting id. </em>at 323, 127 S.Ct. 2499. The Fifth Circuit has rejected the contention that allegations of motive and opportunity standing alone will satisfy the scienter requirement, but it has found that they may meaningfully enhance the strength of the inference of scienter. <em>Flaherty &amp; Crumrine Preferred Income Fund, Inc. v. TXU Corp., </em>565 F.3d 200, 208 (5th Cir.2009) <em>(citing Ind. Elec., </em>537 F.3d at <em>533), cert. denied, </em>558 U.S. 873, 130 S.Ct. 199, 175 L.Ed.2d 125 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The Fifth Circuit has also rejected group pleading of scienter and requires the plaintiffs to plead facts showing \u201cthe state of mind of the individual corporate official or officials \u2018who make or issue the statement (or order or approve it or its making or issuance, or who furnish information or language for inclusion therein, or the like) rather than generally to the collective knowledge of all the corporation\u2019s officers and employees acquired in the course of their employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., citing id. </em>Where the corporate documents have no stated author or statements with the documents are not attributed to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>individual, a corporate officer\u2019s signature on the document is sufficient to charge the document to him. <em>Southland, </em>365 F.3d at 365. \u201c[T]he corporation itself may be treated as making press releases and public statements issued by authorized officers on its behalf, and statements made by its authorized officers to further the interests of the corporation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Under the PSLRA a plaintiff must prove that the defendant\u2019s act or omission alleged to have violated the Exchange Act caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4). To establish loss causation an investor must plead facts showing a causal relationship between his damages and the defendant\u2019s material misstatement or omission. The Supreme Court has held that the traditional elements of proximate causation and economic loss must be alleged to establish loss causation under \u00a7 10(b). <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Broudo, </em>544 U.S. 336, 346-17, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577 (2005). For loss causation the plaintiff may not simply allege that the price of security on the date of purchase was inflated because of the alleged misrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (\u201cas a matter of pure logic, at the moment that a transaction takes place, the plaintiff [who has purchased securities at an inflated price] has suffered no loss; the inflated purchase payment is offset by ownership of a share that <em>at that instant </em>possesses equivalent value.\u201d (emphasis in original)). Nor does a decline in stock price following a public announcement of bad news, by itself, demonstrate loss causation supporting a securities fraud claim. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. \u201cAn investor must show that the misstatement or omission <em>itself </em>is the actual cause of his economic loss, as opposed to changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific facts, conditions, or other events.\u201d <em>Dura Pharms., </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627; <em>see also Alaska Elec. Pension Fund v. Flowserve Corp., </em>572 F.3d 221 (5th Cir.2009) (\u201cThe loss must be caused because this truth \u2018ma[de] its way into the marketplace,\u2019 not as a result of \u2018changed economic circumstances, changed investor expectations, new industry-specific or firm-specific facts, conditions\u2019 or other factors independent of the fraud.\u201d), <em>citing Dura Pharms., </em>544 U.S. at 342-43, 125 S.Ct. 1627. The Fifth Circuit requires that a plaintiff must allege either (1) a \u201cfacially \u2018plausible\u2019 causal relationship between the fraudulent statements or omissions and plaintiffs economic loss, including allegations of material misrepresentation or omission, followed by the leaking out of relevant or related truth about the fraud that caused a significant part of the depreciations of the stock and plaintiffs loss\u201d or (2) \u201cenough facts to give rise to a reasonable hope or expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the foregoing elements of loss causation.\u201d <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d at 258. \u201c[L]oss causation may be pleaded on the theory that the truth gradually emerged through a series of partial disclosures and that an entire series of partial disclosures caused the stock price deflation.\u201d <em>Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., </em>565 F.3d 228, 261 (5th Cir.2009). The Fifth Circuit has ruled that notice pleading under Rules 8(a) and 12(b)(6), not heightened pleading, is sufficient to plead loss causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Factual Allegations of the Amended</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Consolidated Class Action Complaint (# 44)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Defendant Houston American\u2019s business is the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas in the United States, specifically developing concessions in properties in the Gulf Coast Region, principally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Texas and Louisiana, and in the South American country of Colombia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant John F.

Miller (Executive Vice President of Gulf United Energy), Jim Ford (Executive Vice President of Gulf United Energy), and Jeffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">According to Confidential Witness 3, a technical committee of the following people met regularly in Houston to review the progress at the CPO 4 block and to discuss the next steps, communicating almost daily by phone and email: Terwilliger, Jacobs, Jeffers, Ford, Gulf United Executive Vice President of Exploration James Fluker (\u201cFluker\u201d), Confidential Witness 3, and Confidential Witness 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Plaintiffs explain that the Guidelines for Application of the Petroleum Resources Management System (\u201cPRMS\u201d) is a joint effort of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the World Petroleum Council, and the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers to provide definitions and guidelines \u201cdesigned to provide a common reference for the international petroleum industry, including national reporting and regulatory disclosure agencies, and to support petroleum project and portfolio management requirements. They are intended to improve clarity in global communications regarding petroleum resources.\u201d #44 at p. 12. PRMS defines \u201creserves\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">those quantities of petroleum anticipated to be commercially recoverable by application of development projects to known accumulations from a given date forward under defined conditions. Reserves must further satisfy four criteria: they must be (1) discovered, (2) recoverable, (3) commercial, and (4) remaining (as of the evaluation date) based on the development project(s) applied. Reserves are further categorized in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on project maturity and/or characterized by development and production status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-11\"># 44 at pp. 12-13. Under PRMS,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">To be included in the Reserves class, there must be a high confidence in the commercial productibility of the reservoir as supported by actual production or formation tests. In certain cases, Reservoirs may be assigned on the basis of well logs and/or core analysis that indicate that the subject reservoir is hydrocarbon-bearing and is analogous to reservoirs in the same area that are producing or have demonstrated the ability to produce on formation tests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJL\"><em>Id. </em>at p. 13. In contrast, \u201c \u2018resources\u2019 are a broader category that encompass all quantities of petroleum naturally occurring on or within the Earth\u2019s crust, discovered and undiscovered (recoverable or unrecoverable), as well as quantities already produced.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Resources also include all types <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>of petroleum, whether considered \u2018conventional\u2019 or \u2018unconventional.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>The PRMS does not allow companies to aggregate estimates of \u201creserves\u201d with those of \u201cresources\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">Petroleum quantities classified as Reserves, Contingent Resources, or Prospective Resources should not be aggregated with each other without due consideration of the significant differences in the criteria associated with their classification. In particular, there may be a significant risk that accumulations containing Contingent Resources and/or Prospective Resources will not achieve commercial production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\"># 44 at p. 13. Plaintiffs allege that Houston American falsely represented its recoverable oil reserves to investors and knowingly disregarded industry standards on recoverable oil reserves.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">In September 2010, Houston American hired Confidential Witness 1, who reported to Terwilliger and Jeffers. Pursuant to Terwilliger\u2019s instructions, the engineer did not evaluate available reserves in CPO 4, but performed only a paper document re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>view of the resources of the Llanos basin and did not conduct any tests of his own in the field, but instead relied on existing seismic data, geological maps, and other records. The engineer reported that Terwilliger did not want the engineer to do a risk assessment of the Llanos basin resources. As a result, he performed a \u201climited scope examination\u201d in accordances with the Society of Petroleum Engineers and produced a written report without a risk assessment even though he believed \u201cthere could be a lot of risks in drilling in an area like that.\u201d In fact the engineer thought there were \u201cnumerous\u201d risks in that basin. An article dated October 19, 2010, published on LaRepublica.com.co, reported that Confidential Witness 1 prepared a document stating that some of Houston American\u2019s estimates of oil reserves were not supported by official data or available evidence. In short, Confidential Witness 1 evaluated only resources, not reserves, for the CPO 4 block and even stated \u201cthere were no reserves\u201d for the CPO 4 block. He also stated that it was impossible to evaluate the oil reserves in the CPO 4 block because no drilling had begun and thus there was no history of oil production from which to evaluate its oil reserves. When specifically asked if Houston American had a legitimate reason to characterize its oil resources in the CPO 4 block as \u201coil reserves,\u201d he answered that Houston American had \u201cnever reached the point where they could call the oil resources there \u2018reserves.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Despite the fact that Houston American had no basis to estimate oil reserves at the time of, or prior to, Confidential Witness l\u2019s evaluation in September 2009 because there was no oil production data, Plaintiffs allege that Houston American falsely stated in investor presentation materials filed with the SEC on November 9, 2009 on Form 8-K, signed by Jacobs, that CPO 4 block contained huge amounts of oil reserves, i.e., approximately 1^4 billion barrels.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The partnership\u2019s management committee purportedly continually disagreed about how to proceed with drilling in the CPO 4 block. Plaintiffs\u2019 Confidential Witness 3 joined Houston American in January 2011 when it was \u201cat the stage prior to drilling wells.\u201d Confidential Witness 3 reported that he had disagreements with Houston American and that the partners also disagreed about where to drill the wells and about economic justification for drilling them, with SK less optimistic than Houston American about the prudence of doing so based on Confidential Witness 3\u2019s review of the seismic data, which Confidential Witness 3 explained significantly lowered SK\u2019s expectations for the CPO 4 block. SK wanted to drill only two wells, but Houston American and Terwilliger insisted on three, according to Confidential Witness 3. The management committee finally agreed to three wells in CPO 4 block despite the conflict among members. It chose to drill Tamand\u00faa first, a second well, initially called Negretos, in the southeast, and a third on the eastern side.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Plaintiffs claim that Defendants knowingly failed to conduct the necessary tests for reporting recoverable oil reserves in CPO 4, for which drilling had to have been commenced \u2014 in actuality drilling in CPO 4 did not begin until mid 2011. Instead Defendants only conducted tests to determine \u201cresources,\u201d and Defendants knew that they did not have the requisite information and data to report \u201creserves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Drilling began on the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well in July 2011, but problems quickly mounted. The well bit got stuck repeatedly and, according to Confidential Witness 3, the engineers were unable to determine why, so finally the management committee unanimously chose to sidetrack the well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>twice even though sidetracking increased the cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">During this time Defendants issued statements that mainly attributed the delays to the \u201cinflow of hydrocarbons\u201d and claimed that \u201ca significant amount of geological risk has been reduced.\u201d They also issued positive statements that they found \u201ca very significant show of hydrocarbons with some oils\u201d and characterized these shows as \u201cvery, very positive.\u201d Confidential Witnesses 3 and 4 stated that Houston American never found a \u201csignificant\u201d or strong show of hydrocarbons.\u201d They reviewed the geological tests and records and did not find any evidence of hydrocarbon shows at any time. Based on his review, Confidential Witness 4 stated that Houston American had never made any findings of \u201cstrong shows of hydrocarbons\u201d or significant hydrocarbons,\u201d and that \u201c[t]here was no indication of gas or oil,\u201d while Confidential Witness 3 corroborated that statement, observed that any hydrocarbons found \u201cwere not strong\u201d and explained that it was not \u201cfactual\u201d to represent that the well had \u201coil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">As the drilling continued, the cost went $30 to $50 million over budget and took seven months instead of two. When the drilling reached 16,000 feet in December 2011, it hit rock and there was still no sign of oil. At that point, according to Confidential Witness 3, the committee decided to end the drilling effort because \u201cit was obvious that we had to stop. It was decided in a telephone call. We couldn\u2019t go any further.\u201d The partners had SK Innovation Co. conduct a well test, which takes about three weeks, and it did not find flowable hydrocarbons in Tamand\u00faa, reported Confidential Witness 3, who further observed, \u2018We [SK] didn\u2019t think the probability of finding hydrocarbons justified the cost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Houston American and Gulf United Energy decided to do another well test on a \u201csole risk basis,\u201d i.e., do it themselves at their own expense, while SK decided not to participate because it did not think the probability of finding hydrocarbons justified the cost. That second round of tests of fluids at the bottom of the well in February or March 2012 found nothing, according to Confidential Witness 3. So they abandoned the first well and moved on to Negretos in the south, according to Confidential Witness 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">Confidential Witness 5 joined SK in January 2012, approximately the time when SK Exploration was preparing to test the Tamand\u00faa well for hydrocarbons and reported on it. He stated that the results of the C9 formation tests conducted by the partners around February 2012 were very disappointing and \u201cthere was nothing commercial there.... There was no continuous flow.\u201d # 44 at p. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">Confidential Witness 4 also started working for SK in January 2012. When the team' drilled a six-inch hole and planned to do two tests, a C9 formation and a C7 formation, he confirmed that the results of the former were so disappointing that SK decided not to proceed further. Confidential Witness 4 further stated that \u201c[t]he results were very, very poor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b663-11\">The technical committee reviewed the results of the drilling operation on the CPO 4 block. Confidential Witness 4 reviewed the geological tests and records and did not find evidence of strong hydrocarbon shows at any time. He reported that Houston American and Gulf United spent approximately $5 million on the second round of tests of the C7 formation, which took more than two weeks, only to be disappointed again. The committee then decided to abandon the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">Plaintiffs then specifically detail the alleged materially misleading or false representations made by Houston American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>during the Class Period about the amount of recoverable oil reserves in the CPO 4 block, specifically in the C7 and C9 formations in the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well, when there were no grounds for reporting recoverable oil reserves there. As the Amended Complaint\u2019s newly added claim, they assert that on November 9, 2009 Houston American filed a Form 8-K with the SEC signed by Jacobs. It included slides prepared by Houston American for an investor presentation held that day regarding Houston American\u2019s oil exploration prospects. <em>Inter alia, </em>it made the materially false or misleading statement in dispute: \u201cCPO 4 Block consists of 345,452 net acres and contains over 100 identified leads or prospects with estimated reserves of 1 to 4 billion barrels.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege th\u00e1t Confidential Witness 1 stated, \u201cThere were no reserves.\u201d Thus Defendants had no basis for claiming in the Form 8-K filed on November 9, 2009 that the CPO 4 block contained \u201c100 identified leads or prospects with estimated recoverable reserves of 1 to 4 billion barrels.\u201d Moreover they never retracted or qualified the estimate. Houston American\u2019s stock, in response, increased over 10%, rising from $3.95 to $4.35 on November 10, 2009 and reaching $4.83 by November 16, 2009, a 22% increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">In-April 2010 financial publications began questioning Houston American\u2019s disclosures. On April 7, 2010 an internet publication called \u201cSeeking Alpha\u201d posted an article entitled \u201cHouston American Energy Corp. Set for Collapse\u201d on its website questioning the value of Houston American stock and its \u201cover-hyping\u201d of the CPO 4 block, from which the complaint (# 44 at pp. 19-23) quotes extensively and which the Court incorporates, herein. Plaintiffs claim that the article caused the value of the stock to drop $5.84 per share on a very heavy trading volume to close at $14.51 on April 7, 2010. Houston American responded with a press release denying the allegations. Then on June 25, 2010, it announced that Defendant Broun had resigned for \u201cpersonal and health reasons.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>On June 28, 2010, a website called Sharesleuth.com posted an article entitled, \u201cSmall Texas Company promotes big South American oil venture,\u201d which the Court incorporates herein (# 44 at pp. 24-25) and which strongly criticized, indeed maligned, Houston American\u2019s management <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and also doubted the value of the CPO 4 block, as well as the truthfulness of Defendants\u2019 estimate of 1 to 4 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. It highlighted the fact that SK Energy said little about the CPO 4\u2019s potential and did not list the tract among its main exploration and development projects for 2010. Houston American stock then fell $1.66 per share to close at $10.88 per share on June 28, 2010, and on the next day at $9.95.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that Houston American denied the accusations and continued making false statements throughout the Class Period.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">In a press release on August 16, 2010, Terwilliger stated, \u201cWith our higher interest in CPO 4 and other recent prospects acquired in Colombia, we continue to focus on growing our reserves and production as our newer prospects are drilled over the next year.\u201d On November 15, 2010 Houston American issued another press release reporting its financial results for the quarter and for the nine months ending September 30, 2010, in which Terwilliger stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">Houston American Energy enjoyed another strong quarter, highlighted by our continuing success in Colombia where we have participated in drilling seven successful wells, year to date, out of eight wells drilled. Our oil production for the 2010 third quarter increased by 69% from the 2009 third quarter and for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 our oil production was up 224% from the same period in 2009. We have also benefited from a more favorable price environment for oil with average sales price of oil realized increasing 34% <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>for the quarter and 35% for the nine month period. As a result, our revenues were up 122% for the quarter and 332% for the nine month period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-4\">We continue to focus on identifying early stage resource plays where we can' participate in large resource potential at lower cost, typified by our Colombian operations. Our belief in the resource potential in Colombia, and in particular our Serran\u00eda and CPO 4 prospects, continues to grow. Our belief in that potential has translated into our hiring of an in-house Senior VP of Exploration to focus on development of our Colombian holdings and the decision during the third quarter to increase our stake in the CPO 4 prospect from 25% to 37.5%. We continue to invest in Serran\u00eda and CPO 4 and expect drilling of our \u2022 first wells on Serran\u00eda to occur in the near future with drilling on CPO 4 expected to commence in early 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">.... Together with our cash on hand, proceeds from our sale of Hupecol assets and sale of our Karnes County, Texas working interest leave us well positioned to fund all of our foreseeable development costs on Serran\u00eda and CPO 4.... Through this approach, we have steadily increased our stakes, and potential reserve finds, in resource plays in Colombia with our interests in Serran\u00eda and CPO 4 being' 12.5% and 37.5%, respectively, compared to our initial interests in Colombian assets that ranged from 1.6% to 12.5%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Around December 1, 2010, Terwilliger, representing Houston American in a web-cast, stated that CPO 4 and Serran\u00eda \u201ccreate an opportunity of absolutely extraordinary growth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Defendants argue that as of the dates of each of these materially false or misleading statements, no oil had been discovered in the CPO 4 block.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">The SEC began investigating Houston American\u2019s potential violations of federal securities laws regarding its purported reserves in October 2010, and the investigation progressed to a formal SEC investigation as of March 1, 2011. On March 15, 2011 Houston American filed its annual report for the period ending December 31, 2010 on a Form 10-K, which was signed by Terwilliger, Jacobs, Tawes, Hartzell, and Boylan. Defendants assert that it falsely stated, \u201cWe may from time to time be a party to lawsuits incidental to our business. As of March 1, 2011 we are not aware of any current, pending or threatened litigation or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\u201d Houston American\u2019s materially misleading statements, made when Defendants knew' they were subject to an SEC investigation concerning the core business of Houston American, -allegedly inflated the price of its stock from its closing price of $3.95 at the beginning of the Class Period on November 9, 2009 to a high of $20.44 on July 6, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">In July 2011, Houston American\u2019s Management Committee commenced drilling operations on the first test well prospect in CPO 4. On October 5, 2011 Houston American filed a Form 8-K signed by Jacobs, which reported problems when the \u201cwell encountered a significant kick from the uppermost pays sand\u201d and the \u201cstrong inflow of hydrocarbons forced the well to be shut-in and stabilized.\u201d It appeared to compromise the mud system, so it was decided to sidetrack the well and make changes to the well program that would modify the way in which the well would be drilled. The Form 8-K also stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-10\">While the Tamand\u00faa # 1 is taking longer to drill than anticipated, we believe that a significant amount of geological risk has been reduced in the well and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>are very encouraged from the strong shows of hydrocarbons (gas and oil) in the first objective sand, the C-7. In addition, production from fields around this area in the Llanos Basin is generally associated with stacked pay sequences so we are encouraged about the prospects of our lower sands due to the first objective sand (the C-7) bearing hydrocarbons. However, despite the information derived from the initial Tamand\u00faa # 1 wellbore, there is no assurance that we will locate hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to be commercially viable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">On October 6, 2011 Houston American filed another Form 8-K, signed by Jacobs, that contained investor presentation materials and that stated basically the same information.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The complaint alleges that on October 13, 2011, representing Houston American, Terwilliger participated in a Canncord Genuity Global Energy Conference and misleadingly stated regarding the progress of the CPO 4 drilling operations,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">But the C7, which is the uppermost potential pay sand in the [Carbonara] series. We had tremendous kick which we announced and a very significant show of hydrocarbons gas with some oil. And that\u2019s very interesting because it\u2019s \u2014 geographically you always want your uppermost sand to have hydrocarbons in it. That suggests that for migration you know that you have a good change now if you have structures below you that there was migration through those structure. That\u2019s very, very positive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkW\">On November 8, 2011, Houston American filed a Form 10-Q report, signed by Terwilliger and Jacobs, for the period ending on September 30, 2011 and reported most of the same information, including the materially false statement that \u201cthe strong shows of hydrocarbons (gas and oil) in the first objective sand, are believed to increase the likelihood of hydrocarbons in the lower sands\u201d and that \u201cwe believe the geological risk of the well has been reduced,\u201d although \u201cthere is no assurance that we will locate hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to be commercially viable.\u201d Houston American\u2019s Form-8K filed with the SEC on December 20, 2011 again stated that \u201c[wjhile drilling the secondary objectives in the sidetrack, the C-7 and C-9 formations, we experienced strong hydrocarbon shows and an inflow of gas.\u201d This statement led investors to believe that Defendants had encountered evidence consistent with the presence of actual oil in the well. As noted <em>supra, </em>several witnesses testified that the drilling never produced any evidence of \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201csignificant\u201d hydrocarbons nor any oil shows. Confidential Witness 3 stated that neither oil nor flowable hydrocarbons were found in the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well, while Confidential Witness 4 represented that in his experience and review of reports and analyses of the CPO 4 block, Houston American had never made any findings of \u201cstrong shows of hydrocarbons\u201d; in other words, they concluded there was no oil in the CPO 4 block in Tamand\u00faa. Confidential Witness 4, the drilling manager of SK Exploration and Production, maintained that the well had not shown any significant amounts of hydrocarbons at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">Houston American stopped drilling in December 2011 when it hit rock and could not drill farther. It decided to and did conduct tests of the well in February and March. The first tests were \u201cextremely discouraging\u201d because they did not yield any evidence of flowable hydrocarbons or that the well was a commercial zone. Despite these findings, Defendants kept falsely representing that they had encountered oil shows or other indications of hydrocarbons. For example on March 1, 2012 Houston American presented an update in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>a press release in a Form 8-K signed by Terwilliger on the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well, stating that it \u201cexhibited oil shows while drilling, and other indications of hydrocarbons such as log analyses that indicate possible productive sands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\">' The partners completed hydrocarbon testing on Tamand\u00faa # 1 well no later than March 2012. Confidential Witness 4 said the testing revealed that the C-9 formation had no oil and that therefore SK decided not to proceed with the testing it had planned in the adjoining C7 formation, but to move on to other projects. Houston American and Gulf United, however, went ahead with the second test, but, according to Confidential Witness 3, \u201cdid not find any flowable hydrocarbons in Tamand\u00faa,\u201d indeed found \u201cnothing,\u201d and SK therefore abandoned the well. Confidential Witness 5 also reported that \u201cthere was nothing commercially viable [in C9]\u201d and \u201cthere was nothing we got to the surface to indicate it was a commercial zone. There was not continuous flow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Confidential Witness 2 represented that he had heard from his contacts in the industry about the issues that Houston American encountered in the CPO 4 block. He stated that Houston American waited about six to eight weeks after encountering these obstacles to publicly announce that it had stopped efforts to drill in the Tamand\u00faa well. Confidential Witness 2 further stated that it \u201ctook forever\u201d for Houston American to concede that the well could not be developed commercially.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Houston American\u2019s 2011 Form 10-K annual report filed on March 7, 2012 for the period ending December 31, 2011, signed by Terwilliger, Jacobs, Tawes, Hartzell, and Boylan, continued to make false or misleading statements about the CPO 4 development and the strong presence of hydrocarbons. <em>Inter alia </em>it again stated that drilling on the first well on the CPO 4 block, the Tamand\u00faa # 1, was \u201csidetracked to address drilling issues associated with high pressure and inflows of hydrocarbons into the well bore.\u201d Moreover it reported,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">While the well exhibited oil shows while drilling, and other indications of hydrocarbons such as log analysis that indicate possible productive sands, hole conditions have prohibited sufficient testing on the bottom hole. There have been many attempts to evaluate the well resulting in tool failures and stuck pipe, and current conditions are such that the operator has made the decision not to try to reenter the bottom hole sections. As a result of these developments, the decision has been made that without the ability to effectively test the lower zones, the most prudent course of action is to plug back the well and to further evaluate the C-7 and C-9 Formations. As indicated by the Logging While Drilling data, the well encountered approximately 200 feet of net resistive sands in the C-7 formation and approximately 140 feet of net resistive sands in the C-9 formation (resistive sands do not necessarily mean pay).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">After attempting to complete the well, the rig is expected to be moved to one of two locations that are currently permitted and ready to receive the rig. In addition, the operator has five additional locations that are in various stages of permitting, location and construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">We anticipate completion of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well during the first quarter of 2012 with well testing and, as appropriate, completion of the well to follow. Drilling of a second test well on the CPO 4 prospect is expected to commence shortly after completion of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">As noted, despite repeated representations that the drilling had produced strong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>carbon shows, according to Confidential Witness 3 the Tamand\u00faa well had not exhibited any oil shows nor produced any significant amounts of hydrocarbons at any point, and the committee had stopped drilling in late 2011. Testing merely confirmed what Defendants already knew, i.e., that there was no oil in the well nor any significant evidence of hydrocarbons. Confidential Witness 4 stated, \u201cI never got the impression from my review of geological tests and records that there were significant hydrocarbons discovered along the way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The 2011 Form 10-K also allegedly falsely stated, \u2018We may from time to time be a party to lawsuits incidental to our business. As of March 1, 2012, we were not aware of any current, pending, or threatened litigation or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\u201d This statement is false and misleading because Houston American admitted on April 19, 2012 that the SEC had issued a nonpublie formal order of private investigation on March 1, 2011, which followed a nonpublic informal inquiry begun by the SEC in October 2010. As part of the litigation in February and April of 2012 Houston American received three subpoenas issued by the SEC calling for testimony from the CEO and CFO and delivery of specified documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On March 1, 2012 Houston American also announced that drilling in the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well was delayed and that further analysis of the well\u2019s C7 and C9 formations would be announced as soon as available. Houston America stock then fell $3.84 per share, losing more than 35% of its value, to close at $7.00 per share on March 1, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In a press release on March 16, 2012 to update the status of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well in light of \u201cvarious unfounded rumors,\u201d Houston American stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">Regarding the Tamand\u00faa # 1 sidetrack well, the Company anticipates that it will be able to announce the test results of the C-9 and C-7 formations in a matter of days as soon as the information is available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Regarding rumors currently circulating on message boards, John Terwilliger, Chairman and CEO of the Company, stated, \u201cThere is a great deal of speculation and misinformation currently posted on message boards regarding our company. Specifically, I would note that we believe that we have more than adequate cash on hand to fund our portion of anticipated costs of testing and completion of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 sidetrack well and carrying on with our business plan. Further, statements that we are on the verge of bankruptcy are wholly unfounded. We have no debt on our books and have, what we believe to be, a valuable portfolio of prospects. We remain optimistic about our CPO 4 prospect and other prospects in our portfolio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">In another press release on April 4, 2012, \u201can operational update on the Company\u2019s CPO 4 block and status of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well,\u201d Houston American announced,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">The Company is currently eagerly awaiting the final results of the testing of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well and will announce the results as soon as they are available. During preliminary testing of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well it has been determined that the C-9 and C-7 formations experienced formation damage as a result of the mud program used to control the well while drilling. The formation damage has resulted in a testing period longer than what was originally anticipated. Although there have been delays with the testing, the Company remains optimistic that these conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>will be overcome and that it will be able to establish a successful test on the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\">After testing of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well is complete, the drilling rig on location will be moved to the next prospect on CPO 4. All necessary preparations have been completed for the drilling rig to move to the next prospect and begin drilling. These preparations included completion of the surface location and all logistics related to the drilling of the well, including all permitting. It should also be noted that the next prospect located on CPO 4 will be shallower than the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well and is anticipated to be drilled in less than 60 days once the drilling rig is on location.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">After the release, Houston American\u2019s stock fell $0.11 to close at $4.67 on April 4, 2012. The stock price continued to fall, closing at $4.21 on April 5, 2012, $4.06 on April 9, 2012, and $3.67 on April 9, 2012, the next three trading days.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">On April 19, 2012 Houston American in another press release announced termination of testing and completion efforts on the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well \u201cdue to formation damage while drilling,\u201d and plans for the next well on the CPO 4 block. It also disclosed that the SEC had been investigating it since October 2010 and had issued it three subpoenas calling for testimony from its chief executive officer and chief financial officer in addition to delivery of specified documents. In part the press release stated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-7\">The Company is encouraged, however, by the information gained from [the Tamand\u00faa # 1] well for other prospects on the block. The Tamand\u00faa # 1 wellbore will be preserved in a way to allow for further evaluation, if at such time in the future it is determined that it is warranted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alx\">The Company also announced that efforts are commencing to move the drilling rig from the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well site to the location of the next prospect on the CPO 4 block. This next well is expected to spud in the May/June time frame. The Company expects that the data gained during the drilling, evaluation and testing of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well will be used to significantly help with future operations on the CPO 4 block.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-9\">The Company also confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) is conducting a non-public formal investigation into the Company. The Company\u2019s confirmation of such investigation follows receipt of information by the Company that third parties had become aware of the investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0h\">Pursuant to the investigation, in February and April of 2012, the Company received three subpoenas issued by the SEC. The subpoenas called for the testimony of the Company\u2019s chief executive officer and chief financial officer and the delivery of certain documents. The subpoenas were issued pursuant to a nonpublic formal order of a private investigation issued by the SEC on March 1, 2011, which followed a nonpublic informal inquiry commenced by the SEC in October 2010. The Company received a copy of the nonpublic formal order of private investigation on February 10, 2010 in connection with the February 2012 subpoenas issued by the SEC. Although the Company cannot be certain of the scope of the investigation, the SEC is trying to determine whether there have been any violations of federal securities laws. The investigation does not represent a conclusion by the staff that there have been any violations of the federal securities laws nor whether the staff would conclude that any enforcement action is appropriate. At this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>time the Company has not been made aware of a finding by the SEC of any securities violations. Also, as stated in the subpoenas issued by the SEC, the investigation does not mean that the SEC has a negative opinion of any person, entity, or security. The Company has cooperated fully, and is committed to continuing to cooperate fully, with the SEC in this matter. It is not possible at this time to predict the timing or outcome of the SEC investigation, including whether or when any proceedings might be initiated, when these matters may be resolved or what, if any, penalties or other remedies may be imposed, and whether any such penalties or remedies would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">That same day the price of Houston American\u2019s shares dropped $1.24, or more than <em>35.5% of </em>its value, to close at <em>$2.25 </em>per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Since then the Company has admitted in its Form 10-Q, filed with the SEC for the period ending September 30, 2012, that the SEC investigation has targeted possible misrepresentations that the Company had made relating to the CPO-4 prospect, specifically \u201cto matters relating to disclosures in the late 2009 and early 2010 time period regarding resource potential for the CPO-4 prospect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">As a result of Houston American\u2019s wrongful acts and omission and the precipitous drop in its stock value, Plaintiffs claim that class members have suffered significant losses and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"A4_\">Plaintiffs assert two causes of action. The first is against Houston American, Terwilliger, and Jacobs for violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The second is against the Individual Defendants for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss (# 53)</p>\n<p id=\"AHv\">Characterizing the Amended Complaint as impermissibly premised on fraud by hindsight, Defendants insist that Houston American continually warned that there is no way to predict prior to drilling and testing whether a well will be successful. In every press release about the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well, Houston American expressly stated that \u201cthere is no assurance that we will locate hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to be commercially viable.\u201d It repeatedly warned that preliminary hydrocarbon shows did not mean the well would be a success.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Defendants contend that the Amended Complaint fails to satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of the PSLRA in the following ways. First, it fails to allege particularized facts showing that Houston American made false statements, but instead relies entirely on alleged statements by unnamed \u201cConfidential Witnesses\u201d to create the impression that Houston American knew in 2011 that the well would not be commercially viable. <em>See Material Yard Workers Local 1175 Ben. Funds v. Men\u2019s Wearhouse, Inc., </em>No. H-09-3265, 2011 WL 3059229, at *6 (S.D.Tex. July 22, 2011) (Hughes, J.) (\u201cA party who presents the stories of unnamed people is neither giving the court nor the defendant a plain statement of the facts____ A secret witness is not far above a false witness.\u201d),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>citing Higginbotham v. Baxter Intern., Inc., </em>495 F.3d 758, 756-57 (7th Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]e must discount allegations that the complaint attributes to five \u2018confidential witnesses\u2019 .... It is hard to see how information from anonymous sources could be deemed \u2018compelling\u2019 or how we could take account of plausible opposing inferences [as required by Tellabs].<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Perhaps these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>confidential sources have axes to grind. Perhaps they are lying. Perhaps they don\u2019t even exist.\u201d). Furthermore Defendants argue that the allegations are \u201cambiguous as to timing and blur the lines between the witnesses\u2019 knowledge of the post-testing state of play in 2012 and what Defendants knew in \u2018real time\u2019 during 2011,\u201d despite the fact that the PSLRA requires particularized statements showing that the 2011 statements were false when made.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Second, Defendants contend that the Amended Complaint fails to plead particularized facts raising a strong inference of scienter. Although Plaintiffs assert that Defendants made false statements to inflate the value of Houston American\u2019s stock, the only sales of such stock by Defendants occurred after the well failed and after Houston American\u2019s share price declined. Moreover the Amended Complaint indicates that at its own risk, Houston American paid $5 million for a second test of the well, demonstrating that it did not know there was \u201cno oil\u201d in the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Third, Defendants complain that the Amended Complaint attempts, to- extend the class period back to challenge the reserve estimate in the November 2009 investor presentation. Defendants object that the claim is barred by (1) the PSLRA\u2019s safe harbor for forward-looking statements and (2) the applicable two-year statute of limitations. They also charge that the allegations fail to satisfy the PSLRA\u2019s heightened pleading standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Defendants emphasize that with each press release and disclosure, Houston American stated that there was no certainty that Houston American would locate commercially viable hydrocarbons in the Tamand\u00faa well. They also advised potential investors to carefully review the filings with the SEC, quoting examples in whibh they identify many risk factors that affect their business plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">. Plaintiffs claim that Houston American\u2019s statements that the Tamand\u00faa well encountered shows of hydrocarbons during drilling were false at the time they were made. Defendants respond that they were not false for several reasons. First, Houston American never stated that there was commercially viable oil or gas in the Tamand\u00faa well and, citing examples, it repeatedly warned that regardless of any -hydrocarbons observed during drilling, it would not know the results until the well was tested and there might not be com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>mercially viable hydrocarbons in the well. Second, they maintain that the market understood that Houston American\u2019s statements were not promises or predictions; from the beginning, in its first disclosure on October 5, 2011, it disclosed that the \u201cstrong inflow of hydrocarbons forced the well to be shut-in and stabilized\u201d and \u201ccompromised the mud system.\u201d The drop in the value of its stock that day reflects that understanding of the serious problems encountered in the drilling. Third, significantly none of Plaintiffs\u2019 Confidential Witnesses disputes that the well had to be \u201cshut-in\u201d due to a \u201cstrong inflow of hydrocarbons.\u201d Confidential Witness 3 is the <em>only witness who worked at SK in 2011 </em>while the well was being drilled and thus the only one with personal knowledge of what was happening and what was known by Houston American at the time; he acknowledges that there were hydrocarbon shows during the drilling phase and questions only whether they were \u201cstrong.\u201d There also is no allegation that he made this belief known to Houston American. Moreover the Amended Complaint states that Confidential Witness 3 \u201chad many disagreements with Houston American\u201d and \u201cdifferent opinions.\u201d # 44 at \u00b6 57.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Disagreements among business executives, by themselves, do not support an inference of falsity. Confidential Witness 5 appears to concede that there were at least some hydrocarbons in the well in stating that there \u201cwas nothing commercially viable\u201d and \u201cno continuous flow.\u201d Confidential Witness 4\u2019s statement suggested the same: \u201cI never got the impression from my review of the geological tests and records that there were significant hydrocarbons discovered along the way.\u201d Houston American, moreover, had warned that \u201cit is not easy to verify the quantity and quality of hydrocarbons in the formations due to the lack of porosity data\u201d in the well.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Defendants also argue that since Plaintiffs are not able to provide particularized allegations that the hydrocarbon shows in 2011 were nonexistent, they instead attempt to make a fraud-by-hindsight case by taking allegations about the final 2012 test results and implying that Defendants knew about the underlying facts in 2011. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about the timing of the final testing are also not particularized. They state that the final testing of the bottom of the well occurred in February or March of 2012. On March 2, 2012 Houston American disclosed that it decided to abandon testing of the lower portion of the well and plug back the well while continuing to evaluate the higher-level C-7 and C-9 formations. The Confidential Witnesses do not appear to dispute that Houston American continued to evaluate the C-7 and C-9 formations nor disagree with its statement on August 19, 2012 that it was ceasing efforts to test and complete the C-7 and C-9 formations because of formation damage during drilling. Thus again the Confidential Witnesses do not contradict Houston American\u2019s disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">In sum Defendants insist that the Amended Complaint does not plead facts showing that Houston American\u2019s statements, which were mainly comprised of disclosures of the current depth of the drilling in the well, problems encountered in the drilling, and warnings that the well might not yield commercially viable hydrocarbons, were false. Plaintiffs try to conflate the state of knowledge after the 2012 testing with the real-time knowledge in 2011 and fail to demonstrate with particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>larity that Houston American made material misstatements. <em>See Stockman v. Flotek Indus., Inc., </em>No. H-09-2526, 2010 WL 3785586, at *15-23 (S.D.Tex. Sept. 29, 2010) (rejecting allegations from \u201cconfidential witnesses\u201d that were not sufficiently particularized or reliable).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">To Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Houston American should have disclosed the SEC investigation sooner, e.g., in its 2011 Form 10-K, Defendants respond that it fails as a matter of law. An SEC investigation is not a pending legal proceeding or litigation and an issuer has no duty to disclose such an investigation \u201cuntil it reaches a stage when the agency or prosecutorial authority makes known it is contemplating filing suit or bringing charges.\u201d <em>Rickman v. Goldman Sachs Grp., </em>868 F.Supp.2d 261, 272 (S.D.N.Y.2012),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> citing David M. Stuart and David A. Wilson, <em>Disclosure Obligations Under the Federal Securities Laws in Government Investigations, </em>64 Business Lawyer 973 (Aug. 2009). Houston American\u2019s statement that it faced no pending or threatened litigation therefore was not false. <em>Id. </em>at 272-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Defendants further object that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not give rise to a strong inference of scienter as to Terwilliger or Jacobs, the only individual Defendants accused of primary \u00a7 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 violations, and thus the claims against them individually as well as against Houston American should be dismissed. \u201c[T]he inference of scienter must be more than merely \u2018reasonable\u2019 or \u2018permissible\u2019 \u2014 it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations. A complaint will survive, we hold, only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.\u201d <em>Tel-labs, </em>551 U.S. at 324,127 S.Ct. 2499.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Insisting there are no particularized facts showing that any Defendant knew that any statements were false, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs fail to identify any specific communications or reports to Terwilliger or Jacobs that directly contradict their public statements or identify the information that was furnished and when it was furnished. <em>Abrams v. Baker Hughes, Inc., </em>292 F.3d 424, 432 (5th Cir.2002) (dismissing complaint where plaintiffs \u201cpoint[ed] to no specific internal or external report available [to Defendants] at the time of the alleged misstatements that would contradict them\u201d); <em>Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., </em>332 F.3d 854, 868 (5th Cir.2003) (dismissing complaint where report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>\u201cfail[ed] to identify exactly who supplied the information [that contradicted company\u2019s public disclosures] or when [management] knew the information\u201d); <em>In re Odyssey Healthcare, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>424 F.Supp.2d 880, 890 (N.D.Tex.2005) (\u201cThe Complaint does not allege the existence of any specific reports that would have disclosed such irregularities that were provided to the Individual Defendants.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Moreover Defendants also assert that Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on confidential sources and their inability to plead falsity with particularity work against an inference of scienter. Defendants urge that statements by sources who were not employed at SK or Houston American at the time of the making of the alleged misstatements \u201ccould hardly be probative of the individual Defendants\u2019 scienter concerning matters that happened when they were not employed\u201d there. <em>In re Dell Inc., </em>591 F.Supp.2d 877, 895 (W.D.Tex.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Pursuant to <em>Tellabs, </em>Defendants maintain that the allegations in the governing complaint support an overwhelming competing inference that Terwilliger and Jacobs did not act fraudulently. There are no allegations of insider trading or personal profit from the alleged misrepresentations. <em>Mizzaro v. Home Depot, Inc., </em>544 F.3d 1230, 1253 (11th Cir.2008) (lack of suspicious stock sales or other financial motive \u201cweighs against inferring scienter\u201d).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Terwilliger only sold stock on April 24, 2012, after Houston American\u2019s stock price had declined. Moreover the complaint alleges that he sold not by choice, but because his bank made him sell to cover a margin call. There are no allegations that Jacobs sold any stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Defendants point to alleged facts that undermine any inference of fraudulent intent: (1) after SK decided to abandon the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well, Houston American chose to do a second test on the well at its own expense; (2) Houston American paid about $5 million for the second test of the C7 formation but would not have done so if it had known all along that the well would be unsuccessful; (3) Houston American and its partners spent $50 million drilling the Tamand\u00faa well, suggesting that they were committed to and believed in the opportunity; (4) SK was purportedly less enthusiastic but continued to participate and wanted to drill at least two wells; (5) Plaintiffs fail to refute Houston American\u2019s October 5, 2011 statement that the well had to be shut-in due to a \u201cstrong inflow of hydrocarbons\u201d that \u201ccompromised the mud system,\u201d an event that substantiates Houston American\u2019s disclosures about hydrocarbon shows while also providing a plausible explanation why the company experienced difficulty continuing with the well; and (6) Houston American made candid disclosures regarding technical difficulties and delays encountered while drilling the Tamand\u00faa well and repeatedly advised its shareholders that there could be no assurance of locating hydrocarbons in commercially viable quantities. The facts weigh heavily against an inference of scienter and show the opposite \u2014 that Houston American spent millions of dollars and considerable time and effort drilling the well and trying to find oil. Defendants made clear that Houston American was a high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>risk investment and repeatedly warned that the presence of hydrocarbon shows does not guarantee a positive result.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Defendants argue that the new claim about the November 2009 estimate, made prior to drilling any wells on CPO 4, is barred by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements because it was accompanied by meaningful cautionary language <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and Plaintiffs fail to show that it was made with actual knowledge of its falsity and therefore applies regardless of whether the cautionary language is deemed sufficient. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77z-2 (defining forward-looking statement broadly and expressly including a \u201cstatement of future economic performance\u201d). <em>See also Arkoma Basin Exploration v. FMF Assocs. 1990-A, Ltd., </em>249 S.W.3d 380, 385 (Tex.2008)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> (oil and gas reserve estimates for fields with little drilling or production are statements of opinion regarding what can be produced in the future and \u201creserve estimates inherently\u2019 include- analysis and assumptions about future events\u201d). Risk disclosures in prior SEC filings may be \u201cincorporated by reference into a forward looking statement,\u201d as Houston American did, and Houston American\u2019s annual report filed with the SEC included nine pages of detailed and specific cautionary language (Ex. C (# 53-4) at pp. 15-25).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">Regardless, insist Defendants, Plaintiffs\u2019 new claim is time-barred because it was not commenced within \u201cthe earlier of \u2014 (1) 2 years after the discovery of the facts constituting the violation; or (2) 5 years after such violation.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b). \u201c[T]he limitations period [for a \u00a7 10(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>claim] begins to run once the plaintiff did discover or a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have \u2018discover[ed] the facts constituting the violation\u2019\u2014whichever comes first.\u201d <em>Merck &amp; Co. v. Reynolds, </em>559 U.S. 683, 130 S.Ct. 1784, 1798, 176 L.Ed.2d 582 (2010). The statement was made on No.vember 9, 2009, more than three years before Plaintiffs first asserted this claim, and Plaintiffs have alleged that \u201cthe facts constituting the violation were known more than two years before Plaintiffs asserted this claim.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that the November 2009 estimate was false because it does not meet the PRMS definition of \u201creserves.\u201d Houston American\u2019s Form 10-K filed on March 29, 2010 disclosed approximately 1.2 million barrels of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves in Colombia. Ex. K. If they believed that the November 2009 estimate of one to four billion barrels referred to PRMS\u2019 definition of \u201creserves,\u201d Plaintiffs would clearly have discovered the truth by March 29, 2010, which is more than two years before they brought this claim. Furthermore, even news articles referenced in the Amended Complaint that purportedly revealed the truth and questioned the veracity of the November 2009 estimate came more than two years before they brought this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Next, Defendants move to dismiss because Plaintiffs have failed to plead loss causation, i.e., facts showing \u201cthat the market reacted negatively to a corrective disclosure, which revealed the falsity of [the company\u2019s] previous representations.\u201d <em>Catogas v. Cyberonics, Inc., </em>292 Fed.Appx. 311, 314-15 (5th Cir.2008), <em>citing Dura Pharm., </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627. The \u201ctruth\u201d revealed in a corrective disclosure must \u201c \u2018make the existence of the actionable fraud more probable than it would be without the alleged fact (taken as true).\u2019 \u201d <em>Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., </em>597 F.3d 330, 337 (5th Cir.2010), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, Erica P. John Fund,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2179, 180 L.Ed.2d 24 (2011). \u201c[T]he truth revealed by the corrective disclosure must show that the defendant more likely than not misled or deceived the market,\u201d as \u201c[o]therwise, the misstatements would do little more that \u2018touch upon\u2019 the alleged loss rather than cause the loss.\u201d That Houston American failed to find commercially viable amounts of hydrocarbons in the well does not \u201cmake the existence of the actionable fraud,\u201d i.e., the prior representations about preliminary hydrocarbon shows, \u201cmore probable than it would be without the alleged fact (taken as true).\u201d Houston American warned from the start that the presence of hydrocarbon shows did not mean that commercially viable amounts of hydrocarbons would be found. Thus the ultimate failure to find such is not \u201ccorrective\u201d of the earlier statements and does not \u201cshow that [Houston American] more likely than not misled the market\u201d about the shows. Thus Plaintiffs have not pleaded loss causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Similarly the 1-4 billion estimated reserves claim also fails for lack of loss causation. If the 1-4 billion were construed as a representation about commercially viable and producible reserves supported by actual production or formation tests, Houston American\u2019s subsequent Form 10-K disclosure that it had only 1.2 million barrels of reserves in Colombia corrected the disclosure. There is no allegation that this corrective disclosure produced any loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Last of all, Defendants claim that the Amended Complaint fails to plead a \u00a7 20(a) control person claim. \u201cWhere a primary violation by the \u2018controlled person\u2019 has not been adequately pleaded, the court should also dismiss a section 20(a) claim.\u201d <em>In re Capstead Mortgage Corp.

Although Confidential Witness 4 did not join SK until January 2012, he did review the geological tests and records from the initial drilling records and said that he did not find evidence of strong hydrocarbons at any time. #54 at p. 16, referencing #44, \u00b668! Contrary to Defendants\u2019 assertions, Plaintiffs do not allege that Defendants\u2019 materially false or misleading statements ended in 2011: Confidential Witness 5 testified about the disappointing C9 results relating to Defendants\u2019 false or misleading statements after February 2012. <em>Id., citing id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 99, 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Plaintiffs deem \u201cunpersuasive\u201d Defendants\u2019 argument that statements that hydrocarbon shows were strong or significant are issues of opinion that do not support an inference of falsity. Plaintiffs insist that, first, a statement of opinion can be materially false and/or misleading for purposes of security fraud claims if the statement is made without a basis in fact. <em>Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, </em>501 U.S. 1083, 1093-94, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991) (opining that conclusory statements such as that the proposed merger\u2019s terms were \u201cfair\u201d and the consideration price \u201chigh\u201d are actionable under the federal securities laws because \u201cconelusory terms in a commercial context are reasonably understood to rest on a factual basis that justifies them as accurate, the absence of which renders them misleading\u201d); <em>Rubinstein v.

What Defendants call \u201copinions\u201d were based on specific data, test results, and reports, which contained known information with industry standards that guide interpretations of the information. #54 at p. 11, citing #44, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96, 104, and Federman Decl. at Ex. A. Confidential Witnesses 3 and 4, both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>members of the technical committee who reviewed the same reports and data as Houston American, unequivocally stated that there were -never any findings of \u201cstrong shows of hydrocarbons.\u201d # 44, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96,103-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">Plaintiffs further assert that even if Defendants\u2019 statements about \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cstrong\u201d hydrocarbon shows and oil shows could somehow be construed as not false, they were materially misleading because there was a \u201csubstantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d <em>Basic Inc., </em>485 U.S. at 231-32, 108 S.Ct. 978. \u201c[T]he disclosure required by the securities laws is measured not by literal truth, but by the ability of the statements to accurately inform rather than mislead prospective buyers.\u201d <em>Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., </em>565 F.3d 228, 248 (5th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants\u2019 statements of optimism<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> were also materially false or misleading. There were no \u201cstrong shows of hydrocarbons\u201d to justify encouragement. By March 16, 2012, the test of the C9 formation was completed, Defendants knew about the disappointing results (\u00b6\u00b6 63, 67, 99), and SK had decided not to participate in or to fund testing of the adjoining C7 formation (\u00b6\u00b6 64, 69), none of which was disclosed to investors. Thus Defendants\u2019 statements on March 1, 2012 (\u201cthe well exhibited oil shows while drilling, and other indications of hydrocarbons such as log analysis that indicate possible productive sands\u201d), on March 7, 2012 (same), on March 16, 2012 (\u201cWe remain optimistic about our CPO 4 prospect\u201d), and on April 4, 2012 (\u201cAlthough there have been delays with the testing, the Company remains optimistic that these conditions will be overcome and that it will be able, to establish a successful test on the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well.\u201d) were materially false or misleading. When Defendants chose to speak about the progress and results of the partners\u2019 exploration of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well, they had a duty to do so truthfully, accurately, and in a way that would not mislead investors. <em>In re Enron Corp. Sec., Derivative, and \u201cERISA\u201d Litig., </em>258 F.Supp.2d 576, 590 (S.D.Tex.2003) (when a \u201ccorporation makes a disclosure of material fact, voluntarily or involuntarily, the courts have recognized that \u2018there is a duty to make it complete and accurate.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d. at 249 (\u201cOnce the defendants engaged in public discussion concerning the benefits of Type I affiliation and the no-deposit programs, they had a duty to disclose a \u2018mix of information\u2019 that is not misleading\u201d); <em>Rubinstein, </em>20 F.3d at 170 (\u201c[Ujnder Rule 10b-5, a duty to speak the full truth arises when a defendant undertakes to say anything.\u201d). Plaintiffs further claim that the statements identified by Defendants as cautionary statements are inapposite because they only caution about the quantity (\u201cthere is no assurance that we will locate hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to be commercially viable\u201d) of recoverable hydrocarbons, but not the quality. Defendants\u2019 repeatedly positive description of the hydrocarbon shows and the progress in the Tamand\u00faa well were materially false or misleading because they led investors to believe that Houston American had found hydrocarbons of a commercially viable quality, i.e., a quality that could potentially be producible by conventional petroleum production <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>techniques), when actually- that had not been determined. Defendants did not disclose the real risk that the hydrocarbons might not be producible at all by economically viable means, as proved to be true. The cautionary warnings did not put investors on notice that Houston American\u2019s statements that it had found oil were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Plaintiffs insist that Defendants\u2019 November 9, 2009 statement of \u201crecoverable oil reserves\u201d is not shielded by the safe harbor provision for several reasons. First, the statement about the estimate of 1-4 billion barrels of recoverable reserves is not forward-looking, but a statement of existing fact because Defendants represented that they had a basis for making that estimate. Industry standards require a minimum amount of testing and analysis before a company can classify oil estimates as \u201creserves.\u201d Their statement implies that they had conducted the necessary testing when they had not. Even if it could be interpreted as forward-looking, the safe harbor would not apply because the statement was \u25a0 not accompanied by any meaningful cautionary statements that would trigger such protection. <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d at 244-45 (requiring \u201c \u2018substantive\u2019 company-specific warnings based on a realistic description of the risks applicable to the particular circumstances\u201d). It is well settled that boilerplate risk warnings such as those Defendants seek to hide behind will not shield defendants who in fact knew full well of the adverse facts belying their public representations. Risk disclosures containing generalized warnings about industry conditions - that may affect the company\u2019s business and financial results, \u201csuch as that the mineral exploration business is inherently, risky, need not be disclosed as such information is already included in the \u2018total mix of information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rubinstein, </em>20 F.3d at 168 n. 30 (noting that alleged misrepresentations and cautionary language must be analyzed in context and the presence of cautionary language is not <em>per se </em>dispositive), <em>citing Krim, </em>989 F.2d at 1446 (observing that securities laws require issuers to disclose material, firm-specific information regarding predictions \u2014 not information concerning general economic \u201cfacts\u201d and conditions already known to investors and analysts). Furthermore, the adequacy of risk warnings is a factual issue not to be resolved on the pleadings. <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d at 248 (\u201cBecause \u2018reasonable minds could ... disagree as to whether the mix of information in the document is misleading,\u2019 the statutory safe harbor provision cannot provide the basis for dismissal as a matter of law.\u201d); <em>Lone Star Ladies Inv. Club v. Schlotzsky\u2019s, Inc., </em>238 F.3d 363, 369 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cWhatever the ultimate answer to the adequacy of the disclosures under the [Securities] Act, we are not persuaded that the decision ought to be made here in ruling on a motion to dismiss.\u201d). The Court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Plaintiffs also object to Defendants\u2019 contention that the November 9, 2009 misrepresentation regarding the oil reserve estimate fails because it is time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(b),<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>provides that a securities fraud claim must be brought no later than the earlier of two years after discovery of the facts constituting the violation or five years after such violation. They arg\u00fce that the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense and should not be considered by the Court on a motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Plaintiffs further contend that in <em>Merck &amp; Co., Inc. v. Merck, </em>559 U.S. 633, 130 S.Ct. 1784, 176 L.Ed.2d 582 (2010), the Supreme Court held that the statute of limitations for securities plaintiffs only begins to run once plaintiffs are on notice of the facts constituting each element of the alleged \u00a7 [10(b) ] violation.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Plaintiffs maintain that since scienter is one element of a \u00a7 10(b)/Rule 10b-5 claim, before limitations could begin to run plaintiffs had to be on notice of specific facts evidencing Defendants\u2019 scienter of the alleged misstatements. They cite <em>City of Pontiac General Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. MBIA, Inc., </em>637 F.3d 169, 175 (2d Cir.2011) (holding that under <em>Merck, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>\u201ca fact is not deemed \u2018discovered\u2019 until a reasonably diligent plaintiff would have sufficient information about that fact to adequately plead it in a complaint,\u201d i.e., \u201cuntil he can plead that fact with sufficient detail and particularity to survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.\u201d).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Second Circuit remanded the suit to the district court, <em>inter alia, </em>in light of <em>Merck\u2019s </em>ruling on the statute of limitations to determine whether, in light of the defendant\u2019s inquiry notice defense the plaintiffs had sufficient information about the defendant\u2019s scienter to plead their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Plaintiffs claim that they did not have access to facts supporting Defendants\u2019 scienter regarding the November 9, 2009 misrepresentation about the CPO 4 oil reserve estimate until at least April 19, 2012, when Houston American disclosed that it was being investigated by the SEC. # 44, \u00b6\u00b6 88, 106, 112. Plaintiffs did not learn until November 9, 2012 that the SEC was focused on Defendants\u2019 disclosures about the oil potential in CPO 4. # 44, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 112. They also maintain that only during Plaintiffs\u2019 investigation to prepare their Amended Complaint, filed on November 15, 2012, did Confidential Witness 1 inform them that Houston American did not Conduct any te\u00e1ts necessary to estimate the amount of recoverable reserves and therefore lacked a reasonable basis to claim that they had discovered reserves. Although Defendants argue that limitations began to run no later than June 28, 2010 when the Sharesleuth.com articles published on the internet questioned the'\u2019veracity of Defendants\u2019 \u201caudacious\u201d claims of 1-4 billion barrels of potential reserves, it failed to cite any tangible evidence that Defendants were intentionally misleading investors. # 44, \u00b6\u00b6 79-81. In addition Defendants continued to falsely reassure investors about its growing reserves and production. <em>In re Dynegy, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>339 F.Supp.2d 804, 850 (S.D.Tex.2004) (\u201cInvestors are not placed on inquiry notice when \u2018the warning signs are accompanied by reliable words of comfort from management\u2019 \u201d \u201cif an investor of ordinary intelligence would reasonably rely on the statements to allay the investor\u2019s concern.\u201d), <em>quoting LC Capital Partners, LP v. Frontier Ins. Group, Inc., </em>318 F.3d 148, 155 (2d Cir.2003).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Plaintiffs insist that the extension of the Class Period does not require republication of lead plaintiff notices. Not only do Defendants fail to show why the current Lead Plaintiffs cannot adequately represent investors covered by the expanded Class period, but Defendants have no chance to be appointed Lead Plaintiffs because current Lead Plaintiffs have suffered far more substantial losses, more than $1.5 million. Decl. of Federman, Ex. A and B in support of Spitzberg/Gerber Group\u2019s motion for consolidation, appointment of Lead Plaintiffs, and approval of Lead Plaintiffs\u2019 selection of co-lead counsel (#20). The cost of republication would outweigh any marginal gains from notifying class members of the extension of the Class Period. <em>In re Cyberonics Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>468 F.Supp.2d 936, 938 (S.D.Tex.2006), <em>citing Greenberg v. Bear Steams &amp; Co., </em>80 F.Supp.2d 65 (E.D.N.Y.2000) (holding that the PSLRA \u201cdoes not mandate, nor does it suggest, that a Court approved lead plaintiff must re-publish a notice of the purported class after an amended complaint is filed.... In cases where amended complaints encompassed the same claims and securities, but different class periods, courts have generally found that \u2018the efficiency of republication outweighs the marginal fairness gains of notifying class members of an extended class period.\u2019 \u201d) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Plaintiffs also assert that they have adequately alleged a claim based on Defendants\u2019 failure to disclose the SEC investigation, which was clearly a \u201cthreatened\u201d proceeding. They argue that since Defendants stated in their 2010 Form 10-K and 2011 Form 10-K that they are \u201cnot aware of any current, pending, or threatened litigation or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial conditions,\u201d Defendants had a duty to complete that disclosure. <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d at 249 (\u201c[W]e have long held under Rule 10b-5, a duty to speak the full truth arises when a defendant undertakes a duty to say anything.\u201d). The SEC\u2019s investigation related to Houston American\u2019s core operations\u2014 oil reserves and drilling \u2014 a matter that was indisputably material to investors in deciding whether to buy its stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Regarding allegations of scienter as to Terwilliger and Jacobs, Plaintiffs cite <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d at 254, for the proposition that where a plaintiff demonstrates that an inference of scienter is at least \u201cequally as compelling as any alternative inference,\u201d the \u201ctie favors the plaintiff.\u201d <em>See also ACA Fin. Guar. Corp. v. Advest, Inc., </em>512 F.3d 46, 59 (1st Cir.2008) (\u201cWhere there are equally strong inferences for and against scienter, <em>Tellabs </em>now awards the draw to the plaintiff.\u201d). Plaintiffs maintain that the Amended Complaint contains numerous allegations that Terwilliger and Jacobs knew or recklessly disregarded the alleged fraud based on their knowledge of and access to contrary information. Such evidence is provided in the statements of Confidential Witnesses who worked side by side with Defendants on the Tamand\u00faa well project and who directly contradict Defendants\u2019 public statements. Moreover Defendants fail to refute any of the Confidential Witnesses\u2019 statements about the November 9, 2009 reserves statements. As noted, Jacobs signed the Form 8-K <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>that included the allegedly materially false and/or misleading reserves estimate. To demonstrate that Terwilliger and Jacobs had scienter, the complaint adequately asserts that the drilling partners had a management committee and a technical committee that regularly met to discuss efforts at Tamand\u00faa (# 44, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 66), and that Terwilliger and Jacobs sat on both committees along with Confidential Witnesses 3 and 4 from SK. Both Confidential Witnesses stated that the drilling never produced any evidence of strong hydrocarbon shows. Confidential Witness 3 stated that even before drilling began, SK had low expectations for CPO 4 and that after seeing the seismic data, SK wanted to drill only two wells. The daily reports sent to Houston American detailing \u201ceverything that happened at the well\u201d and the information conveyed to Defendants during the committee meetings contradicted representations made by Defendants publicly. Furthermore, Confidential Witnesses 3, 4, and 5 all testified that the tests on the drilling operations to determine whether there were any hydrocarbons found nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Plaintiffs further point out that Houston American is a tiny company with only three employees (two being Terwilliger and Jacobs) and its only source of revenue is oil exploration, adding to a strong inference of scienter. <em>Nathenson v. Zonagen, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 400, 425 (5th Cir.2001) (in a small company making a single product, finding scienter adequately alleged for statements about patent protection for that product that was \u201cobviously important,\u201d involved substantial company efforts, and about which the CEO had \u201cam-pie opportunity to become familiar\u201d); <em>In re Triton Energy Ltd. Sec. Litig., </em>No. 5:98-CIV-256, 2001 WL 872019 (E.D.Tex. March 30, 2001) (finding inference of scienter where fraud involved company\u2019s most important assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Plaintiffs contend that their Confidential Witnesses satisfy the test of <em>ABC Arbitrage, </em>291 F.3d at 352, and <em>Central Laborers\u2019, </em>497 F.3d at 552, in that they are identified with \u201csufficient particularity to support the probability that a person in a position occupied by the source would possess the information alleged.\u201d \u201cConfidential source statements are a permissible basis on which to make an inference of scienter.\u201d <em>Central Laborers, </em>497 F.3d at 552. Plaintiffs have alleged each Confidential Witness\u2019s job title and responsibilities, period of employment, and circumstances under which he or she obtained alleged information. All five were experienced in the oil and gas industry, were in high level positions, and interacted with Defendants or had first-hand knowledge of the development in the Class Period. Their consistency and corroboration of each other\u2019s testimony enhance their reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Moreover, Plaintiffs contend that Terwilliger had a personal financial motive to commit fraud. He pledged approximately 8.1 million of his personal holdings of Houston American stock as collateral for other securities that he had purchased on margin. Thus he had a motive to keep the stock price high to avoid margin calls that could be triggered if the stock price , declined.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> # 44 at \u00b6 21. <em>See, e.g., Goldstein </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>v. MCI WorldCom, </em>340 F.3d 238, 250 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Furthermore, Plaintiffs maintain, Defendants proposed competing inferences are not compelling and are facially less cogent that the strong inference of severe recklessness that arises from allegation in the Amended Complaint. The fact the Defendants invested heavily in the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well is not inconsistent with misrepresenting the results of the drilling. Second they argue that the second test on the C9 formation conducted by Houston American and Gulf Energy at their own expense was a \u201cHail Mary,\u201d a reckless attempt to salvage the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">. As for Defendants\u2019 assertion that warnings and cautionary disclosures weigh against inferring scienter, Plaintiffs argue that the warnings or disclosures do not relate to the alleged material misrepresentations. The case is not about formation damage while drilling or the well being \u201cshut-in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Plaintiffs also insist that they have adequately pleaded loss causation under Fed. R.Civ.P. 8. A complaint only needs to provide the defendant with \u201csome indication of loss and the causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind.\u201d <em>Dura Pharm., </em>544 U.S. at 347, 125 S.Ct. 1627; <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d at 256. The disclosure does not have to \u201creveal that the previous information was fraudulent, only that it was wrong.\u201d <em>In re TETRA Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>2009 WL 6325540 at *9 (S.D.Tex. July 9, 2009). Plaintiffs have alleged what is required: a \u201cfacially \u2018plausible\u2019 causal relationship between the fraudulent statements or omissions and plaintiffs economic loss, including allegations of material misrepresentation or omission, followed by the leaking out of relevant or related truth about the fraud that caused a significant part of the depreciation of the stock and plaintiffs economic loss.\u201d <em>Lormand v. U.S. Unwired, Inc., </em>565 F.3d 228, 258 (5th Cir.2009). The pleading standard is not difficult to satisfy: \u201cAsking for plausible grounds for an element of a claim does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of that element.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, <em>quoting Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 545, 127 S.Ct. 1955. Furthermore, they only need to plead causation, not prove it. <em>Erica P. John Fund, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2183 (holding that securities fraud plaintiffs do not have to prove loss causation to obtain class certification). Houston American\u2019s stock fell by 35.5% when it disclosed the closure of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well, the first indication that the statements about hydrocarbon shows and oil existing were misleading, and the investigation of it by the SEC. #44 at \u00b6\u00b688, 110, 111. The stock also dropped by 17.5% when Houston American disclosed on November 9, 2012 that the focus of the SEC investigation was its representations about the CPO 4 block\u2019s resource potential. # 44 at \u00b6 112 and Federman Deck, Ex. C at 18. The true test results were publicly exposed only by the filing of the complaint in this action on November 15, 2012. <em>See Rubinstein, </em>20 F.3d at 163-65, 170 (securities fraud was adequately alleged where defendant withheld adverse test results regarding oil discovery well). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Defendants claim that their March 29, 2010 disclosure that Houston American had only 1.2 million barrels of net proved reserves corrected its November 9, 2009 statement that the CPO 4 block had 1 to 4 billion barrels of \u201cestimated recoverable reserves, Plaintiffs point out that \u201cproved reserves\u201d are not comparable to \u201crecoverable reserves.\u201d The former is only a fraction of the \u201crecoverable reserve\u201d estimate. Thus Defendants\u2019 disclosure on March 29, 2010 did not indicate that the statements about the larger \u201crecoverable reserve\u201d was false or misleading. Furthermore, the market\u2019s reaction (stock price increased about $1.24 or 7% from the previous day\u2019s close) undercuts the inference that his information was a corrective disclosure. Federman Deck Ex. C at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Finally Plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded control person liability under \u00a7 20(a) because they have alleged a primary violation and because they have alleged facts showing that the Individual. Defendants controlled Houston American, knew of the falsity of the information being published, were in a position to prevent its dissemination, and caused Houston American to violate \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Defendants\u2019 Reply (# 61)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Much of the Reply is' redundant of arguments made in Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Emphasizing that pleading a securities fraud case must meet the specific requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b), Defendants reiterate that Plaintiffs take statements out of context and conflate the drilling phase and the testing phase for the Tamand\u00faa well to show that the statements during the drilling phrase about hydrocarbon shows were false. Defendants again highlight Houston American\u2019s disclosure of numerous problems during the drilling phase and warnings that success was not guaranteed. Confidential Witness 3, who was the only one of the five to be involved during the drilling phase, acknowledged there were hydrocarbon shows, but there is no indication that he shared his opinion with anyone else working on the drilling or that anyone else agreed or disagreed with him. None of the Confidential Witnesses disputes that hydrocarbon inflows necessitated shutting in the Tamand\u00faa well and replacing surface equipment. Furthermore Confidential Witnesses 4 and 5 did not join the project until the testing phase. Confidential Witness 4 reached his conclusion about the significance of the hydrocarbon shows after reviewing information from the testing phase. Although Plaintiffs argue that the test results should be considered because there are no allegations that Defendants\u2019 materially false or misleading statements ended in 2011, the only statements they challenge in 2012 relate to the drilling phase, not the testing phase. # 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 98, 101. Defendants insist that the Amended Complaint fails to plead particularized facts showing that Houston American\u2019s statements regarding the drilling phase of the Tamand\u00faa well were false or fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Maintaining that the Amended Complaint does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter, Defendants argue that it does not describe any communications with Houston American about the disputed hydrocarbon shows or report that came to Houston American\u2019s attention that the shows were not \u201cstrong\u201d or did not exhibit oil and gas. The Amended Complaint only generally asserts that \u201cdaily reports\u201d showed \u201ceverything that happened at the weil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">As noted in footnote 10, Defendants contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 insistence that Houston . American misled investors by using the term \u201creserves\u201d because it had not yet drilled wells on CPO 4 at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>November 2009 estimate, even if Plaintiffs were correct that the term refers to the definition in the PRMS, Houston American made it clear that it had not yet drilled the first two exploratory wells. There is no strong inference of an intent to defraud where the defendants voluntarily disclose in the same presentation the very information that Plaintiffs argue shows that part of the presentation was false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Moreover Defendants assert that they have shown overwhelming competing inferences under <em>Tellabs </em>that Terwilliger and Jacobs did not act fraudulently and that Plaintiffs only conclusorily assert that these competing inferences are not compelling. Plaintiffs fail to explain, no less allege facts showing, why Houston American would make positive statements about a well it knew would fail a few months later, or spend tens of millions of dollars drilling and testing the well, including approximately $5 million at its own expense after SK gave up. They speculate the second test was a \u201cHail Mary\u201d but allege no facts to support that speculation. Although Plaintiffs claim that Houston American made the false statements to inflate Houston American\u2019s share price, the fact remains that Jacobs never sold any of his stock and Terwilliger sold stock only after the well failed and the share price declined. No Defendants are alleged to have sold any stock during the lengthy two-and-a-half-year putative class period. <em>Zonagen, </em>267 F.3d at 420-21 (\u201cThe fact that the other defendants did not sell their shares during the relevant class period undermines plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u201d), <em>quoting Acito v. IMCERA Group, </em>47 F.3d 47, 54 (2d Cir.1995). Since completion of the drilling established a definite end date for any alleged fraud, if a defendant believed the well would fail, he would be in a much better position by selling the stock before that point. Plaintiffs cite no authority for their argument that Terwilliger had a motive to commit fraud because he pledged his Houston American shares as collateral for other securities.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Defendants repeat that the November 2009 estimate is a forward-looking statement protected by safe harbor, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77z-2, because it is a statement of future performance: one cannot determine whether the estimate will prove correct until future drilling activities are complete. Meaningful cautionary language is present in Houston American\u2019s annual report, which contains nine pages of detailed industry-specific risk disclosures, none of which are addressed by Plaintiffs. Nor do Plaintiffs specify what risks had begun to materialize in November 2009 and whether they were included in those detailed and specific risk disclosures. Third, the adequacy of Houston American\u2019s warnings can be determined at the pleading stage. <em>See, e.g., Home Solutions of America Investor Group v. Fradella, </em>Civ. A. No. 3:06-CV-1096-N, 2008 WL 1744588, *6 (N.D.Tex. Mar. 24, 2008) (\u201cCourts in this district have routinely found the safe harbor applicable when the required \u2018meaningful cautionary language\u2019 was contained in SEC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>filings that were incorporated by reference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Defendants again insist that the claim based on the November 2009 estimate is time-barred because it was not asserted within two years of discovery of the facts constituting the alleged violation. It was misleading because the information that Plaintiffs use to support their argument, i.e., that Houston American did not have one to four billion barrels in \u201creserves\u201d as defined by the PRMS because it had not yet drilled wells or conducted formation tests on CPO 4 and thus could not have reserves at that time, is clear from the November 2009 presentation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Defendants reiterate that Plaintiffs have not pleaded loss causation because they do not allege any disclosures about the Tamand\u00faa well that inflated the value of America\u2019s stock; although such an allegation though not sufficient by itself, it is a required element.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Dura Pharm., </em>544 U.S. at 347, 125 S.Ct. 1627 (complaint that merely alleges plaintiffs paid \u201cartificially inflated price\u201d fails to state a claim). They do not allege that statements about the well, specifically about the hydrocarbon shows, inflated the price of Houston American\u2019s stock. Plaintiffs did not plead but now argue that the April 19, 2012 announcement of the closure of the Tamand\u00faa well was \u201cthe first hint\u201d that the hydrocarbon statements were allegedly false or misleading and that \u201cthe true nature of the test results were finally publicly exposed only by the filing of the Complaint on November 15, 2012.\u201d Pl.s\u2019 Opp., # 54 at 40. Plaintiffs fail to assert that the 2012 press releases announcing unsuccessful testing on the Tamand\u00faa well corrected any statements about hydrocarbon shows observed while drilling. Thus they fail to plead loss causation with respect to this claim.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Although the stock closed two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>cents lower on November 16, 2012, it closed three cents higher on the next trading day. Ex. M. In sum, argue Defendants, there is no inflation on the front end and no correction on the back end, and thus no loss causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">As for the November 2009 resource estimate, Defendants contend that it is not plausible that investors were under the impressions that Houston American had 1-4 billion barrels of \u201creserves\u201d as defined by the PRMS. Moreover none of the disclosures cited by Plaintiffs correct this misimpression. Neither of two articles cited by Plaintiffs suggest that anyone ever believed that Houston American\u2019s estimate referred to the PRMS reserves based on actual production or formation tests. # 54 at p. 41; # 44, \u00b6\u00b6 75, 79. It is also not plausible that the two disclosures they cite concerning the SEC investigation in April and November 2012 revealed any \u201ctruth\u201d about the November 2009 estimate that caused the share price to fall. The April 2009 disclosure does not state anything about the November 2009 estimate. The \u201c17.5%\u201d drop that Plaintiffs refer to in November 2012 is actually a 10-eent drop at a time when Houston American\u2019s share price had already lost most of its value. <em>See In re Redback Networks Sec. Litig., </em>Bo. C 03-5642 JF (HRL), 2007 WL 4259464, at *5 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 4, 2007) (\u201cDefendants respond, correctly, that Plaintiffs must do more than give \u2018some indication\u2019 of what a causal connection \u2018might be,\u2019 and that Plaintiffs must show a plausible factual theory of the causal connection between the alleged misrepresentations and the claimed loss.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Defendants maintain that the bottom line is the \u201cHouston American\u2019s share price declined because a risk Houston American disclosed and that was well known \u2014 that Houston American may not discover commercially viable hydrocarbons in the Tamand\u00faa well \u2014 came to fruition. The Amended Complaint fails to allege that any decline following the materialization of this known risk is attributable to a purportedly false statement by Houston American, and therefore fails to plead loss causation.\u201d # 61 at p. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Court\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">After considering the allegations in the Amended Complaint as a whole, although a close question, the Court finds that Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">There is no dispute that the challenged misrepresentations or omissions are material. Plaintiffs have specified each statement, the date and place the statements were made, who made them or who signed the relevant SEC-filed document, and explained why they find that the statement was misleading, as required by the PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l) by showing what the real situation in the well drilling allegedly was before or at the time each statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-10\">Although Plaintiffs have not pleaded a cognizable motive of personal financial gain for Defendants\u2019 alleged material misstatements and omissions, with regard to establishing scienter, an unusual and, in this action, a very significant factor is highlighted by Plaintiffs. Houston American is a very small company with only three employees: Houston American\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>President and Chairman of the Board of Directors Terwilliger, its Chief Financial Officer Jacobs, and Senior Vice President of Exploration Jeffers. The suit focuses on the first and only well that this small company, with two partners, was drilling at the time on the CPO 4 block, the Tamand\u00faa # 1. Moreover, to oversee and direct that project Houston American established two small committees: (1) the management committee, composed of only six people and charged with making the decisions about exploration, drilling and production on the CPO 4 block, as well as how deep to drill, and (2) the technical committee, composed of only 7 individuals. Houston American\u2019s only three employees, Terwilliger, Jacobs and Jeffers, sat on both committees. As pleaded by Plaintiffs, the five Confidential Witnesses were each hired for their experience and expertise in drilling such wells. Confidential Witness 8, a geophysicist and Senior Vice President of Americas for SK Innovation Co. from January 2011 (prior to the commencement of the drilling) to June 2012, was responsible for managing the drilling operation of the CPO 4 block, and also sat on both the management committee and the technical committee.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Confidential Witness 3 testified that the members of the technical committee met regularly in Houston to review the progress at the CPO 4 block and to discuss the next steps, communicating almost daily by phone and email. Plaintiffs allege that the management committee purportedly disagreed about how to proceed with drilling in the CPO 4 block, and Confidential Witness 3 reported that he had disagreements with Houston American and that the partners also disagreed about where to drill the wells and about economic justification for drilling them, with SK less optimistic than Houston American about the prudence of doing so based on Confidential Witness 3\u2019s review of the seismic data. Confidential Witness 3 stated that the well bit got stuck repeatedly and the engineers were unable to determine why, so finally the management committee unanimously chose to sidetrack the well twice even though sidetracking increased the cost. The Court finds that it is not reasonable that, with so few members, each either a key player in the partner companies or an experienced expert in the industry, the two committees did not thoroughly discuss the problems with the drilling of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well and/or that all the members were not fully apprised of the specific details of the actual situation when the challenged disclosures to potential investors were made about the drilling of the well. <em>See Nathenson, </em>267 F.3d at 424-25 (although normally an officer\u2019s position in a company is not sufficient to create the requisite inference of scienter,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the court found from a combination of special circumstances that an officer\u2019s position in a defendant company may create an inference of scienter when the company is a small, one-product company devoting most of its efforts and expenditures to that product with its future prospects substantially dependent on it). All the alleged misrepresentations and omissions were made by Terwilliger and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Jacobs. Thus an inference of scienter as to these two Individual Defendants could arise from the pleadings, based on specific information purportedly shared and argued about among the few committee members and testified to by the Confidential Witnesses, but misrepresented in Houston American\u2019s press releases and SEC filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Nevertheless, as the Supreme Court held in <em>Tellabs, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2510,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">The strength of an inference cannot be decided in a vacuum. The inquiry is inherently comparative\u201d How likely is it that one conclusion, as compared to others, follows from the underlying facts? To determine whether the plaintiff has alleged facts that give rise to the requisite \u201cstrong inference\u201d of scienter, a court must consider plausible, nonculpable explanations for the defendant\u2019s conduct, as well as inferences favoring the plaintiff.... [T]he inference of scienter must be more than \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cpermissible\u201d \u2014 it must be cogent and compelling, thus strong in light of other explanations. A complaint will survive, we hold, only if a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as compelling as any opposing inference one could draw from the facts alleged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Taking all the pleaded facts as true, the Court finds that, along with the absence of a motive of personal gain, the obstacle to finding this inference of scienter as compelling in comparison with other explanations, is Houston American\u2019s decision, despite the Confidential Witnesses\u2019 conclusions and SK\u2019s resulting withdrawal, to spend another $5 million for more testing of the well after the first testing produced negative results according to the Amended Complaint\u2019s allegations. So, too, does SK\u2019s decision after the first testing to abandon the Tamand\u00faa well # 1, but to remain committed to drilling another in the CPO 4 block. The Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs\u2019 explanation that Houston American\u2019s decision to continue testing the well was a desperate \u201cHail Mary\u201d decision does not make sense for a small company whose President and Chief Financial Officer, Terwilliger and Jacobs, knowingly made the statements alleged to be false or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Furthermore Plaintiffs fail to address whether the alleged misstatements or omissions were the actual cause of their economic loss as opposed to other explanations, e.g., changed economic circumstances or investor expectations or industry-specific facts. <em>Dura Pharms., </em>544 U.S. at 342,125 S.Ct. 1627.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Because Plaintiffs fail to state a primary violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, their claim for control person liability under \u00a7 20 also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Because the law relied upon by the Court in reaching its decision is established and clear and because Plaintiffs have already been given an opportunity to amend in filing the governing complaint, the Court finds granting another leave to amend would be futile. Accordingly, the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">ORDERS that Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim (# 53) is GRANTED and this action is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-8\">.

In their memorandum (#54 at p. 16), Plaintiffs emphasize that the distinction between \"resources\" and \"reserves\u201d is the likelihood that a company can get any oil out of the ground in commercial quantities, a fact that undoubtedly is material to investors. They charge that by representing that CPO 4 contained an estimated 1 to 4 billion barrels of estimated recoverable \"reserves,\" Defendants falsely led investors to believe that there was a high level of confidence in the commercial productibility of barrels of oil from CPO 4, when they had no idea if it was true. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs also point out that Defendants do not deny Confidential Witness l's statement that Houston American failed to conduct any tests in CPO 4 that were required by industry standards to substantiate the presence of reserves nor that PRMS\u2019s definition of reserves is the industry standard \"designed to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>a common reference for the international petroleum industry, including national reporting and regulatoiy disclosure agencies.\u201d # 54 at p. 23, citing # 44, \u00b6 42.

In their motion to dismiss (#53 at p. 13), Defendants object that Plaintiffs' argument rests entirely on the assumption that the term \"reserves\u201d used by Houston American has the same meaning as the PRMS assigns to it. Highlighting the fact that the PRMS definition requires a \u201chigh confidence in the commercial productibility of the reservoir as supported by actual production and formation tests,\u201d Defendants insist the definition does not apply because when it made the estimate of 1-4 billion barrels, Houston American had just acquired its interest in CPO 4 and had not yet drilled a well, had no production data, and repeatedly disclosed in its SEC filings and press releases that it might not discover hydrocarbons in commercially viable filings. Moreover the PRMS definition closely tracks the definition of reserves applicable to SEC filings. On the first page of the investor presentation that the document uses, Houston American stales that the document uses certain terms \"that the SEC guidelines strictly prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC\u201d and that \"[tjhese terms include reserves with substantially less certainty, and no discount or other adjustment is included in the presentation of such reserved numbers.\u201d # 53 at p. 15, citing Exhibit H and Exhibit I at 1. Furthermore Defendants point out that Houston American\u2019s SEC filings disclose its proved oil and natural gas reserves. # 54, Ex. J (Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, filed on March 16, 2010); Ex. K (highlighted excerpts of Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, filed on March 29, 2010). They state that these reserve figures are prepared by an independent engineering firm and that Plaintiffs do not challenge these figures. If Plaintiffs believed their contention that the estimate in the November 2009 presentation refers to reserves where there is \u201chigh confidence in the commercial productibility ... as supported by actual production or formation tests,\u201d they would have realized their mistake when Houston American filed its 10-K showing approximately 1.2 million barrels of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves in Colombia. In addition the November 2009 presentation shows that (1) Houston American had just acquired its interest in CPO 4; (2) the estimate is based on \u201cleads and prospects\u201d from seismic data (and not a reference to \"reserves\u201d as defined by PRMS), which are clues and places to go looking for oil, not discovered oil; and (3) that SK and Houston American had not yet drilled any wells on CPO 4 and would not do so until obtaining additional 3D seismic data for the block. #53 at p. 16, and Ex. I at pp. 12, 34 (discussing 3D seismic to be completed by December 2010 and Houston American's share of the seismic cost).

[Alllegations must be considered collectively; the significance that can be ascribed to an allegation of motive, or lack thereof, depends on the entirety of the complaint.\u201d <em>In accord, In re Franklin Bank Corp., </em>782 F.Supp.2d 364, 377 (S.D.Tex.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\">. Defendants misrepresent the requirements of loss causation. In its most recent opinion, <em>Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., </em>718 F.3d 423, 434 (5th Cir.2013), the Fifth Circuit wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">Although the 10b-5 fraud action does not expressly require proof of price impact as an element of the claim, a plaintiff must nevertheless prevail on this fact in order to establish another element on which the plaintiff does bear the burden of proof: loss causation. As the [Supreme Court in <em>Erica P. John Fund, Inc. v. Halliburton Co., </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2179, 180 L.Ed.2d 24 (2011)] stated, \"\u2018Price impact\u2019 simply refers to the effect of a misrepresentation on the stock price,\u201d 131 S.Ct. at 2187. Price impact can be shown <em>either </em>by an increase in price following a fraudulent public statement <em>or a decrease in price following a revelation of the fraud </em>[emphasis added by this Court].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">\"In other words, proof of a fraudulently inflated purchase price only satisfies reliance; loss causation requires going a step further to supply 'the logical link between the inflated share price and any later economic loss.\u2019 \u201d <em>FindWhat, </em>658 F.3d at 1311, <em>quoting Dura Pharms., </em>544 U.S. at 342, 125 S.Ct. 1627.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b689-13\">. As noted <em>supra, </em>\"[L]oss causation may be pleaded on the theory that the truth gradually emerged through a series of partial disclosures and that an entire series of partial disclosures caused the stock price deflation.\u201d <em>Lormand, </em>565 F.3d at 261. Defendants\u2019 challenge to this single, final disclosure ignores the gradual series of disclosures pleaded by Plaintiffs and the price impact on Houston American's stock. Plaintiffs allege that Houston American\u2019s press release on April 4, 20012 disclosing that formation damage to the C9 and C7 was delaying drilling and testing on the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well. #44, \u00b6 108. Following this disclosure that same day Houston American's stock fell $0.11, and continued to fall for the next three trading days until it closed at $3.67 on April 10, 2012. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 109. On April 19, 2012 Houston American\u2019s stock fell by 35.5% to close at $2.25 per share when it disclosed the closure of the Tamand\u00faa # 1 well, the first indication that the statements about hydrocarbon shows and oil existing were misleading, and that it was being investigated by the SEC. # 44 at \u00b6\u00b6 110, 111. The stock also dropped by 17.5% when Houston American disclosed on November 9, 2012 that the focus of the SEC investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>was its representations about the CPO 4 block\u2019s resource potential. # 44 at \u00b6 112 and Federman Decl., Ex. C at 18. Finally Plaintiffs allege that the true test results were publicly exposed only by the filing of the complaint in this action on November 15, 2012. By the final disclosure, the substantial impact on the price of the stock had already occurred. Moreover the Fifth Circuit requires only notice pleading under Rules 8(a) and 12(b)(6), not heightened pleading, for loss causation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b691-4\">.
