Nichter, for judicial release. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 20, 2010, appellant filed an indictment charging appellee with 1 count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity under R.C. 2923.32, 1 count of theft under R.C. 2913.02, 22 counts of identity fraud under R.C. 2913.49, 20 counts of forgery under R.C. 2913.31, and 4 counts of receiving stolen property under R.C. 2913.51. The indictment alleged that appellee had held himself out as several different licensed residential real estate appraisers and forged appraisals in their names, resulting in a number of financial institutions making potentially under-secured mortgage loans valued over $ 1,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Pursuant to a plea agreement, on November 18, 2011, appellee pleaded guilty to three counts of identity fraud, each a second-degree felony under R.C. 2913.49. The parties jointly recommended to the trial court sentences of four years on each count to run concurrently. On January 13, 2012, the trial court accepted appellee's plea of guilty to three counts of identity fraud and dismissed the remaining counts. At the sentencing hearing, two of appellee's victims, Durk Reese and Mark Harmon, told the trial court the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   MR. REESE: In November '09, I started my own appraisal business. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In March * * * of 2010, I received a compl[ai]nt from the Division of Real Estate that my license was under investigation\n   for bad appraisers. I couldn't grow my business because I was under investigation. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   In July of 2010, I found out through other clients of mine that I've been blackballed. That means I couldn't do work no where. * * * That cost me 50 percent of my clients[.] My livelihood, my ability to take care of my family was almost - you know, it was gone. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   * * * I'd been blackballed because * * * all the expenses had gone to [appellee]. Not to me. He signed my name, but he put his own e-mail address, his own home number, his own fax on but with my name. So everything went to him. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   * * * I can't get all the money I lost. * * * I know I lost thousands of dollars of hard money, potential income. It could be hundreds of thousands of dollars that I lost in the two years that it's taken to do this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Jan. 13, 2012 Tr. at 14-17.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   MR. HARMON: I went to work for [appellee] in 2006 as his appraiser apprentice. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   In March 2009, I left his appraisal business for a better opportunity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In April of 2010, I was notified by City Mortgage that there was significant deficiencies in two reports that I had submitted[.] Because of their negative review, I had been placed on their internal do-not-use list. [T]he list that's shared with the general public. It's common knowledge throughout the appraisal industry[.] This prevented me from working[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [I]t was discovered that the appraisal reports that had received the negative reviews were written by [appellee]. He signed them using my stolen signature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [I]n early 2010, * * * there was an abundance of work. * * * I was unable to participate in that work. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I've not only been damaged financially, but my reputation has been damaged throughout the industry, [a]nd to have this stigma associated with me makes it very difficult to get work from certain companies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Jan. 13, 2012 Tr. at 18-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The trial court sentenced appellee to four years of imprisonment on each count, all to be served concurrently, and ordered him to write letters of apology to the three professional real estate appraisers who were the victims of appellee's crimes and from whom appellee stole personal identifying information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 5} After serving seven months, appellee filed a motion for judicial release on August 7, 2012. The trial court overruled the motion but indicated that it would reconsider the request after appellee had served one year of his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Appellee filed another motion for judicial release on May 24, 2013. The trial court held a hearing on November 22, 2013 to consider the motion. Appellant urged the trial court to deny the motion based on the seriousness of the crime. On January 13, 2014, the trial court issued an order granting the motion for judicial release, suspending appellee's prison term and placing appellee on a three-year term of community control. Appellant appealed to this court as a matter of right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 7} This court reversed, holding the trial court had failed to make the \"very specific set of findings\" required by R.C. 2929.20(J) and to \"justify its findings with an analysis of the relevant R.C. 2929.12 factors.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant appealed the decision of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In a split decision, we reversed the trial court once again in\n   <em>\n    State v. Nichter\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. No. 15AP-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-3489\">\n    2015-Ohio-3489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205086339\">\n    2015 WL 5086339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Nichter II\n   </em>\n   \"). In\n   <em>\n    Nichter II\n   </em>\n   , we concluded that the trial court \"read verbatim\" the language of the statute and \"acknowledged the required statutory findings\" but \"failed to actually make the findings required\" by the statute.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The trial court held a third hearing on September 10, 2015. Appellant again asserted that granting judicial release would demean the seriousness of the offenses. As a result of the hearing, the trial court again granted appellee's motion for judicial release. At the September 10, 2015 hearing, the trial court also made the following comments on the record:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   The court anticipates that the state will appeal this matter. As such, it will await a ruling from the appellate court on whether this recitation meets statutory requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Whatever the outcome of that appeal, the court wants to be clear that it has no intention of reversing its original decision to grant [appellee's] request for judicial release.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Sept. 10, 2015 Tr. at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant appealed to this court from the decision of the trial court. In a split decision, we reversed the trial court for a third time in\n   <em>\n    State v. Nichter\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016-Ohio-7268\">\n    2016-Ohio-7268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20N.E.3d%201219\">\n    63 N.E.3d 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   \"). In\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   , this court concluded there was no support in the record for the trial court's finding that appellee committed identity fraud while under \"strong provocation.\" We determined that while appellee's own financial difficulties at the time of the offenses may have provided appellee with a motive to commit identity fraud, such financial difficulties did not constitute \"strong provocation\" as that term is used in R.C. 2929.12(C)(2) and 2929.20(J). We also found no support for the trial court's finding that the absence of actual or expected physical harm to appellee's victims mitigated the seriousness of appellee's offenses because the conduct normally constituting identity fraud does not create a risk of physical harm to the victim. Having so concluded, this court stated it was \"difficult to conceive\" how the aggravating factors found by the trial court outweighed the relevant factors mitigating the seriousness of appellee's criminal conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45. Nevertheless, the majority decision in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   concluded that because the trial court found other substantial grounds to mitigate appellee's offenses but did not identify those grounds in making its ruling, we remanded the case for a third time to allow the trial court \"to expressly identify the other substantial grounds mitigating appellee's conduct on which it relied and to reweigh the statutory factors in light of this decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Our judgment entry stated, in relevant part, \"[i]t is the judgment and order of this court that the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed, and this cause is remanded to that court for further proceedings in accordance with law\n   <em>\n    consistent with said decision\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) (Oct. 21, 2016 Jgmt. Entry at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After this court issued\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   , but before conducting further proceedings on remand, the trial court released appellee from the previously imposed community control sanction by signing off on a \"notification of community control termination\" filed with the court by Franklin County Adult Probation Services (\"FCAPS\"). The FCAPS notification provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   On November 22, 2013, the above named defendant was found guilty of three counts of Taking the Identity of Another (F2) and placed on community control for a period of three (3) year(s). Effective 11/21/2016, the Defendant has complied with the terms of [his] community control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, the Defendant is discharged from community control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (Nov. 29, 2016 Notice of Community Control Termination at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 13} After issuing the order on November 29, 2016 releasing appellee from the community control sanction, the trial court issued a \"criminal case processing sheet\" (\"CSPS\") on January 23, 2017, vacating the previously scheduled hearing on appellee's May 24, 2013 motion for judicial release. The CSPS provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   At the time of scheduling the 1/26/17 date, Defendant was under the jurisdictional supervision of this Court. Since the scheduling of the 1/26/17 court date the Defendant has been terminated from Community Control (effective 11/29/16) and a hearing is no longer necessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 14} However, on motion of appellant, the trial court rescheduled the hearing. On February 26, 2018, the trial court held an oral hearing on appellee's May 24, 2013 motion for judicial release in accordance with this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   . At the hearing, appellee argued the trial court no longer had jurisdiction over the matter because appellee had served his community control sanction. The trial court made the following ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   I am sensitive to the arguments raised by [appellee's counsel] regarding her belief that this court is without jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   However, paragraph 48 of the appellate court's decision from 2016 states that they are reversing and remanding the cause for further proceedings consistent with the decision. Despite all of the procedural processes that occurred in this case,\n   <em>\n    I believe that it would be a dereliction of my duty as the trial court judge to ignore the order of the appellate district not to reconsider the bases outlined in its decision\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   And so I am going to grant the state's motion for a hearing on the judicial release motion that was filed in May of 2013. So that is why we are here today.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Emphasis added.) (Feb. 26, 2018 Tr. at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On March 8, 2018, the trial court issued a decision and entry granting appellee's May 24, 2013 motion for judicial release. After making the statement at the hearing that \"it would be a dereliction of my duty as the trial court judge to ignore the order of the appellate district not to reconsider the bases outlined in its decision,\" the trial court disregarded the specific instructions of this court and, once again, found that strong provocation indicated\n   appellee's conduct was not more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense of identity fraud. (Feb. 26, 2018 Tr. at 10.) Even though this court in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   determined the mitigating factor listed in R.C. 2929.12(C)(3) was of \"dubious value in mitigating appellee's conduct\" and \"largely irrelevant to the analysis,\" the trial court, once again, found that because appellee did not cause or expect to cause physical harm to his victims, his conduct in committing identity fraud was not more serious than conduct normally constituting that offense.\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45. In keeping with this court's instruction, however, the trial court found, pursuant to R.C. 2929.12(C)(4), that appellee's relatively small financial gain as a result of his crimes and appellee's \"own assessment that his dismal financial situation was the catalyst for his terrible choices\" constituted \"substantial grounds to mitigate [appellee's] conduct, although the grounds are not enough to constitute a defense.\" (Mar. 8, 2018 Decision &amp; Entry at 16, 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 16} As a matter of right, appellant appealed to this court from the trial court's decision modifying the previously imposed sentence by a grant of judicial release. R.C. 2953.08(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [1.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING JUDICIAL RELEASE BY GOING BEYOND AND VIOLATING THIS COURT'S APPELLATE MANDATE AND FAILING TO FOLLOW THIS COURT'S RULING.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [2.] THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING JUDICIAL RELEASE IN THE ABSENCE OF RECORD SUPPORT FOR THE NECESSARY FINDING RELATED TO SERIOUSNESS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The standard of review applied by an appellate court in reviewing a trial court's decision to grant judicial release is found in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), which provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   The court hearing an appeal under division (A), (B), or (C) of this section shall review the record, including the findings underlying the sentence or modification given by the sentencing court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The appellate court may increase, reduce, or otherwise modify a sentence that is appealed under this section or may vacate the sentence and remand the matter to the sentencing court for resentencing. The appellate court's standard for review is not whether the sentencing court abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    The appellate court may take any action authorized by this division if it clearly and convincingly finds either of the following\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    That the record does not support the sentencing court's findings under division (B) or (D) of section 2929.13, division (B)(2)(e) or (C)(4) of section 2929.14, or division (I) of section 2929.20 of the Revised Code, whichever, if any, is relevant\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (b) That the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Though appellee argued in the trial court that his release from the community control sanction divested the trial court of jurisdiction in this matter, neither party raised the issue in this appeal. Nevertheless, because the issue of jurisdiction is a threshold issue for purposes of appeal, this court issued an entry on November 15,\n   2018 ordering the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the following question:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   In light of the trial court's November 29, 201[6] entry terminating appellee's community control, is this matter moot, ripe and/or does this court lack jurisdiction to hear and determine the merits of the instant appeal?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Nov. 15, 2018 Journal Entry at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The parties filed their respective briefs, and this court has considered the jurisdictional question. Appellee maintains the trial court's order releasing appellee from community control divested the trial court of jurisdiction to revisit appellee's motion for judicial release even though this court had repeatedly reversed the trial court's judgments granting judicial release and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. We disagree with appellee's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The procedural history of this case, as set forth above, shows the trial court has never issued an order granting judicial release and imposing a community control sanction that has not been reversed by this court. In each of our prior decisions reversing the trial court's judgment granting judicial release and imposing a community control sanction, we remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to conduct further proceedings on appellee's May 24, 2013 motion for judicial release.\n   <em>\n    Nichter I\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Nichter II\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 22} \" 'The effect of a reversal and an order of remand is to reinstate the case to the docket of the trial court in precisely the same condition that obtained before the error occurred.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In light of this court's prior decisions in this case, the trial court's November 29, 2016 entry did not have the effect of releasing appellee from the trial court's jurisdiction. By reason of our prior decisions in this case, the trial court retained continuing jurisdiction of appellee's May 24, 2013 motion for judicial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Given the limited scope of our remand in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's November 29, 2016 entry merely represents an acknowledgement by the trial court that FCAPS complied with its statutory duty to effectuate the court-ordered community control sanction and that appellee fully complied with the terms of community control. In light of our reversal of the trial court's decision granting judicial release, the trial court's November 29, 2016 entry was more akin to a ministerial function than an adjudication of the parties' substantial rights. Thus, the trial court's November 29, 2016 entry did not render moot appellant's appeal, as of right, from the trial court's judgment granting judicial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 24} For similar reasons, we disagree with appellee's assertion that the trial court's November 29, 2016 order releasing appellee from community control became final due to appellant's failure to file a notice of appeal to this court. There is no question that community control proceedings in felony cases are created by statute and set forth in R.C. 2929.15. \"Like\n   judicial release, community control proceedings are special proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, the Eleventh District reversed the appellant's robbery conviction on finding trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to move for dismissal of the charge on speedy trial grounds. On remand, the trial court reviewed a previously unfiled transcript which established that appellant did not have a meritorious argument for dismissal on speedy trial grounds. The trial court subsequently convicted appellant of robbery and appellant appealed arguing that the trial court erred and violated the law-of-the-case doctrine. Though the Eleventh District admonished the parties for not earlier filing the transcript, the court held that application of the law-of-the-case doctrine under the circumstances would be unjust, and the court affirmed the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 34}\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   does not support appellee's argument in this case.

The procedural history of this case proves the need for such a rule. In the intervening period since the trial court first granted appellee's motion for judicial release in 2013, the trial court has deemed that appellee completed the three-year period of community control initially imposed by it, despite the order never being affirmed on appeal. If the trial court's failure to follow the remand order in this case results in the fourth reversal of the trial court's decision, appellee could be faced with the possibility of serving the remaining 25 months of his prison term. However, the question whether appellee should receive any present or future consideration for time ostensibly served on community control is not an issue raised in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 36} For the foregoing reasons, we hold the trial court erred and violated the law-of-the-case doctrine when it found appellee's criminal conduct in this case was less serious than conduct normally associated with identity fraud because in committing the offense, appellee was under \"strong provocation,\" and because in committing the offense, appellee \"did not cause or expect to cause physical harm to any person or property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   R.C. 2929.12(C)(2) and (3).

Appellant's Second Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 37} In appellant's second assignment of error, appellant argues the record clearly and convincingly fails to support the trial court's finding, pursuant to R.C. 2929.20(J)(1)(b), that the relevant factors indicating appellee's criminal conduct was more serious than the conduct normally constituting identity fraud outweigh the relevant factors indicating appellee's criminal conduct was less serious than the conduct normally constituting identity fraud. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 38} R.C. 2929.20(J) provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    A court shall not grant a judicial release\n   </em>\n   under this section to an eligible offender who is imprisoned for a felony of the first or second degree, or to an eligible offender who committed an offense under Chapter 2925. or 3719. of the Revised Code and for whom there was a presumption under section 2929.13 of the Revised Code in favor of a prison term,\n   <em>\n    unless the court, with reference to factors under section 2929.12 of the Revised Code, finds both of the following\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (a) That a sanction other than a prison term would adequately punish the offender and protect the public from future criminal violations by the eligible offender because the applicable factors indicating a lesser likelihood of recidivism outweigh the applicable factors indicating a greater likelihood of recidivism;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    That a sanction other than a prison term would not demean the seriousness of the offense because factors indicating that the eligible offender's conduct in committing the offense was less serious than conduct normally constituting the offense outweigh factors indicating that the eligible offender's conduct was more serious than conduct normally constituting the offense.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (2) A court that grants a judicial release to an eligible offender under division (J)(1) of this section shall specify on the record both findings required in that division and also shall list all the factors described in that division that were presented at the hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 39} As we concluded in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   , the record in this case clearly and convincingly fails to support the trial court finding that the factors listed in R.C. 2929.12(C)(2) and (3) mitigate appellee's criminal conduct in this case. Accordingly, the trial court was prohibited from considering such factors in determining whether the mitigating factors outweigh the factors identified by the trial court as making appellee's criminal conduct more serious than the conduct normally constituting identity fraud. Nevertheless, the trial court also made a finding, pursuant to R.C. 2929.12(C)(4), that other substantial grounds mitigated appellee's conduct in this case. The trial court found appellee's relatively small financial gain as a result of his crimes and his \"dismal financial situation,\" which \"was the catalyst for [appellee's] terrible choices,\" provided substantial grounds to mitigate appellee's conduct, although such grounds were not enough to constitute a defense. (Mar. 8, 2018 Decision &amp; Entry at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 40} The record in this case establishes that appellee's criminal conduct jeopardized the professional licenses, reputations, businesses, and livelihoods of his victims. At the November 14, 2014 hearing on appellee's motions, one of the victims, Reese, told the trial court that appellee's crimes continues to result in his appraisal\n   license being threatened and the loss of business opportunities. Reese's comments to the court were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   I have had no closure in this whole thing. Every day I have to worry about when the mail is delivered, if I am going to get a certified letter from the Department of HUD, a letter from the Division of Real Estate wanting to pull my real estate license.

Echoing the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   , the trial court speculated that because appellee did not explain the nature and extent of his financial difficulties either to the presentence investigator or in his statements at the hearing, it is possible that a less sinister cause of appellee's dismal financial situation existed, such as the payment of family medical bills. We agree that, on this record, it is possible appellee's dismal financial situation was caused, in whole or in part, by factors other than appellee's selfishness and greed. However, because appellee did not disclose the precise nature and extent of his dismal financial situation, there is no evidentiary basis to conclude that appellee's dismal financial situation was due to issues beyond appellee's control. Thus, the record contains no support for the trial court's finding that appellee's dismal financial situation was \"substantial grounds\" mitigating appellee's criminal conduct.

Based on the foregoing, we find the record clearly and convincingly fails to support the trial court's findings that appellee's relatively small financial gain as a result of his crimes and his \"dismal financial situation,\" which \"was the catalyst for [appellee's] terrible choices,\" provided substantial grounds to mitigate appellee's conduct under R.C. 2929.12(C)(4) and 2929.20(J).

These trial court findings have never been challenged in any of the prior appeals and have not been challenged herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 46} The trial court listed three statutory mitigating factors to support a finding that appellee's conduct was less serious than the conduct normally constituting identity fraud: strong provocation under R.C. 2929.12(C)(2) ; the absence of physical harm to the victims under R.C. 2929.12(C)(3) ; and other substantial grounds to mitigate the offender's conduct under R.C. 2929.12(C)(4), including appellee's relatively small financial gain and his dismal financial situation that was a catalyst for his crimes. The trial court then weighed the factors which made appellee's criminal conduct more serious than the conduct normally constituting identity fraud against the factors which made appellee's conduct less serious and found that appellee's conduct in committing identity fraud was less serious than the conduct normally constituting identity fraud. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.20(J)(2)(b), the trial court further found that because the R.C. 2929.12(C) factors outweighed the R.C. 2929.12(B) factors, a sanction other than prison would not demean the seriousness of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 47} As noted above, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   held the record clearly and convincingly failed to support the trial court's finding that the factors listed in R.C. 2929.12(C)(2) and (3) applied in this case. Because no additional evidence was submitted to the trial court on remand, this court's determination in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   is the settled law of this case. Thus, the trial court erred and violated the law-of-the-case doctrine when it weighed the factors of strong provocation and the absence of physical harm to the victims against the unchallenged R.C. 2929.12(B) factors it found to be present in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 48} In this appeal, we have determined appellee's relatively small financial gain from his crimes and the \"dismal financial situation\" that was a \"catalyst for [appellee's] terrible choices\" are not \"substantial grounds\" mitigating the seriousness of appellee's criminal conduct under R.C. 2929.12(C)(4). (Mar. 8, 2018 Decision &amp; Entry at 17.) Thus, the trial court also erred when it weighed appellee's relatively small financial gain from his crimes and the \"dismal financial situation\" that was a \"catalyst for [appellee's] terrible choices\" against the unchallenged R.C. 2929.12(B) factors found to be present in the case. (Mar. 8, 2018 Decision &amp; Entry at 17.) Because the trial court did not identify any other R.C. 2929.12(C) factors, there are no remaining mitigating factors left to weigh against the unchallenged R.C. 2929.12(B)(4) aggravating factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Based on the above, we hold the trial court erred when it granted appellee's application for judicial release and we sustain appellant's second assignment of error. We find that on this record, appellee failed to carry his burden as to the finding required by R.C. 2929.20(J)(1)(b), as a matter of law, and there is no further need for this court to remand the case to the trial court to make additional findings or engage in the weighing process contemplated by R.C. 2929.20(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 50} R.C. 2929.20(J)(2) clearly places the burden on eligible offenders to prove both of the facts listed in division\n   (J)(1) in order to obtain judicial release.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In order to satisfy his burden of proof under R.C. 2929.12(J)(1)(b), appellee was required to prove that a sanction other than a prison term would not demean the seriousness of the offense because factors indicating that his conduct in committing identity fraud was less serious than conduct normally constituting that offense outweigh factors indicating that his conduct was more serious than conduct normally constituting that offense. Because the trial court thwarted this court's order of remand in\n   <em>\n    Nichter III\n   </em>\n   and failed to identify other substantial grounds mitigating appellee's conduct that are supported by the record, we are left with no alternative but to find that a sanction other than a prison term would demean the seriousness of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Accordingly, pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), we hereby vacate the trial court's judgment granting judicial release and remand this matter for the trial court to issue an order denying judicial release.
