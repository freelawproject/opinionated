Four issues are raised in this appeal. First, Appellant argues the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress; he contends there was no probable cause to obtain a search warrant. Next, he asserts when it was discovered during trial that the state failed to disclose a recorded interview between the investigator from the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy and the confidential informant's mother, the trial court should have either granted his motion for mistrial or his motion for continuance. Third, Appellant argues the trial court erred when it denied his request for a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of entrapment. Last, Appellant contends the trial court erred during sentencing when it failed to advise him of the possible penalties for violating the terms of his community control sanction. For the reasons enumerated below, all arguments are meritless and the convictions are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Statement of the Facts and Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b62} Appellant is a urologist with an office in St. Clairsville, Ohio. Ashley Padgett, who has a degree in surgical technology, worked for Appellant for approximately two years. Her employment with him ended the last week of March 2016. The two were romantically involved for a period of time while she was working for him; their relationship ended in December 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b63} When Padgett left his employment she either took a prescription pad or she was given one by Appellant. She wrote approximately 24 prescriptions for Percocet and used those scripts to buy Percocet from local pharmacies. This eventually caused the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy to investigate. In April 2017, she was interviewed by Leslie Arnold from the Pharmacy Board and Officers Starkey and West from the Martins Ferry Police Department and the Belmont County Major Crimes Unit. Padgett admitted to writing the scripts and she was informed she would be charged for that criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b64} During the interview, Padgett was asked about becoming a confidential informant and asked if she would try to buy drugs from Appellant. She agreed to become a confidential informant; she indicated Appellant knew about her drug problem and while she was working for him he had given her Adderall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b65} Two controlled buys occurred and were recorded. The first buy occurred on April 26, 2016 at Appellant's home in St. Clairsville, Ohio. She bought three Adderall pills from Appellant for $ 36. The following day, April 27, 2016, Padgett attempted another controlled buy from Appellant for five pills for $ 60. This time it was supposed to occur at his office, but ended up occurring at his residence. Appellant did not have the agreed amount of drugs, so he gave her one Adderall and half a Suboxone. Appellant did not take any money from Padgett for these pills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b66} These controlled buys provided the basis for a warrant to search Appellant's residence. The search occurred on April 28, 2017. During the search an Ice Breaker's case was found containing pills. In total eight pink pills, Adderall (Amphetamine ), and a piece of one white pill, Suboxone (Buprenorphine ) were found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b67} As a result of the investigation, controlled purchases, and the search of Appellant's residence, Appellant was indicted for three counts of trafficking, two in violation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(1)(C)(1)(a) and one in violation of R.C. 2925.02(A)(1)(C)(2)(a). The first two were fourth-degree felonies. The last one was a fifth-degree felony. Appellant was also indicted for two counts of possession, one in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(1)(a), a fifth-degree felony and one in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A)(C)(2)(a), a first-degree misdemeanor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b68} Prior to trial, Appellant moved to suppress the items found during the search of the residence arguing the officers failed to obtain a valid search warrant. 12/18/17 Motion to Suppress. Following a hearing, the motion was denied. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr.; 2/6/18 Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on Denial of Motion to Suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b69} At trial, Appellant stipulated he gave the drugs to Padgett on April 26 and 27, 2017. 1/27/18 Trial Tr. 346-347. Appellant sought to prove the affirmative defense of entrapment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b610} At trial, Padgett testified that while she did not have a physical relationship with Appellant after she quit working for him in March 2016, she continued to communicate with him. Padgett claimed after she quit working for Appellant she purchased Adderall from him. She additionally\n   stated that in January or February 2014, when she was working for him, Appellant introduced her to the drug and gave her the drug while she was working for him. The recordings of the controlled purchases were played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b611} The jury found Appellant guilty of all offenses. The court sentenced him to an aggregate sentence of five years of community control to include a six-month jail sentence and a six-month sentence at Eastern Ohio Correction Center. 2/8/18 J.E.; 2/8/18 Sentencing Tr. 6-9. He received five years of community control which included a six-month jail sentence and a six-month sentence at Eastern Ohio Correction Center for each of the trafficking convictions and for the fifth-degree felony possession conviction. 2/8/18 J.E.; 2/8/18 Sentencing Tr. 6-7. For the misdemeanor possession conviction he received a six-month jail sentence. 2/8/18 J.E.; 2/8/18 Sentencing Tr. 9. The trial court ordered the sentences to be served concurrent to each other. 2/8/18 J.E.; 2/8/18 Sentencing Tr. 7. At the sentencing hearing and in the sentencing judgment entry the trial court notified Appellant that if he violated community control he would be sentenced to an 18-month prison term. 2/8/18 J.E.; 2/8/18 Sentencing Tr. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b612} Appellant timely appealed his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    First Assignment of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The trial court erred by overruling Defendant-Appellant's motion to suppress because there was no probable cause to obtain a search warrant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b613} Appellant contends the basis for the search warrant was statements made by Ashley Padgett to law enforcement and the two controlled buys. He contends that when law enforcement requested the search warrant it withheld facts in order to obtain the warrant. For instance, he claims the issuing judge was not informed that Padgett had not had a romantic relationship with Appellant for over a year when the controlled purchase was arranged. Likewise, he contends the court was not informed Padgett allegedly had no contact with Appellant for over a year prior to the controlled buys. He asserts the court was not told of the statements law enforcement personnel told Padgett to use to get Appellant to sell her the drugs; the statements were to use his love for her and that she could convince him to take this risk that was so significant. Appellant argues the withholding of all this information indicates the search warrant was not based on probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b614} The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that, \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" The Fourth Amendment, however, does not contain any \"provision expressly precluding the use of evidence obtained in violation of its commands.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That affidavit solely relied on the two controlled drug transactions and does not reference any statements Padgett made to the officers. It also does not indicate the officer told her what statements she should say to Appellant to get him to sell her drugs. The affidavit does not indicate Padgett's previous contact with Appellant or their prior relationship. It does not state if she previously obtained drugs from Appellant prior to the controlled buys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b619} During the suppression hearing, counsel for Appellant asked Officer Starkey if he knew if Padgett obtained drugs from Appellant during the year prior to the controlled buys. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 41-42. He stated he did not know. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 41-42. Officer Starkey was also questioned about and confirmed that he told Padgett it was important for her to get Appellant to talk about giving her drugs during the controlled buys. 1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 42-43. The recorded controlled buys and Padgett's interview with law enforcement were played for the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b620} In overruling the motion to suppress, the trial court explained the controlled buys were important and provided sufficient probable cause for the search warrant:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Reliable information obtained from credible informants suffices to establish probable cause. There must be a substantial basis however, for believing the source of the hearsay to be credible, and that there is a factual basis for the information furnished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Now, the officers - the officer, singular, who prepared the Affidavit, and the reviewing county court judge who issued the arrest warrant based upon that Affidavit, were not relying merely upon hearsay of the confidential informant. This is not a situation where a confidential informant tells a police officer X, Y and Z, and the police officers uses X, Y and Z in his or her Affidavit to support an arrest, search or whatever. This is a police officer preparing an Affidavit and the reviewing court, county court judge, issuing the arrest warrant after his own investigation, with verified and controlled telephone conversations and buys.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   If you look at the Affidavit, it uses the word \"controlled\", I believe, four times. That's upon which the officer relied. That's upon which the county court judge relied. There were numerous safeguards in place to make certain; it almost made it irrelevant whether the confidential informant was reliable or dependable upon what he or she - she in this case - had told the officers. Safeguards, multiple ones, as indicated were in place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Based upon the totality of the circumstances, the motion to suppress evidence in this case is respectfully, very respectfully, overruled, but nevertheless overruled.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1/11/18 Suppression Tr. 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b621} This reasoning is logical and indicates the trial court had a substantial basis for concluding probable cause existed based on the information contained within the four corners of the affidavit. The fact that the affidavit did not state whether Padgett bought drugs or had any physical contact with Appellant for a year prior to the controlled buys is inconsequential. The controlled buys occurred; Appellant sold or gave her drugs without a prescription during these transactions. This was sufficient probable cause for the search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b622} Furthermore, law enforcement telling Padgett what to say and to use her relationship with Appellant to have him sell her drugs is typical in a controlled drug transaction. Confidential informants are used for controlled buys because drug dealers typically do not sell drugs to a person they do not know for fear it is an undercover police officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Using a previous relationship to obtain drugs from a known distributor and law enforcement indicating what needs to be said or seen in the video recording for purposes of building a case are how controlled buys occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b623} Appellant's arguments about the timing of the controlled buys and law enforcement telling Padgett to use her relationship to get Appellant to take the \"significant risk\" to sell her drugs may support his affirmative defense of entrapment, but it does not negate the fact that the controlled buys occurred. Those controlled buys provided sufficient probable cause for the search warrant.

The State admitted at trial the information regarding the Arnold-Myers conversation was not disclosed; the state did not believe it was part of its investigation and believed it was irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b630} Appellant asserts the information provided to Arnold by Myers was the catalyst to investigate Appellant. He asserts the conversation could have been used to support his entrapment defense. He claims\n   he was committed to the defense of entrapment and the jury could have easily seen this case as a mother protecting her daughter by falsely accusing Appellant and causing an investigation into him to occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b631} Despite Appellant's insistence to the contrary, it does not appear Appellant was committed to the entrapment defense. It was not until the middle of Ashley Padgett's testimony, which was a little over half way through the trial that Appellant stipulated he gave Padgett the drugs. Prior to that point, the questions asked by counsel partially went to the entrapment defense, but also insinuated Padgett had the drugs and there was no evidence Appellant gave her the drugs. It is clear from the record the trial court knew there was a possibility of pursuing an entrapment defense; multiple statements between defense counsel and the trial court confirmed this and the trial court even indicated to counsel that it was getting close to the point for it to decide whether to pursue the affirmative defense. However, at the point the motion for a mistrial or in the alternative motion to continue was made, there was no statement from Appellant that he was definitively pursuing the entrapment defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b632} Regardless, even if he was committed to the defense, Padgett's testimony indicated he was predisposed to commit the crime; he had previous involvement in a similar activity and was not an innocent person who was implanted with the idea by government officials. Padgett stated Appellant had sold her drugs at various times from the fall of 2016 through January 2017, which was prior to the two controlled buys. 1/27/18 Trial Tr. 352, 355, 364. During one of the controlled buys, Appellant stated he gave Padgett Adderall intermittently while she was working for him. 1/27/18 Trial Tr. 358. Padgett also testified that during her employment with Appellant, she would buy Adderall from the same person he did and Appellant would additionally give her some of the ones he bought. 1/27/18 Trial Tr. 364, 366. At the last controlled buy Padgett asked Appellant to write her a prescription for Adderall. He refused, but then gave her an Adderall pill. 1/27/18 Trial Tr. 369. These statements and actions indicate Appellant was predisposed and thus, the entrapment defense would not be applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b633} Consequently, the record does not suggest the Myers-Arnold conversation was material; there is not a probability sufficient to undermine the confidence in the outcome. It is unclear how the Myers-Arnold conversation would alter the above testimony and help Appellant's entrapment defense.

By choosing the word \"specific\" in R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) to describe the notification that a trial judge must give when sentencing an offender to community control, the General Assembly has made clear that the judge shall, in straightforward and affirmative language, inform the offender at the sentencing hearing that the trial court will impose a definite\n   term of imprisonment of a fixed number of months or years, such as \"twelve months' incarceration,\" if the conditions are violated. To comply with the literal terms of the statute, the judge should not simply notify the offender that if the community control conditions are violated, he or she will receive \"the maximum,\" or a range, such as \"six to twelve months,\" or some other indefinite term, such as \"up to 12 months.\" The judge is required to notify the offender of the \"specific\" term the offender faces for violating community control.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) notification is meant to put the offender on notice of the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   prison term he or she faces if a violation of the conditions occurs. However, from the trial court's perspective, the notice does little more than set a ceiling on the potential prison term, leaving the court with the discretion to impose a lesser term than the offender was notified of when a lesser term is appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 19, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b654} The court then stated the notification of a specific prison term is a prerequisite for a later imposition of a prison term if a community control sanction violation occurs.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b655} Considering the Ohio Supreme Court decision, the notification in this instance, which clearly sets forth a specific prison term, is compliant with the mandates of R.C. 2929.19(B)(4). Furthermore, it is noted the Eleventh Appellate District has concluded an R.C. 2929.14(B)(4) advisement stating, \"if there was a sentence imposed in this particular situation, it will be a sentence of 36 months,\" was sufficient even though the trial court did not specifically advise the offender imprisonment could be imposed if the conditions of community control were violated, if the law was violated, or if the offender left the state without permission.\n   <em>\n    State v. Payne\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-5073\">\n    2015-Ohio-5073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20N.E.3d%20872\">\n    53 N.E.3d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24, overruled on other grounds by\n   <em>\n    State v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12537475\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/109/12/\">\n    2018-Ohio-1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12537475\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/109/12/\">\n    109 N.E.3d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20. The advisement in the case before us is more straight forward then the one in\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ; here, the trial court clearly indicated if there was a violation of the terms of the community control the sentence would be 18 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b656} Consequently, since the trial court clearly indicated at the sentencing hearing and in the sentencing judgment entry the specific prison term and stated that prison term would be imposed for a violation of community control, the trial court complied with R.C. 2929.14(B)(4) and there is no error. This assignment of error is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b657} For the reasons set forth above, all four assignments of error lack merit. Appellant's convictions are affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Waite, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Bartlett, J., concurs.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
