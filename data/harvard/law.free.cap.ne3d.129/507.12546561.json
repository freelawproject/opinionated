Appellants were terminated from their at-will, part-time positions as emergency medical technicians (\"EMTs\") after a newly-certified EMT, 19-year-old Brianna Schramm submitted a written incident report alleging that they had harassed her for improperly performing her duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} Appellants argue that the trial court erred by crediting disputed testimony at the summary judgment stage, and in finding that union member and full-time Paramedic Jeff Johnson was not a similarly-situated male employee. Because we agree that Johnson is not a proper comparator based upon uncontroverted evidence in the record, the judgment entry of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b63} An appellate court conducts a de novo review of a trial court's decision to\n   grant summary judgment, using the same standards as the trial court set forth in Civ.R. 56(C).\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

Gast was employed by Appellee for approximately seven years and Mansfield was employed for approximately one year. Appellants held Level one or Basic EMT certification, known as EMT-B, and were licensed to respond to emergency calls. Despite their part-time status, Appellants typically worked 40-50 hours per week in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b612} EMS Coordinator, David Snyder, who had been in the field with Appellants many times, described them as \"very competent EMTs.\" (Snyder Depo. 34). EMS Captain, Brian Cooper described Appellants as \"sticklers\" with regard to procedures and maximizing patient care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b613} Cooper testified that both women had personnel issues within the department, but conceded \"that goes through all EMS. You might look at somebody the wrong way and somebody takes offense at that.\" (Cooper Depo. 21). He identified Nick Jessee, James Tolbert, and a few women that were no longer employed by EMS as employees who stated they did not want to work with Appellants. According to a letter requesting reemployment after Appellants' employment had been terminated, EMT Miranda Landers wrote that she had resigned because Mansfield harassed her and told her to quit when they worked together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b614} Cooper testified that he disregarded the complaints about Appellants as hearsay because the complaining EMTs refused to document their issues in writing. The term \"hearsay\" is derived from a conversation Cooper had with Mayor Paul Riethmiller, who appointed Snyder and Cooper to their supervisory positions at EMS. Riethmiller explained that any complaints regarding personnel should be reduced to writing, insofar as he was unable to rely on hearsay when considering personnel decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b615} Appellants' prior disciplinary history is in dispute. According to Cooper, he had called Appellants to his office four or five times in the past because other EMTs said they were \"too mean, this, that, and the other thing.\" (Cooper Depo. 83-84). Cooper testified that, in these meetings, Appellants acknowledged that they were \"aggressive,\" \"that's how they do things and other people need to get thicker skins,\" and \"In EMS. That's how we go.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84). Cooper further testified that Mansfield could get mean if she was provoked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b616} In an affidavit attached to the motion for summary judgment, Cooper averred that \"[o]n multiple occasions it was brought to [his] attention that [Appellants] had belittled, harassed, intimidated, and/or bullied co-workers.\" (Cooper Aff. \u00b6 5). At his deposition, Cooper testified that he did not prepare the affidavit, and that he did not agree with the term \"harassed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b617} At their depositions, Appellants testified that they had each been reprimanded one time by Cooper. Mansfield testified that she was called into Cooper's office on one occasion and told to \"watch what you say, don't joke around because people may not take it as a joke.\" (Mansfield Depo. 59). She testified that the reprimand was not related to any particular incident. Likewise, Gast testified that she was verbally reprimanded one time. She was called into Cooper's office because of an accusation by EMT-B Kaitlyn Copeland that Gast had threatened her on Facebook. Gast explained that she saw Copeland driving an ambulance with a flat tire and recounted the story at Gast's other job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b618} Appellants concede there was a long-standing hierarchy of personnel at EMS. At the top were the paramedics, who were the most highly-trained members of the staff. Next were the EMT-Is, or intermediate level EMTs, with the EMT-Bs at the lowest level comprising the majority of EMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b619} By tradition, the more senior EMTs helped train the new hires in the procedures and practices of EMS. New EMTs were required to demonstrate they knew where all the equipment was located, how to use it, and how to insure the equipment was ready for use. In order to confirm the newer EMTs were qualified, more senior EMTs worked individually with them on the various jobs that had to be mastered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b620} To verify proper training, new EMTs performed various tasks in the\n   presence of the more senior staff. When an EMT failed to grasp a particular responsibility, the more senior staff would retrain them. Appellants testified that retraining occasionally included kidding and comments about the new EMTs abilities. Appellants were subject to this tradition when they were first hired until they established their own proficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b621} On October 1, 2015, the day that is the subject of Schramm's incident report, Appellants were scheduled to work a shift with Johnson and Schramm. Mansfield, Johnson, and Schramm provided conflicting accounts of the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b622} Mansfield testified that, when she arrived that day, she found Schramm using a checklist to oversee each of the squads (ambulances) and their equipment. Mansfield noticed that Schramm had failed to check some of the fluid levels in a squad and offered to assist her. Mansfield asked to review Schramm's list to determine the tasks Schramm had already completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b623} Mansfield asked Schramm if she had checked the cardiac monitors contained in some of the squads. Schramm indicated that one of the batteries was low, but she did not know how to exchange the battery for a fully-charged unit. Mansfield showed Schramm where the recharger was located and how to change the battery. Mansfield then asked if Schramm knew how to set up the 12 leads on the monitor, and Schramm replied that she did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b624} By that time, Johnson and Gast had walked over to the squad and were watching the demonstration. Mansfield explained to Schramm that Johnson, who was the full-time paramedic assigned to the shift, preferred the leads to be set up so that the adhesive pads were already on the leads when they were needed. After Mansfield demonstrated the technique, Schramm folded the leads into storage and the four of them left the garage area for the lounge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b625} Throughout the rest of that day, the crew members ate their meals together, responded to calls, and folded fundraising shirts for delivery. According to the schedule, Schramm worked with Gast three additional days without issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b626} Johnson provided an undated written account of the events of October 1, 2015. According to Johnson, he noticed that Schramm had not done fluid checks on the motors. When he confronted her, Schramm told him no one had ever performed that task during her prior shifts, despite the fact that the task was on the checklists. Johnson instructed Mansfield to perform the fluid check with Schramm, which prompted Mansfield to review Schramm's prior work that day. Mansfield found a dead or low battery in a monitor, and, according to Johnson, Mansfield informed Schramm \"nicely\" of her responsibility to monitor and replace or report equipment problems to avoid responsibility for equipment failure on a call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b627} Next, Johnson asked Schramm if she had been trained to set up all of the relevant equipment. Schramm responded in the affirmative, but when Johnson asked her to set up the \"monitor to transmit 12 lead to Wheeling Hospital,\" she confessed she was unfamiliar with the process. Mansfield explained that Schramm needed to learn the preferred methods of her paramedics, for instance, that Johnson liked his leads packed in a specific way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b628} When the foursome returned to the living room, Johnson asked Schramm who had trained her, and she told him that she was trained by Paramedic Mary Greer. Greer was identified by Snyder at his deposition as EMS's Training Officer. Johnson told Schramm that she was not the first of Greer's trainees who was unaware of certain responsibilities of the job. Johnson\n   explained that Greer relegates her EMT to the role of driver, but that other paramedics expect their EMTs to \"be aggressive and jump in and do what you were trained to do.\" (Statement 3). The four employees spent the remainder of the shift folding fundraising t-shirts, going on separate calls, and eating lunch together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b629} It was not until October 9, 2015 that Schramm discussed the events of October 1st with Greer. Greer informed Cooper, and Cooper instructed Greer to tell Schramm to submit an incident report. Schramm testified that she was given the form by Cooper and completed it in his office. Schramm's incident report form, dated October 9, 2015 reads, in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   On October 1st 2015, I worked with [Jeff Johnson, Charli Gast and Mary Mansfield]. Like every other shift, I started off my day with squad checks at 7 am. Charli Gast was inside with Jeff Johnson talking. I was the only person out in the bay checking squads by myself. I was getting to the last of my squads when Mary Mansfield approached me. She took the clipboards for the squads I just previously checked. She pulled me into one of the squads and started yelling at me about a cardiac monitor battery being low. She was right, because while checking the squad, I forgot to check the monitor battery. She stated that if we were to go on a cardiac arrest and the monitor would die, it would be all my [sic] fault. Mansfield then proceeded to rip the cords out of the cardiac monitor and scold me for \"not folding them correctly.\" She continued to scold me saying that Jeff Johnson prefers his stickers on the 12 leads.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   By this time, Mansfield and I were both in the squad, and Charli Gast and Jeff Johnson were standing in the open side doors to the squad. Jeff Johnson being the full timer, stood by while Mansfield scolded me. When Mansfield finished, Jeff Johnson added, \"I've already been called into the office because of you.\" Once Mansfield was finished correcting me on how to properly set up a squad to how Johnson likes it, I went back to the squad I was removed from. Mansfield jumped inside and told me that we were going to start over to make sure I \"did it right.\" Mansfield then began to explain to me how \"aggressive\" her and Charli are. Mansfield then said, \"I will chew your ass out\" referring to me if I would mess anything up or do anything wrong. After that incident, I finished my squad checks and returned inside to the show room to avoid them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   When they came in, they asked me who I had trained with. I rambled off names such as Mary (Greer), Nick Jessee, and a few others I worked with since I first started. They all joined together and said, \"There's your problem\" and smirked. I tried to isolate myself from them because I feel [sic] threatened. I wanted to be as far away from them as possible. A call came in and Charli and I were the crew to take it. Once on scene, Charli took lead and I followed asking her if she needed anything or if there was anything I could do for her. She ordered me to get the cot, so I did. Once we got the patient loaded and dropped off, we came back to station. Like previously stated, I tried to isolate myself in the show room to avoid confrontation. Charli + Johnson then walked into the room and Charli stated, \"I talked to Johnson about the call, we both think you could use some work.\" I just nodded my head and they walked off.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   I felt threatened by all of them. I feel like they were watching my every move, so it felt as if I was walking on egg shells and trying not to mess up because I didn't want any more confrontation\n   from them. I just felt like they were talking about me behind my back. I didn't notify anyone because I was afraid of it coming back on me and if I happened to work with them again, I didn't want them cornering me for telling the entire time I felt like I had to do everything their way and by their standards or else I wasn't good enough.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b630} Riethmiller instructed Cooper to gather statements about Appellants and submit them to Snyder. Cooper informed the other employees at EMS that they could submit statements about their interactions with Appellants. Cooper forwarded the statements of Greer, Jessee, and Tolbert to Snyder who forwarded then to Riethmiller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b631} Snyder conceded that he never accessed Appellants' personnel files. In an affidavit attached to the motion for summary judgment, Snyder averred that several informal complaints of harassment, intimidation, and bullying by Appellants had been brought to his attention, most of them by other female EMTs. He further averred that he verbally reprimanded Appellants for their \"inappropriate personal conduct\" on several occasions. (Snyder Aff. \u00b6 4-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b632} Besides Schramm's statement, there was no other written account of the events of October 1, 2015 prior to Appellants' termination. Cooper did not inform Appellants that a complaint had been lodged against them or the nature of the charges. As a result they were not permitted to submit a statement in their defense. In fact, neither Appellant was made aware of Schramm's allegations until the day their employment was terminated. Riethmiller testified that he expected to hear Appellants' version of the story during their pre-disciplinary meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b633} Cooper testified that Riethmiller instructed him to meet with Johnson and Johnson's union representative. At the meeting, Johnson said \"he did not witness anything go back and forth like that. He could only state that he was there.\" (Cooper Depo. 61). Cooper communicated the foregoing information to Riethmiller. Cooper conceded that Johnson was not informed of Schramm's accusations at the meeting. According to Johnson, he was not called in to meet with Cooper until after Appellants' employment was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b634} Riethmiller believed that performance evaluations were performed in EMS, and that they were Snyder's responsibility. Riethmiller was never informed about employee performance at EMS, however, he conceded that other employees had told him that Appellants were \"outstanding\" EMTs and \"good workers.\" (Riethmiller Depo. 21-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b635} Riethmiller, Snyder, and Cooper met to discuss Schramm's allegations. Snyder could not recall any discussion from the meeting, but testified that he was not asked to give any recommendation regarding discipline. Snyder was unable to recall whether there was any discussion of Johnson's role in the events of October 1, 2015. At his deposition, Snyder stated that he thought the harassment involved \"some type of physical altercation.\" (Snyder Depo. 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b636} Riethmiller testified that Cooper and Snyder reported there was \"a situation where a new employee was [sic] claiming harassment and she was to the point she was scared to come to work.\" (Riethmiller Depo. 46). Riethmiller testified that he believed Johnson was a witness rather than an accused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b637} Riethmiller conducted a second meeting attended by Cooper, Snyder, and Schramm. Riethmiller testified that Schramm said she was grabbed by the arm and pulled into the squad. When asked to\n   describe the harassment reported by Schramm at the meeting, Riethmiller said, \"[t]he screaming and yelling about how everything was to be done.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-63). Riethmiller testified that Schramm did not mention Johnson's conduct at the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b638} Based on the information gathered at the meetings, Riethmiller concluded that Appellants had violated several provisions of the employee handbook and set forth the charges in Pre-Disciplinary Notices. He then arranged for Cooper to accompany Appellants to City Hall for a meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b639} According to Mansfield, she was the first to meet with Riethmiller. Just prior to the meeting, Mansfield received a copy of the Pre-Disciplinary Notice and was made aware of the charges leveled against her. During the meeting, Mansfield denied touching Schramm and all of the other allegations. Riethmiller terminated her employment at the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b640} After Cooper drove Mansfield back to the EMS station, she gathered her personal effects and sent a text message to Gast who was returning from a run. In the text message, Mansfield advised Gast that she had been fired and that Gast was next. According to Gast, upon her return, Cooper drove her to City Hall where she was presented with a Pre-Disciplinary Notice and then terminated by Riethmiller.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b641} Reithmiller's recollection of the events surrounding Appellants' termination was completely at odds with Appellants' testimony. Riethmiller testified that he met with Appellants at the same time. He further testified that Appellants were excused after a thirty minute meeting, and that he, Snyder, and Cooper resumed the meeting to determine the appropriate discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b642} According to Riethmiller, they agreed that \"[t]hey had a real problem down at the squad and [they] needed to nip this in the bud and handle it.\" (Riethmiller Depo. 73). He further stated, \"Due to their past write-ups - I want to use the correct word - past disciplinary action, that this needed to be dealt with quickly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 73-74). Riethmiller testified that \"Mr. Cooper had [evidence of predisciplinary action] in their file.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 74). According to his deposition testimony, Riethmiller believed that there were written reprimands in Appellants' personnel files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b643} On February 23, 2016 Appellants filed a two-count complaint in the Belmont County Court of Common Pleas alleging the termination of their employment was motivated by gender discrimination, and they were not considered for open full-time positions for the same reason. The parties exchanged paper discovery but did not conduct depositions prior to the voluntary dismissal of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b644} The matter was refiled on March 30, 2017. The parties incorporated the written discovery previously exchanged in the original action and scheduled depositions. On January 11, 2018, Appellee filed a Motion for Summary Judgment which Appellants opposed on February 12, 2018. While their motion for summary judgment was pending, Appellants voluntarily dismissed the claim based on the open full-time positions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b645} On March 22, 2018 the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of Appellee. The trial court reached the following conclusion with respect to the issues before us on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs have failed to prove that Johnson was a comparable male employee who received better treatment. Johnson was a full-time employee as a paramedic, the most highly trained of the staff, and thus two (2) levels\n   above Plaintiff's [sic] part time employee level.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Also, Plaintiffs offered no proof of prior disciplinary action against Johnson. Finally, the record is clear that Schramm's complaint of misconduct was only directed at [Appellants] as Schramm named Johnson as a possible witness rather than a perpetrator. Thus, he is neither comparable to Plaintiffs nor did he receive better treatment for comparable conduct, as there is no allegation of misconduct by Johnson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (3/22/18 J.E. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b646} Appellants advance two assignments of error, one procedural and one substantive, both relating to the trial court's determination that Johnson was not a similarly-situated employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error No 1:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   The Trial Court Erred in Finding that Plaintiffs Failed To Established [sic] A Similarly Situated Comparator as Part of Their Prima Facie Case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b647} At his deposition, Johnson testified that he had been a paramedic since 1990. At all times relevant to the complaint, he was a full-time employee licensed in Ohio and West Virginia and a union member. Appellants, on the other hand, were part-time, at-will EMT-Bs. Nonetheless, Appellants contend that the trial court erred in concluding that Johnson was not a similarly-situated individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b648} First, Appellants argue that they worked 40-plus hours per week prior to the termination of their employment, and, therefore, Johnson's full-time status did not disqualify him as a proper comparator. However, full-time status was not defined solely by hours worked at EMS. As a full-time employee, Johnson received health benefits. Further, full-time employees worked one 24-hour shift and one 16-hour shift per week. Therefore, Appellants' 40-plus hour weekly schedule did equate to full-time status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b649} Next, Appellants argue that both paramedics and EMT-Bs participated in daily chores, and, as a consequence, were treated equally. This argument belies Appellants' testimony that there was a hierarchy at EMS and paramedics were at the top. Mansfield testified that the color-coded schedule at EMS indicated the full-time employee assigned to the shift because \"that's how they ran it was who was your full-timer [sic].\" (Mansfield Depo. 9-10). The full-time employee was responsible for determining the personnel sent on a call. Therefore, paramedics had certain managerial responsibilities that were not shared by the EMTs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b650} Further, Johnson was licensed in West Virginia and Ohio. Dual licensing was coveted by EMS based upon its proximity to the state line. Although Gast testified that she was in the process of attaining a West Virginia license, she conceded that she held only an Ohio license when her employment was terminated. (Gast Depo. 7-8). Therefore, Johnson had qualifications that distinguished him from Appellants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b651} Of greatest import, Johnson was a union member. Federal courts interpreting Title VII have long held that no discriminatory intent may be inferred from a defendant's decision to treat differently union members and non-union members.

At-will employees, by contrast, may be disciplined or discharged for virtually any reason, subject to a few exceptions such as discrimination. Title VII does not take away an employer's right to interpret its rules as it chooses, and to make determinations as it sees fit under those rules. Because of this fundamental difference, employees in these two groups are never similarly situated and cannot be compared in Title VII lawsuits to show discrimination. The only employees with whom the plaintiffs could compare themselves would be others not protected by the collective bargaining agreement, but there has been no evidence of this nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   at *4, quoting\n   <em>\n    McKie v.
