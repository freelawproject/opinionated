No. CV-07-633043, Luri filed suit against Republic Services, Inc., Republic Services of Ohio Hauling, L.L.C., Republic Services of Ohio I, L.L.C., Jim Bowen, and Ron Krall (collectively \"Republic\"), alleging wrongful discharge and termination based on his refusal to comply with Republic's directive that he terminate older employees and replace them with younger candidates. The case proceeded to trial, and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Luri, awarding him $ 3,500,000 in compensatory damages and $ 43,108,599 in punitive damages. On July 8, 2008, the trial court entered judgment on the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b63} After filing a supersedeas bond that stayed execution of the judgment, Republic appealed the judgment to this court, arguing that the trial court erred in denying its motion to bifurcate Luri's punitive damages claim under R.C. 2315.21(B)(1), and in not applying the statutory cap on punitive damages. This court affirmed the trial court's denial of Republic's motion to\n   bifurcate punitive damages, but reversed the trial court's award of punitive damages and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Luri v.

The Ohio Supreme Court subsequently refused to accept jurisdiction of Luri's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b67} On May 21, 2015, the trial court vacated the July 8, 2008 judgment rendered after the first trial. Its journal entry vacating the judgment stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to the Supreme Court's rejection of plaintiff's appeal on 03/25/15, this court finds that its 10/04/13 ruling entitling [Republic] to a new trial has been affirmed and the judgment underlying defendants' supersedeas bond has thus been vacated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b68} The second trial commenced in June 2016, and Luri settled with Republic after opening statements.

Each policy had coverage limits of $ 25 million with retentions of $ 1,000,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b610} On June 22, 2009, Luri filed a supplemental complaint pursuant to R.C. 3929.06, which authorizes direct actions against the judgment debtor's insurance carrier after a final judgment has been obtained and upon the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent. Luri sought judgment against American Home, National Union, and AIG to \"pay at least the policy limits of one policy, $ 25,000,000, and possibly two,\" in partial satisfaction of the July 8, 2008 judgment, which had been obtained after the jury trial but subsequently vacated by the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b611} After briefing, the trial court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment. It ruled that a vacated judgment is a void judgment, and thus, Luri lacked a final judgment as required by R.C. 3929.06 to proceed against American Home, National Union, and AIG. It further found that the vacated judgment was \"uninsurable as a matter of law because it constitutes a 'double recovery' or windfall that would provide Luri greater coverage than Republic under the policies.\" Therefore,\n   it concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact, and National Union, American Home, and AIG were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20452\">\n    664 Fed.Appx. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.2016), Luri asserts that under the AIG policies at issue, the July 8, 2008 judgment was a final judgment because the amount owed by the insured was \"fully and finally determined by judgment against the insureds after actual trial,\" and the plain language of the policies did not require that he maintain that judgment through subsequent appellate proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b626} In\n   <em>\n    Hantz\n   </em>\n   , the insured sought coverage under a fidelity bond issued by AIG companies, including National Union, after the insured reimbursed to affected clients funds stolen by one of the insured's employees. AIG defended on timeliness grounds, asserting that the insured had not brought its lawsuit within the 24-month contractual limitations provision, which provided that the insured could not bring legal proceedings seeking the recovery of losses after the expiration of 24 months from the date of final judgment or settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b627} Hantz conceded on appeal that the Michigan lower court's order of judgment settling the clients' claim against Hantz would constitute a final judgment under Michigan law, but argued that final judgment was actually the date the Michigan appellate court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The Sixth Circuit disagreed, noting that \"Michigan courts use the term 'final judgment' to refer to the trial court's order ending litigation at that level.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20452\">\n    at 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It noted further that \"as a legal term of art, 'final judgment' virtually always designates the judgment by a court that determines all the rights and obligations of the parties in a case so that it can be appealed - not a judgment that has been resolved after appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20452\">\n    at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b628} Luri asserts that\n   <em>\n    Hantz\n   </em>\n   is \"persuasive authority\" that indicates the July 8, 2008 judgment from the trial court was indeed a final judgment obtained after trial as required by the AIG policies, regardless of subsequent events. We do not agree because\n   <em>\n    Hantz\n   </em>\n   is easily distinguishable from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b629} First,\n   <em>\n    Hantz\n   </em>\n   was decided under Michigan law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20452\">\n    664 Fed.Appx. at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, there was no question that the trial court's judgment at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hantz\n   </em>\n   was a valid final judgment; the judgment was affirmed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=664%20Fed.%20Appx.%20452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is not at all apparent that the Sixth Circuit would have considered a trial court judgment that was vacated after appeal, such as what we have here, to be a valid final judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b630} This court addressed the issue of whether a trial court's judgment that had been reversed was a final judgment for purposes of R.C. 3929.06 in\n   <em>\n    Benkoe,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 57342,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20115418\">\n    1990 WL 115418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, the appellant brought suit against her employer for an intentional tort. The jury found for the appellant, and the employer appealed. Subsequent to the judgment against the employer, the appellant brought a supplemental petition under R.C. 3929.06 to execute the judgment against the employer's insurer. After briefing, the trial court granted the insurance company's motion for summary judgment. Meanwhile, this court reversed the jury verdict that had been rendered in favor of the appellant and remanded for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b631} The appellant then appealed the grant of summary judgment to the insurance company on the R.C. 3929.06 supplemental petition. This court found that a final judgment is a precondition to a recovery against an insurance carrier under R.C. 3929.06, but that \"no such final judgment exists insofar as this court of appeals has reversed and remanded the underlying action for a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. As in\n   <em>\n    Benkoe\n   </em>\n   , Luri does not have a final judgment for R.C. 3929.06 purposes because the trial court's July 8, 2008 judgment was reversed, remanded, and ultimately vacated after appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b632} Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Luri, reasonable minds can only conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that appellees are entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting appellees' motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b633} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   MARY J.
