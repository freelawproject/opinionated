As a matter of statutory interpretation, we find the decades-old rule of sentence modification remains undisturbed: courts may modify a sentence only if the new sentence would not have violated the terms of the valid plea agreement had the new sentence been originally imposed. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment that it was not authorized to modify the sentence imposed under Defendant's fixed-term plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In March 2015, Defendant Alberto Rodriguez was charged with class A misdemeanor operating while intoxicated (\"OWI\") and class C misdemeanor operating a vehicle with an alcohol concentration equivalent of .08 or more. Due to prior OWI convictions, Rodriguez was also charged with level 6 felony OWI with a prior conviction and with being a habitual vehicular substance offender (\"HVSO\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rodriguez entered into a plea agreement on January 6, 2016. In exchange for dismissal of the class C misdemeanor charge, Rodriguez pled guilty to the class A misdemeanor OWI, level 6 felony OWI with a prior conviction, and HVSO charges. The trial court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Rodriguez according to the plea agreement's terms: thirty months in Elkhart County work release for merged level 6 felony OWI with a prior conviction and class A misdemeanor OWI charges and an additional forty-two months on work release for the HVSO charge. A hand-written notation on the plea agreement read, \"Agreed all time to Work Release no discretion to\n   <em>\n    change\n   </em>\n   .\" (Appellant's App. Vol. II at 13) (emphasis in original). This note was incorporated into the trial court's sentencing order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 12, 2017, Rodriguez petitioned to modify his sentence under Indiana Code section 35-38-1-17(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the\n   modification hearing, Rodriguez argued that recent changes to the modification statute-combined with his positive report from work release and his need to be present for his son-supported the court's ability to modify his sentence. The State opposed Rodriguez's petition, arguing that courts have no power to modify a sentence once the court has accepted a binding stipulated plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court denied Rodriguez's motion to modify his sentence. The court relied on Indiana Code section 35-38-1-17(l) (2016), which read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   A person may not waive the right to sentence modification under this section as part of a plea agreement. Any purported waiver of the right to sentence modification under this section in a plea agreement is invalid and unenforceable as against public policy.\n   <strong>\n    This subsection does not prohibit the finding of a waiver of the right to sentence modification for any other reason\n   </strong>\n   , including failure to comply with the provisions of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Emphasis altered from court's order). Applying the above emphasized language to the specific terms of Rodriguez's plea agreement, the court found that a defendant who \"enter[s] into a binding plea agreement waives the right to seek or receive a modification of [his or her] sentence.\" (Appellant's App. Vol. II at 22.) Thus, the trial court held that it had no authority to modify Rodriguez's sentence. Rodriguez appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In a split decision, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \"modification of Rodriguez's sentence is permissible under Section 35-38-1-17(l)...\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

The majority found additional support for its position in the decision of another panel of the Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Combined with subsequent amendments to the same statutory scheme in 2016 and 2018, courts and practitioners alike were thrown into uncertain territory over whether defendants who entered into a fixed-term plea agreement could now petition for sentence modification despite the terms of their agreement. Our own Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez II\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Stafford II\n   </em>\n   charted no less than four possible paths forward to interpret the same statutory provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We resolve this split in interpretations today and conclude that the legislature's amendments did not change course from the previously accepted view of sentence modification in Indiana. As demonstrated below, this conclusion flows from our Court's precedent and the canons of statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Historically, courts were bound by the terms of the plea agreement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State's primary argument in this case is that the legislature never intended to change course from the well-established policy in Indiana that trial courts have no authority to reduce or suspend a sentence in a way that would violate the terms of a valid plea agreement. Applying that rule to this case, the State argues that Rodriguez could not petition for sentence modification because his plea agreement reserved no discretion for the trial court to change his work release placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Generally speaking, \"[a] criminal defendant has no constitutional right to engage in plea bargaining.\"\n   <em>\n    Bethea v.

The State urges the opposite, believing that these provisions can be harmonized to show the General Assembly never intended to allow modification of fixed plea agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When interpreting a statute, \"our primary goal is to determine and give effect to the intent of the legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    Daniels v.

Recognizing that a valid interpretation exists so as to reconcile and harmonize both provisions in the present case, we will-and must-give effect to both provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The language of Indiana Code section 35-35-3-3(e) is straightforward: a court is bound by the terms of the plea agreement at the time it accepts the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This provision is implicitly recognized in the language of Indiana Code section 35-38-1-17(e) (2016),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which only allows a court to reduce or suspend a sentence in a way in which it was authorized\n   <strong>\n    at the time of sentencing\n   </strong>\n   . These two provisions are easily harmonized in light of our discussion in part one of this opinion. Simply stated, if the terms of the plea agreement-to which the State, defendant, and court are bound-allowed any sentencing discretion by the trial court at the time the sentence was imposed, the trial court only possesses the degree of discretion to modify a sentence that was contemplated by the terms of the original plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We do not think the waiver language of subsection (l) casts irreconcilable doubt on this interpretation. By its terms, the provision prohibits a defendant from \"waiv[ing] the right to sentence modification ... as part of a plea agreement\" and declares \"[a]ny purported waiver of the right to sentence modification ... in a plea agreement is invalid and unenforceable as against public policy.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-38-1-17\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-1-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l) (2016). This provision has been interpreted by our Court of Appeals in a way that provides an unequivocal right to sentence modification-an interpretation that brought us here today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stafford I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325366\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/190/#p193\">\n    86 N.E.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   193 ;\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12548849\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/91/1033/#p1038\">\n    91 N.E.3d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But the legislature placed important qualifiers in this same subsection that suggest any purported right to modification is potentially limited by other unenumerated factors. The subsection itself \"does not prohibit the finding of a waiver of the right to sentence modification\n   <strong>\n    for any other reason\n   </strong>\n   , including failure to comply with the provisions of this section.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-38-1-17\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 35-38-1-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l) (2016) (emphasis added). Thus, it does not appear the General Assembly intended a comprehensive prohibition on the waiver of a right to sentence modification when the waiver of that right is contemplated by the same subsection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We think a reasonable harmonization of these provisions is that the legislature sought only to ban the explicit waiver of the right to sentence modification\n   <strong>\n    within the text of the written plea agreement\n   </strong>\n   . This interpretation comes directly from the plain language of subsection (l). When referencing waiver of the right to sentence modification, the legislature used language like \"\n   <strong>\n    as part of\n   </strong>\n   a plea agreement\" and \"\n   <strong>\n    in a\n   </strong>\n   plea agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035-38-1-17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). This language plainly suggests that waiver of the right to sentence modification cannot be an explicit term of a plea agreement. A waiver of this right can be implied, however, \"for any other reason\" and as is the case here, that \"reason\" is that the trial court could not impose a different sentence that would have violated the terms of Rodriguez's binding plea agreement. In our view, this is not a \"tortured interpretation,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stafford I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12325366\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/86/190/#p193\">\n    86 N.E.3d at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but rather \"a construction which will permit both laws to stand.\"\n   <em>\n    Moryl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6975157\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/4/1133/#p1137\">\n    4 N.E.3d at 1137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This view also reinforces the well-established principle that plea agreements are contractual in nature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154874\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/816/35/#p38\">\n    816 N.E.2d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . When the trial court accepted Rodriguez's plea agreement, it-along with Rodriguez and the State-became bound by the terms of the agreement. The State agreed to drop certain charges in exchange\n   for Rodriguez's agreement to serve a fixed term on work release. We agree with the State that an interpretation allowing for modification of a valid plea agreement that allows no sentencing discretion frustrates the State's benefit of the bargain and would throw the terms of many other plea agreements into uncertainty. We do not think that the legislature intended such a change and find no such intent here today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Understanding that the legislature's amendments did not alter the settled law of\n   <em>\n    Pannarale\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, the trial court appropriately found it had no discretion to modify Rodriguez's sentence because it was bound by the terms of the valid plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Rush, C.J., and Massa, Slaughter, and Goff, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Rodriguez did, however, reserve the right to request a modification of sentence-with the State's consent-if he was incarcerated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Indiana Code section 35-38-1-17(e) (2016) reads:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    At any time after:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    (1) a convicted person begins serving the person's sentence; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    (2) the court obtains a report from the department of correction concerning the convicted person's conduct while imprisoned;\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n    the court may reduce or suspend the sentence and impose a sentence that the court was authorized to impose at the time of sentencing.
