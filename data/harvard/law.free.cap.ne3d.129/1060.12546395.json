Testa, tax commissioner, for revenue Greenscapes receives from the sale of lawn and garden products that are shipped into the state of Ohio. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Greenscapes is a Georgia corporation. It does not have any locations in Ohio\n   and does not employ any agents, representatives, or employees in Ohio. Greenscapes' primary customers are \"big-box\" retailers such as Walmart, Home Depot, and Lowe's. These retailers have distribution centers located in Ohio. When an order is placed, Greenscapes is provided with a delivery address. It prepares a bill of lading but is not responsible for shipping. The retailer arranges for a carrier to pick up the product at Greenscapes' facility. Once loaded into the carrier's truck, the product becomes the property of the retailer. After the product leaves the facility, Greenscapes cannot track the final destination of the product. In this case, we are concerned with the situsing of the total gross receipts that Greenscapes receives when it sells goods that are shipped by the retailer to Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In April 2012, an auditor for the Ohio Department of Taxation sent Greenscapes a nexus letter. The letter stated that it appeared that Greenscapes was doing business in Ohio but had not registered or filed for the CAT. It requested that Greenscapes take one of three actions: (1) register, file, and remit any taxes owed; (2) provide information if already registered and filed; or (3) explain why the company should not be required to register for the CAT. In response, Greenscapes registered for the CAT in May 2012 and filed returns for all quarters of 2011 and 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Greenscapes also received notice in 2012 that a CAT audit was to be conducted. After initially complying and sending some sales information, Greenscapes declined to further participate in the audit. It also stopped filing CAT reports and paying any taxes to Ohio. The auditor used the sales information provided to determine the total gross receipts for 2007-2012 and estimated the total gross receipts for 2005 and 2006. In February 2014, a notice of assessment was issued to Greenscapes in the amount of $ 64,064 for taxes owed for the period of 2005-2012, plus interest, penalty, and late payment penalty. The department also issued notices of assessment for each quarter of 2013 and 2014 based upon estimated tax owed due to Greenscapes' failure to file a return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Greenscapes filed petitions for reassessment for 2005-2014 and also filed a refund claim for the CAT payments that it made in 2011 and 2012. Greenscapes contended that it was not liable for the CAT because it did not own the goods shipped to Ohio, was not responsible for the goods being shipped to Ohio, and Ohio may not be the final destination for the goods as they were sent to Ohio distribution centers. The tax commissioner issued a final determination on December 29, 2015. Relying on R.C. 5751.033(E) and\n   <em>\n    Dupps Co. v. Lindley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1804413\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-2d/62/305/\">\n    62 Ohio St.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=405%20N.E.2d%20716\">\n    405 N.E.2d 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980), the tax commissioner found that when a purchaser buys tangible personal goods in Georgia and subsequently ships those goods to a retail location in Ohio, the seller's gross receipts from that sale must be sitused to Ohio. He further noted that Greenscapes failed to produce any evidence that Ohio was not the final destination for the goods. The tax commissioner affirmed the assessments and denied the refund claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Greenscapes filed a timely notice of appeal with the BTA. At the hearing before the BTA, Greenscapes presented evidence and the testimony of Donald Hayes, an executive vice president. The exhibits were examples of orders from retailers such as Lowe's, Home Depot, and Wal-Mart. They reflected that the retailers were billed at their home offices, which are located outside of Ohio, and that common carriers were hired by the retailers to pick up the goods in Georgia and deliver them to Ohio. Hayes testified that Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and Lowe's constitutes 95\n   percent of its customer sales and that Greenscapes has not successfully marketed to customers outside of these retailers. He acknowledged that Greenscapes had some online presence during the audit period but that it did not have a catalog nor did it advertise its products. Hayes admitted that Greenscapes was aware that retailers like Lowe's have a national presence and that is the reason that Greenscapes likes to work with them. He also confirmed that Greenscapes' products have been shipped to all 50 states and to Canada.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The tax commissioner presented the testimony of Janelle Rahn, who conducted the audit of Greenscapes. She stated that during the audit Greenscapes had provided a document showing sales by state from 2007 to 2012. Rahn was then contacted by an accountant for Greenscapes, who clarified that the document did not represent sales in Ohio but that it showed sales by ship to destination. Rahn explained that this distinction was immaterial because under the situsing statute the final destination controls where the goods would be sitused. Because the document reflected goods shipped to Ohio, she used that data to determine the tax owed for 2007-2012 and estimated the tax owed for 2005 and 2006. Rahn also testified that she offered to consider additional information showing that Ohio was not in fact the final destination for the goods but did not receive any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The BTA agreed with the tax commissioner that the ultimate destination of the products sold by Greenscapes after all transportation has been completed controls where the sales are sitused. It acknowledged that some of the goods that were shipped to Ohio may have ended up in retail locations outside of Ohio but also noted that Greenscapes failed to present any evidence of further transportation. The BTA found that Greenscapes knew its products would be transported to Ohio based on its customers' orders and the bills of lading it provided to the drivers responsible for transportation. The BTA recognized that Greenscapes had raised arguments under the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution but declined to make any findings as constitutional challenges are outside of its authority. The BTA found that Greenscapes failed to meet its burden on appeal and affirmed the determination of the tax commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Greenscapes appeals the decision of the BTA and assigns the following errors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [I.] THE BOARD OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT GREENSCAPES' DELIVERY OF PRODUCT IN GEORGIA TO ITS OUT OF STATE CUSTOMERS' CARRIER OR A COMMON CARRIER HIRED BY ITS CUSTOMERS, WHO THEN SHIPPED THE PRODUCT TO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS LOCATED IN OHIO, WAS ENOUGH CONTACT TO CREATE A SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS BETWEEN GREENSCAPES AND THE STATE OF OHIO SUCH THAT THE STATE OF OHIO COULD ASSESS A COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY TAX AGAINST GREENSCAPES UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [II.] THE BOARD OF TAX APPEALS ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT GREENSCAPES HAD THE MINIMUM CONNECTION TO OHIO SUCH THAT OHIO COULD TAX GREENSCAPES UNDER THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Scope of the Appeal and Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In its assignments of error, Greenscapes alleges that the application of the CAT to its sale of goods to retailers based outside of Ohio is unconstitutional and a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. In response, the tax commissioner contends that we lack jurisdiction to consider these claims because Greenscapes failed to (1) properly specify error as to the tax commissioner's final determination or the BTA decision, (2) specify the statute or statutes that are unconstitutional, and (3) preserve the substantial nexus challenge because it was not raised as part of its petition for reassessment. The tax commissioner initially notes that Greenscapes' assignments of error incorrectly state the BTA's holding. He contends that the BTA did not hold that there was a substantial nexus or minimum contact with Ohio. Instead, the BTA affirmed the final determination that the gross receipts for products delivered into Ohio were properly sitused to Ohio. Because the errors specified in the notice of appeal to the BTA and to this court do not actually address the actual holding made in the final determination or in the BTA's decision, the tax commissioner contends that we lack jurisdiction over this matter. The tax commissioner also notes that the only statute referenced in the notice of appeal is R.C. 5717.033(E). That statute is concerned with situsing but does not reference substantial nexus or minimum contact. The tax commissioner argues that Greenscapes has abandoned any claim based on the statute because it did not brief that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} R.C. 5717.02 authorizes the BTA to hear appeals from final determinations of the tax commissioner. The notice of appeal to the BTA \"shall contain a short and plain statement of the claimed errors in the determination or redetermination of the tax commissioner * * * showing that the appellant is entitled to relief and a demand for the relief to which the appellant claims to be entitled.\" R.C. 5717.02(C). In similar fashion, the notice of appeal from the BTA's decision shall set forth \"the errors therein complained of.\" R.C. 5717.04. It is well-established that a notice of appeal filed with the BTA must explicitly and precisely set forth the errors contained in the final determination of the tax commissioner and that any error not specified is not reviewable by either the BTA or an appellate court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lovell v.

If an appellant argues that a tax statute is unconstitutional on its face, the issue may be raised initially in the Supreme Court of Ohio or in the courts of\n   appeals despite not having been previously raised to the BTA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=520%20N.E.2d%20188\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at paragraph two of the syllabus.

The second clause of that sentence, however, states that direct delivery outside Ohio to firm designated by the purchaser is not delivery to the purchaser in Ohio and does not include the limitation that the delivery must be \"other than for purposes of transportation.\" Greenscapes delivers the product to an agent of the Retailers in Georgia for purposes of transportation to Ohio.

The U.S. Supreme Court has further held that a seller whose only contact with the taxing state is by common carrier lacks the required substantial nexus and cannot be taxed by the state. At most, Greenscapes only contact with the State of Ohio is through a common carrier hired and paid for by the Retailers to transport purchased tangible personal property received in Georgia to a distribution center in Ohio. Did the Commissioner err in holding that Greenscapes' delivery of product to a common carrier hired by the Retailers, who then shipped the product into Ohio, was enough contact to create a substantial nexus between Greenscapes and the State of Ohio such that the State of Ohio could assess a Commercial Activity Tax against Greenscapes under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     THIRD:\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The U.S. Supreme Court requires that there be some minimum connection between a state and the entity it seeks to tax to comport with the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

Greenscapes does not direct any effort towards residents of Ohio and its only connection to the state is its sales of product to out-of-state corporations, who then ship some of the product to distribution centers in Ohio.

Greenscapes relied, in good faith, on the text of R.C. 5751.033(E) and on Federal constitutional principles for the conclusion that it was not subject to Ohio's Commercial Activity Tax.

The CAT levies a tax on each person with taxable gross receipts for the privilege of doing business in Ohio. R.C. 5751.02(A). For purposes\n   of the CAT, \"person\" includes companies and \"any other entities.\" R.C. 5751.01(A). A person who has less than $ 150,000 of taxable gross receipts in a calendar year does not have to pay the CAT. R.C. 5751.01(E)(1). If a person's taxable gross receipts is $ 1,000,000 or less, the CAT owed is a flat $ 150. R.C. 5751.03(B)(1). After that, the amount of tax owed is determined by a formula set forth in R.C. 5751.03 and is based on the amount of taxable gross receipts. \"[G]ross receipts\" is \"the total amount realized by a person, without deduction for the cost of goods sold or other expenses incurred, that contributes to the production of gross income of the person, including the fair market value of any property and any services received, and any debt transferred or forgiven as consideration.\" R.C. 5751.01(F). One example of \"gross receipts\" is the \"[a]mounts realized from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of the taxpayer's property to or with another.\" R.C. 5751.01(F)(1)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} To fall within the purview of the CAT, the gross receipts must be taxable in Ohio. \"Taxable gross receipts\" are \"gross receipts sitused to this state under section 5751.033 of the Revised Code.\" R.C. 5751.01(G). As pertinent to Greenscapes,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [g]ross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be sitused to this state if the property is received in this state by the purchaser. In the case of delivery of tangible personal property by motor carrier or by other means of transportation, the place at which such property is ultimately received after all transportation has been completed shall be considered the place where the purchaser receives the property. For purposes of this section, the phrase \"delivery of tangible personal property by motor carrier or by other means of transportation\" includes the situation in which a purchaser accepts the property in this state and then transports the property directly or by other means to a location outside this state. Direct delivery in this state, other than for purposes of transportation, to a person or firm designated by a purchaser constitutes delivery to the purchaser in this state, and direct delivery outside this state to a person or firm designated by a purchaser does not constitute delivery to the purchaser in this state, regardless of where title passes or other conditions of sale.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   R.C. 5751.033(E).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The tax commissioner determined that Greenscapes was required to pay the CAT because it had gross receipts sitused to Ohio based on the sale of its products which were delivered to Ohio distribution centers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Substantial Nexus and the Commerce Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In its first assignment of error, Greenscapes challenges the application of the CAT to its sale of goods to retailers who ship those goods to Ohio distribution centers.

The tax commissioner issued an assessment of a franchise tax against the House of Seagram. As part of the computation of the tax owed, the tax commissioner included the sale of liquor to the state of Ohio. The House of Seagram argued that the sale of liquor originated outside of Ohio and should not be included in the business-done formula. The Supreme Court of Ohio disagreed. It concluded that pursuant to R.C. 5733.05, sales of tangible personal property, delivered by the seller to a common carrier outside Ohio and ultimately received in Ohio after all transportation has been completed, are deemed business done in Ohio and must be included in the formula for computing the franchise tax.\n   <em>\n    House of Seagram\n   </em>\n   at 101,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=271%20N.E.2d%20827\">\n    271 N.E.2d 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dial manufactured its consumer products outside of Delaware. In general, Dial's customers were larger retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, and K-Mart, and all sales were invoiced at Dial's Arizona headquarters. Dial shipped the products to its customers from facilities located outside of Delaware, and title passed to the purchasers upon delivery to a common carrier, which also occurred outside of Delaware. Dial argued that its sales were a \"wholly local\" activity that could not be taxed in Delaware. The Delaware Supreme Court disagreed. It noted that for purposes of the wholesalers' tax the determinative factor is the destination to which the seller delivers the goods to the purchase and not the location where title passed. Because the tax applied to activity that occurred within Delaware-the delivery of tangible personal property to a purchaser-the Delaware Supreme Court concluded that the wholesalers' tax did not violate the Commerce Clause. The uniform holding of courts in other states employing similar provisions to R.C. 5751.033(E) is that the destination of the goods, and not their delivery point, is dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indiana Dept. of Revenue v.

Based on the holding of\n   <em>\n    Crutchfield\n   </em>\n   , Greenscapes has a substantial nexus with Ohio. We therefore conclude that application of the CAT to Greenscapes did not violate the dormant Commerce Clause. The first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. Minimum Contact and the Due Process Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 36} In the second assignment of error, Greenscapes argues that the application of the CAT to its sales violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Although Greenscapes may market its goods to big-box retailers who may buy and distribute those goods to Ohio, Greenscapes contends that it has done nothing to purposefully direct sales to Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 37} The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that \"[no] State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" It guards against a state exceeding its jurisdiction to tax by establishing a twofold test. First, there must be a definite link or a minimum connection between the state and the person, property, or transaction that Ohio seeks to tax; second, the income attributed to the state for tax purposes must rationally relate to values connected with the taxing state.\n   <em>\n    T.
