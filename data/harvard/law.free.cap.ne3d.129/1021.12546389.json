Because the trial court did not state that it considered the contents of the presentence investigation report (\"PSI\") prior to imposing sentence, Appellant contends that his seven-year sentence is contrary to law. As there is no evidence in the record to show that the trial court did not consider the contents of the PSI prior to the imposition of sentence, the judgment entry of sentence is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b62} Review of felony sentences is governed by R.C. 2953.08(G)(2).\n   <em>\n    State v.

Pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), an \"appellate court may vacate or modify a felony sentence on appeal only if it determines by clear and convincing evidence that the record does not support the trial court's findings under relevant statutes or that the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b63} R.C. 2929.19(B)(1) reads, in pertinent part, \"[a]t the sentencing hearing, the court, before imposing sentence, shall consider * * * if one was prepared, the [PSI] made pursuant to section 2951.03 of the Revised Code or Criminal Rule 32.2 * * *.\" Although the trial court's consideration of the PSI is memorialized in the judgment entry of sentence, the trial court did not refer to its contents at the sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b64} Appellant asserts a single assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court did not comply with R.C. 2929.19(B)(1) in that it failed to state orally that it considered the presentence investigation report prior to imposing sentence making the sentence contrary to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b65} Appellant argues that R.C. 2929.19(B)(1) should be read to impose the same legal requirement as R.C. 2929.11 and 2929.12, as the General Assembly employs the obligatory term \"shall\" in all three of the statutes. R.C. 2929.11 reads, in pertinent part, \"the sentencing court shall consider the need for incapacitating the offender, deterring the offender and others from future crime, rehabilitating the offender, and making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or both.\" R.C. 2929.12, which sets forth aggravating and mitigating factors to be considered by the trial court prefaces the respective factors with the phrase \"[t]he sentencing court shall consider * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b66} In this District, a silent record raises a rebuttable presumption that the sentencing court considered the statutory factors in R.C. 2929.11 and R.C. 2929.12.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Further, defense counsel cited to the contents of the PSI directly prior to the imposition of sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Your Honor, I have had an opportunity to review the [PSI] with my client. And at the time of the change of plea, as the court is aware, there was no agreement or consensus on what we thought would be an appropriate sentence. It was my position that I would ask for a [PSI]. The reason in doing so is that I thought that it would, and I believe that it does, indicate that [Appellant], although he certainly did a fine job in this matter, has a very minimal criminal record * * *.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (8/11/17 Sent.
