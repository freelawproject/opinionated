For the following reasons, we hold that the purchaser may not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   \u00b6 2 Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \u00b6 3 The plaintiff, Sienna Court Condominium Association, is a condominium association governing the Sienna Court Condominiums, a two-building, 111-residential-unit property located in Evanston, Illinois. In 2013, plaintiff filed a verified complaint in the circuit court of Cook County on behalf of the individual unit owners in the condominium buildings. In its complaint, plaintiff alleged that Sienna Court Condominiums was a newly constructed property developed by TR Sienna Partners, LLC (TR Sienna), and that TR Sienna had marketed and sold the buildings' condominium units to individual purchasers. Plaintiff further alleged that, at the time the units were sold by TR Sienna to their purchasers, the condominium buildings contained a number of latent defects that resulted in water infiltration and other conditions that rendered both the individual units and common areas of the buildings unfit for their intended purpose of habitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b6 4 As ultimately amended, plaintiff's complaint contained 10 counts. Count I of the complaint alleged breach of an express warranty against TR Sienna. The remaining nine counts of the complaint asserted claims for breach of an implied warranty of habitability against (1) TR Sienna; (2) the general contractor; (3) the architect and engineering design firms; (4) material suppliers and (5) several subcontractors, including the defendants in this case, Don Stoltzner Mason Contractor, Inc.; BV and Associates, Inc., d/b/a Clearvisions, Inc.; Lichtenwald-Johnston Ironworks Company; and Metalmaster Roofmaster, Inc. Relevant to the issues in this case, the complaint alleged that each condominium unit and the common elements of the buildings were subject to an implied warranty of habitability extending from \"each and every subcontractor\" and that the subcontractors had therefore warranted that the buildings, or the portions constructed by them, would be suitable and fit for their intended purpose of habitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 5 Prior to the filing of plaintiff's complaint, both TR Sienna and the general contractor were declared bankrupt by order of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiff sought and was granted relief from the automatic bankruptcy stay so that it could pursue its claims against TR Sienna and\n   the general contractor to the extent of their available insurance. See 215 ILCS 5/388 (West 2010) (the bankruptcy or insolvency of an insured shall not relieve the insurer from its liabilities in case of any loss occasioned during the term of the policy). Subsequent discovery revealed that TR Sienna and the general contractor both had two separate insurance policies, each providing coverage of $1 million per occurrence with $2 million aggregate limits. Discovery further revealed that plaintiff had recovered approximately $308,000 from TR Sienna through a warranty escrow fund that TR Sienna had been required to establish under a City of Evanston ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 6 Defendants and the material suppliers filed a joint motion to dismiss counts III through VI and count IX of plaintiff's complaint (the counts that were directed against them), asserting that they were not subject to an implied warranty of habitabililty. At subsequent hearings on this motion, the parties' discussion centered largely on the appellate court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Minton v. The Richards Group of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3520699\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/116/852/\">\n    116 Ill.

In\n   <em>\n    Minton\n   </em>\n   , the appellate court held that, where the purchaser of a newly constructed home \"has no recourse to the builder-vendor and has sustained loss due to the faulty and latent defect in their new home caused by the subcontractor, the warranty of habitability applies to such subcontractor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20N.E.2d%20835\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20N.E.2d%20835\">\n    at 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Ill.%20Dec.%20582\">\n    72 Ill.Dec. 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20N.E.2d%20835\">\n    452 N.E.2d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Focusing on the word \"recourse,\" defendants argued that the plaintiff in this case had recourse from TR Sienna in the form of insurance policies and the warranty escrow fund and, therefore, under\n   <em>\n    Minton\n   </em>\n   , no implied warranty of habitability could exist. Plaintiff, in contrast, contended that the existence of potential or actual recourse from the developer-vendor was not the determinative factor in establishing an implied warranty of habitability with a subcontractor. Rather, according to plaintiff, the only relevant factor was whether the developer-vendor had been declared legally insolvent. Because that had occurred here, plaintiff maintained that an implied warranty of habitability existed with defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 7 The circuit court denied defendants' motion to dismiss. Thereafter, defendants moved for the circuit court to certify that its order denying the motion merited discretionary appeal under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 308 (eff. Feb. 26, 2010), because it involved questions of law to which there was a substantial dispute and the resolution of the questions would materially advance the litigation.

As defendants point out, underlying these certified questions is the general assumption that, at least in some instances, it is appropriate to recognize a claim for breach of an implied warranty of habitability against the subcontractors of a newly constructed home, even though the subcontractors have no contractual relationship with the homeowner. Defendants\n   challenge this assumption, arguing that, where there is no contractual privity between a subcontractor and a homeowner, there is no implied warranty of habitability. Plaintiff in its brief does not dispute that we may consider this threshold argument, and we agree. There is no point in determining whether recovery from a subcontractor depends on the availability of recourse from an insolvent developer-vendor if the implied warranty of habitability itself does not exist. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. v. SEC Donohue, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"544916\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/176/160/#p164\">\n    176 Ill. 2d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 164-66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=223%20Ill.%20Dec.%20424\">\n    223 Ill.Dec. 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=679%20N.E.2d%201197\">\n    679 N.E.2d 1197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (considering underlying premise of Rule 308 questions). Accordingly, we modify the questions certified by the circuit court to add a threshold inquiry: May the purchaser of a newly constructed home assert a claim for breach of an implied warranty of habitability against a subcontractor who took part in the construction of the home, where the subcontractor had no contractual relationship with the purchaser?

In\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   , this court held that an implied warranty of habitability protects the first purchaser of a new house against latent defects that would render the house not reasonably fit for its intended use. The court stated that it was necessary to recognize such a warranty due to the significant changes in the construction methods and marketing of new houses that had arisen in the modern era. The court explained that many \"new houses are, in a sense, now mass produced,\" that the buyer often purchases the house \"from a model home or from predrawn plans,\" and that the buyer of a newly constructed house \"has little or no opportunity to inspect\" the construction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Ill.%20Dec.%20746\">\n    27 Ill.Dec. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.E.2d%201154\">\n    389 N.E.2d 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court stated that the purchaser \"must rely upon the integrity and the skill of the builder-vendor\" and concluded that the \"vendee has a right to expect to receive that for which he has bargained and that which the builder-vendor has agreed to construct and convey to him, that is, a house that is reasonably fit for use as a residence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.E.2d%201154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For these reasons, the court determined that recognition of an implied warranty of habitability was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 15 Importantly,\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   stressed that the implied warranty of habitability is based in the contract of sale.

The warranty exists \"as an independent undertaking collateral to the covenant to convey\" that relaxes the rule of\n   <em>\n    caveat emptor\n   </em>\n   and the doctrine of merger, and it should be understood as \"an implied covenant by the builder-vendor that the house which he contracts to build and to convey to the vendee is reasonably suited for its intended use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.E.2d%201154\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 16 In addition, the\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   court recognized that, while the implied warranty of habitability is a \"creature of public policy,\" it could nevertheless be waived by the purchaser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Ill.%20Dec.%20746\">\n    27 Ill.Dec. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.E.2d%201154\">\n    389 N.E.2d 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiff maintains that we should recognize such a cause of action now. Plaintiff acknowledges the contractual origins of the implied warranty of habitability and further acknowledges that neither it nor the individual condominium owners at issue in this case had contracts with the defendant subcontractors. Nevertheless, plaintiff maintains that its cause of action should proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 18 Plaintiff analogizes to the law of personal injury and strict products liability. Plaintiff points out that product liability law has its origins in the concepts of implied warranties and contract law, and that many of the early decisions limited the right to recover for personal injuries from defective products to those who were in contractual privity with the manufacturer. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Winterbottom v. Wright\n   </em>\n   (1842) 152 Eng. Rep. 402; 10 M. &amp; W. 109.

However, an implied term in a contract is no less contractual in nature simply because\n   it is implied by the courts, and the fact that a contractual term is imposed by law does not automatically convert any cause of action for violating that term into a tort.

A person may choose not to commence an action in tort, but he cannot waive a duty imposed by the courts. This court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Petersen\n   </em>\n   that the implied warranty of habitability is a contractual term that may be waived is a conclusive indication that a cause of action for breach of the warranty must be based in contract, not tort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 24 In light of the foregoing, it is clear that to hold the implied warranty of habitability is a duty imposed in tort, as plaintiff contends, we would necessarily have to recognize a new exception to the\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   doctrine and also eliminate the option of waiver of the warranty. Not only does this implicate principles of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   , but it also raises significant practical problems, particularly for subcontractors. Subcontractors depend upon contract law and their contracts with the general contractor to protect and define their risks and economic expectations. The subcontractors' fees and costs are set in relation to their liability exposure, which is controlled in turn by their contracts. To allow what is, in effect, a tort claim to be brought directly against subcontractors by homeowners would undermine and, in some instances, render pointless these contractual obligations and restraints. Avoiding this outcome and preserving the distinction between tort and contract law is the principal point of the economic loss rule.

Upon purchase of their condominium units, the homeowners in this case possessed a potential cause of action against TR Sienna for breach of the implied warranty of habitability (assuming they had not waived the warranty).

Our appellate court, therefore, held that the implied warranty of habitability applies to a subcontractor when the purchaser has sustained loss due to a latent defect caused by the subcontractor and the purchaser cannot recover from the builder-vendor.\n    <em>\n     Minton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3520699\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-app-3d/116/852/\">\n     116 Ill.

Similar to the builder-vendor, subcontractors are in the business of construction and building homes, and they are knowledgeable about construction methods. The purchaser of a new home relies not only on the competence and integrity of the builder-vendor but also on the competence of the subcontractors. A subcontractor's work on a new home is necessarily performed for the benefit of the purchaser. As with the builder-vendor,\n    a purchaser should be able to expect the subcontractor's work to contribute to \"a house that is reasonably fit for use as a residence.\" See\n    <em>\n     Petersen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2984675\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/76/31/\">\n     76 Ill. 2d at 40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Ill.%20Dec.%20746\">\n     27 Ill.Dec. 746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.E.2d%201154\">\n     389 N.E.2d 1154\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The purchaser has a reasonable expectation that subcontractors will perform their work competently, and subcontractors should likewise expect to be held responsible for the cost to repair latent defects they have caused.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    \u00b6 44 The policy considerations that have consistently guided this court's decisions on whether to extend the implied warranty of habitability strongly favor applying the warranty to subcontractors. As we held in\n    <em>\n     Redarowicz\n    </em>\n    , \"[i]f construction of a new house is defective, its repair costs should be borne by the responsible builder-vendor who created the latent defect.\"\n    <em>\n     Redarowicz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3097419\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/92/171/\">\n     92 Ill. 2d at 183\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Ill.%20Dec.%20411\">\n     65 Ill.Dec. 411\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20N.E.2d%20324\">\n     441 N.E.2d 324\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That statement may be applied equally to a subcontractor who created the latent defect. In those circumstances, the costs of repair should be borne by the responsible subcontractor, not by the innocent purchaser. See\n    <em>\n     Redarowicz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3097419\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/92/171/\">\n     92 Ill. 2d at 183\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=65%20Ill.%20Dec.%20411\">\n     65 Ill.Dec. 411\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20N.E.2d%20324\">\n     441 N.E.2d 324\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    \u00b6 45 In sum, the policy considerations relied upon by this court in first recognizing and later extending the implied warranty of habitability apply with equal force here. A new home purchaser is necessarily dependent on those constructing the home, including both the builder-vendor and the subcontractors hired by the builder-vendor.\n    <em>\n     Petersen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2984675\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/76/31/\">\n     76 Ill. 2d at 39-41\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20Ill.%20Dec.%20746\">\n     27 Ill.Dec. 746\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=389%20N.E.2d%201154\">\n     389 N.E.2d 1154\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . This court has extended the implied warranty based on the policy considerations underlying the warranty without regard to privity of contract. Based on those policy considerations, the implied warranty of habitability should also be extended to apply directly to subcontractors. Plaintiffs should be able to pursue a claim for breach of the warranty directly against the subcontractors for their own defective work, regardless of whether the builder-vendor is insolvent or whether any other recourse is available. I would affirm the appellate court's decision answering the certified questions in the negative. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
