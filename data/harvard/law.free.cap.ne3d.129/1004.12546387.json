For the following reasons, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b62} On October 3, 2016, Frierson was indicted on three counts of rape and two counts of kidnapping. The rapes in counts one and two and the kidnapping in count three related to crimes connected against L.C. and were alleged to have occurred on or about July 12, 1997. The rape in count four and the kidnapping in count five related to crimes connected against C.C. and were alleged to have occurred on or about September 29, 2000. Each count contained a sexually violent predator specification and a notice of prior conviction. Frierson did not have any prior sexually violent offense convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b63} The trial court bifurcated the counts pertaining to L.C. and C.C. and separate jury trials were held. As a result of the trials, Frierson was found not guilty of rape in count one, guilty of rape in count two, guilty of kidnapping in count three, guilty of rape in count four and not guilty of kidnapping in count five. The sexually violent predator specifications associated with the counts for which the juries returned a guilty verdict proceeded to a bench trial, and the trial court found Frierson guilty of those specifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b64} The trial court imposed prison terms of 20 years to life for each of Frierson's convictions and ordered the three sentences to be served concurrently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sexually Violent Predator Specifications\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b65} In his first assignment of error, Frierson argues that the trial court committed plain error when it found him guilty of the sexually violent predator specifications because the application of R.C. 2971.01, as amended by the legislature in 2005, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b66} Frierson did not raise that argument before the trial court. \"Failure to raise at the trial court level the issue of the constitutionality of a statute or its application, which issue is apparent at the time of trial, constitutes waiver of such issue and * * * therefore need not be heard for the first time on appeal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Finding plain error in this instance, we elect to exercise our discretion to consider Frierson's Ex Post Facto argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b67} The crux of the present Ex Post Facto challenge is stated as follows: At the time Frierson committed his crimes, he would not have been eligible for sexually violent predator specifications under the language of R.C. 2971.01 as interpreted by the Ohio Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"430584\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/104/106/\">\n    104 Ohio St.3d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004-Ohio-6238\">\n    2004-Ohio-6238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=818%20N.E.2d%20283\">\n    818 N.E.2d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The legislature subsequently amended R.C. 2971.01 in 2005 such that Frierson would be eligible for sexually violent predator specifications and the enhanced sentencing penalties commiserate therewith. We find amended R.C. 2971.01, as applied to Frierson, to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Prior Version of R.C. 2971.01\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b68} At the time of Frierson's crimes, R.C. 2971.01(H)(1) defined a \"sexually violent predator\" as \"a person who has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to committing, on or after the effective date of this section [January 1, 1997], a sexually violent offense and is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually violent offenses.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1995 Ohio H.B. 180.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In interpreting the language of R.C. 2971.01(H)(1), the court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   These words clearly indicate that at the time of indictment, the person has already been convicted of a sexually violent offense. A grand jury cannot indict based on a conviction that has not occurred and may not ever occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [T]he General Assembly intended that a conviction of a sexually violent offense that existed prior to the current indictment must be used to support a sexually-violent-predator specification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Under the state's interpretation of R.C. 2971.01(H)(1), R.C. Chapter 2971 would impose severe penalties on persons who are first-time offenders but who are also determined to be sexually violent predators. For example, a person convicted of gross sexual imposition pursuant to R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), a third-degree felony, identified as a sexually violent offense by R.C. 2971.01(L)(1), would normally be subject to a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. R.C. 2907.05(B) and 2929.14(A)(3). However, under the state's interpretation of R.C. 2971.01(H)(1), even a first-time offender could be defined as a sexually violent predator and would be subject to a maximum sentence of life in prison under R.C. 2971.03(A)(3). R.C. Chapter 2971 is a sentence-enhancement statute, and consequently, we must construe any ambiguities against the state. R.C. 2901.04(A). We decline to interpret R.C. 2971.01(H)(1) to permit the state to subject first-time offenders of certain sexual\n   offenses to such draconian sentence enhancements without an unambiguous mandate from the General Assembly. To do so would conflict with the criminal-sentencing guidelines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Under the plain language in R.C. 2971.01(H)(1) as it existed at the time of Frierson's offenses, he was not eligible for the enhanced, indefinite sentencing under R.C. 2971.03 because he did not qualify as a sexually violent predator. As the Ohio Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , the words of R.C. 2971.01(H)(1) as it existed during the relevant periods clearly indicated that at the time of indictment, the person must have already been convicted of a sexually violent offense in order to be eligible for the specification. The legislature's subsequent amendment of the statute following\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   was not mere \"clarification\" as the state argues, but a significant and substantive change to the definition of \"sexually violent predator,\" allowing, for the first time, the underlying conduct in an indictment to satisfy the specification without a prior conviction. As applied to Frierson, this amendment greatly enhanced his potential punishment by subjecting him to the indefinite sentencing found in R.C. 2971.03 whereas he was not subject to an enhanced sentence prior to the amendment. Therefore, we find that amended R.C. 2971.01(H)(1), as applied to Frierson, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b613} Frierson's first assignment of error is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b614} Frierson's second and third assignments of error are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The record reflects that C.C., the victim of the rape charged in count four, had been deported from the United States in 2002. The state introduced deportation records pertaining to C.C. that reflected that she was prohibited from entering the United States \"[a]t any time because you have been found inadmissible or excludable under Section 212 of the Act, or deportable under Section 241 or 237 of the Act, and ordered deported or removed from the United States, and you have been convicted of a crime designated as an aggravated felony.\" An investigator with the CODIS unit of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's office testified that their office reached out to immigration officials to arrange to have C.C. return to the United States for trial but that those efforts were unsuccessful. Frierson correctly points out that the prosecutor's office could have sought a Significant Public Benefit Parole through ICE to allow C.C. leave to return to the United States for trial. However, Frierson did not raise this option during the extensive pretrial hearings conducted by the trial court concerning C.C.'s availability to testify and the appropriateness of the Skype connection for trial.

When the conduct supports more than one offense, however, a court must conduct an analysis of allied offenses of similar import to determine whether the offenses merge or whether the defendant may be convicted of separate offenses. R.C. 2941.25(B).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   A trial court and the reviewing court on appeal when considering whether there are allied offenses that merge into a single conviction under R.C. 2941.25(A) must first take into account the conduct\n   of the defendant. In other words, how were the offenses committed? If any of the following is true, the offenses cannot merge and the defendant may be convicted and sentenced for multiple offenses (1) the offenses are dissimilar in import or significance - in other words, each offense caused separate, identifiable harm; (2) the offenses were committed separately, and (3) the offenses were committed with separate animus or motivation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   At its heart, the allied offense analysis is dependent upon the facts of a case because R.C. 2941.25 focuses on the defendant's conduct. The evidence at trial or during a plea or sentencing hearing will reveal whether the offenses have similar import. When a defendant's conduct victimizes more than one person, the harm for each person is separate and distinct, and therefore, the defendant can be convicted of multiple counts. Also, a defendant's conduct that constitutes two or more offenses against a single victim can support multiple convictions if the harm that results from each offense is separate and identifiable from the harm of the other offense. We therefore hold that two or more offenses of dissimilar import exist within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25(B) when the defendant's conduct constitutes offenses involving separate victims or if the harm that results from each offense is separate and identifiable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b630} In determining if two or more offenses were committed with a separate animus this court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Echols\n   </em>\n   , victim K.C. was walking home late at night. As she passed a large tree or shrub near East 93rd Street and Woodland Avenue, \"Echols jumped out from the tree\" and came up behind her. Echols held a knife to her throat and threatened her before moving her from the sidewalk to behind the tree and then raping her. Another attack occurred approximately five years later, involving a different victim. Victim M.M. was walking home when a car pulled up and Echols told her to get into the car or he would hurt her.

In\n   <em>\n    Asadi-Ousley\n   </em>\n   , the victim was moved from the sidewalk to a nearby alleyway that was not far from where the victim had been walking. This court concluded that the restraint of the victim was not prolonged, nor the movement substantial enough to demonstrate a separate animus for the kidnapping and the subsequent rape. However, despite the limited asportation, the court in\n   <em>\n    Asadi-Ousley\n   </em>\n   found that the rape and kidnapping charges did not merge as allied offenses because the victim was knocked unconscious by a blow delivered to the back of her head during her movement into the alleyway.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 52. Therefore, the panel in\n   <em>\n    Asadi-Ousley\n   </em>\n   found that the victim had been subjected to an increased risk of harm that was separate and apart from that involved in the underlying rape such that the kidnapping offense ceased to be incidental to the rape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b638} We find the facts on this case to be controlled by\n   <em>\n    Asadi-Ousley, Echols\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Logan\n   </em>\n   .
