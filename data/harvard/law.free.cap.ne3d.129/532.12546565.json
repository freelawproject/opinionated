(\"Lorain Fulton\") appeals the trial court's denial of a writ of mandamus. Lorain Fulton's mandamus alleged that appellee city of Cleveland had, by its zoning regulations, effectuated a \"taking\" of Lorain Fulton's real estate. Lorain Fulton assigns two errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   I.

It is undisputed that the parcel is located in a Local Retail Business District. It is also undisputed that since 2003, the area has been part of a Pedestrian Retail Overlay (\"PRO\") district, the purpose of which is to \"maintain the economic viability of older neighborhood shopping districts by preserving the pedestrian-oriented character of those districts and to protect public safety[.]\" In 2013, Lorain Fulton leased the property to McDonald's Restaurants under a \"triple net lease\" that placed key obligations such as maintenance and taxes on the tenant rather than the landlord. A McDonald's Restaurant with 86-foot frontage and drive-through was planned for the parcel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b64} The record demonstrates that the proposed plan satisfied 95 out of 96 zoning conditions and did not require a variance, but the planned 86-foot frontage exceeded the 40-foot limitation of the PRO district. As such, it required conditional-use approval from the planning commission. In October 2012, Lorain Fulton submitted an application for conditional-use approval. The city required Lorain Fulton to obtain a traffic impact study. Ultimately, the study determined that the proposed development would not generate a negative traffic impact. The city's traffic engineer and an independent traffic engineer also agreed with this assessment. Nevertheless, the planning commission denied the conditional-use approval for the 86-foot frontage. The Board of Zoning Appeals (\"BZA\") affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b65} On appeal to the court of common pleas in Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV-14-822128, the court reversed. The trial court concluded that the PRO's 40-foot limitation on building frontage is \"incapable of rational application and bears no rational basis to\n   the stated purpose of the PRO,\" and was \"used as a pretext\" for denying expressly permitted uses. The city appealed the common pleas ruling to this court. In November 2016, while the appeal was pending, Lorain Fulton sold the property to MetroHealth for $ 1,175,000. This court subsequently dismissed the appeal, determining that the sale to MetroHealth had rendered the controversy moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    OC Lorain Fulton v. Bd. of Zoning Appeals\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Russell Lamb (\"Lamb\") of Lorain Fulton testified that after Cleveland appealed the reversal of the BZA decision, McDonald's terminated its lease with Lorain Fulton. Lorain Fulton later sold the property to MetroHealth for $ 1,175,000, but according to Lamb, it anticipated selling the parcel for $ 1,500,000 upon obtaining the requested conditional-use approval. Therefore, Lamb maintained that Lorain Fulton suffered a deficit of $ 325,000 due to this lowered sale price. He also asserted that Lorain Fulton incurred litigation costs of $ 636,000 from the denial of the conditional use approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b67} Robert Brown (\"Brown\"), formerly of the Cleveland planning commission, testified that the property was located in the PRO, so the proposed use required planning commission consideration of traffic and other issues. Despite the city's denial of the conditional-use approval, Brown maintained that \"every other use would still be available for the property.\" Brown admitted that restrictions in the PRO were not enforced on a similarly situated parcel owned by Hansa Haus. The city also maintained that there had been no partial regulatory taking because the ultimate sale to MetroHealth for $ 1,175,000 resulted in a 78% recovery of the anticipated $ 1,500,000 return on investment and was a considerable profit over the $ 600,000 purchase price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b68} On July 3, 2018, the trial court determined that no taking had occurred, and it declined to issue a writ of mandamus.

Additionally, the court held that the city's \"interference with [Lorain Fulton's] business contract can be viewed as draconian or even abusive[.]\" However, as explained below in the second assigned error, the court applied the\n   <em>\n    Penn Cent.\n   </em>\n   analysis to this case, as requested by the parties and as required under law.

A valid takings claim will not evaporate just because a purchaser took title after the law was enacted, but a reasonable restriction that predates a landowner's acquisition of property can be one of the objective factors that most landowners would reasonably consider in forming fair expectations about their property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605065\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1933/#p1945\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Palazzolo v.

During the pendency of the city's appeal in\n   <em>\n    Lorain Fulton I\n   </em>\n   , McDonald's terminated the lease, but Lorain Fulton\n   sold the parcel and realized a profit of almost $ 600,000 from the sale to MetroHealth. Lorain Fulton's reasonable expectations of a profit were realized despite the lower anticipated sale price, given the substantial gain in relation to the $ 600,000 purchase price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

In this action alleging a partial taking, the trial court recognized that the city treated Lorain Fulton less favorably than Hansa Haus, a similarly situated business. Additionally, the court held that the city's \"interference with [Lorain Fulton's] business contract can be viewed as draconian or even abusive[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b621} However, in applying all of the elements of the ad hoc factual inquiry set forth in\n   <em>\n    Penn Cent.\n   </em>\n   , this trial court concluded that no partial regulatory taking had occurred. Reviewing the legal conclusions de novo and the factual findings under the \"clearly erroneous\" standard, we find no reversible error. Overall, Lorain Fulton suffered only a relatively small diminution from their expected profit, and realized a significant gain, given the purchase price. The economic impact does not support a taking. Reasonable investment-based expectations were not sufficiently impacted to create a taking. We reiterate: a\n   <em>\n    Penn Cent.\n   </em>\n   taking does not arise merely because a regulatory action deprives the property owner of one proposed use, even if it is the most profitable use of the property.\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
