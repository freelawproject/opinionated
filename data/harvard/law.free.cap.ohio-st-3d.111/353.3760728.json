The new sentencing entry includes a statutorily mandated period of postrelease control that was not present in the original sentencing entry. The trial court judge did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to issue the new entry, because the defendant\u2019s original sentence had not expired, and therefore we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Robbery and Attempted Escape: 2003 Common Pleas Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 2} In February 2003, in separate indictments, relator, Brandon Cruzado, was charged with one count of robbery, a felony of the second degree, with an accompanying firearm specification, and one count of attempted escape, a felony of the third degree. On April 7, 2003, Cruzado entered guilty pleas to the robbery and attempted-escape charges. In the written pleas that Cruzado signed, he was notified about postrelease control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cIf you are sentenced to prison for a 2nd or a 3rd degree felony where the 3rd degree felony involves causing or threatening physical harm, you will have mandatory post-release control of three (3) years. If you receive prison for a non-violent 3rd, 4th, or 5th degree felony, you may be given up to three (3) years of post-release control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 4} At the plea hearing, respondent, Lorain County Common Pleas Court Judge Edward M. Zaleski, accepted Cruzado\u2019s guilty pleas after determining that the pleas were knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. At this hearing, Cruzado responded affirmatively to Judge Zaleski\u2019s asking, \u201cDo you understand that upon your release from the institution, you will have five years of post-release control with the Adult Parole Authority and the Adult Parole Authority could return you to prison for up to nine months if you violate their conditions to a maximum of 50 percent additional time?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">{\u00b6 5} On July 7, 2003, Judge Zaleski again notified Cruzado that after he finished serving his prison sentence, he would be placed on postrelease control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cNow, upon your release from the institution, you will have five years of post-release control with the Adult Parole Authority. And if you violate their terms, they may impose a nine month prison term for each violation up to a maximum of 50 percent of the stated term originally imposed. Fifty percent of three years is 1-1/2 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">{\u00b6 7} Judge Zaleski\u2019s specification of a postrelease-control period of five years at both the plea and sentencing hearings was incorrect because Cruzado\u2019s second-degree-felony conviction for robbery required a postrelease-control period of only three years. R.C. 2967.28(B)(2). There was no objection made to the erroneous statements at either hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>{\u00b6 8} On July 18, 2003, Judge Zaleski sentenced Cruzado to terms of three years for robbery and one year for attempted escape, to be served concurrently. In the sentencing entry for Cruzado\u2019s robbery conviction, the form used by Judge Zaleski included some language regarding \u201cpost conviction control,\u201d but this applied only to an unchecked section for repeat violent offenders and major drug offenders, which did not apply to Cruzado. The parties agree that the July 18, 2003 sentencing entry did not contain a written statement concerning postrelease control. The July 18, 2003 sentences were not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Resentencing: 2006 Common Pleas Court Proceeding</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 9} On May 24, 2006, before the expiration of Cruzado\u2019s three-year sentence for his robbery conviction, Judge Zaleski held a resentencing hearing at which he informed Cruzado of his mandatory three-year period of postrelease control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[U]pon your release from the institution, you will be placed on post-release control for a period of a mandatory three years. For violating post-release control conditions, the Adult Parole Authority or Parole Board may impose a more restrictive or longer controlled sanction, including a nine month prison term, for each violation up to a maximum of 50 percent of the stated term originally] imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 11} Judge Zaleski also issued a judgment entry reflecting his resentencing of Cruzado to a three-year term for his robbery conviction and a mandatory three-year period of postrelease control. Upon the expiration of his robbery sentence, Cruzado was released from prison and was placed on a three-year term of postrelease control, as ordered by Judge Zaleski\u2019s resentencing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">Prohibition Case</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">{\u00b6 12} Cruzado filed this action for a writ of prohibition two days before his resentencing to prevent Judge Zaleski from conducting the hearing. At the time, Cruzado\u2019s sentence for his attempted-escape conviction had expired, and his sentence for his robbery conviction was set to expire on June 6, 2006. On June 2, we granted an alternative writ and ordered the parties to submit evidence and briefs. The Ohio Public Defender submitted amicus curiae briefs in support of Cruzado.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">{\u00b6 13} This cause is now before us for our consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">{\u00b6 14} Because the resentencing hearing has already occurred, Cruzado now requests a writ of prohibition to vacate the resentencing and void his postrelease control. Judge Zaleski counters that this case is now moot because prohibition will not issue to review an accomplished act.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">{\u00b6 15} Judge Zaleski\u2019s contention lacks merit. A \u201cprohibition action is not necessarily rendered moot when the act sought to be prevented occurs before a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>court can rule on the prohibition claim.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 301, 2004-Ohio-2894, 809 N.E.2d 1146, \u00b6 11; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Brady v. Pianka, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 147, 2005-Ohio-4105, 832 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 8. \u201cIf a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition * * * will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction <em>and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 16} Nevertheless, if the lower court does not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to proceed, that court has general subject-matter jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction, and a party challenging that jurisdiction has an adequate remedy by appeal. <em>Dzina v. Celebrezze, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 385, 2006-Ohio-1195, 843 N.E.2d 1202, \u00b6 12. Under these circumstances, extraordinary relief in prohibition will not lie. <em>State ex rel. Downs v. Panioto, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 347, 2006-Ohio-8, 839 N.E.2d 911, \u00b6 27 (\u201cprohibition will not issue if the relator has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 17} Cruzado asserts that he is entitled to the writ because Judge Zaleski patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to modify his 2003 sentencing entry to include postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 18} It is true, as Cruzado asserts, that \u201ctrial courts lack authority to reconsider their own valid final judgments in criminal cases.\u201d <em>State ex rel. White v. Junkin </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 335, 338, 686 N.E.2d 267; <em>State ex rel. Hansen v. Reed </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 597, 599, 589 N.E.2d 1324.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 19} It is equally true, however, that this general rule is subject to two exceptions under which the trial court retains continuing jurisdiction. <em>State v. Garretson </em>(2000), 140 Ohio App.3d 554, 559, 748 N.E.2d 560. First, a trial court is authorized to correct a void sentence. Id., citing <em>State v. Beasley </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 74, 75, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774. Second, a trial court can correct clerical errors in judgments. Id., citing Crim.R. 36 (\u201cClerical mistakes in judgments, orders, or other parts of the record, and errors in the record arising from oversight or omission, may be corrected by the court at any time\u201d). \u201cThe term \u2018clerical mistake\u2019 refers to a mistake or omission, mechanical in nature and apparent on the record, which does not involve a legal decision or judgment.\u201d See, e.g., <em>State v. Brown </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 816, 819-820, 737 N.E.2d 1057. Although courts possess inherent authority to correct clerical errors in judgment entries so that the record speaks the truth, \u201cnunc pro tunc entries \u2018are limited in proper use to reflecting what the court actually decided, not what the court might or should have decided.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayer, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 164, 656 N.E.2d 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Judge Zaleski\u2019s error falls within the first exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the July 2003 sentencing entry for Cruzado\u2019s robbery conviction, Judge Zaleski did not include the three-year postrelease-control term, which R.C. 2967.28(B)(2) requires for a second-degree-felony conviction such as Cruzado\u2019s. \u201cAny attempt by a court to disregard statutory requirements when imposing a sentence renders the attempted sentence a nullity or void.\u201d <em>Beasley, </em>14 Ohio St.3d at 75, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774. \u201c[WJhere a sentence is void because it does not contain a statutorily mandated term, the proper remedy is * * * to resentence the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Jordan </em>at \u00b6 27, we held that \u201cwhen a trial court fails to notify an offender about postrelease control at the sentencing hearing but incorporates that notice into its journal entry imposing sentence, it fails to comply with the mandatory provisions of R.C. 2929.19(B)(3)(c) and (d), and, therefore, the sentence must be vacated and the matter remanded to the trial court for resentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 22} Subsequently, in <em>Hernandez v. Kelly, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-Ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, a case in which the trial court did not notify a criminal defendant at his sentencing hearing that he would be subject to mandatory postrelease control and did not incorporate postrelease control into its sentencing entry, we granted a writ of habeas corpus to compel the defendant\u2019s release from prison, where he was being held for violating his nonexistent postrelease control, and we did not permit the resentencing of Hernandez, because his only journalized sentence had expired. Id. at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 23} We reasoned that the trial court\u2019s noncompliance with the truth-in-sentencing provisions could not be cured by resentencing <em>after </em>the journalized prison term had expired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cWhen the General Assembly adopted Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2, in 1996, it created major changes in the premise of felony sentencing in Ohio. 146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7136. As part of the General Assembly\u2019s goal of achieving \u2018truth in sentencing,\u2019 the new felony-sentencing law was intended to ensure that all persons with an interest in a sentencing decision would know precisely the sentence a defendant is to receive upon conviction for committing a felony. The goal is that when the prosecutor, the defendant, and victims leave the courtroom following a sentencing hearing, they know precisely the nature and duration of the restrictions that have been imposed by the trial court on the defendant\u2019s personal liberty. Confidence in and respect for the criminal-justice system flow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>from a belief that courts and officers of the courts perform their duties pursuant to established law. <em>In this case, neither the trial judge, the prosecutor, nor the defense counsel advised the defendant at the hearing, or in a journal entry, that his liberty would continue to be restrained after he served his sentence. That omission violated not only the statute, but the spirit of the changes in criminal sentencing underlying Senate Bill 2.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe Adult Parole Authority was not authorized to put Hernandez on postrelease control and sanction him for violating the terms of that control in the absence of appropriate notification of postrelease control by the trial court and incorporation of postrelease control in its sentencing entry. <em>In that his journalized sentence has expired, Hernandez is entitled to the writ and release from prison and from further postrelease control. </em>Based on the foregoing, we grant the writ and order Hernandez\u2019s release from prison and postrelease control.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Hernandez, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-Ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, \u00b6 31-32.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 26} Cruzado\u2019s reliance on <em>Hernandez </em>to support his entitlement to extraordinary relief is misplaced. This case is distinguishable from <em>Hernandez </em>in two important respects. First, Judge Zaleski <em>did </em>advise Cruzado at both his plea hearing and his sentencing hearing that he would be subject to a mandatory period of postrelease control after he had served his three-year prison sentence. Although Judge Zaleski misstated Cruzado\u2019s postrelease-control term as five years, which is a <em>longer </em>term than the three-year period actually required by R.C. 2967.28(B)(2), Judge Zaleski did provide some notice \u2014 which Cruzado specifically acknowledged \u2014 -that Cruzado would be subject to a multiyear term of postrelease control. In <em>Hernandez, </em>the petitioner never received any such notice and never acknowledged that he would be subject to a mandatory period of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 27} Second, Cruzado\u2019s sentence had not yet expired when Judge Zaleski resentenced him. By contrast, in <em>Hernandez, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-Ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, \u00b6 28, 30, 32, we emphasized that the defendant\u2019s journalized sentence had already expired, and thus, resentencing was no longer an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 28} Because Cruzado\u2019s sentence had not yet been completed when he was resentenced, Judge Zaleski was authorized to correct the invalid sentence to include the appropriate, mandatory postrelease-control term. The Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Criminal Division, reached a similar conclusion in resentencing a criminal defendant to include the mandatory postrelease-control period that the court had failed to include in an earlier sentencing entry, when the defendant had not yet completed his original sentence. <em>State v. Ramey, </em>136 Ohio Misc.2d 24, 2006-Ohio-885, 846 N.E.2d 111, \u00b6 16 (\u201cWhether, technically speaking, this is considered a correction of a void judgment that overlooked a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>mandatory part of the sentence or merely as a correction of a clerical mistake, either type of alteration to the original judgment entry is permitted by well-established Ohio law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 29} Following our decision in <em>Hernandez, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, the General Assembly amended R.C. 2967.28 to provide that when a trial court imposes a sentence that should include a mandatory term of postrelease control after the July 11, 2006 effective date of the amendment, \u201cthe failure of a sentencing court to notify the offender * * * of this requirement or to include in the judgment of conviction entered on the journal a statement that the offender\u2019s sentence includes this requirement does not negate, limit, or otherwise affect the mandatory period of supervision that is required for the offender under this division.\u201d R.C. 2967.28(B). See Am.Sub.H.B. No. 137. For those cases in which an offender was sentenced before the July 11, 2006 amendment and was not notified of mandatory postrelease control or in which there was not a statement regarding postrelease control in the court\u2019s journal or sentence, R.C. 2929.191 authorizes the sentencing court \u2014 before the offender is released from prison- \u2014 to \u201cprepare and issue a correction to the judgment of conviction that includes in the judgment of conviction the statement that the offender will be supervised under section 2967.28 of the Revised Code after the offender leaves prison.\u201d This latter procedure is similar to the one that Judge Zaleski followed in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 30} Furthermore, Cruzado\u2019s claim that Judge Zaleski violated the law of the case by not adhering to his previous sentencing entry lacks merit. Judge Zaleski did not disregard any mandate of a superior court in a prior appeal in the same case. <em>State ex rel. Sharif v. McDonnell </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 46, 47-48, 741 N.E.2d 127. There was no previous mandate of a reviewing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 31} Finally, Cruzado\u2019s and amicus curiae\u2019s argument that prohibition is warranted based on double jeopardy is not meritorious. Double-jeopardy claims are not cognizable in prohibition. <em>State ex rel. Whiteside v. Fais </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 463, 464, 746 N.E.2d 1113, citing <em>State ex rel. White v. Junkin </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 335, 338, 686 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 32} Based on the foregoing, Judge Zaleski did not lack jurisdiction, much less <em>patently and unambiguously </em>lack jurisdiction, to correct Cruzado\u2019s sentencing entry <em>before his journalized sentence had expired. </em>Therefore, Cruzado has or had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by appealing the resentencing entry to raise his claim. Accordingly, we deny the writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AfA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>John P.
