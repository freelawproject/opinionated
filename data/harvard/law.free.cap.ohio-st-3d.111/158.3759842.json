On March 4, 1992, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice law for 18 months, with six months stayed, for violations of the following Disciplinary Rules: DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 6-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from neglecting an entrusted legal matter), 7-101(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally prejudicing or damaging a client), 9-102(A) (requiring a lawyer to maintain client funds in a separate, identifiable bank account), 9-102(B)(3) (requiring lawyers to maintain complete records and appropriate accounts), and 9-102(B)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly return funds that a client is entitled to receive). <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Downey </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 141, 586 N.E.2d 76. Respondent was reinstated to the practice of law in October 1994. <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Downey </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 1206, 642 N.E.2d 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">{\u00b6 2} In June 2004, relator, Columbus Bar Association, filed an amended complaint charging respondent with additional professional misconduct. Respondent filed an answer to the complaint, and a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held a hearing on the complaint in February 2006. The panel then prepared written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation, all of which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"AMqt\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">{\u00b6 3} In 2002, David Swoope met with respondent to discuss an employment-discrimination matter. Respondent told Swoope that she would not represent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>him, but she said that she would try, without charge, to negotiate a settlement with his former employer. Swoope did not sign a fee agreement with respondent and did not pay a retainer to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent researched Swoope\u2019s legal claims and sent a settlement demand to the attorney for Swoope\u2019s former employer. She also organized discovery-related materials for Swoope and drafted a federal complaint on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 5} Although respondent accompanied Swoope when he filed a federal civil rights suit against his former employer, she declined to place her name on the complaint, and she again told Swoope that she would not represent him. When Swoope tried to contact respondent later, she did not return his calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 6} Swoope filed a grievance against respondent with relator in January 2003. In response, respondent told relator that she did not represent Swoope, although she acknowledged that she had received and reviewed relevant documents for Swoope, had contacted witnesses, had sent a letter to opposing counsel, had spoken with Swoope on several occasions, and had agreed to \u201cassist the best way [she] could to meet the filing date\u201d for his federal complaint. For several months, respondent did not reply to relator\u2019s other inquiries concerning Swoope\u2019s grievance. She did appear for a deposition in connection with relator\u2019s investigation, but she failed to comply with relator\u2019s deadline for providing various documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent acknowledged and the board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(6) (barring lawyers from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on their fitness to practice law) and 6-101(A)(3), as well as Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring lawyers to cooperate with and assist in any disciplinary investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 8} Mollavi Sonii, a native of Liberia, paid respondent $3,000 to represent him in a deportation matter. Respondent filed an application for asylum on Sonii\u2019s behalf in August 1999 with the United States Immigration Court in Detroit, Michigan. Respondent and Sonii appeared for a hearing on the case in October 2000, but they were told that the hearing would be rescheduled for a later date. Neither of them received any notice of a new date for the hearing, and an immigration judge erroneously ordered Sonii\u2019s removal from the country in October 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">{\u00b6 9} Sonii learned about the judge\u2019s removal order in 2002, and he contacted respondent at that time to inquire about the status of his case. Respondent claimed during these disciplinary proceedings that she had never received the judge\u2019s order because it had been sent to her former office address. By the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Sonii and respondent learned about the immigration judge\u2019s October 2000 order, Sonii\u2019s 180-day window for filing an appeal had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent took no action on Sonii\u2019s behalf to challenge the judge\u2019s removal order or to remedy Sonii\u2019s failure to appeal that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 11} Sonii retained a new attorney, and that attorney filed a motion to reopen the asylum case in May 2004. An immigration judge granted that motion in August 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent acknowledged and the board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), Y \u2014 101(A)(1) (barring a lawyer from intentionally failing to seek the lawful objectives of a client), 7-101(A)(2) (prohibiting a lawyer from intentionally failing to carry out a contract of professional employment), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">{\u00b6 13} In May 2000, respondent filed a notice of appearance with the United States Board of Immigration Appeals on behalf of her client Khadija Ba. Ba, a citizen of Mauritius, was appealing the denial of her application for employment authorization and was seeking asylum in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent did not file an appellate brief on Ba\u2019s behalf. In April 2002, the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Ba\u2019s appeal, explaining in its order that no brief supporting her appeal had been filed within the time allowed for filing. Respondent did not tell Ba about the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">{\u00b6 15} Ba retained a new attorney, and that attorney filed a motion to reopen Ba\u2019s case in February 2004. The Board of Immigration Appeals denied that motion in May 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">{\u00b6 16} Respondent acknowledged and the board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(2), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-13\">\n<em>Count IV</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-14\">{\u00b6 17} Sylvester Taye, a Liberian citizen, paid respondent $700 to reopen his asylum case. Respondent filed the necessary pleadings, and a hearing was scheduled for January 15, 1997. Respondent told Taye that she would seek a continuance of the hearing, and she advised Taye that he need not appear on the scheduled date. Respondent did file a motion for a continuance, but it was late. An immigration judge went forward with the hearing as scheduled, and neither respondent nor Taye appeared. The judge ordered Taye\u2019s deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-15\">{\u00b6 18} Several years later, Taye retained a new attorney, and that attorney filed a motion to reopen Taye\u2019s case. However, the Board of Immigration Appeals denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Respondent acknowledged and the board found that respondent\u2019s actions violated DR 1-102(A)(6), 6-101(A)(3), 7-101(A)(l), 7-101(A)(2), and 7-101(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 20} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The aggravating factors cited by the board were respondent\u2019s prior disciplinary offenses and her initial lack of cooperation in the disciplinary process. (Respondent had initially failed to respond to relator\u2019s requests for information about the grievances filed by Sonii, Ba, and Taye, but she did later retain counsel and did cooperate with the investigation thereafter). BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 21} In its discussion of mitigating factors, the board noted that several witnesses \u2014 including Khadija Ba \u2014 testified at respondent\u2019s disciplinary hearing about her professionalism and her kindness. Respondent herself testified that her son began experiencing health problems in 2002 and that his illness prevented respondent from focusing on her legal practice. Respondent began to close down her practice that year, and she registered as \u201cinactive\u201d with this court in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 22} Stephanie Krznarich, a licensed independent social worker and certified chemical dependency counselor, also offered mitigating evidence on respondent\u2019s behalf at the disciplinary hearing. Krznarich testified that she had evaluated respondent in November 2004 and had concluded that respondent was suffering from a generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks, dysthmia (a low-level depression), and posttraumatic stress disorder. Krznarich also explained that respondent had signed a mental-health contract with the Ohio Lawyers Assistance Program (\u201cOLAP\u201d) in November 2004. Since then, according to Krznarich, respondent has taken her prescribed medications, has kept her medical appointments, and has progressed well.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 23} The parties jointly recommended that respondent\u2019s license to practice law be indefinitely suspended. The panel and the board issued similar recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">{\u00b6 24} We have reviewed the board\u2019s report and the record, and we find that respondent violated all of the provisions as described above. We also adopt the recommendation of the parties and the board that an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"APm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>Susan C. Walker, Bridgette Roman, and Bruce A. Campbell, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ab0\">Dianna M. Anelli, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">{\u00b6 25} We have recently imposed indefinite suspensions in similar cases. See, e.g., <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Harris, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 543, 2006-Ohio-1715, 844 N.E.2d 1202 (attorney failed to carry out contracts of employment, neglected client matters, made misrepresentations to clients, failed to return retainers, and failed to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation); <em>Northwestern Ohio Bar Assn. v. Lauber, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 143, 2006-Ohio-419, 841 N.E.2d 770 (attorney neglected several clients\u2019 cases, failed to appear for court proceedings, and failed to cooperate in the disciplinary investigation); <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Ginther, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 48, 2006-Ohio-79, 840 N.E.2d 628 (attorney neglected several clients\u2019 cases, failed to appear at scheduled court hearings, and failed to return client phone calls).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 26} Accordingly, respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. As a prerequisite to the filing of any petition for reinstatement, respondent must (1) maintain a contract with OLAP during the period of the indefinite suspension and successfully fulfill all of the contract\u2019s terms, (2) be evaluated by a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other licensed mental-health professional within 60 days prior to her petition for reinstatement and present a written report from that professional stating that (a) respondent is able to return to the competent and ethical practice of law and (b) none of respondent\u2019s mental-health conditions will impair her ability to meet the demands of legal practice, and (3) reimburse the Clients\u2019 Security Fund for any amounts paid out by the fund as a result of respondent\u2019s misconduct and enter into binding arbitration, if asked to do so by any of the clients whose grievances gave rise to the allegations described above. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
