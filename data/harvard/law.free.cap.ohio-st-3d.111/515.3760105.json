Elmore, raises 17 propositions of law. We find one proposition to be meritorious and remand the case to the trial court to resentence Elmore on the noncapital offenses for which he was convicted. We find that none of his other propositions of law has merit and affirm Elmore\u2019s convictions. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and have compared Elmore\u2019s sentence of death to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. We find that the sentence of death imposed in this case was appropriate, and we therefore affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">{\u00b62} On June 1, 2002, 47-year-old Pamela Annarino attended her son\u2019s wedding ceremony and reception. While Annarino was attending these activities, Elmore broke into her Newark home and waited for her to return. Elmore and Annarino had previously had a personal relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">{\u00b6 3} After she arrived home, Elmore murdered Annarino by strangling her and hitting her in the head with a pipe. Elmore then stole Annarino\u2019s purse and fled in her car. Subsequently, Elmore was convicted of the aggravated murder of Annarino and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\n<em>State\u2019s case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">{\u00b6 4} Around 9:30 a.m. on June 1, 2002, Annarino left her home on West Postal Avenue in Newark to attend her son\u2019s wedding. Annarino and her sister, Janna Wilfong, drove to the wedding in Wilfong\u2019s car. Around 10:00 a.m. or 11:00 a.m., Timothy Grooms, a friend of Annarino, went to her house to look after Annarino\u2019s dog while she was at the wedding. However, Grooms could not get into the house because he could not find the house key where Annarino was supposed to have left it.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 5} At 12:30 p.m., Annarino arrived home from the wedding and went into her house. Shortly thereafter, Annarino drove her Toyota Camry to the wedding reception.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 6} During the late afternoon on June 1, Annarino arrived home. Gloria Cooperider, Annarino\u2019s next-door neighbor, saw Annarino exit her car and walk toward the back door of her house. \u201cVery shortly thereafter,\u201d Cooperider saw Elmore \u201cget in [Annarino\u2019s] car, start it up and pull away.\u201d Cooperider recognized Elmore because she had met him approximately two years earlier when Elmore and Annarino were dating.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">{\u00b6 7} Around 5:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. on June 1, John Williams, who lived with Cooperider, was returning to their home on West Postal Avenue. As Williams turned onto West Postal Avenue, he saw Elmore driving Annarino\u2019s car. Williams waved at Elmore, and Elmore \u201c[k]ind of smiled\u201d and waved back, according to Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 8} On June 2 and 3, Grooms returned to Annarino\u2019s home, but he still had no key to the house, and he left after concluding that Annarino was not there. On June 4, Grooms and Clifton Rodeniser, Annarino\u2019s brother-in-law, went to Annarino\u2019s home to check on her. They found the front and back doors locked, but Grooms pried open a window, and they entered the house. After an extensive search of the home, Grooms and Rodeniser found Annarino\u2019s body in a bathtub in the second-floor bathroom. Rodeniser then notified the police by calling 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">{\u00b6 9} Around 7:15 p.m. on June 4, police arrived at Annarino\u2019s home. Annarino\u2019s body was covered in blood. A paramedic testified at Elmore\u2019s trial that Annarino \u201chad a large laceration over the right side of her skull above the eye approximately three to four inches in length with bone fragments sticking out.\u201d A pair of elastic leggings was tied around her neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">{\u00b6 10} Police investigators found blood spatters on the ceiling, the tub, and the wall area behind the tub. According to Timothy Elliget, a Newark police criminalist, \u201cblood spatter on the ceiling area above the tub * * * was consistent with castoff from a weapon.\u201d Elliget testified that blood spatters also \u201ccame out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>in a V pattern from the head and deposited on * * * the wall surrounding the back of the tub\u201d and that the spatter pattern \u201cwas consistent with * * * an object striking the victim\u2019s head in that area.\u201d Finally, the absence of blood spatters at the end of the bathtub created a \u201cvoid pattern\u201d that led Elliget to conclude that Annarino was in the bathtub when the attack occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 11} Investigators found evidence that the back door had been forced open. The inside edge of the door near the door lock had been damaged, and pry marks were visible on the door as well. The lock plate was also missing. Newark police officers found three fingerprints on the back door, and Officer Elliget testified that those prints were a match to Elmore\u2019s \u201cleft ring finger, the left middle finger and the left index finger.\u201d Police officers also found a shotgun and a shell underneath Annarino\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">{\u00b6 12} The garage behind the house was also searched by the officers, who found shoe prints on the garage floor and on a piece of paper inside the garage. A shoe print from the garage and a shoe print from the shoes that Elmore was wearing at the time of his arrest were later compared. According to Elliget, the shoe print from the garage and Elmore\u2019s shoe print \u201care of a similar pattern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">{\u00b6 13} On June 5, Dr. Charles Lee, a Deputy Coroner for Licking County, conducted the autopsy on Annarino. The victim had several lacerations on the top of her head caused by \u201cfour to five\u201d blows from a blunt instrument. Dr. Lee found that the \u201cmultiple blunt force injuries to the head\u201d were the cause of Annarino\u2019s death. He also determined that Annarino had been strangled with the leggings that were found around her neck. Strangulation could have easily rendered Annarino unconscious, and it was a contributing factor in her death, according to Dr. Lee. Finally, Dr. Lee testified that lacerations on Annarino\u2019s left forearm were defensive wounds caused by a blunt instrument before Annarino was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">{\u00b6 14} After speaking with Annarino\u2019s neighbors on the evening of June 4, the police determined that Elmore was their primary suspect, and they broadcast his name and the description of Annarino\u2019s Toyota Camry to other law-enforcement agencies. Around 4:00 a.m. on June 5, a Columbus police officer, Shea McCracken, spotted Annarino\u2019s Toyota Camry in Columbus and followed the car into a parking lot. The two occupants of the car exited the vehicle, and they were identified as Scott Darthard and Shawnta Hale.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">{\u00b6 15} Based upon information received from Darthard and Hale, Columbus police officers conducted a stakeout of Hale\u2019s home in Columbus. During the early morning hours of June 5, police officers saw Elmore leave Hale\u2019s home and walk down the street. They then arrested Elmore and transported him to the headquarters of the Columbus Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Around 7:00 a.m. on June 5, Newark Detectives Steven Vanoy and Steven Baum interviewed Elmore. After being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and waiving those rights, Elmore admitted going to Annarino\u2019s home on June 1. He also told the detectives that he and Annarino had argued that day, and he acknowledged that he had taken Annarino\u2019s car. According to Detective Vanoy, Elmore then said, \u201cI did it. I\u2019m guilty. That\u2019s it.\u201d Later that morning, Elmore was transported to the Newark Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 17} At around 10:00 a.m. on June 5, Elmore informed Detective Vanoy that he wanted to talk further. After again waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Elmore provided a detailed confession to Annarino\u2019s murder. Detectives Vanoy and Baum recorded Elmore\u2019s statement on audiotape. Elmore stated that around 6:00 a.m. on June 1, he went to Annarino\u2019s house and \u201cstayed in the garage until she left.\u201d He then broke into the house by prying open the back door with a screwdriver. Elmore went to the upstairs bedroom and found the shotgun that Annarino had kept under her bed. He then took the shotgun to the downstairs kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 18} According to Elmore, after Annarino arrived home from the wedding reception, they sat in the kitchen, talked, and argued. Elmore held the shotgun while he was talking to her. During their argument, Elmore gave Annarino the shotgun and told her \u201cif you want to kill me you can kill me.\u201d Elmore explained to the detectives that he had taken the shells out of the shotgun, but it is unclear whether Annarino knew that the gun was unloaded. Annarino then went to her upstairs bedroom to change clothes. She took the shotgun with her. Elmore followed Annarino, and they continued to argue upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 19} While they were in the upstairs bathroom, Annarino \u201cjust went off on [him],\u201d according to Elmore. He said, \u201cShe just got in my face and started * * * screaming and stuff.\u201d Elmore told Annarino, \u201cI\u2019m gonna get outta here. * * * [Y]ou go where you have to go and I\u2019m gonna leave. * * * [B]ut let me tie you up before you get a chance to call the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">{\u00b6 20} According to Elmore, they continued to argue. At some point, Elmore went downstairs, picked up a lead pipe that he had brought into the house when he broke in, and returned to the upstairs bathroom. He then \u201chit her in the arm and she fell back in the tub.\u201d Elmore explained to the detectives, \u201cIt\u2019s like I just blacked out * * * [and] I hit her again * * * three or four times\u201d on her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">{\u00b6 21} Then, according to Elmore, he went downstairs, \u201cgrabbed her purse, locked the door * * * got in the car and * * * left.\u201d He went to a friend\u2019s house, changed his pants, and drove Annarino\u2019s car to Columbus. He said that he put the pipe and Annarino\u2019s purse into a bag and threw the bag into a dumpster in Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Elmore told the detectives, \u201c[I] just wanted to scare [Annarino]. * * * I didn\u2019t want to hurt her at all.\u201d He denied tying the leggings around her neck, explaining instead that he had put them \u201caround her mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">{\u00b6 23} On June 6, Elmore was questioned again by the detectives. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights for a third time, Elmore continued to deny that he had strangled Annarino. However, Elmore recalled that he had tied her hands with a \u201cyellow floral pattern\u201d dress or shirt. He added that he had untied her hands when she complained that they were bound too tightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">{\u00b6 24} On June 14, Detective Baum interviewed Elmore again. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Elmore said that he had remembered additional details of the crime, including \u201cchoking [Annarino] before [he] hit her.\u201d He added, \u201cI didn\u2019t choke her with the stretch pants. I choked her with my hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">{\u00b6 25} The police never found the lead pipe, Annarino\u2019s stolen purse, or the yellow floral-patterned dress or shirt. They did, however, recover the bloodstained shorts that Elmore was wearing on the day of the murder. A key and a lock-plate cover were found in the shorts pocket. Investigators found that the key operated the deadbolt lock on Annarino\u2019s back door. The lock plate also fit into the door panel and was the same brand as the deadbolt lock.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">{\u00b6 26} Jennifer Duvall, a DNA analyst at the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, conducted DNA tests on the bloodstain found on Elmore\u2019s shorts. Testing revealed that DNA from the bloodstain on the shorts was consistent with Annarino\u2019s DNA. According to Duvall, the chance of finding this same DNA profile in a random member of the population \u201cwould be one in over five quadrillion in the Caucasian population, one in over six quadrillion in the African-American population, and one in more than 14 quadrillion in the Hispanic population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">{\u00b6 27} At Elmore\u2019s trial, the defense introduced a laboratory report showing that the shotgun found under the victim\u2019s bed was fully functional. The defense presented no further evidence until the penalty phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">\n<em>Case history</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">{\u00b6 28} The grand jury in Licking County indicted Elmore on one count of aggravated murder. That first count in the indictment alleged that Elmore committed the aggravated murder of Annarino while also committing kidnapping, aggravated robbery, or aggravated burglary. Appended to Count 1 were four death-penalty specifications: murder for the purpose of escaping apprehension or detection, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3); murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing kidnapping, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7); murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing aggravated robbery, R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>2929.04(A)(7); and murder while committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing after committing aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 29} Elmore was also charged with five noncapital offenses: Count 2 charged Elmore with murder, Count 3 charged kidnapping, Count 4 charged aggravated robbery, Count 5 charged aggravated burglary, and Count 6 charged grand theft for taking Annarino\u2019s Toyota Camry.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 30} Elmore pleaded not guilty to the indictment. At trial, the jury found Elmore guilty of all charges, and he was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 31} Elmore now appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">\n<em>Pretrial and guilt-phase issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">{\u00b6 32} <em>Motion to suppress. </em>In proposition of law XV, Elmore argues that he was improperly arrested without a warrant on the morning of June 5, 2002. Elmore claims that his subsequent statements to the police were the fruits of his improper arrest and should not have been introduced at trial. See <em>Brown v. Illinois </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 590, 603-605, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">{\u00b6 33} During the pretrial hearing on Elmore\u2019s motion to suppress, Detective Vanoy testified that neighbors had seen Elmore drive off in Annarino\u2019s car around the time she was thought to have been killed. During the early morning hours of June 5, 2002, the Newark police sent a broadcast to other law-enforcement agencies indicating that Elmore was wanted in connection with the homicide of Pamela Annarino. The broadcast included a description of Elmore and information about Annarino\u2019s Toyota Camry.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">{\u00b6 34} Around 4:00 a.m. on June 5, Columbus police officer Shea McCracken saw Annarino\u2019s car drive past him. He confirmed that this was Annarino\u2019s car by checking the license plate number on his on-board computer. McCracken also called a nearby patrolman, who verified that the Newark police were looking for this vehicle as part of a homicide investigation. Officer McCracken then signaled the driver of the Toyota Camry to stop, and he determined that the occupants of the car were Scott Darthard and Shawnta Hale.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-12\">{\u00b6 35} Columbus police officer Eric Everhart testified at the suppression hearing that he talked with Darthard and Hale on the morning of June 5. Officer Everhart had known Darthard for more than five years and had had frequent contact with him. Darthard had provided him with reliable information on several occasions. Darthard told Everhart that he had gotten the vehicle from a crack cocaine user and described him as an older, short, black male. Darthard was supposed to return the vehicle to that person at 7:00 a.m. at Oak and Morrison Streets in Columbus.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-13\">{\u00b6 36} Based upon Darthard\u2019s information, several police officers conducted a stakeout of Hale\u2019s home near the corner of Oak and Morrison. Around 6:00 a.m., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>a man matching Elmore\u2019s description was observed exiting Hale\u2019s home. Elmore started walking toward Everhart\u2019s location, and when Elmore saw the police, he did an about-face and started walking in the other direction. Officer Brett Bodell approached Elmore and asked, \u201cHey, bub, what\u2019s your name?\u201d After identifying himself, Elmore was placed in handcuffs and searched, but nothing was found. Elmore was then taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 37} Elmore contends that his warrantless arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. Elmore claims that once he identified himself, answered the officer\u2019s questions, and was patted down, a procedure that revealed nothing suspicious, the police were required to let him go. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">{\u00b6 38} The warrantless arrest of an individual in a public place upon probable cause does not violate the Fourth Amendment. See <em>United States v. Watson </em>(1976), 423 U.S. 411, 423-424, 96 S.Ct. 820, 46 L.Ed.2d 598; <em>United States v. Santana </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 38, 42, 96 S.Ct. 2406, 49 L.Ed.2d 300. Moreover, in Ohio, warrantless arrests are permitted by statute. R.C. 2935.04 provides: \u201cWhen a felony has been committed, or there is reasonable ground to believe that a felony has been committed, any person without a warrant may arrest another whom he has reasonable cause to believe is guilty of the offense, and detain him until a warrant can be obtained.\u201d Thus, the question becomes whether there was probable cause for making the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">{\u00b6 39} Probable cause for a warrantless arrest requires that the arresting officer, at the time of the arrest, possess sufficient information that would cause a reasonable and prudent person to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed. <em>Gerstein v. Pugh </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 103, 111-112, 95 S.Ct. 854, 43 L.Ed.2d 54; <em>Beck v. Ohio </em>(1964), 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223,13 L.Ed.2d 142. In determining whether probable cause existed, we examine the \u201ctotality\u201d of facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest. See <em>State v. Homan </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 421, 427, 732 N.E.2d 952.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 40} Before his arrest, police knew that Elmore had been identified leaving Annarino\u2019s home shortly after she was killed and that he had driven off in her car. Police later stopped Annarino\u2019s car in Columbus. The driver, who was known as a reliable informant, provided the police with a detailed description of the person who had loaned him the car. The driver also told the police where and when they could find this person. The police then went to the corner of Oak and Morrison and observed a man who matched the description walking down the street. When Officer Bodell approached him, Elmore immediately identified himself. Based upon the totality of these circumstances, we hold that the police had probable cause to arrest Elmore.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">{\u00b6 41} Thus, we hold that Elmore was properly arrested, and proposition XV is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>{\u00b6 42} <em>Sufficiency and manifest weight of the evidence. </em>In proposition of law VI, Elmore challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the kidnapping specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and the underlying kidnapping charge, R.C. 2905.01. In proposition of law II, Elmore contends that the kidnapping charge and the kidnapping specification are not supported by the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">{\u00b6 43} In reviewing a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 44} A claim that a jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence involves a separate and distinct test. \u201c \u2018The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 45} During the penalty phase, the trial court merged Specification 1 (murder to escape apprehension) and Specification 2 (kidnapping) into separate Specification 3 (aggravated robbery) and Specification 4 (aggravated burglary). The jury was therefore instructed to consider only the latter two specifications during the penalty phase of the trial. In ruling that the jury should not consider the kidnapping to be an aggravating circumstance in the penalty phase, the trial court explained (outside the presence of the jury):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c[T]he Kidnapping specification is part and parcel of the offenses of Aggravated Murder, Aggravated Robbery and Aggravated Burglary and * * * the defendant lacked a separate animus to commit the Kidnapping offense. The kidnapping did not involve a substantial transportation of the victim to a location different than that where the Aggravated Murder, Aggravated Burglary or Aggravated Robbery occurred and did not involve a substantial restraint of the victim\u2019s freedom separate and distinct from the offenses of Aggravated Murder, Aggravated Robbery and Aggravated Burglary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">{\u00b6 47} Nonetheless, the trial court sentenced Elmore to ten years on Count 3, the separate kidnapping charge. Thus, the trial court never found that its reasoning relating to the specifications affected the separate kidnapping offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Because the kidnapping specification was merged into other specifications, the underlying kidnapping charge is the basis for this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">{\u00b6 48} For a kidnapping conviction to be upheld, \u201cthere must be significant restraint or movement, not just that incident to the killing itself.\u201d <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 524, 605 N.E.2d 70. Elmore argues that there was no movement to support the kidnapping charge, because Annarino was not moved from the bathroom before she was killed. He also asserts that there was insufficient evidence of restraint and that the leggings around her neck were \u201cincidental to the act of murder [but do] not support a kidnapping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">{\u00b6 49} The record refutes Elmore\u2019s claim. During his police statement on June 6, 2002, Elmore admitted that he had tied Annarino\u2019s hands before killing her. He later untied her hands when she complained that they were bound too tightly. Thus, Elmore restrained Annarino for some period of time before murdering her. We have affirmed a kidnapping conviction in similar circumstances. See <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 280-281, 754 N.E.2d 1150 (victim restrained by being tied to her bed and gagged before she was murdered); cf. <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 93 (kidnapping charge dismissed because the murder victim was neither restrained nor moved from the room where she was killed). Therefore, we hold that there was sufficient evidence to prove kidnapping in Count 3, and we overrule proposition VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 50} As to Elmore\u2019s manifest-weight challenge, Elmore reiterates that there was no evidence of asportation or restraint to support his conviction for kidnapping. As discussed, Elmore tied Annarino\u2019s hands before killing her. Accordingly, after carefully reviewing the record and weighing the evidence, we cannot say that the jury clearly lost its way and created a manifest miscarriage of justice in convicting Elmore of the separate offense of kidnapping. Thus, we reject proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 51} <em>Allied offenses. </em>In proposition of law III, Elmore argues that aggravated murder and kidnapping are allied offenses of similar import and, therefore, he cannot be convicted of both crimes. R.C. 2941.25(A) provides: \u201cWhere the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment * * * may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\u201d This court has repeatedly held that aggravated murder and kidnapping are not allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25. See <em>State v. Coley </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 253, 265, 754 N.E.2d 1129; <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 133, 154, 689 N.E.2d 929; <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 32-33, 559 N.E.2d 464. Thus, we reject proposition III.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>{\u00b6 52} In proposition of law VIII, Elmore argues that he was improperly-convicted of and sentenced for aggravated robbery and grand theft because the two crimes constitute allied offenses of similar import. However, the defense failed to raise this issue at trial and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Comen </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 206, 211, 553 N.E.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 53} Aggravated robbery and theft may constitute allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25(A). See <em>State v. Parson </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 442, 446, 6 OBR 485, 453 N.E.2d 689; <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 420, 6 OBR 466, 453 N.E.2d 595, paragraph one of the syllabus. However, further analysis is necessary. R.C. 2941.25(B) provides, \u201cWhere the defendant\u2019s conduct * * * results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind committed separately or with a separate animus as to each, the indictment * * * may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d Thus, Elmore\u2019s conduct must be reviewed to determine whether the offenses were committed separately or with a separate animus as to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">{\u00b6 54} Elmore committed aggravated robbery as charged in Count 4 by taking Annarino\u2019s purse after he killed her. He committed grand theft as charged in Count 6 <em>after he left the house </em>and drove off in Annarino\u2019s car. Thus, Elmore\u2019s theft of Annarino\u2019s purse was committed separately from his theft of her car. See <em>State v. Houseman </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 499, 509, 591 N.E.2d 405 (aggravated robbery of car keys and an antique gun inside the house committed separately from the theft of the victim\u2019s car); <em>State v. Reyna </em>(1985), 24 Ohio App.3d 79, 82, 24 OBR 148, 493 N.E.2d 555 (aggravated robbery of money inside the house committed separately from the theft of the victim\u2019s car). Accordingly, we overrule proposition VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 55} <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In proposition of law XIII, Elmore argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 56} Elmore argues that his counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective because the lawyers conceded during closing arguments in the guilt phase of the trial that Elmore was guilty of kidnapping after those lawyers had made an earlier, unsuccessful motion for an acquittal on the kidnapping charge and specification. Elmore contends that counsel were deficient by presenting \u201cinconsistent theories on outcome determinative matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>{\u00b6 57} At the conclusion of the state\u2019s case, the defense moved for an acquittal on the kidnapping charge and the kidnapping specification. See Crim.R. 29(A). The defense, citing <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345, argued that the state did not prove that the kidnapping was committed with a separate animus from the underlying murder. The trial court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">{\u00b6 58} During final trial-phase arguments, the defense focused on convincing the jury that Elmore was guilty of murder rather than aggravated murder. Trial counsel argued: \u201cAnd we maintain that * * * you\u2019ll not find Phillip Elmore innocent, but you will find him not guilty of aggravated murder, and you should find him guilty of murder, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re asking you to do. Phillip Elmore committed a burglary, he committed a kidnapping, he committed a robbery, he committed a theft of a motor vehicle, and he committed a murder. He did not commit aggravated murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">{\u00b6 59} Trial counsel\u2019s motion for acquittal on the kidnapping charge and specification and his final argument acknowledging that a kidnapping had occurred were not inconsistent. Trial counsel\u2019s motion for acquittal was based upon a legal argument about the alleged inseparability of the animus underlying the murder and the kidnapping. In making this argument, trial counsel did not argue that the elements of kidnapping had not been proven. Moreover, counsel\u2019s legal argument was presented to the trial court, and the final argument was presented to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">{\u00b6 60} Trial counsel\u2019s tactical decision to concede Elmore\u2019s guilt on the kidnapping charge maintained defense credibility and allowed the defense to focus the jury\u2019s attention on defense counsel\u2019s argument that Elmore was guilty of murder rather than aggravated murder. Cf. <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 60-61. As his closing argument shows, trial counsel argued vigorously for the jury to find Elmore guilty only of murder and not aggravated murder. Had Elmore succeeded in obtaining an acquittal on the aggravated-murder charge, he would have been ineligible for the death penalty. Thus, we reject this ineffectiveness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">{\u00b6 61} Furthermore, given the overwhelming evidence of Elmore\u2019s guilt, even if counsel\u2019s performance had been deficient, Elmore was not prejudiced. Moreover, the kidnapping specification was merged before sentencing. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s efforts on the kidnapping issue did not affect the penalty phase. Accordingly, we reject proposition XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">{\u00b6 62} <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>In proposition of law IV, Elmore argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by referring to facts outside the record during the guilt-phase closing argument. \u201cThe test regarding prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is whether the remarks were improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">(\u00b6 63} Elmore attacks the following segment of the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument: \u201cWhat happened, we submit to you, a reasonable theory is that Pam Annarino didn\u2019t know that [the back] door had been forced open, and she goes inside. She does not sit down at the kitchen table and talk. Instead, she does what I suspect many women would do who have been dressed in relatively formal clothes since 8:00 that morning, she walks upstairs and she changes her clothes. Do any of you believe for one minute that that woman would have walked upstairs, let alone changed clothes, knowing that Phillip Elmore is in the house? Of course, not.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cAnd we submit * * * that when she was upstairs, Phillip Elmore comes upstairs and he surprises her. You want to know why that knot\u2019s in the back? Because we submit he came up behind her with those pants and put them around her neck, and that\u2019s the beginning of the kidnapping. And we submit to you that that defendant, for however long he had been in the house, was sitting there getting, as he said, mad, mad and madder. You want to know why? Because he had been rejected by Pam Annarino and his ego is more important \u2014 .\u201d Defense counsel objected at that point on the ground that the argument assumed facts not in evidence, but the objection was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 65} Elmore argues that the prosecutor made an unsupported accusation in asserting that Annarino would not have gone upstairs if she had known that he was in the house. Elmore also claims that the prosecutor improperly argued that he had sneaked up behind Annarino and choked her. According to Elmore, the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments led the jury to find that he purposely killed Annarino.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">{\u00b6 66} The defense, however, opened the door to the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument. During the defense argument, trial counsel argued that Elmore had gone to Annarino\u2019s house to talk to her but had not intended to hurt her. Trial counsel claimed that \u201c[i]f it was [Elmore\u2019s] specific intent to cause her death, why upstairs? Why not in the kitchen when she comes in the door where he has the crow bar, the pipe and the screwdriver? * * * It doesn\u2019t make sense. What makes sense is what Mr. Elmore tells us happened: An argument escalates to the point where he snaps, where he loses it, and where he does a terrible thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">{\u00b6 67} The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal then refuted these defense claims. Moreover, \u201c[p]rosecutors are entitled to latitude as to what the evidence has shown and what inferences can reasonably be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 111, 684 N.E.2d 668. The prosecutor\u2019s argument \u2014 that Elmore surprised Annarino after she went upstairs and that he strangled her from behind \u2014 represented fair comment based on reasonable inferences that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>could be drawn from the evidence. Argument that Elmore waited in the house for Annarino to arrive home and got \u201cmad and madder\u201d because she had \u201crejected\u201d him was also fair comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">{\u00b6 68} We find that the prosecutor committed no misconduct in making his rebuttal argument. Thus, proposition IV is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 69} <em>Instructions. </em>In proposition of law V, Elmore argues that the instructions improperly defined aggravated burglary as a theft offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 70} Over defense objection, the trial court provided the following instructions on the aggravated-robbery charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cFourth Count. The Defendant is charged with aggravated robbery. Before you can find the Defendant guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that on or about the 1st day of June, 2002, and in Licking County, Ohio, the Defendant, while committing or attempting to commit or fleeing immediately after committing or attempting to commit a <em>theft offense, </em>had a deadly weapon, a pipe or other blunt object, on or about his person or under his control and displayed the weapon, brandished it, indicated that he possessed it, or used the weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cUnderlying Theft Offense. Theft is defined as knowingly obtaining or exerting control over the property of another without the consent of the owner or with purpose to deprive the owner of said property. <em>You are further instructed that Aggravatefd] Burglary is defined as a theft offense under </em>Ohio law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">{\u00b6 74} First, Elmore claims that the trial court erred by instructing that aggravated burglary is a theft offense. However, this argument lacks merit. R.C. 2913.01(E)(1) defines a theft offense to include \u201c[a] violation of section * * * 2911.11 * * * of the Revised Code.\u201d That latter provision defines the crime of aggravated burglary. Moreover, the intent of the General Assembly concerning the definition of a theft offense is reflected in the Legislative Service Commission\u2019s 1973 comment on R.C. 2913.01:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c \u2018Theft offense\u2019 is broadly defined to include not only a series of specific offenses contained in the new code, but also to include any felony or misdemean- or, under state or federal law or municipal ordinance, of which robbery, <em>burglary, </em>breaking and entering, theft, conversion, embezzlement, fraud, forgery, counterfeiting, or similar act is an element * * (Emphasis added.) Thus, there was no error, because the trial court\u2019s instruction was a correct statement of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">{\u00b6 76} Second, Elmore argues that the instruction defining aggravated burglary as a theft offense relieved the state of its burden to prove that an underlying theft offense had been committed. We also reject this argument. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>court\u2019s instruction simply supplied the <em>definition </em>of a theft offense. These instructions conveyed no findings that aggravated burglary had been committed. See <em>State v. Nelson </em>(June 15, 1983), Summit App. Nos. 10973, 10975, 10993, and 10999, 1983 WL 4137, at *5 (instruction defining breaking and entering as a \u201ctheft offense\u201d was proper).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">{\u00b6 77} Finally, Elmore\u2019s reliance on <em>Sandstrom v. Montana </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed.2d 39, is misplaced. <em>Sandstrom </em>held that a jury instruction that shifts to the defendant the burden of proof on an element of the crime at issue violates due process. <em>Sandstrom </em>is not implicated here, because the trial court\u2019s definition of theft did not supply a missing element of the state\u2019s proof and did not shift any burden to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 78} Based on the foregoing, proposition V is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 79} In proposition of law XIV, Elmore argues that the trial court erred by refusing the defense request for an instruction on voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 80} R.C. 2903.03(A), which defines \u201cvoluntary manslaughter,\u201d provides: \u201cNo person, while under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage, either of which is brought on by serious provocation occasioned by the victim that is reasonably sufficient to incite the person into using deadly force, shall knowingly cause the death of another * * Voluntary manslaughter is considered an inferior-degree offense to aggravated murder. See <em>State v. Benge </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 136, 140, 661 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">{\u00b6 81} Before giving an instruction on voluntary manslaughter in a murder case, the trial court must determine \u201cwhether evidence of reasonably sufficient provocation occasioned by the victim has been presented to warrant such an instruction.\u201d <em>State v. Shane </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 630, 590 N.E.2d 272, paragraph one of the syllabus. In making that determination, trial courts must apply an objective standard: \u201cFor provocation to be reasonably sufficient, it must be sufficient to arouse the passions of an ordinary person beyond the power of his or her control.\u201d Id. at 635, 590 N.E.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">{\u00b6 82} First, Elmore asserts that he was entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter because Annarino provoked him by threatening and screaming at him. Elmore\u2019s argument relies on his version of events in his statements to the police. Elmore told the police, \u201c[Annarino] got in my face and started * * * screaming and stuff. She said, I ought * * * [to] just kill you * * * and I just told her * * * [to] leave me alone and quit going off on me.\u201d Elmore claimed that he told Annarino, \u201c[Y]ou\u2019re making me angry * * * [and] I\u2019m gonna go off on you Pam. She just kept on * * * so I went downstairs and I got the pipe. I came back up. She just started * * * arguing at me * * * [s]o * * * I hit her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>{\u00b6 83} Even if Elmore\u2019s version of events is true, Annarino\u2019s alleged comments did not provide sufficient provocation to warrant an instruction on voluntary-manslaughter. In <em>State v. Shane, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 638, 590 N.E.2d 272, we held that an admission of infidelity by the defendant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was not reasonably sufficient to provoke the defendant into using deadly force. We found that the victim had done very little to provoke that defendant and that words alone will not constitute reasonably sufficient provocation to incite the use of deadly force in most situations. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. In the case now before us, there was even less provocation because Elmore and Annarino were no longer involved in a personal relationship, and Elmore broke into her house before confronting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 84} Second, Elmore argues that he was entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter because Annarino \u201ccould have been the aggressor by physically fighting\u201d with him. But there was no evidence that Annarino was the aggressor. Rather, Elmore broke into Annarino\u2019s home, waited for her to arrive home from her son\u2019s wedding, and then attacked and killed her. Dr. Lee testified that lacerations and contusions on Annarino\u2019s forearms were defensive wounds. Moreover, Elmore\u2019s claim that the presence of black hairs in dried blood on Annarino\u2019s hand and an injury to her thumbnail provide evidence that Annarino attacked him is pure conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 85} The evidence shows that when Elmore killed Annarino, he was not under the influence of sudden passion or in a sudden fit of rage. During his argument with Annarino, Elmore went downstairs, picked up the lead pipe that he had brought into the house, went back upstairs, and hit her on the head with the pipe four to five times, killing her. From the evidence presented, the trial court could rightly find that a voluntary-manslaughter instruction was not warranted. See <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 70 (voluntary-manslaughter instruction not warranted when one victim was shot five times and the other victim was shot in the back of the head); <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 602, 734 N.E.2d 345 (voluntary-manslaughter instruction not warranted where victim was stabbed 18 times).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b6 86} Based on the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to instruct on voluntary manslaughter, and proposition XIV is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 87} <em>Juror smoke breaks during deliberations. </em>In proposition of law I, Elmore argues that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the jury\u2019s request to smoke during the guilt-phase and penalty-phase deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">{\u00b6 88} While the guilt-phase deliberations were underway, the jury sent the trial court a request to smoke. The trial court responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>{\u00b6 89} \u201cThe Court: * * * Jury has a question, can we smoke. The Court has indicated, sorry, no. Agreed to by counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cMr. Rigg: By defense, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cMr. Rossi: Yes, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 92} The jury returned its guilt-phase verdict approximately three and one-half hours after making this request. The jury deliberated slightly more than three hours before returning its sentencing verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 93} Elmore claims that the trial court erred by refusing to permit the jurors to smoke during deliberations because of the \u201cwell known features of nicotine withdrawal.\u201d Elmore argues that the juror who was not permitted to smoke \u201cmay have spent more time reviewing and concentrating on the case if [he or she] had been allowed to satisfy [his or her] nicotine addiction.\u201d Elmore suggests that the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit smoking may explain the brevity of the jury\u2019s deliberations. However, counsel consented to the trial court\u2019s ruling and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 371, 738 N.E.2d 1208; <em>State v. Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 94} The record indicates that there was only one smoker on this jury. Elmore\u2019s claim that this juror suffered from nicotine withdrawal is totally speculative. The simple request, \u201ccan we smoke?\u201d does not indicate any type of emergency. There is no support in the record for Elmore\u2019s claim that the juror who wished to smoke was under any additional stress occasioned by \u201cmentally wanting, and physically needing to smoke tobacco.\u201d Nor is there any evidence that this juror rushed the other jurors during their deliberations. There is also no protected class of jurors who have the right to smoke during a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 95} In any event, jurors could not take smoking breaks outside the jury room after submission of the case because \u201cR.C. 2945.33 and Crim.R. 24(G) clearly contemplate that jurors in capital cases generally must not be permitted to separate during their * * * deliberations.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Davis (1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 44, 48, 584 N.E.2d 1192; see, also, <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 249, 750 N.E.2d 90 (trial court under no obligation to provide jurors with smoke breaks). Based on the foregoing, we find no plain error, and proposition I is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">\n<em>Penalty-phase issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">{\u00b6 96} <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In proposition of law X, Elmore argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">{\u00b6 97} Testimony about Elmore\u2019s prison records. Elmore claims that his lawyers were ineffective when they elicited testimony about his bad behavior and inappropriate sexual conduct while in prison. Elmore claims that trial counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>questioning opened the door on cross-examination to testimony that he had masturbated \u201cat female officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 98} Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a clinical psychologist, was a defense mitigation witness. During Dr. Smalldon\u2019s testimony, trial counsel asked the following question about Elmore\u2019s prison records:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cQ: * * * What do you learn from those records that you\u2019ve collected * * * when he was incarcerated. What did you learn from those records in terms of his adjustment and in terms of his abilities while he was in prison?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cA: Well, most of these records document the years that he\u2019s spent in the Ohio prison system. They\u2019re full of bad behavior. * * * [H]e\u2019s been a difficult inmate most of the time. * * * [Tjhere are documented instances of sexually inappropriate behavior. There are instances documented in those records where he\u2019s refused orders of people in positions of authority. There are documented instances of interpersonal conflict with other * * * inmates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 101} During cross-examination, Dr. Smalldon was asked about a memorandum addressing Elmore\u2019s prison behavior that was prepared by Dr. J. Michael Harding, a clinical psychologist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cQ: We just have one more exhibit that\u2019s been marked State\u2019s Exhibit 59 for identification purposes, and I want * * * [to ask] if you can identify what that is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cA: This is a memorandum dated April 28 th, 2000. It\u2019s from Noble Correctional Institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cQ: You testified on direct exam that Mr. Elmore had been cited while he was incarcerated * * * for some sexual misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">{\u00b6 105} \u201cA: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">{\u00b6 106} \u201cQ: Does that refer to that sexual misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\">{\u00b6 107} \u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-15\">{\u00b6 108} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-16\">{\u00b6 109} \u201cQ: What type of sexual misconduct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-17\">{\u00b6 110} \u201cA: This says that he\u2019s received several tickets for masturbating at female officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-18\">{\u00b6 111} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-19\">{\u00b6 112} \u201cQ: In the letter, Dr. Harding writes with regard to this particular type of conduct, \u2018Some individuals tend to engage in such behavior because of poor impulse control or similar reasons that' stem from symptoms of mental illness. Lastly, some individuals engage in such behavior because [they] make a conscious decision to do that independent of any influence [of] mental illness or psychological distress.\u2019 Would you agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>{\u00b6 113} \u201cA: I agree that that\u2019s what he wrote, and I agree that that\u2019s true of some individuals, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cQ: And he finishes by saying, \u2018It is likely that he,\u2019 meaning Mr. Elmore, \u2018masturbates in the presence of female officers because he chooses to do so. It is suggested that this situation be viewed as a custody rather than a mental health issue[.\u2019]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 115} \u201cA: I read that record. I remember that very well. What struck me the most about it is the reason that he cited for that conclusion, which was the fact that Mr. Elmore refused to talk with him. In my opinion, that\u2019s not an adequate foundation for the clinical conclusion that he arrived at.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 116} The defense decision to call or not call a mitigation witness is a matter of trial strategy. <em>State v. Keith </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 514, 530, 684 N.E.2d 47. Likewise, the scope of questioning is generally a matter left to the discretion of defense counsel. Debatable trial tactics generally do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Singh, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 603, 2004-Ohio-3213, 813 N.E.2d 12, \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">{\u00b6 117} Eliciting testimony that Elmore\u2019s prison records are \u201cfull of bad behavior,\u201d contain \u201cdocumented instances of sexually inappropriate behavior,\u201d and include \u201cinstances * * * where he\u2019s refused orders of people in positions of authority\u201d could have been a trial tactic to support the defense theory that Elmore was impulsive, lacked control over his behavior, and made foolish choices, in an attempt to counteract the claim of aggravated murder and seek a reduction to murder, which did not carry the death penalty. While such testimony was also damaging, counsel needed some evidence to support the theory of an impulsive act. These are risks counsel must weigh, especially when confronted with such strong evidence as here. \u201c[A] court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Even if trial counsel\u2019s questioning reflected deficient performance, Elmore fails to establish prejudice under the <em>Strickland </em>test. Testimony that Elmore behaved badly in prison, disobeyed orders, and masturbated at female officers cannot be viewed as affecting his death sentence when weighed against the proven aggravating circumstances of the murder itself. Moreover, we shall disregard such testimony during our independent reassessment of the sentence, which will correct any error. See <em>State v. Twyfovd </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 340, 363, 763 N.E.2d 122; <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 322, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">{\u00b6 118} Failure to call family members as mitigation witnesses. Elmore contends that his counsel were ineffective by failing to call his brother, Demetrius Elmore, and other family members as mitigation witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>{\u00b6 119} \u201cThe decision to forgo the presentation of additional mitigating evidence does not itself constitute proof of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 536, 684 N.E.2d 47. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[attorneys need not pursue every conceivable avenue; they are entitled to be selective.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 542, 747 N.E.2d 765, quoting <em>United States v. Davenport </em>(C.A.7,1993), 986 F.2d 1047,1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 120} First, Elmore claims that his counsel should have called Demetrius as a witness to corroborate Dr. Smalldon\u2019s testimony about Elmore\u2019s dysfunctional family life. After repeated attempts to contact Demetrius, Dr. Smalldon talked with Demetrius on the day before Dr. Smalldon testified. Dr. Smalldon testified that Demetrius was living in Arizona and had \u201chad relatively little contact with [Elmore] or with other members of [the Elmore] family for years.\u201d According to Dr. Smalldon, Demetrius confirmed that their father had been an alcoholic, \u201cvery violent,\u201d and had sexually abused Elmore\u2019s two sisters. Demetrius also confirmed that, as young children, \u201cthey were frequent witnesses to their father beating their mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 121} Thus, Dr. Smalldon testified about what Demetrius had told him about Elmore\u2019s dysfunctional family life, and the jury heard that testimony. It is totally speculative whether Demetrius could have provided other favorable mitigating testimony in view of his limited contact with Elmore and other family members. We conclude that counsel\u2019s decision not to call Demetrius as a mitigation witness was a \u201ctactical choice\u201d that cannot rightly be viewed as the ineffective assistance of counsel. See <em>State v. Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 122} Second, Elmore claims that his counsel were deficient by failing to call Florence Elmore, his stepmother, and Sonya and Nicki, his two sisters, as mitigation witnesses. Elmore contends that these family members could have provided relevant and credible mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">{\u00b6 123} Dr. Smalldon interviewed Florence before he testified. According to Dr. Smalldon, Florence did not provide any reliable information about Elmore\u2019s upbringing. Florence denied any history of violence in the family. She also stated that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know a thing about [the sexual-abuse allegations] at the time.\u201d Moreover, Dr. Smalldon testified that Florence \u201cwanted nothing to do with these proceedings.\u201d Thus, it is highly questionable whether Florence\u2019s testimony would have helped the defense case, and it evidently would have contradicted Demetrius\u2019s testimony and could have damaged the defense strategy in mitigation. Under these circumstances, trial counsel made a legitimate tactical decision in not calling her as a mitigation witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">{\u00b6 124} We also reject Elmore\u2019s claim that his lawyers were ineffective by not calling Elmore\u2019s sisters, Nicki and Sonya, as witnesses. Dr. Smalldon testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>about allegations that Elmore\u2019s father sexually abused Nicki and Sonya. However, the defense could not talk to Nicki because, according to Dr. Smalldon, \u201c[s]he is currently * * * living with Florence Elmore [and] categorically refused to speak with anyone who was involved in her brother\u2019s defense.\u201d The defense could also not contact Sonya because, as Smalldon testified, she \u201chas not * * * been in any sort of regular contact with family members in at least 16 years * * * [and n]o one even knows where Sonya is at this point.\u201d Elmore has failed to proffer additional information that Sonya and Nicki would have provided as witnesses. Thus, it is highly speculative whether their testimony would have added anything to Elmore\u2019s mitigation or made any difference in the outcome of the case, even if they could have been located or compelled to testify. Moreover, trial counsel presented other evidence about the sexual-abuse allegations. Dr. Smalldon testified that Elmore discussed watching his father sexually abuse his two sisters, Demetrius verified Elmore\u2019s allegations, and Franklin County Children Services records documented that allegations of sexual abuse had been made against Elmore\u2019s father, again putting this evidence before the jury. Under these circumstances, we conclude that trial counsel\u2019s failure to call Nicki and Sonya as witnesses did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 125} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition X.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 126} <em>Merger. </em>In proposition of law XI, Elmore claims that the trial court erred by failing to merge the aggravated-burglary and aggravated-robbery aggravating circumstances. He argues that merger was required because the two aggravating circumstances arose from the same course of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 127} Elmore\u2019s failure to object to the allegedly duplicative nature of the two aggravating circumstances waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 65; <em>State v. Cook, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 528, 605 N.E.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">{\u00b6 128} In any event, the aggravated-burglary and aggravated-robbery specifications were not subject to merger, because they were committed with a separate animus. The burglary was complete as soon as Elmore broke into Annarino\u2019s home with the intent to commit murder, robbery, theft, or kidnapping. Elmore committed aggravated robbery when he stole Annarino\u2019s purse after killing her. Thus, the aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery were separate offenses and constituted separate aggravating circumstances because they arose from different acts. See <em>State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 68; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 569, 580, 660 N.E.2d 724; <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 253, 256, 12 O.O.3d 263, 389 N.E.2d 1118.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">{\u00b6 129} Accordingly, we find no plain error, and proposition XI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>{\u00b6 130} <em>Noncapital sentencing. </em>In supplemental proposition of law XVII, Elmore argues that the trial court erred by sentencing him on his noncapital offenses to maximum and consecutive sentences in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 296,124 S.Ct. 2531,159 L.Ed.2d 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 131} The trial court sentenced Elmore to ten years\u2019 confinement for kidnapping (Count 3), ten years\u2019 confinement for aggravated robbery (Count 4), ten years\u2019 confinement for aggravated burglary (Count 5), and 18 months\u2019 confinement for grand theft (Count 6). The trial court ordered in its sentencing entry that \u201cCount 3 shall run concurrently with all other counts; Counts 4, 5, and 6 shall all run consecutively to one another and consecutive to Count 1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">{\u00b6 132} The trial court made the following findings for imposing maximum and consecutive sentences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-8\">{\u00b6 133} \u201cThe Court is imposing the maximum penalty for the counts finding specifically that a shorter term would not adequately punish the defendant nor protect the public; further, that the worst form of the offense has been committed; and that the offender poses a great likelihood of committing future crimes if he were to be released.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">{\u00b6 134} \u201cThe Court is also ordering * * * consecutive sentences finding specifically * * * that it is necessary to protect the public; that it is appropriate with regard to punishing the defendant; that the sentences are not disproportionate; further, that the harm caused was so great that a single term would not adequately reflect the seriousness of the criminal conduct; and that the offender\u2019s criminal history shows that consecutive terms are needed to protect the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-10\">{\u00b6 135} \u201cThe Court would also adopt the facts and circumstances with regard to the consecutive sentences and the maximum sentences that have been presented in this case that are relevant to what it has previously indicated regarding consecutive sentences and the maximum sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">{\u00b6 136} Trial counsel objected on the record to the imposition of the maximum and consecutive sentences \u201cin light of recent Supreme Court holdings concerning the sentencing of criminal defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">{\u00b6 137} Based upon <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>(2000), 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435, and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>we recently declared parts of Ohio\u2019s felony-sentencing scheme unconstitutional. <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470. The unconstitutional provisions include R.C. 2929.14(C), which relates to the imposition of maximum sentences, and R.C. 2929.14(E)(4), which relates to the imposition of consecutive sentences. Following <em>Blakely, </em>we ruled that the sentencing criteria set forth in R.C. 2929.14(C) and 2929.14(E)(4) are unconstitutional because of the requirement for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>judicial findings of fact beyond those determined by the jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Foster </em>at \u00b6 62-67, 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">{\u00b6 138} In <em>Foster, </em>we severed the unconstitutional provisions of the sentencing code, including R.C. 2929.14(C) and 2929.14(E)(4), and remanded the cases for resentencing. We further stated that \u201ctrial courts have full discretion to impose a prison sentence within the statutory range and are no longer required to make findings or give their reasons for imposing maximum [or] consecutive * * * sentences.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 139} In the present case, we hold that the trial court\u2019s factfinding in support of maximum and consecutive sentences violated <em>Foster. </em>We reject the state\u2019s argument that Elmore\u2019s challenge to the noncapital sentences is rendered moot by Elmore\u2019s death sentence. The trial court\u2019s reliance on unconstitutional sentencing statutes when imposing maximum and consecutive sentences on the noncapital offenses violated Elmore\u2019s constitutional rights and must be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 140} We find that proposition XVII has merit. Thus, we remand Elmore\u2019s case to the trial court for a new sentencing hearing on the noncapital offenses in accordance with <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">\n<em>Cumulative errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 141} In proposition of law XVI, Elmore argues that cumulative trial errors deprived him of a fair trial and mandate a reversal of his death sentence. However, Elmore received a fair trial. Moreover, \u201cerrors cannot become prejudicial by sheer weight of numbers.\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 212, 661 N.E.2d 1068. Thus, this proposition is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">{\u00b6 142} In proposition of law IX, Elmore attacks the constitutionality of Ohio death-penalty statutes. We also reject this claim. See <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">\n<em>Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">{\u00b6 143} In proposition of law VII, Elmore claims that his death sentence is disproportionate to death sentences imposed in similar cases. We shall address this argument during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">\n<em>Sufficiency and weight of the aggravating circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">{\u00b6 144} In proposition of law XII, Elmore argues that his death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. This argument will also be addressed during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 145} <em>Aggravating circumstances. </em>The evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that Elmore was properly convicted of the murder of Pamela Annarino while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), and murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 146} As discussed earlier, the trial court merged Specifications 1 (escaping detection) and 2 (kidnapping) with Specifications 3 (aggravated robbery) and 4 (aggravated burglary) during the penalty phase. Thus, we \u2014 as did the jury \u2014 will consider only Specifications 3 and 4 in weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 147} <em>Mitigation evidence. </em>Elmore called one mitigation witness and made an unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 148} Elmore\u2019s unsworn statement. Elmore stated, \u201cFirst and foremost, I have to say to Pamela\u2019s family that I\u2019m truly sorry for what I\u2019ve done. Why it happened, I just * * * don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t know. But I feel that I deserve the worst punishment that there is. That\u2019s one thing I agree with the prosecutor. And I never knew that I could take someone\u2019s life, and each and every day I relive that, * * * and it\u2019s never going to go away. If I could bring her back, I would bring her back. I really would. I don\u2019t understand why I did it. I ask myself that every day, each and every day. The nightmares, it\u2019s just too much. If I could give my life for her right now, I would with no hesitation, none. And I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m truly sorry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 149} Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon evaluated and conducted psychological testing of Elmore, reviewed Elmore\u2019s records, and interviewed Elmore\u2019s family members. Dr. Smalldon\u2019s evaluation raised no questions about Elmore\u2019s sanity or competency-</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 150} Elmore was raised in a dysfunctional family. Elmore\u2019s father was described by Dr. Smalldon as an alcoholic who was \u201cvery violent * * * particularly when he was drinking.\u201d According to Dr. Smalldon, Elmore told him that as a child, Elmore \u201cwanted [his father] dead because [he] watched him beat [his] mother. He beat me. He beat my brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 151} Elmore and his brother, Demetrius, reported to Dr. Smalldon that their father had sexually abused their sisters, Sonya and Nicki. Elmore told Smalldon that when he was approximately six years old, he saw his father having sexual intercourse with Nicki. On another occasion, Elmore, according to Dr. Smalldon, \u201cobserved his father having sexual intercourse with Sonya.\u201d Franklin County Children Services records also document allegations that Elmore\u2019s father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>sexually abused Sonya and Nicki. According to Dr. Smalldon, Elmore \u201cexperienced intense feelings of helplessness and rage in response to the things that he observed in his home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">{\u00b6 152} Elmore was not a very motivated student and did not do well in school. He would \u201ctypically get C grades.\u201d Elmore\u2019s work history, Dr. Smalldon explained, is \u201calmost nonexistent.\u201d Elmore worked for a couple of years at a Wendy\u2019s restaurant, and this was his longest period of employment. Elmore was described in the prison records that Dr. Smalldon recounted for the jury as an \u201cexcellent worker\u201d and a \u201chard worker\u201d in his prison jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 153} Dr. Smalldon told the jury that Elmore has a \u201chistory of aggressive behavior.\u201d Records that Smalldon described at the trial indicated that Annarino had applied for a civil protection order because \u201cshe felt threatened by [Elmore] prior to this offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">(\u00b6 154} Elmore was first sent to prison when he was approximately 20 years old. Elmore\u2019s records, according to Dr. Smalldon, show that he was \u201cin and out [of prison] * * * many times\u201d until his release in 2001. Dr. Smalldon testified that Elmore \u201crepeatedly found himself * * * unable to cope out in the community and would behave * * * in a self-defeating way that would assure [that he would be] sent back into an environment that was more structured and * * * [where] he felt more comfortable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 155} Tests administered by Dr. Smalldon before the trial indicated that Elmore suffered from a \u201cclinically significant amount of depression.\u201d Personality testing indicated \u201crebellious or anti-social attitudes.\u201d According to Dr. Smalldon, Elmore has always viewed himself as an \u201coutsider, something of a rebel, someone who doesn\u2019t like rules, doesn\u2019t like people telling him what to do, and has, at times, responded badly when they\u2019ve attempted to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 156} Elmore reported to Dr. Smalldon before the trial that he had sustained a head injury when he was 17 years old. Medical records could not be found to corroborate those injuries. However, Dr. Smalldon testified that neuropsychological testing points to the existence of a \u201crelatively mild brain impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 157} Dr. Smalldon testified that Elmore knew that what he was doing was wrong when he murdered Annarino and committed the other crimes. He also testified that Elmore is not mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">{\u00b6 158} Testing showed that Elmore has a full-scale IQ in the low 70s. Dr. Smalldon believes that \u201cat his best, when he wasn\u2019t in jail,\u201d Elmore would score in the high 70s or very low 80s on an IQ test.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">{\u00b6 159} Dr. Smalldon diagnosed Elmore with dysthymia, a longstanding relatively low-grade depression. Elmore was also diagnosed with \u201ca history of polysubstance abuse, including abuse of crack cocaine.\u201d Additionally, Dr. Small-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>don diagnosed Elmore with \u201ca personality disorder not otherwise specified\u201d and \u201clow intellectual functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">{\u00b6 160} Finally, Dr. Smalldon testified that Elmore expressed remorse for what he did. Elmore told him that \u201cit would demean the victim * * * [to] go before the jury and ask for forgiveness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">\n<em>Sentence evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 161} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offense to be mitigating. On the afternoon of June 1, 2002, Elmore broke into Annarino\u2019s home. That same day, Elmore murdered Annarino by strangling her and hitting her on the head with a pipe. Afterwards, Elmore stole her purse and fled in her car. These facts establish a horrific crime without any mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 162} Elmore\u2019s character offers nothing in mitigation. However, his history and background provide some mitigating features. Elmore was raised in a dysfunctional family. His father was a violent alcoholic. As a child, Elmore watched his father beat his mother and sexually abuse his two sisters. His father also beat Elmore. Moreover, Elmore has a low IQ.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 163} The statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable, including R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation); (B)(4) (youthfulness of the offender; i.e., Elmore was 38 years old at the time of the offense); (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record); and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 164} We find that Elmore\u2019s intellectual deficiencies, longstanding depression, and mild brain impairment do not qualify as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) factor because there was no evidence that Elmore\u2019s condition caused him to lack the substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 153, 174, 652 N.E.2d 721; <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 432, 653 N.E.2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 165} Nevertheless, we give some weight to Elmore\u2019s limited intellectual abilities and other mental deficiencies under the catchall provision of R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). Testing showed that Elmore\u2019s IQ is in the low 70s. However, Elmore is not mentally retarded. Dr. Smalldon also testified that Elmore knew he was wrong when he murdered Annarino and committed his other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">{\u00b6 166} We give weight to Elmore\u2019s cooperation with the police after his arrest under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). See <em>State v. Tenace, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 255, 2006-Ohio-2417, 847 N.E.2d 386, \u00b6 104. We also give weight to Elmore\u2019s apology to the victim\u2019s family and expressions of remorse in his unsworn statement. See <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 509, 709 N.E.2d 484. We find no evidence of any other mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6c\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>Robert L.

Gilbert, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, urging affirmance for amicus curiae Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">{\u00b6 167} We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Elmore murdered Annarino during the course of an aggravated robbery and an aggravated burglary. Compared with these serious aggravating circumstances, Elmore\u2019s mitigating evidence has little significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 168} Finally, we find that the death penalty is proportionate to death sentences approved for other robbery-murder and burglary-murder cases. See <em>State v. Thomas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 124; <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 423, 739 N.E.2d 300; <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 301, 731 N.E.2d 159; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 586, 605 N.E.2d 884.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 169} We affirm Elmore\u2019s convictions and sentence of death. However, we remand this case to the trial court for resentencing on the noncapital offenses in accordance with <em>State v. Foster, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845 N.E.2d 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b630-9\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
