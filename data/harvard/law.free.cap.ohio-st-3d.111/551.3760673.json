Louise Epperson and Daniel Holdeman formed Holdeman-Eros, L.L.C., a limited liability company, by filing articles of organization with the Ohio Secretary of State on May 3, 2002. They also executed an operating agreement that set forth their respective ownership interests and management authority for the business. Pursuant to the agreement, Daniel Holdeman was a member and director and held a 51 percent interest in the company and Louise Epperson, the other member and director, held a 49 percent interest in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">{\u00b6 2} Shortly after the company was formed, Holdeman died, and his widow, Jo Ann Holdeman, was appointed executor of his estate. As the executor, pursuant to Section 12 of the operating agreement, Mrs. Holdeman became Holdeman\u2019s successor-in-interest. Under the agreement\u2019s terms, a successor-in-interest shall be admitted as a member only upon the written consent of the company. When Mrs. Holdeman asked for consent to become a member, Epperson refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">{\u00b6 3} Mrs. Holdeman then filed a declaratory-judgment action against Epperson and the company, requesting a declaration that she should be given all the rights of a member during the estate\u2019s administration. Epperson and the company counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that because Holdeman ceased to be a member of the company when he died, Mrs. Holdeman, though the assignee of his membership interest, was not a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">{\u00b6 4} The Clark County Court of Common Pleas awarded a declaratory judgment to Mrs. Holdeman, holding that she, as executor of her husband\u2019s estate and successor-in-interest, should be accorded all rights as a member of the company, including, but not limited to, the full rights of profits and distributions, full access to all business records, and full rights of operation and control of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>company \u201cwith due regard for and with the purpose of timely administering the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">{\u00b6 5} The Second District Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, stating that as R.C. 1705.21(A) conflicts with the operating agreement\u2019s provisions dealing with the death of a member, the statute takes precedence. In concluding that \u201cMrs. Holdeman is entitled to exercise all the member rights that Daniel Holdeman possessed before his death,\u201d the court of appeals stressed that Mrs. Holdeman could exercise her member rights only during the period of administration of the estate, for purposes of settling the estate. <em>Holdeman v. Epperson, </em>Clark App. No. 2004-CA-49, 2005-Ohio-3750, 2005 WL 1714210, \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">{\u00b6 6} The proposition as framed by the appellants is whether \u201c[t]he legal representative of a withdrawing member of a limited liability company has the legal rights of an assignee and not a member.\u201d Restated, the principal issue in this case is the extent to which an executor of an estate of a deceased member may exercise \u201cmember\u201d rights in a limited liability company.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 7} The appellants, Epperson and the company, argue that Mrs. Holdeman, as a successor-in-interest and executor, has only the legal rights as an assignee of the economic interest of the member in the company, rather than the full rights of a member. They contend that the operating agreement does not conflict with the statute and thus the operating agreement controls the outcome. Appellee, Mrs. Holdeman, asserts that R.C. 1705.21(A) conflicts with and therefore overrides the provisions of the operating agreement. Both the statute and operating agreement must be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The Operating Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 8} The operating agreement of the company states that the company is a \u201cmember-managed limited liability company. All of the authority of the Company shall be exercised by or under the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, which shall consist of all of the Members of the Company.\u201d The board of directors consisted of Epperson and Daniel Holdeman. Because Daniel Holdeman owned the larger percentage interest in the company, he was the managing member of the company and presided over the meetings of the board of directors. The term \u201cmember\u201d is not specifically defined in the operating agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">{\u00b6 9} Section 10 deals with restrictions on transfer of a member\u2019s interest. Section 10.1 states, \u201cExcept as specifically provided otherwise in this Operating Agreement, no Member shall assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of any interest in the Company, or withdraw from the Company, without the consent of a Majority-in-Interest (other than the Member attempting to transfer the interest).\u201d If a member seeks to assign his or her interest, the assignee may be admitted as a member only after complying with certain requirements, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>that \u201c[t]he Company shall consent in writing to the admission of the assignee as a Member, which consent may be withheld for any reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">{\u00b6 10} The provision of specific interest in resolving the issue before us is Section 11, entitled \u201cDeath of a Member.\u201d This section states that when a member dies, the successor-in-interest of the deceased member \u201cshall immediately succeed to the interest of such member in the Company. Such Successor-in-Interest shall not become a Member of the Company unless admitted as a Member in accordance with Section 10 of this Agreement.\u201d A successor-in-interest is defined in Section 12 as \u201csuch person as the Member shall, from time to time, have designated in a notice to the Company * * *. In the event that a Member has failed to designate a Successor in Interest, or if the person designated is not then living or for any reason renounces, disclaims or is unable to succeed to such interest, the Successor in Interest shall be the executor or administrator of the deceased Member\u2019s estate, who shall hold or distribute such interest in accordance with applicable fiduciary law.\u201d The section also directs that a successor-in-interest shall not become a full member unless the company consents.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 11} Since Daniel Holdeman never executed a notice to the company designating a successor-in-interest, his widow, as executor of his estate, automatically became the successor-in-interest pursuant to Section 12. Mrs. Holdeman could not become a full member of the company without consent from the company, which the company declined to give. Thus, the language of the operating agreement implicitly restricted Mrs. Holdeman to a membership interest rather than the status of a member of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 12} Typically, once an operating agreement is reviewed and it appears that the terms of the contract dictate the status of the parties, the inquiry 'ends because \u201ccourts presume that the intent of the parties to a contract resides in language they chose to employ in the agreement.\u201d <em>Shifrin v. Forest City Ents., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 635, 638, 597 N.E.2d 499. Furthermore, when \u201cthe terms in a contract are unambiguous, courts will not in effect create a new contract by finding an intent not expressed in the clear language employed by the parties.\u201d Id. Nevertheless, in this case, both the trial court and the court of appeals examined R.C. Chapter 1705 and found that the General Assembly has preempted this area by enacting R.C. 1705.21(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Statutory Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 1705.21(A) provides, \u201cIf a member who is an individual dies or is adjudged an incompetent, his executor, administrator, guardian, or other legal representative may exercise all of his rights as a member for the purpose of settling his estate or administering his property, including any authority that he had to give an assignee the right to become a member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>{\u00b6 14} In examining this statute, both the trial court and appellate court looked at the definitions of \u201cmember\u201d and \u201cmembership interest\u201d set forth in the Limited Liability Company Act, R.C. Chapter 1705. \u201cMember\u201d is defined as a \u201cperson whose name appears on the records of the limited liability company as the owner of a membership interest in that company.\u201d R.C. 1705.01(G). A \u201cmembership interest\u201d is defined as \u201ca member\u2019s share of the profits and losses of a limited liability company and the right to receive distributions from that company.\u201d R.C. 1705.01(H).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 15} The terms are distinguishable in that a \u201cmember\u201d possesses management rights, and one holding merely a \u201cmembership interest\u201d possesses limited, economic rights. R.C. 1705.22 gives members the right to obtain \u201c[t]rue and full information\u201d regarding the status of the business and financial condition of the company, while R.C. 1705.18 limits the assignee of a membership interest to receiving profits, losses, and allocations of the company and specifically directs that the assignee is not \u201cto become or to exercise any rights of a member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 16} The appellants contend that the company\u2019s operating agreement explicitly limits a member\u2019s successor-in-interest to possession of an economic interest in the company unless consent is given. Nevertheless, while it is true that the operating agreement restricts Mrs. Holdeman as the successor-in-interest to economic rights only, R.C. 1705.21(A) expressly grants the executor of an estate the right to exercise <em>\u201call of [the decedent\u2019s] rights as a member </em>for the purposes of settling his estate.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">{\u00b6 17} Although the operating agreement seems inconsistent with the statute, Epperson and the company assert that R.C. Chapter 1705, read in its entirety, does not conflict with the terms of the operating agreement, because the General Assembly intended to limit an executor to the exercise of economic rights that the decedent held at death. They also state that other sections of R.C. Chapter 1705 considered in conjunction with R.C. 1705.21(A) show that the General Assembly did not intend to give an executor the rights of a member. They point out that under R.C. 1705.15, a member ceases to be a member upon an event of withdrawal, and death is one of the listed events. R.C. 1705.15(E). R.C. 1705.18 states that an assignee of a membership interest is not entitled to exercise the rights of a member, and R.C. 1705.20 provides the procedures by which an assignee can become a member of a limited liability company. Appellants assert that these sections plainly show that on his death, Holdeman withdrew from the company. He therefore had retained only the membership rights of an assignee, and Mrs. Holdeman is entitled to exercise only those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Statutory Precedence</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">{\u00b6 18} We have held, \u201cIt is elementary that no valid contract may be made contrary to statute, and that valid, applicable statutory provisions are parts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>every contract.\u201d <em>Bell v. N. Ohio Tel. Co. </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 157, 158, 36 O.O. 501, 78 N.E.2d 42. This maxim is codified in R.C. Chapter 1705. R.C. 1705.04(A) sets forth the requirements for a company\u2019s articles of organization. Besides setting forth the name of the company and the period of its duration, the articles of organization can include any other provisions \u201cthat are not inconsistent with applicable law.\u201d As a result, to the extent the operating agreement is in conflict with the statute, the statute takes precedence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">{\u00b6 19} The statutory provisions that Epperson and the company rely upon, R.C. 1705.15, 1705.18, and 1705.20, contain the limiting words, \u201c[u]nless,\u201d \u201cif,\u201d or \u201cexcept as otherwise provided in the operating agreement.\u201d They all discuss in general terms the rights of assignees of membership interests. These sections do not appear to be inconsistent with the operating agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 1705.21(A), on the other hand, specifically sets forth the rights of legal representatives for a deceased member and grants the executor \u201call of [the deceased\u2019s] rights as a member for the purpose of settling his estate or administering his property.\u201d Because this section does not state \u201cexcept as otherwise provided in the operating agreement,\u201d we can infer that the General Assembly did not intend R.C. 1705.21(A) to be restricted by contrary language within an operating agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">{\u00b6 21} Furthermore, as the court of appeals so aptly remarked, \u201cR.C. 1705.21(A) refers to member rights in the past tense. In this regard, the statute specifically says that an executor may exercise all the decedent\u2019s rights as a member, \u2018including any authority he [the decedent] <em>had </em>to give an assignee the right to become a member.\u2019 * * * If the legislature intended to restrict executors to member rights that a decedent possesses after death, the legislature would have used the present tense. In such a situation, the legislature would have said that executors may exercise a decedent\u2019s rights, including the authority the decedent \u2018has\u2019 to give assignees the right to become members. However, this is not the language the legislature used.\u201d (Emphasis and bracketed material added by the court of appeals.) <em>Holdeman, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1681, 2005-Ohio-6480, 839 N.E.2d 402, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">{\u00b6 22} In enacting R.C. 1705.21(A), the General Assembly ensured that the legal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate has the ability to carry out an executor\u2019s fiduciary obligations to the estate\u2019s beneficiaries. The membership rights granted are limited in time and in purpose for settlement of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">{\u00b6 23} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Clark County Court of Appeals and hold that an executor of the estate of a deceased member of a limited liability company has all rights that the member had prior to death, for the limited purpose of settling the member\u2019s estate or administering his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Ak0\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b647-6\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AMH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">{\u00b6 24} I respectfully dissent. I believe that in enacting R.C. 1705.21, the General Assembly simply intended to clarify what rights an executor is entitled to exercise in situations that the operating agreement may not have addressed. Any broader interpretation flies in the face of limited-liability operating agreements. If the operating agreement already defines the rights of the parties upon a member\u2019s death, then no statute can interfere with those contract rights. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and hold that the operating agreement of a limited liability company controls the relationship of the remaining members and the executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">{\u00b6 25} In this case, Epperson owned a 49 percent interest in Holdeman-Eros, L.L.C., and the decedent owned a 51 percent interest. Thus, in his capacity as the majority member, the decedent had been the managing member and presided over meetings of the board of directors. Through the majority\u2019s interpretation, Mrs. Holdeman, who was never intended by Epperson or the decedent to become a controlling member of the company, effectively becomes a majority member and presumably is permitted to exercise all the rights of a majority member, including presiding over meetings of the board of directors and exercising her majority vote to control the future course of the company. I do not believe that this result was intended by the General Assembly in enacting R.C. Chapter 1705.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">{\u00b6 26} I believe that the majority\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 1705.21(A) is contrary to the express language contained in other sections of R.C. Chapter 1705, which delineates the conditions under which one may exercise the right to participate in the management of a limited liability company. See R.C. 1705.12, 1705.14, 1705.15, 1705.18, and 1705.20. Interpreting R.C. 1705.21(A) in pari materia with the remaining sections of R.C. Chapter 1705 mandates the conclusion that an executor has only the rights of an assignee of a member and not the full rights of a member unless the operating agreement provides otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">{\u00b6 27} For example, R.C. 1705.15(E) addresses the effect of the death of a member:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cExcept as approved by the specific written consent of all members at the time, <em>a person ceases to be a member of a limited liability company upon the occurrence of any of the following events of withdrawal:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>{\u00b6 30} \u201c(E) Unless otherwise provided in writing in the operating agreement, <em>a member who is an individual dies, </em>or is adjudicated an incompetent.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">{\u00b6 31} Thus, as of the date of his death, the decedent is considered by statute to have withdrawn from the company and to have lost his membership status.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">{\u00b6 32} In the event that, unlike here, no operating agreement exists, I agree that pursuant to R.C. 1705.21(A), the executor of an estate of a deceased member of a limited liability company has all rights that the member had prior to death, \u201cfor the limited purpose of settling the member\u2019s estate or administering his property.\u201d But by merely reciting the language of the statute, the majority fails to determine the actual rights of an executor in this situation and therefore fails to delineate the full effect of exercising those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">{\u00b6 33} If R.C. 1705.21(A) controls over the operating agreement, then the parties need guidance as to the last phrase of the statute, \u201cfor the purpose of settling [the member\u2019s] estate or administering his property.\u201d Does this language mean merely collecting assets, assessing value, and determining the amount due the estate, which are essentially similar to the economic rights as an assignee and are duties of an executor? Or can the executor, especially if the decedent was a member who had majority control, make decisions that go to the heart of the company\u2019s operations, such as changing the direction of the business, hiring or firing other employees, and suing other parties, all under the guise of \u201cadministering his property\u201d? After all, under the majority\u2019s interpretation, the executor is now a majority member of the board with authority to control the company, even though the executor may be unqualified for the task.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">{\u00b6 34} I believe that by failing to clarify the statutory language, we duck the real controversy in this case, which is what actions are allowed in the executor\u2019s role of settling the estate of a deceased member of a limited liability company. We give no guidance to the executor in this situation, and in essence by assigning full membership rights to the executor, we give our blessing to any actions that she might take. I believe that we should define the statutory phrase \u201csettling the member\u2019s estate or administering his property\u201d as taking only those actions necessary to collect, evaluate, and distribute the assets due the estate, which is, effectively, fulfilling the duties of an executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">{\u00b6 35} As noted by the concurrence of Judge Young in the appellate opinion below, \u201ca partnership is a voluntary association and when the result as envisioned by the opinion of this court is that a minority partner becomes subject to a control of a majority partner which was not voluntarily elected[,] the result is manifestly immoral and unfair. * * * [The General Assembly] should consider adopting something akin to the Oklahoma amendment cited by the [appellate] opinion[,] which limits the rights of personal representatives to those of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>assignee of the member\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Holdeman v. Epperson, </em>Clark App. No. 2004-CA-49, 2005-Ohio-3750, 2005 WL 1714210, \u00b6 58-59.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ahx\">Martin, Browne, Hull &amp; Harper, P.L.L., Glenn W. Collier, and Randall M. Comer, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b649-8\">Chernesky, Heyman &amp; Kress, P.L.L., and Thomas L.

Freund, for appellant Louise Eros Epperson.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">{\u00b6 36} Therefore, I would define the R.C. 1705.21(A) phrase \u201csettling [the member\u2019s] estate or administering his property\u201d narrowly. Because the majority fails to define the statutory language at all, I would call upon the General Assembly to clarify whether R.C. 1705.21(A) controls when there is a clear operating agreement of the parties in effect on a member\u2019s death, and if so, the extent of the rights of an executor. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b649-6\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
