The Industrial Commission denied the employee\u2019s claim, and the Tenth District Court of Appeals later denied the employee\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus that would have directed the commission to reach a different outcome. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Tenth District\u2019s judgment denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">{\u00b6 2} The appellant is George Lange, who worked as a die setter at a General Motors assembly plant in Trumbull County. (A die setter is a skilled worker who positions and adjusts cutting or stamping machinery.) Lange was injured on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>job in January 2002 when a metal-forming press closed on his left hand during a die-changing procedure. He received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">{\u00b6 3} Lange then sought additional compensation from the bureau, alleging \u2014 in accordance with Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 4121.47\u2014 that his employer, General Motors, had committed a violation of a specific safety rule (\u201cVSSR\u201d). The rule<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Lange contended had been violated by his employer was Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1-5-05:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">{\u00b6 4} \u201c(D) Machinery control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(2) When machines are shut down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe employer shall furnish and the employees shall use a device to lock the controls in the \u2018off position or the employer shall furnish and the employees shall use warning tags when machines are shut down for repair, adjusting, or cleaning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">{\u00b6 8} A staff hearing officer at the Industrial Commission concluded, however, that the rule did not apply because Lange did not prove that the machine was shut down for repair, adjusting, or cleaning when the injury occurred. The safety rule applies, by its own terms, only when a machine is shut down, and, according to the staff hearing officer\u2019s decision, the press in question \u201cwas in operation at the time of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">{\u00b6 9} That finding by the staff hearing officer was based on several sworn statements in the record. One of those statements was Lange\u2019s own affidavit, in which he explained that the die-changing procedure that he and his co-workers were performing at the time of his injury cannot be accomplished if the press is locked in the off position. Instead, according to Lange\u2019s affidavit, the ram must be raised and lowered to complete the die-changing process, and Lange\u2019s injury occurred during one of those cycles.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">{\u00b6 10} Lange\u2019s co-worker, who cycled the press during the die-changing procedure, likewise explained in an affidavit that he \u201cactivate[d] the press\u201d when he \u201cgot the indication from the die truck driver that the die was in place.\u201d That step of \u201cbring[ing] the press down on top of the die\u201d is performed, the co-worker explained, \u201cso that the top portion of the die can be clamped onto the press.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">{\u00b6 11} Citing this testimony, the Industrial Commission\u2019s staff hearing officer found that the press \u201cwas in operation because the die was being changed, and the press cannot be completely shut down while the die is being changed.\u201d Therefore the safety rule then codified at Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-05(D)(2) did not apply, the hearing officer found, because that rule covers situations in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>machines are shut down for repair, adjusting, or cleaning. Finding the rule inapplicable to the situation that resulted in Lange\u2019s injury, the hearing officer denied the VSSR claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b6 12} Lange then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in December 2004 in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. The court of appeals denied relief, however, finding that \u201cthe machine at issue here was kept running when relator and other employees were in the process of changing dies.\u201d \u201cTherefore,\u201d the court of appeals explained, \u201cthe machine here was not shut down and Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-05(D)(2) is inapplicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 13} Lange has now filed an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 14} In order to be entitled to an additional workers\u2019 compensation award for a VSSR, \u201cthe claimant must establish that an applicable and specific safety requirement existed at the relevant time, that the employer failed to comply with the requirement, and that the employer\u2019s noncompliance was a cause of the injury.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Supreme Bumpers, Inc. v. Indus. Comm., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 134, 2002-Ohio-7089, 781 N.E.2d 170, \u00b6 46. \u201cVSSRs are factual questions to be determined exclusively by the commission.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Parks v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 22, 27, 706 N.E.2d 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 15} In this case, the Industrial Commission and the court of appeals both found that the safety requirement identified by appellant Lange \u2014 Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-05(D)(2) \u2014 did not apply to the situation that resulted in his injury. The rule requires employers to take certain steps when machines are shut down, and the machine that injured Lange was not, according to the Industrial Commission, shut down.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">{\u00b6 16} To be entitled to a writ of mandamus, Lange had to show that the commission abused its discretion. <em>State ex rel. Mees v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 128, 130, 58 O.O.2d 319, 279 N.E.2d 861. \u201cWhen the record contains some evidence to support the commission\u2019s factual findings, a court may not disturb the commission\u2019s findings in mandamus.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mahoney v. Team Am. 3, Inc., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 532, 2003-Ohio-4830, 795 N.E.2d 628, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">{\u00b6 17} The record in this case provides some evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding that the machine in question was not shut down. Both Lange and one of his co-workers explained in affidavits that the machine must be turned on and the ram must be raised and lowered during the die-changing process that the workers were performing at the time of Lange\u2019s injury. In light of that evidence, the commission did not abuse its discretion and the court of appeals properly denied mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">{\u00b6 18} To be sure, Lange argues that this case turns on the proper interpretation of the words \u201cshut down\u201d in the regulation rather than a factual dispute about whether the machine was on or off. Yet \u201cthe interpretation of a specific safety requirement is within the commission\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>Arce v. Indus. Comm., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 90, 2005-Ohio-572, 822 N.E.2d 795, \u00b6 19. The commission\u2019s interpretation of the words in a safety rule is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>State ex rel. Edwards v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 422, 423, 751 N.E.2d 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 19} The commission did not abuse its discretion when it found that a safety regulation for machines that are \u201cshut down\u201d does not apply to a machine that must be turned on while workers make adjustments to it. The commission\u2019s interpretation is consistent with the oft stated principle that \u201call reasonable doubts concerning the interpretation of the specific safety requirement must be construed against its applicability to the employer.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Arce v. Indus. Comm., </em>105 Ohio St.3d 90, 2005-Ohio-572, 822 N.E.2d 795, \u00b6 19. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Sanor Sawmill, Inc. v. Indus. Comm., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 199, 2004-Ohio-718, 803 N.E.2d 802, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 20} Indeed, this court has already accepted the commission\u2019s view that this safety rule does not apply when a machine must be kept running while it is being cleaned, adjusted, or repaired. See <em>State ex rel. Harris v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 152, 154, 12 OBR 223, 465 N.E.2d 1286 (\u201cIt was reasonable for the commission to hold that the rule does not apply when the machine is already running, because the fact of its running, itself, provides adequate warning\u201d). Based on that prior decision and the principle that \u201cspecific safety requirements must be strictly construed in the employer\u2019s favor,\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lamp v. J.A. Croson Co. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 77, 78, 661 N.E.2d 724, the commission did not abuse its discretion when it found that Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-05(D)(2) did not apply to the facts presented by this case. The rule was designed to protect workers when machines are shut down, and the commission reasonably concluded that a machine is not shut down when employees leave the machine turned on while making adjustments or repairs to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 21} Perhaps additional safety measures could have been or should have been taken by General Motors or by Lange and his fellow employees to prevent the injury that he suffered. The commission did not abuse its discretion, however, when it found that the specific safety rule at issue does not apply to machines that are left running while being repaired, adjusted, or cleaned, and certainly some evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that this particular machine was not in fact shut down when Lange was hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">{\u00b6 22} Because the Industrial Commission did not abuse its discretion when it denied Lange\u2019s YSSR claim, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b656-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Ai0m\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Boyd, Rummell, Carach, Curry, Kaufmann &amp; Bins-Castronovo Co., L.P.A., and Walter Kaufmann, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b657-5\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Derrick L.
