Pursuant to R.C. 5733.05(A)(4) as it existed during the years in question, \u201cappreciation\u201d is excluded from a financial institution\u2019s taxable net worth for Ohio franchise-tax purposes. The bank contends that the interest and dividend payments it received as additions to the cash surrender value of the policies should be treated as appreciation. While it is true that the policies increased in value, the increase did not result from appreciation of the asset, but rather from an outside source of revenue added to the value of the policy as issued. Hence, the increase did not result from the asset itself gaining value, and we conclude that the addition of interest and dividend payments did not amount to appreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 2} The appellants in these five consolidated cases are five subsidiaries of National City Bank, referred to collectively as \u201cNational City.\u201d During the years 1994 through 1998, National City owned several \u201cbank-owned life insurance\u201d (\u201cBOLI\u201d) policies. A BOLI policy is a whole-life insurance policy purchased and owned by a bank to insure the lives of its employees. When an insured employee dies, the bank receives the death benefit payable under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 3} Like other whole-life insurance policies, a BOLI policy has a cash surrender value, which is payable to the policy owner \u2014 the bank \u2014 if the policy is surrendered by the bank prior to the death of the insured person or persons. When a BOLI policy is purchased by a bank, the cash surrender value is roughly equal to the premium paid by the bank for the policy. National City paid the full premium for its BOLI policies at the time it purchased each policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 4} Some of the BOLI policies guaranteed that the bank would receive a minimum monthly interest payment on the cash surrender value of the policies. Other BOLI policies provided for National City to receive dividends on the cash surrender value of the policies. In each instance, National City decided to accept the interest or dividend payments on a BOLI policy in the form of additions to the cash surrender value of the policy, rather than receive those payments in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 5} National City treated the initial cash surrender value of each of its BOLI policies as an asset in its accounting records and treated any increases in that cash surrender value \u2014 attributable to the interest and dividend payments that National City received from the insurance companies \u2014 as increases in the value of its asset. This was done in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, the cash surrender value of the bank\u2019s BOLI policies increased each time an insurer declared a dividend or credited National City with an interest payment generated by a policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 6} Further, National City never surrendered any of its BOLI policies during the tax years in question and therefore never received any payment for the cash surrender value of those policies during those years. The only cash payments that National City received from the BOLI policies were death benefits that the insurance companies paid when an insured bank employee or former employee died.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. Chapter 5733 describes the corporate franchise tax that Ohio imposes on each corporation \u201cfor the privilege of exercising its franchise during the calendar year.\u201d R.C. 5733.01(A). The tax is based on the \u201cvalue of the issued and outstanding shares of stock\u201d of the company. R.C. 5733.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Pursuant to former R.C. 5733.05(A)(4) \u2014 a statutory provision applicable to financial institutions during most of the tax years at issue \u2014 \u201cappreciation\u201d was to be excluded when a bank or other corporation determined the value of its stock for franchise-tax purposes. 1993 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 152, 145 Ohio Laws, Part III, 4279-4280. The General Assembly has since amended the statute, and R.C. 5733.056(B), applicable to the tax year 1998, the last tax year at issue, now provides the same treatment of appreciation for financial institutions for franchise-tax purposes. R.C. 5733.05(A); 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 215, 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1723, 1735-1736.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 9} The Tax Commissioner considered National City\u2019s claim that the value added to the BOLI policies constituted appreciation and issued a final determination in 2003 rejecting the bank\u2019s position. National City then challenged that decision before the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), which held a hearing on the matter in September 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 10} The BTA affirmed the Tax Commissioner, concluding that \u201cthe interest and/or dividends earned by the BOLI policies according to their specific contract terms do not constitute \u2018appreciation\u2019 as contemplated by R.C. 5733.05(A)(4).\u201d The BTA held that the cash surrender value of the BOLI policies \u201cdoes not independently increase in value,\u201d but instead \u201cthe increase is from the accumulated interest and dividends paid by the insurance company.\u201d The interest and dividend payments \u201care not an \u2018appreciation\u2019 of the * * * life insurance policy,\u201d because \u201cthe value of the underlying life insurance policy does not change,\u201d the BTA explained. Appreciation, the BTA added, is a term that refers to an intrinsic increase in an asset, rather than income produced by that asset. The BTA therefore affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny National City\u2019s refund claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 11} National City has now appealed that decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 12} In reviewing a BTA decision, our standard of review is whether the decision is \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d R.C. 5717.04. The court \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d this court will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">{\u00b6 13} The burden of proof rests on the taxpayer \u201cto show the manner and extent of the error in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.\u201d <em>Stds. Testing Laboratories, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 240, 2003-Ohio-5804, 797 N.E.2d 1278,</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>\u00b6 30. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s findings \u201care presumptively valid, absent a demonstration that those findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Nusseibeh v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784 N.E.2d 93, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 14} The issue here concerns whether the increases in the cash surrender value of National City\u2019s BOLI policies should be treated as appreciation as specified in R.C. 5733.05(A)(4) and 5733.056(B) during the tax years at issue. National City contends that the increases it recorded in the cash surrender value of its BOLI policies for the years 1994 through 1998 should be treated as appreciation, and therefore should not be included as part of the bank\u2019s total book value for corporate franchise tax purposes. The commissioner, however, argues that the value of the policies did not appreciate for tax purposes, because the cash surrender value of the policies did not increase apart from the added value obtained from interest and dividend payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 15} As we noted ten years ago, \u201c[t]here is no statutory definition of \u2018appreciation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edwards Industries, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 643, 645, 660 N.E.2d 1181. In that case, the court concluded that the term \u201cappreciation\u201d as used in former R.C. 5733.05 referred to \u201can increase in value over some period of time.\u201d Id. We therefore gave the term \u201cappreciation\u201d its plain meaning. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 111 (defining \u201cappreciation\u201d as \u201c[a]n increase in an asset\u2019s value, usu. because of inflation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 16} As stated by the BTA in its decision, the cash-surrender-value aspect of a BOLI policy \u201cis, in effect, an investment device.\u201d When the bank\u2019s investment in its insurance policies generated interest or dividends, it asked the carriers to add those payments to the cash value of its policies, thereby adding to the base amount on which the next interest or dividend payment would be calculated. The cash surrender value did not appreciate; instead, it grew larger solely because additional interest or dividend payments were added to it over time. According to the testimony of a senior vice-president of National City, all the increases in cash surrender value that the bank recorded for its BOLI policies came from interest or dividend payments from the insurance carrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 17} National City \u2014 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles \u2014 recorded the interest and dividend payments as increases in the cash surrender value of its BOLI policies. Therefore, National City claims that it is entitled to treat the interest and dividend payments as appreciation because it did not record those payments in its books as interest or dividend income. Nonetheless, these payments represented an actual return on its investment in its insurance policies. The bank paid an up-front one-time premium for each BOLI policy and, in return, received dividends or regular interest payments, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>bank chose to add to the cash value of its policies, thereby boosting the principal amount on which its future interest or dividend payments would be calculated.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ake\">Vorys, Sater, Seymour <em>&amp; </em>Pease, L.L.P., Raymond D. Anderson, and David A. Froling, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b579-14\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and Barton A. Hubbard, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 18} The two cases on which National City principally relies do not support its claim that the cash surrender value of the policies appreciated when the bank reinvested its interest or dividend payments. In <em>Edwards Industries, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 643, 660 N.E.2d 1181, we rejected the taxpayer\u2019s claim that certain retained earnings should be treated as appreciation pursuant to former R.C. 5733.05(A)(4). And in <em>SHV N. Am. Corp. v. Tracy </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 395, 639 N.E.2d 64, we ruled that the depreciation of some corporate assets did not affect the calculation of appreciation for other corporate assets under former R.C. 5733.05(A)(4). Neither decision addressed the issue presented in this case, nor did either define \u201cappreciation\u201d in the fashion that National City requests us to do now.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 19} Rather, as the BTA determined, the cash surrender value of the BOLI policies \u201cdoes not independently increase in value; the increase is from the accumulated interest and dividends paid by the insurance company.\u201d Because the cash surrender value of the BOLI policies did not increase separately from the reinvested interest and dividend payments, that value did not appreciate, and National City is not entitled to treat those payments as appreciation pursuant to R.C. 5733.056(B) and former R.C. 5733.05(A)(4) as it existed for the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 20} The conclusion of the BTA that the full cash surrender value of National City\u2019s life-insurance policies \u2014 including any periodic increases in those values resulting from interest and dividend payments \u2014 should have been counted by the bank as part of its book value for corporate franchise-tax purposes during the tax years in question is both reasonable and lawful, and we therefore affirm that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b579-12\">Lanzinger, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
