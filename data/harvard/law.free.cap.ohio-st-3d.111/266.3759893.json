Ake of Canton, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0000103, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1972. On October 11, 2004, relator, the Stark County Bar Association, charged respondent with five counts of professional misconduct all related to contumacious conduct that he committed during proceedings to dissolve his marriage. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause and made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation, which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">{\u00b6 2} Respondent, a successful practitioner in personal-injury and domestic-relations law, and his wife, Janet, filed for dissolution of their marriage in January 2001. The case, which became protracted and acrimonious, was assigned for some postdecree proceedings to visiting Judge Thomas D. White. Janet was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings; however, respondent initially represented himself, committing much of the charged misconduct while acting as his own attorney. Judge White eventually found respondent in contempt for his conduct as alleged in Counts I through V; however, these findings were later dismissed as part of the comprehensive resolution to the couple\u2019s litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\"><em>Count I </em>\u2014 Withdrawal <em>of Funds in Violation of Court Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">{\u00b6 3} On August 26, 2002, Judge White issued an order temporarily restraining respondent from withdrawing funds from a FirstMerit Bank account until further order of the court. Respondent opposed the restraining order and filed several motions to vacate the order over the next few weeks. On October 31, 2002, Judge White overruled respondent\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">{\u00b6 4} After Judge White\u2019s ruling on October 31, respondent consciously violated the temporary restraining order by writing a check on the bank account to his secretary for $94,000. One week later, the funds were wire-transferred to Naples, Florida, to pay for a condominium that respondent had agreed to buy.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">{\u00b6 5} At the panel hearing, respondent explained why he had disregarded Judge White\u2019s order. His frustration with the court\u2019s ruling was particularly apparent from this exchange with the panel chairperson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cQ. All right. So you got this August 26 order on August the 26th, and it says you can\u2019t take any money out of that account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>{\u00b6 7} \u201cDid you take money out of that account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cA. In October.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cQ. In violation of the court order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cQ. Knowing that you\u2019re in violation of the court order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cQ. What did you do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA. I had two obligations that I had incurred prior to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ. No. Not why did you take it out. WTiat did you do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-13\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA. I gave it to \u2014 I transferred it to my secretary, so that when I knew that I had to wire it to Florida on \u2014 I think within a few days after that, and so that it could be wired directly down and pay the obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-14\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cQ. Mr. Ake, when you took this money out of this account, you knew that was going to put you in contempt of court, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-15\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA. I \u2014 Yes, I knew. The short answer, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-16\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cQ. I mean, you thought about it, realized, T\u2019m in contempt of court but I\u2019m going to do it anyway\u2019; is that what you\u2019re telling me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-17\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cA. I believed I had no choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-18\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cQ. Well, you could have complied with the Court\u2019s order; that would have been a choice, wouldn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-19\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cA. And then I would \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether you want me to explain or try to explain or not. I mean, yes, I knew. I mean, the short answer, if you\u2019re cross-examining me, yes, I knew I was in violation of the Court order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-20\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. Well, the real answer is, you had some obligation, you felt you needed this money to do it to meet your obligations, and you decided to take the money out and take your chances and be in contempt as opposed to letting somebody in Florida sue you for breach of contract. That\u2019s about it, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-21\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. Plus, I also believed that the Court order was not \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have been upheld on appeal and I believe that to this day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-22\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Do you not see an ethical violation in deliberately, as an attorney violating the Court order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-23\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. Yes, sir. I do. I also see ethical violations in breaching contracts with people, putting people into situations where they are personally harmed by my actions. And, in this case, no one \u2014 no one other than the written word of the Court order, no one was harmed. My wife received every dime that she was entitled to receive. At the time that I took the money out, my wife owed me money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. Is it your thinking that somebody has to be financially harmed for there to be an ethical violation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. \u2014 when you deliberately ignore a Court order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. If the restraining order goes to holding my personal funds for some reason, there should be a reason, and if I don\u2019t owe anybody any money to hold those funds. I am perfectly \u2014 I believe and had I known we\u2019d be here today, I would have appealed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cHad I taken this to the Fifth District Court of Appeals, that I believe the Court of Appeals would have vacated the restraining order as overbroad, a prior restraint on my \u2014 on my account, and having nothing to do with the facts and issues of this case. That\u2019s my belief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-10\"><em>Count II </em>\u2014 Encumbrance <em>of Marital Residence in Violation of Court Order</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">{\u00b6 32} Also during the dissolution proceedings, respondent and Janet agreed and Judge White ordered that \u201cneither party shall incur any debt using the marital real estate as collateral, or in any other way encumber the marital real estate.\u201d On April 1, 2002, respondent consciously violated this order by using his one-half interest in the property to secure a $400,000 line of credit that he individually obtained. Respondent claimed that Janet had consented to this transaction at a time when they were considering reconciliation and that he saw this consent as an oral modification of the dissolution agreement on which Judge White\u2019s order was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\"><em>Count III </em>\u2014 Violation <em>of the Court\u2019s Order on Pet Care</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-13\">{\u00b6 33} Respondent and his wife agreed and the court ordered that respondent keep and care for the couple\u2019s very large dogs and allow Janet to visit them. Respondent admitted that he violated the court\u2019s custody order. Without telling Janet, respondent gave up one dog to the local humane society, falsely claiming that his mother-in-law was unable to take care of the animal. Respondent later tried to recover the dog at Janet\u2019s request, but by that time the dog had been given to someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">{\u00b6 34} Defending his actions, respondent asserted that neither the dissolution agreement nor the incorporating court order required him to notify Janet of how he was caring for the dogs. Respondent testified that the real reason he had relinquished the dog was that it kept escaping from his enclosure. Respondent admitted that he had lied to the humane society about his reasons for giving up the dog, but testified that he thought the lie would improve the dog\u2019s chances for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Count IV </em>\u2014 Failure <em>to Communicate Information on Life Insurance</em></p>\n<p id=\"A97\">{\u00b6 35} By court order, respondent was required to give Janet records confirming the value of his life insurance policy and her designation as beneficiary. Respondent testified that he had instructed his insurance carrier to supply this information to Janet. The company apparently replied in a letter, advising that its representatives were permitted to discuss policy terms only with the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">{\u00b6 36} Respondent did not promptly provide the necessary documents to Janet. He claimed that he never read the insurance company\u2019s letter and thus did not consciously fail to provide the documentation. He also pointed out that because he never changed the policy beneficiary, no harm resulted from his delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\"><em>Count V </em>\u2014 Failure <em>to Pay Ordered Expenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"AVV\">{\u00b6 37} On November 21, 2001, the court ordered respondent to pay for approximately $14,000 in tuition, books, and health insurance for Janet. Respondent knew of but did not comply with the court\u2019s order, claiming that Janet owed a sum of money to him against which the ordered expenses should be set off. The court eventually determined that respondent was not entitled to a setoff, and respondent delinquently paid Janet the ordered amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">{\u00b6 38} The board found, as did the panel, that respondent had violated each of the following Disciplinary Rules relative to all five counts in the complaint: DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), 1-102(A)(5) (prohibiting conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law), and 7-102(A)(l) (prohibiting a lawyer from taking any action on behalf of his client that the lawyer knows will serve merely to harass or maliciously injure another). Adopting the panel\u2019s report, the board explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cThis controversy is an excellent example why no one should ever represent himself or herself in a domestic relations action. Respondent deliberately violated a court\u2019s order on five separate occasions because he disagreed with the order and because it suited his economic interest to do so. Respondent candidly admitted as much. He committed these violations not just as a party but as an attorney of record and officer of the court. Respondent\u2019s counsel argued that not every contempt of court is an ethical violation, which is true. Counsel gave the example of a heated exchange between an attorney and judge in the courtroom resulting in a [finding of] contempt. After lunch, cooler tempers prevail, apologies are made and the trial proceeds. This may well not be an ethical violation but the analogy does not fit [this] case. Respondent deliberately, and in a calculated fashion, ignored a court\u2019s order on numerous occasions, even to the point of transferring money to his secretary\u2019s account. This was hardly a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>spontaneous act in the heat of battle. The fact that Respondent eventually made his ex-wife financially whole and Judge White purged the findings of criminal contempt does not change the intentional nature of Respondent\u2019s conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Recommended Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">{\u00b6 40} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the panel and board weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors of respondent\u2019s case. See Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proe.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">{\u00b6 41} As to aggravating factors, the board found, consistently with the panel\u2019s report, that respondent\u2019s actions were dishonest and self-serving and that he had committed multiple acts of misconduct, repeatedly violating several of the same Disciplinary Rules. BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), and (d). The board also found that respondent refused to recognize that his conduct rose to the level of an ethical violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">{\u00b6 42} As to mitigating factors, the board found that respondent had no prior record of discipline. BCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). Respondent also had fully and freely disclosed during the disciplinary process the facts underlying the charges against him. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). Two witnesses, one a Stark County Family Court judge, the other a prominent local attorney, also testified at length as to respondent\u2019s good character and professional reputation. Respondent submitted numerous similarly complimentary character references from judges, magistrates, and others in his community.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">{\u00b6 43} Relator advocated that respondent be suspended from practicing law for one year but that the suspension be stayed on the condition that he commit no further misconduct. Arguing that his conduct did not violate any Disciplinary Rule, respondent asked for dismissal of the complaint. The board, adopting the panel\u2019s proposed sanction, recommended a six-month suspension, all stayed provided that he commit no further misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">{\u00b6 44} Consistently with the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1992), Preface and Standard 3.0, when imposing a sanction for attorney misconduct, we consider the duties violated, the actual or potential injury caused, the attorney\u2019s mental state, the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Wise, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 164, 2006-Ohio-550, 842 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 28; <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Respondent has not filed objections to the findings that he consciously violated court orders as alleged in Counts I through V and that his actions constituted violations of the Disciplinary Rules cited by the board. These violations represent abuses of the legal process and disserve the lawyer\u2019s professional duty to honor and protect the legal system. For a similar infraction \u2014 the knowing violation of a court order or rule that causes injury or potential injury or interferes or potentially interferes with a legal proceeding \u2014 ABA Standard 6.22 advises that a suspension from the practice of law is generally appropriate. See, also, <em>In re Conduct of Chase </em>(2005), 339 Or. 452, 121 P.3d 1160 (lawyer\u2019s license to practice suspended for 30 days for repeatedly faffing to comply with a court order for child support).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">{\u00b6 46} Mitigating circumstances, however, support the stayed suspension recommended in this case. Frustration with judicial rulings never excuses a lawyer, while acting on his own behalf or on behalf of a client, from abiding by a court order. Nevertheless, we are convinced by the testimony and other evidence extolling respondent\u2019s integrity and competence that he would not disobey a court order in any situation other than the charged atmosphere of ending his own marriage. We are therefore confident that respondent will never repeat his transgressions. Moreover, despite the potential harm and risk of interference posed by respondent\u2019s disrespect, we note that Judge White dismissed the contempt citation against respondent with his ex-wife\u2019s consent and that neither of them filed the underlying grievance against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">{\u00b6 47} Thus, upon review, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of misconduct and recommendation. For his violations of DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), 1-102(A)(6), and 7-102(A)(l), respondent is suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for six months. The suspension is stayed, however, on the condition that he commit no further misconduct. If respondent violates the condition, the stay will be lifted and he shall serve the entire suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">{\u00b6 48} Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b362-9\">Resnick, Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b362-10\">Moyer, C.J., Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b362-11\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnS\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-12\">{\u00b6 49} I respectfully dissent. \u201cA lawyer shall not disregard * * * a ruling of a tribunal made in the course of a proceeding * * DR 7-106(A). The rule could not be more clear; a lawyer may not violate a court order. Ake not only acknowledged that he violated the order of the trial court, he brazenly acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>edged that he had supplanted the trial court\u2019s judgment with his own: \u201cI also believed that the Court order was not \u2014 wouldn\u2019t have been upheld on appeal and I believe that to this day.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AUy\">John A.

Kettlewell, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">{\u00b6 50} We have previously held that a violation of a trial court\u2019s order is a violation of DR 7-106(A). <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. McCray, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 43, 2006-Ohio-1828, 845 N.E.2d 509, \u00b6 17-18. We have sanctioned more severely than the majority does here conduct similar to that of respondent. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Osborne </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 77, 578 N.E.2d 455 (one-year suspension for violating court order).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">{\u00b6 51} Our system of justice rests upon respect for judicial tribunals and then-orders. Lawyers may not choose which orders they will respect. I would suspend respondent from the practice of law for six months.</p>\n<judges id=\"b363-8\">Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
