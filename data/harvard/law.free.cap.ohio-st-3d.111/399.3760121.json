Sandy Satullo II and Copper Kettle Marina, Inc., argue in this appeal as of right that they do not owe Ohio use tax for their use of two boats between November 1, 1995, and October 31, 1999. The Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) found that the state Tax Commissioner had properly imposed a use tax on the appellants. According to the BTA, the appellants did not purchase the boats with the intent to resell them, and therefore the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception to the sales and use tax did not apply. The BTA likewise rejected the appellants\u2019 request for a tax exemption under R.C. 5741.02(C)(4), which exempts the transient use of tangible personal property in Ohio \u201cby a nonresident tourist or vacationer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>For the reasons that follow, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b489-13\">{\u00b6 3} Copper Kettle is an Ohio corporation that began selling boats in the 1970s. From its 12,000-square-foot showroom in Lorain, Ohio, the company not only sold boats but also serviced and stored them.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-14\">{\u00b6 4} In the mid-1990s, the president of Copper Kettle wanted the company to serve as a dealer for a British-made boat model called the Sunseeker. Copper Kettle\u2019s line of credit was too small, however, for the company to purchase one of the boats. The founder of Copper Kettle \u2014 S. Sandy Satullo \u2014 used his own funds in 1995 to acquire one 55-foot Sunseeker boat for $750,000. Satullo was listed as the buyer of the boat on the sales contract prepared by the seller \u2014 Hideaway Yacht Sales, Inc., of Pompano Beach, Florida \u2014 although the BTA found that the buyer\u2019s signature on the document appeared to be that of Satullo\u2019s son, appellant S. Sandy Satullo II. No documents signed by the elder Satullo suggest that he purchased the Sunseeker for Copper Kettle, although Copper Kettle was listed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the buyer of the boat on a document titled \u201cOrder Acknowledgement and Agreement of Sale\u201d that was also prepared by the seller, Hideaway Yacht Sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 5} Neither the Satullos nor Copper Kettle paid sales tax in Florida when the Sunseeker was purchased there in 1995. In January 1998 \u2014 more than two years after the Sunseeker was purchased \u2014 the younger Satullo signed an affidavit stating that no sales or use tax was owed in Florida in connection with that purchase because the boat had been acquired with the intent to resell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant Satullo and two other persons sailed the Sunseeker from Florida to Ohio in 1996. That summer and the following summer, it was docked in Ohio and Michigan. The boat was stored in Florida during the winter months. While the Sunseeker was in Ohio, it was docked at private marinas in Bratenahl and Port Clinton, and also at a public boathouse in Lakewood.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant Satullo testified that the Sunseeker was being demonstrated for resale during the summer months when it was in Ohio. He denied using the boat for his own personal enjoyment. The BTA found, however, that the private marinas and limited-public-access sites where the Sunseeker was stored were not typical locations where boats were offered for sale. Also, correspondence in the record between an insurance broker and an insurance agency indicates that the Satullos listed the owner of the Sunseeker as Copper Kettle \u201cfor tax purposes only,\u201d and the insurance carrier noted that the boat would be \u201cused 100%\u201d for \u201cpleasure use by S. Satullo, Jr. and S. Satullo, Sr.\u201d The younger Satullo arranged for the purchase of the insurance on the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 8} Although the younger Satullo listed himself as the owner of the Sunseeker in 1996 on a registration form for a private marina in Port Clinton, he denied that he had ever owned the boat when the Tax Commissioner\u2019s office inquired about it two years later. The boat was not listed on Copper Kettle\u2019s 1996 personal property tax return or on Copper Kettle\u2019s accounting records, and it was never displayed at any boat shows in Ohio, Michigan, or Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">{\u00b6 9} In 1998, the Sunseeker was traded in for a larger boat made by Azimut, an Italian manufacturer. The seller of the 70-foot Azimut yacht was Richard Bertram, Inc., a Florida boat dealer. The elder Satullo wrote two personal checks to Richard Bertram, Inc. in late 1997 and early 1998, and he also provided an additional cashier\u2019s check to that company. The checks totaled more than $1.7 million, and those funds, together with the $645,523 trade-in value of the Sunseeker, were used to purchase the Azimut, which cost more than $2.4 million. The invoice does not indicate that the Satullos or Copper Kettle paid sales tax in Florida on the purchase of the Azimut.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">{\u00b6 10} The Azimut was brought to Ohio and Michigan in the summer of 1998. The appellants eventually sold that yacht to a boat dealer in Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>{\u00b6 11} The Tax Commissioner performed an audit of the appellants\u2019 purchases and use of the two boats and concluded that the younger Satullo and Copper Kettle owed more than $300,000 in use taxes, penalties, and interest charges. (The elder Satullo had died by the time the Tax Commissioner issued his final determination.)</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 12} The younger Satullo and Copper Kettle appealed the determination to the BTA, which held a hearing on the matter in September 2004. The BTA sided with the Tax Commissioner, finding that \u201cCopper Kettle was the titled owner of the boats, but Mr. Satullo II had both possession and a license to use the boats within the state of Ohio,\u201d and therefore both Copper Kettle and the younger Satullo were liable for the payment of use taxes on the boats. The BTA also found insufficient support in the record for the appellants\u2019 claims that they had purchased the boats with the intent to resell them. \u201cCopper Kettle was not a dealer for any boat line at the time of purchase and has provided no tangible evidence of proposed dealership agreements or sub-dealership agreements with any manufacturer,\u201d the BTA explained, and \u201c[t]he purchases were not consummated as if the boats were intended to be a part [of] Copper Kettle\u2019s inventory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 13} The younger Satullo and Copper Kettle have filed this appeal of right from the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">The Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 14} In reviewing a BTA decision, this court looks to see if that decision was \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783; see R.C. 5717.04. The court \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dish Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d this court will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150,152, 648 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">{\u00b6 15} As for the burden of proof, it rests on the taxpayer \u201cto show the manner and extent of the error in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.\u201d <em>Stds. Testing Laboratories, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 240, 2003-Ohio-5804, 797 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b6 30. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s findings \u201care presumptively valid, absent a demonstration that those findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Nusseibeh v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784 N.E.2d 93, \u00b6 10. Any claimed exemption from taxation \u201cmust be strictly construed,\u201d and the taxpayer \u201cmust affirmatively establish his or her right\u201d to the exemption. <em>Campus Bus Seru. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-1915, 786 N.E.2d 889, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The Appellants\u2019 Compliance with R.C. 5717.04</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 16} Before we address the merits of the case, a procedural wrinkle deserves mention. R.C. 5717.04, which prescribes the way in which appeals may be taken from decisions of the BTA, states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c[Ajppeals shall be taken within thirty days after the date of the entry of the decision of the board * * * by the filing by appellant of a notice of appeal with the court to which the appeal is taken and the board. * * * Proof of the filing of such notice with the board shall be filed with the court to which the appeal is being taken. * * * Unless waived, notice of the appeal shall be served upon all appellees by certified mail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 18} According to the Tax Commissioner, the appellants\u2019 notice of appeal is defective because (1) the proof of filing attached to the appellants\u2019 notice of appeal does not show that the notice filed in this court was also filed with the BTA, (2) the proof of filing states that the notice was sent by ordinary mail rather than by certified mail to the Tax Commissioner\u2019s counsel, and (3) the appellants failed to file a new proof of filing when they resent the notice to the Tax Commissioner by certified mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 19} The appellants\u2019 notice of appeal was timely filed, however, with both this court and the BTA. A copy of that notice was sent to the Tax Commissioner by certified mail, as well as by ordinary mail, within 30 days after the BTA issued its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 20} In these circumstances, we find no jurisdictional defect that compels dismissal of the appeal. To be sure, the appellants should have indicated in their notice of appeal to this court that they had also timely filed the notice with the BTA. The appellants did provide us, however, with proof of that timely filing with the BTA in response to a show-cause order \u2014 see <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1464, 2006-Ohio-594, 842 N.E.2d 536 \u2014 and we are therefore satisfied that the appellants have complied with R.C. 5717.04. The fact that the original certificate of service filed with this court listed \u201cordinary U.S. mail\u201d as the method of service on the Tax Commissioner, when in fact the notice of appeal had been sent by both ordinary and certified mail within the 30-day appeal period, is not a jurisdictional defect under the statute. The appellants properly perfected an appeal from the BTA, and we may therefore reach the merits of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Ohio\u2019s Use Tax</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">{\u00b6 21} Under R.C. 5741.02(A)(1), a tax is levied on \u201cthe storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property or the benefit realized in this state of any service provided.\u201d However, if the acquisition of the tangible personal property or services \u201cwould be a sale not subject to the [sales] tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>imposed by sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code,\u201d then the use tax described in R.C. Chapter 5741 is likewise not imposed. R.C. 5741.02(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\n<em>Satullo\u2019s Notice of Appeal Filed With the BTA Did Not Specify One of the Alleged Errors That He Now Raises Here</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 22} Satullo contends first that he was not a \u201cconsumer\u201d subject to Ohio\u2019s use tax. He failed, however, to raise this issue in the notice of appeal that he filed with the BTA from the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cFor more than 50 years, this court\u2019s decisions interpreting the specificity requirement of R.C. 5717.02 have made clear that a notice of appeal filed with the BTA must explicitly and precisely recite the errors contained in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.\u201d <em>Cousino Constr. Co. v. Wilkins, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 90, 2006-Ohio-162, 840 N.E.2d 1065, \u00b6 41. We have also explained that any alleged errors not specified in the notice of appeal are not reviewable by the BTA or by this court. See, e.g., <em>Kern v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 347, 349, 650 N.E.2d 428 (appellants\u2019 failure to mention an R.C. 5739.02(B)(14) exemption claim in their notice of appeal was fatal); <em>Cleveland Elec. Ilium. Co. v. Lindley </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 71, 75, 23 O.O.3d 118, 430 N.E.2d 939 (\u201cUnder R.C. 5717.02, a notice of appeal does not confer jurisdiction upon the Board of Tax Appeals to resolve an issue, unless that issue is clearly specified in the notice of appeal\u201d); <em>Lenart v. Lindley </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 110, 114, 15 O.O.3d 152, 399 N.E.2d 1222 (\u201cR.C. 5717.02 is a jurisdictional enactment and * * * adherence to the conditions and procedure set forth in the statute is essential\u201d); <em>Queen City Valves v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 579, 583, 53 O.O. 430, 120 N.E.2d 310, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed.1951) (R.C. 5717.02 requires the appellant to \u201cspecify\u201d any alleged errors, and \u201cspecify\u201d means \u201c \u2018to mention specifically; to state in full and explicit terms; to point out; to tell or state precisely or in detail; to particularize; or to distinguish by words one thing from another\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 24} Under R.C. 5741.02(B), a consumer who stores or uses tangible personal property in this state is liable for use tax unless that tax was paid when the property was purchased. \u201cConsumer\u201d is defined in R.C. 5741.01(F) as \u201cany person who has purchased tangible personal property.\u201d Because Satullo did not specify either of those statutory provisions or even mention the word \u201cconsumer\u201d in his notice of appeal to the BTA from the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination, he failed to preserve for review any challenge to his status as a consumer subject to the use tax, and he cannot now raise that issue in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\n<em>The Resale Exception Does Not Apply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">{\u00b6 25} The Tax Commissioner and the BTA both found that Satullo and Copper Kettle were subject to Ohio\u2019s use tax because they did not purchase the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Sunseeker and Azimut boats with the intent to resell them. That conclusion is supported by probative evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 5739.01(E) excludes from the definition of a \u201cretail sale\u201d any sale \u201cin which the purpose of the consumer is to resell the thing transferred or benefit of the service provided, by a person engaging in business, in the form in which the same is, or is to be, received by the person.\u201d In other words, when the purchaser\u2019s intent in buying goods or sendees is to resell them to yet another purchaser without changing the goods or services in any way, the original purchase is not considered a \u201cretail sale\u201d and is therefore not subject to sales tax. And under R.C. 5741.02(C)(2), any sale not subject to the sales tax is likewise not subject to the use tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 27} The burden rested on the appellants to prove to the Tax Commissioner and the BTA that the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception applied to the purchases of the two yachts. See <em>Std. Oil Co. v. Peck </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. 63, 65, 56 O.O. 56, 125 N.E.2d 342 (\u201cevery sale or use of tangible personal property in Ohio is <em>presumed </em>to be taxable, and the burden rests on the taxpayer to establish affirmatively its right to the exceptions claimed\u201d). The appellants failed to meet that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 28} The record contains ample evidence supporting the BTA\u2019s factual finding that the appellants did not purchase the boats with the intent to resell them. There were no dealer agreements between the appellants on the one hand and the manufacturers or the sellers of the boats on the other. The paperwork filed by the appellants in Florida, which stated that the Sunseeker was purchased in 1995 with an intent to resell it, was not prepared until 1998 when the appellants traded in the Sunseeker for the Azimut. The appellants did not list the boats on Copper Kettle\u2019s personal property tax returns or other business records, and the insurance paperwork suggests that the Sunseeker was intended not for resale but for the Satullos\u2019 own personal use. Both boats appear to have been purchased with the Satullos\u2019 personal funds rather than with Copper Kettle\u2019s corporate funds, and the appellants did not provide the Tax Commissioner with any sales literature suggesting that the boats had been offered for resale. The BTA also found that the private marinas or limited-public-access docks where the boats were stored in Ohio and Michigan were not typical locations where boats would be marketed for sale, and the appellants did not display either the Sunseeker or the Azimut at any boat shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 29} In light of these facts, all of which are supported by the record, the BTA reasonably concluded that the appellants did not purchase the boats with an intent to resell them. To be sure, the appellants offered the testimony of four witnesses who supported their resale-exception claim. But the BTA \u201chas wide discretion to determine the weight given to evidence and the credibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>witnesses before it.\u201d <em>Meijer, Inc. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 181,185, 661 N.E.2d 1056.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">{\u00b6 30} The BTA, in rejecting the appellants\u2019 resale-exception claim, described their witnesses\u2019 testimony as questionable and not persuasive and noted the inconsistency between the evidence that they presented and the evidence gathered from other sources by the Tax Commissioner. We will not second-guess those findings, for it is \u201cnot the function of this court to substitute its judgment on factual issues for that of the Board of Tax Appeals.\u201d <em>Citizens Financial Corp. v. Porterfield </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 53, 57, 54 O.O.2d 191, 266 N.E.2d 828. If the record contains reliable and probative support for the BTA\u2019s determination, \u201cwe will affirm.\u201d <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N. E.2d 483. Even if we \u201cmight have weighed the evidence differently from the Board of Tax Appeals if we had been making the original determination,\u201d we will not disturb the decision as long as there is evidence that reasonably supports the BTA\u2019s conclusion. <em>Jewel Cos., Inc. v. Porterfield </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 97, 99, 50 O.O.2d 238, 255 N.E.2d 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">{\u00b6 31} For these reasons, we affirm the BTA\u2019s decision that the appellants did not purchase the boats with the intent to resell them, and therefore the R.C. 5739.01(E) resale exception to the sales and use tax does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">\n<em>The Transient-Use Exception Does Not Apply</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">{\u00b6 32} Appellant Satullo next contends that he is not liable for use taxes on the boats because he was a \u201ctransient\u201d user of them. The BTA rejected this claim, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 5741.02(C)(4) provides that the use tax does not apply to the \u201c[transient use of tangible personal property in this state by a nonresident tourist or vacationer, or a non-business use within this state by a nonresident of this state,\u201d as long as the property was purchased \u201coutside this state for use outside this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">{\u00b6 34} The BTA rejected Satullo\u2019s claim that he was a Florida resident, noting that he listed a Solon, Ohio address on insurance paperwork and on a form that he completed for a private marina on Lake Erie. The BTA found, in other words, that Satullo was not \u201ca nonresident\u201d of this state as would be required for him to claim an exemption under R.C. 5741.02(C)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-13\">{\u00b6 35} We will not overturn the BTA\u2019s factual finding on this issue. \u201cWhere the appellant-taxpayer\u2019s assertion of error is basically one concerning a factual determination by the board, this court has been unwilling to disturb such determination if there is any probative evidence in the record to support the board\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Decor Carpet Mills, Inc. v. Lindley </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 152, 153, 18 O.O.3d 376, 413 N.E.2d 833. That axiom applies in this case, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>probative evidence in the record supports the BTA\u2019s finding concerning Satullo\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 36} Moreover, evidence in the record also suggests that Satullo cannot rightly claim that the boats were purchased \u201cfor use outside this state,\u201d as the R.C. 5741.02(C)(4) transient-use exemption requires. According to the testimony of one of the appellants\u2019 own witnesses, appellants\u2019 goal was to market the boats in Ohio and nearby states. The president of Copper Kettle testified at the BTA hearing that he wanted the company to acquire the Sunseeker because he believed that the company \u201ccould be successful in Northeastern Ohio with a high-style line of boats,\u201d and he hoped to \u201cpioneer a line of boats in Ohio that was different than what anybody else would have.\u201d Whether the boats were purchased for the Satullos\u2019 personal use (as the BTA found) or for marketing purposes (as the appellants claimed), the record does not show that the boats were purchased \u201cfor use outside this state,\u201d and the R.C. 5741.02(C)(4) transient-use exemption therefore does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\n<em>The Assessments Against Both Appellants Were Reasonable and Lawful</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 37} The appellants also challenge the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to impose use tax on the younger Satullo for purchases allegedly made by Copper Kettle alone. The Tax Commissioner explained in his written final determinations, however, that he does not intend to collect the tax twice. He simply assessed the tax against both Satullo and the corporation because they presented what he described as \u201calternative and contradictory arguments\u201d about the ownership of the two boats.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">{\u00b6 38} The Tax Commissioner\u2019s action \u2014 and the BTA\u2019s affirmance of it \u2014 was not unreasonable or unlawful. The BTA found that although the record \u201ccontains conflicting evidence as to who is the actual titled purchaser of the property,\u201d Copper Kettle was \u201cthe titled owner of the boats,\u201d and Satullo \u201chad both possession and a license to use the boats.\u201d The use-tax assessments against both of them were therefore proper, according to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">{\u00b6 39} That conclusion is supported by the record, as we explained above. Satullo listed himself as the owner of the Sunseeker in 1996 on a registration form for the private marina in Port Clinton, and he used both boats in Ohio. Copper Kettle\u2019s vice-president claimed in a letter to the Tax Commissioner\u2019s office in 1998 that the company owned the Sunseeker, and its president likewise stated in a 1999 letter to the Tax Commissioner\u2019s office that the company owned the Azimut. Probative evidence, in other words, supported the BTA\u2019s conclusion that both appellants owed use taxes for the storage or use of the boats in Ohio, and we will not overturn that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>{\u00b6 40} As for the lawfulness of the dual assessment against both Satullo and Copper Kettle, there was nothing improper about the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to assess the two owners of the property for the same tax. Tax collectors are entitled to impose tax liabilities on multiple persons or entities if the facts and the law support such a finding. See <em>Gerardo v. Commr. of Internal Revenue </em>(C.A.3, 1977), 552 F.2d 549, 555, quoting <em>Stone v. United States </em>(S.D.N.Y.1975), 405 F.Supp. 642, 649 (the Internal Revenue Service is permitted \u201c \u2018to assess deficiencies against more than one person for the same tax liability\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 41} As the Tax Commissioner explains in his brief filed with this court, \u201cthere is but one use tax liability\u201d for each boat, and therefore if one of the appellants pays, the other has a full defense against any further collection of the tax liability. On the record before us, which contains conflicting evidence about the ownership of the boats, we find nothing unreasonable or unlawful about the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to assess both appellants for the full amount of the unpaid use taxes, with the caveat that the taxes may be collected just once from the two appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The Taxable \u201cPrice\u201d of the Boats</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">{\u00b6 42} The appellants present several other claims, none of which warrants reversal of the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\n<em>The De\u00f1nition of \u201cPrice\u201d in R.C. 5741.01(G)(4) and 5741.01(G)(3)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 43} The appellants rightly note that under R.C. 5739.025, the amount of sales or use tax owed by a consumer is determined by the \u201cprice\u201d of the taxable goods or services, and \u201cprice\u201d is defined in R.C. 5741.01(G). Among the definitions of that term in the statute is this provision in R.C. 5741.01(G)(4):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cIn the case of tangible personal property held in this state as inventory for sale or lease, and that is temporarily stored, used, or otherwise consumed in a taxable manner, the price is the value of the temporary use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">{\u00b6 45} That provision is significant, the appellants claim, because the Sunseeker and the Azimut were only temporarily stored in Ohio during the years covered by the Tax Commissioner\u2019s audit. But the BTA did not find that the boats were \u201cheld in this state as inventory for sale or lease\u201d as is necessary to trigger the R.C. 5741.01(G)(4) definition of the term \u201cprice.\u201d Indeed, as discussed above, the BTA expressly rejected the appellants\u2019 claim that the boats were purchased with the intent to resell them.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">{\u00b6 46} The BTA\u2019s factual findings are supported by probative evidence in the record. Because the BTA reasonably rejected any suggestion that the two boats in question were held in this state as inventory for sale or lease, we find that R.C. 5741.01(G)(4) does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>{\u00b6 47} The appellants also argue that the BTA should have considered the definition of \u201cprice\u201d in R.C. 5741.01(G)(3). That provision, however, applies to \u201ca nonresident business consumer\u201d who temporarily stores, uses, or otherwise consumes tangible personal property \u201cin the conduct of business in this state.\u201d The BTA\u2019s factual findings do not support the application of that provision in this case. Copper Kettle is an Ohio corporation rather than a \u201cnonresident.\u201d As for Satullo himself, he was not a \u201cbusiness\u201d and he did not use the boats \u201cin the conduct of business in this state.\u201d The BTA also found that Satullo failed to prove that he lived outside Ohio. For each of these reasons, which are supported by probative evidence in the record, we hold that R.C. 5741.01(G)(3) does not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\n<em>The Trade-In Value of the Sunseeker</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 48} The appellants contend that the Tax Commissioner should have reduced the \u201cprice\u201d of the Sunseeker for use-tax purposes in accordance with R.C. 5739.01(H)(3) and 5741.01(G)(2). Those provisions explain that when one boat is traded in as part of the consideration for the purchase of another watercraft at a watercraft dealer, the \u201cprice\u201d for purposes of the sales and use tax does not include the value of the trade-in. Because the appellants traded in the Sunseeker when they acquired the Azimut, they argue that those statutory provisions should have compelled the Tax Commissioner to subtract the Sunseeker\u2019s trade-in value from the taxable \u201cprice\u201d of the Azimut.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 49} The appellants have failed, however, to meet their burden of proof on this issue. The trade-in price reduction applies only if the watercraft dealer was \u201clicensed in accordance with section 1547.543 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 5739.01(H)(3). The appellants offered no evidence at the BTA hearing that Richard Bertram, Inc. \u2014 the Florida watercraft dealer that sold the Azimut \u2014 had obtained an Ohio license under R.C. 1547.543 from the Division of Watercraft at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. It was the appellants\u2019 burden \u201cto show the manner and extent of the error in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.\u201d <em>Stds. Testing Laboratories, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 240, 2003-Ohio-5804, 797 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b6 30. Absent any proof from them that the seller of the Azimut was licensed under R.C. 1547.543, we hold that R.C. 5739.01(H)(3) does not apply in this case. The appellants have therefore failed to show that the Tax Commissioner erred in his calculation of the taxable price of the Azimut.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">{\u00b6 50} The BTA acted reasonably and lawfully when it affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s use-tax assessments against the appellants. The decision of the BTA is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A2o\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Wegman, Hessler &amp; Vanderburg, Keith A.

It is hard to fathom that he will be forced to pay use tax on a boat he never owned. True, he told marina personnel in Port Clinton that he was the owner of the craft, but if we start taxing boaters for boasting, Lake Erie will soon be empty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
