Because we lack jurisdiction over relator\u2019s claim for declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction and relator did not comply with S.CtPrac.R. X(4)(B), we dismiss the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Initiative Petition, Verification, Protests, Transmittal, and Supplementary Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">{\u00b6 2} Intervening respondents Donald McClure, Susan Jagers, and Tracy Sabetta are members of a committee responsible for a state initiative petition proposing a law called \u201cThe Smoke Free Workplace Act.\u201d Under the proposed law, smoking and burning tobacco in enclosed areas of public places and in public and private places of employment in Ohio would be generally prohibited. Intervening respondent SmokeFreeOhio, a coalition of nonprofit organizations, drafted the proposed law.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-14\">{\u00b6 3} On November 17, 2005, the committee filed the initiative petition with respondent Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell. The petition contained over 167,000 signatures from all 88 counties. On December 1, 2005, in accordance with R.C. 3519.15, the Secretary transmitted part-petitions to the county boards of elections to determine their validity. The boards of elections reviewed the part-petitions and then submitted their reports to the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-15\">{\u00b6 4} Beginning in December 2005, relator, Jacob Evans, an Ohio taxpayer and elector, filed protests challenging the sufficiency of the findings of several boards of elections. By March 2006, Evans had filed protests in 34 counties, and the Secretary had filed a motion in 31 of the 34 counties to intervene and transfer venue to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-16\">{\u00b6 5} On December 28, 2005, when some of the protests were pending, the Secretary notified the committee, as required by R.C. 3519.16, that the petition contained 117,026 valid signatures and that this number was sufficient for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>petition to be transmitted to the General Assembly. By letter dated December 28, 2005, the Secretary notified the clerks of the Ohio House of Representatives and the Ohio Senate that the petition met the requirements of Sections lb and lg, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, and he transmitted the full text and summary of the proposed law to the clerks for the General Assembly\u2019s consideration at its 2006 session.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 6} On January 3, 2006, the General Assembly convened its second regular session, and the clerks journalized the transmittal by the Secretary of the proposed law. After four months elapsed without the General Assembly taking any action on the proposed law, the committee filed a supplementary petition pursuant to Section lb, Article II of the Ohio Constitution requesting that the initiative be submitted to the electors for their approval or rejection at the November 7, 2006 general election. The Secretary sent the supplementary part-petitions to the elections boards to determine the sufficiency and validity of the signatures. By letter dated September 7, 2006, the Secretary notified the committee that based on the boards\u2019 reports, he had certified 114,517 valid signatures in the supplementary petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Previous Prohibition and Mandamus Case</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 7} On January 3, 2006, Evans filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County for an emergency writ of prohibition or, in the alternative, for a writ of mandamus to (1) enjoin the clerks of the General Assembly from treating the initiative petition as ever having been transmitted by the Secretary, (2) correct the Secretary\u2019s actions by declaring null and void his December 28, 2005 transmittal of the initiative petition to the General Assembly, and (3) enjoin the Secretary from determining the results of pending protest proceedings before they had been adjudicated. Evans claimed that by not waiting to transmit the proposed law to the General Assembly until reports from the boards of elections had been received following the common pleas court proceedings on Evans\u2019s protests, the Secretary violated Section lb, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Evans also asserted that the Secretary usurped the authority of common pleas courts under R.C. 3519.16 by declaring on December 28, 2005, that the initiative petition contained the required number of signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 8} On April 27, 2006, the court of appeals issued a decision denying the writs. <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Blackwell, </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-6, 2006-Ohio-2076, 2006 WL 1102804. On May 8, 2006, the court of appeals entered a judgment reflecting its April 27 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">{\u00b6 9} On appeal, we affirmed the judgment denying the writs. <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Blackwell, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-4334, 854 N.E.2d 1025. We held that Evans \u201cdid not establish that the petition contained an insufficient number of signatures on the Section lb, Article II deadline of \u2018not less than ten days prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the commencement\u2019 of the January 2006 session of the General Assembly.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 24. We further held that the Secretary did not patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction to transmit the proposed law to the General Assembly and that Evans had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by an action for a prohibitory injunction in common pleas court to prevent the proposed law from being placed on the November 7, 2006 election ballot. Id. at \u00b6 32-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Protest Case and Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 10} Just before the court of appeals entered judgment denying the writs in Evans\u2019s prohibition and mandamus case, on May 4, 2006, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas issued a decision in a case consolidating the protests that Evans had filed in 34 different counties against the statewide smoke-free initiative. The common pleas court sustained Evans\u2019s protests in part and invalidated all part-petitions listing the American Cancer Society as the circulators\u2019 employer when the circulators were actually employed by an independent contractor or were self-employed. The common pleas court determined that the pertinent part-petitions violated R.C. 3501.38(E)(1) and ordered the parties to submit a complete list of circulators not employed by the American Cancer Society who had falsely listed the society as their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 11} On May 25, 2006, the common pleas court issued an entry listing the 27 part-petitions invalidated by its May 4 decision. On May 31, the common pleas court entered judgment on its protest decisions. The common pleas court also ordered the boards of elections to revise their reports of valid signatures and reissue them to the Secretary based on the court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 12} The court of appeals stayed the common pleas court\u2019s judgment pending its resolution of the committee\u2019s appeal. On September 11, 2006, the court of appeals affirmed the common pleas court\u2019s May 2006 judgment and lifted the stay. <em>In re Protest of Evans Against Initiative Petition Proposing Smoke Free Workplace Act, </em>Franklin App. Nos. 06AP-539 through 06AP-548, 2006-Ohio-4690, 2006 WL 2590613. On October 12, 2006, we declined to accept for review the discretionary appeal by the committee and its members. <em>In re Protest of Evans Against Initiative Petition Proposing Smoke Free Workplace Act, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 1422, 2006-Ohio-5314, 855 N.E.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Actions of the Secretary of State and the Boards of Elections</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 13} On September 8, 2006, the Secretary issued Directive 2006-62 ordering the boards of elections to place the statewide smoke-free initiative on the November 7, 2006 election ballot as Issue 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">{\u00b6 14} After the court of appeals- affirmed the judgment of the common pleas court in the protest case and lifted its stay relating to the protest case on September 11, the boards of elections filed revised reports concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>number of valid signatures on the initial petition with the Secretary. On September 19, 2006, after he received the last of the revised reports, Assistant Secretary of State Monty Lobb mailed a letter to the committee members noting that the petition filed on November 17, 2005, contained an insufficient number of signatures for placement on the November 7, 2006 election ballot and that the committee would have to submit an additional 23,750 valid signatures within ten days to ensure placement on that ballot. In the letter, Lobb detailed the procedural history of the initiative petition since November 17, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 15} On September 28, 2006, the committee timely filed a second supplementary petition. The Secretary sent the part-petitions to the elections boards, and after receiving reports from most of the boards, he certified that the committee had submitted 25,486 additional valid signatures. On October 5, 2006, the Secretary found that the committee had filed a sufficient number of signatures to permit the placement of the proposed Smoke Free Workplace Act on the November 7, 2006 election ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Expedited Election Case</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 16} On September 22, 2006, Evans filed this expedited election case for a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary to perform his \u201cministerial function of (a) striking Issue 5 from the November 2006 ballot, (b) not tabulating any of the votes on Issue 5, (c) directing all of the county boards of elections to remove Issue 5 from the November 2006 ballot, and (d) directing all of the county boards of elections not to tabulate any of the votes on Issue 5.\u201d In his complaint, Evans contends that because the committee\u2019s initial filing was found to have had an insufficient number of signatures, the subsequent transmittal to the General Assembly, supplementary filing, and placement on the ballot violate certain constitutional provisions. On September 27, we granted the motion of the committee and its members to intervene as additional respondents. <em>State ex rel. Evans v. Blackwell, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1486, 2006-Ohio-5001, 854 N.E.2d 506. The parties filed evidence and briefs pursuant to the expedited schedule for election cases set forth in S.Ct.Prac.R. X(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">{\u00b6 17} This cause is now before the court for a consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Mandamus: Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">{\u00b6 18} To be entitled to the requested writ, Evans must establish a clear legal right to have Issue 5 stricken from the election ballot, a corresponding clear legal duty on the part of the Secretary to strike the issue, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. <em>State ex rel. Marsalek v. S. Euclid City Council, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 163, 2006-Ohio-4973, 855 N.E.2d 811, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cIn general, if the allegations of a complaint for a writ of mandamus indicate that the real objects sought are a declaratory judgment and a prohibitory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>injunction, the complaint does not state a cause of action in mandamus and must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Grendell v. Davidson </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 629, 634, 716 N.E.2d 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 20} We have applied this jurisdictional rule to expedited election cases by examining the complaint to determine whether it actually seeks to prevent, rather than compel, official action. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Kuhar v. Medina Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-1079, 844 N.E.2d 1179, \u00b6 7; <em>State ex rel. McCord v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 346, 2005-Ohio-4758, 835 N.E.2d 336, \u00b6 24-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b621} After examining Evans\u2019s complaint, we conclude that Evans actually seeks (1) a declaratory judgment that the Secretary\u2019s December 28, 2005 transmittal of the initiative petition to the General Assembly was improper and (2) a prohibitory injunction preventing the issue from being submitted to the electorate at the November 7, 2006 election and further preventing any votes from being tabulated. Evans\u2019s attempts to couch the terms of his mandamus claim in terms of compelling affirmative duties on the part of the Secretary, e.g., to strike or \u201cremove\u201d Issue 5 from the ballot, are unavailing. In <em>Whitman v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 216, 2002-Ohio-5923, 778 N.E.2d 32, \u00b6 5, 9, we rejected a relator\u2019s similar inappropriate attempts to use mandamus to strike or remove a candidate\u2019s name from an election ballot. In <em>Evans, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-4334, 854 N.E.2d 1025, at \u00b6 19, we dismissed Evans\u2019s earlier mandamus claim challenging the Secretary\u2019s transmittal of the committee\u2019s initial petition proposing \u201cThe Smoke Free Workplace Act\u201d to the General Assembly, holding, \u201cEvans seeks relief in the nature of a declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction, which both this court and the court of appeals lack jurisdiction to grant on a purported mandamus claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 22} This well-established precedent warrants dismissal of Evans\u2019s mandamus claim for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Kuhar, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-1079, 844 N.E.2d 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 23} Evans could have filed an action for declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction in the common pleas court in May 2006, immediately after it decided the protest case. Instead, he waited several months until after the court of appeals affirmed the common pleas court\u2019s judgment and then filed this action for extraordinary relief in mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">{\u00b6 24} Admittedly, we have, at times, \u201crecognized the propriety of using a writ of mandamus to enjoin [election officials] from performing the ministerial act of placing an issue on an election ballot.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Thurn v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 289, 291, 649 N.E.2d 1205, citing <em>State ex rel. Bogart v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 554, 621 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>N.E.2d 389, and <em>State ex rel. Burech v. Belmont Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 154,19 OBR 437, 484 N.E.2d 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 25} We have also previously granted writs of mandamus to compel the Secretary of State to strike proposed constitutional amendments from the ballot. <em>State ex rel. Minus v. Brown </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 75, 59 O.O.2d 100, 283 N.E.2d 131; <em>State ex rel. Roahrig v. Brown </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 82, 59 O.O.2d 104, 282 N.E.2d 584. Evans places special emphasis on <em>Minus </em>and <em>Roahrig </em>in his argument on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 26} Nevertheless, these cases are inapposite. Both <em>Minus </em>and <em>Roahrig </em>involved challenges to constitutional amendments proposed by joint resolution of the General Assembly to be submitted to electors, and Section 1, Article XVI of the Ohio Constitution specifically vests this court with \u201cexclusive, original jurisdiction in all cases challenging the adoption or submission\u201d of these proposed constitutional amendments. Therefore, in that type of case, this court \u2014 and not a common pleas court \u2014 must determine the propriety of the placement on the ballot of the constitutional amendment proposed by joint legislative resolution. By contrast, Section 1, Article XVI does not apply to proposed statewide initiatives like Issue 5. We do not have exclusive original jurisdiction over challenges to the submission of proposed statewide initiatives that propose a law like The Smoke Free Workplace Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 27} Moreover, in <em>Thurn, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 291, 649 N.E.2d 1205, we held that prohibition \u2014 and not mandamus \u2014 was the appropriate remedy when the statutory protest procedure under R.C. 3501.39 was available. Id. (\u201cYet R.C. 3501.39 provides for a written protest to be filed against any petition * * * for the holding of an election on any issue and requires a hearing and determination on the protest. * * * [MJandamus does not lie\u201d). Most of the cases cited by Evans predated the enactment of this general protest procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">{\u00b628} In summary, we lack jurisdiction to consider the merits of Evans\u2019s purported mandamus claim because it is actually a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief. Dismissal is thus justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Mandamus: Failure to Comply with S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">{\u00b6 29} Dismissal is also warranted because of Evans\u2019s failure to comply with S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B), which provides that affidavits supporting an original action other than habeas corpus filed in this court must be made on personal knowledge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cAll complaints shall contain a specific statement of facts upon which the claim for relief is based, shall be supported by an affidavit of the relator or counsel specifying the details of the claim, and may be accompanied by a memorandum in support of the writ. <em>The affidavit required by this division shall be made on personal knowledge, </em>setting forth facts admissible in evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>and showing affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to all matters stated in the affidavit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cWe have routinely dismissed original actions, other than habeas corpus, that were not supported by an affidavit expressly stating that the facts in the complaint were based on the affiant\u2019s personal knowledge.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Hackworth v. Hughes, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 110, 2002-Ohio-5334, 776 N.E.2d 1050, \u00b6 24; <em>State ex rel. Tobin v. Hoppel, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 1478, 2002-Ohio-4177, 773 N.E.2d 554; <em>State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 324, 750 N.E.2d 167.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 32} Evans claims that dismissal is not warranted here because his lead counsel\u2019s verification attached to his complaint satisfied the S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B) affidavit requirement. In the notarized affidavit, Evans\u2019s counsel stated that the factual allegations set forth in the complaint \u201care true and correct to the best of his knowledge.\u201d This verification, however, does not comply with the S.Ct. Prae.R. X(4)(B) personal-knowledge requirement. See <em>Hackworth, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 110, 2002-Ohio-5334, 776 N.E.2d 1050, \u00b6 24 (\u201cThe affidavit attached to Hack-worth\u2019s complaint, in which one of his attorneys stated that the facts in the complaint were \u2018true and accurate to the best of her knowledge and belief,\u2019 does not comply with S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 33} Moreover, Evans erroneously asserts that the respondents waived this claim because they raised it in their answers instead of in a motion to dismiss. Motions to dismiss, like most other procedural motions, are inappropriate in expedited election cases filed in this court. <em>State ex rel. Ryant Commt. v. Lorain Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 107, 111, 712 N.E.2d 696; <em>Hackworth, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 110, 2002-Ohio-5334, 776 N.E.2d 1050, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 34} In addition, unlike the relator in <em>Hackworth, </em>id. at \u00b6 25-26, Evans, once he was notified by respondents of this defect, did not seek leave to amend his mandamus complaint to correct the defective affidavit. Therefore, dismissal is also appropriate on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">{\u00b6 35} Based on the foregoing, because we lack jurisdiction over Evans\u2019s ill-disguised claims for declaratory judgment and prohibitory injunction and because Evans did not comply with S.Ct.Prac.R. X(4)(B), we dismiss the cause. The dismissal renders moot Evans\u2019s mandamus claim and respondents\u2019 arguments concerning laches, res judicata, and failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>State ex rel. Essig v.
