Respondent filed an answer to the complaint, and a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline held a hearing on the complaint in December 2005. The panel then prepared written findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommendation, all of which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"A_q\">\n<em>Count I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2003, Stephanie Fisher visited respondent\u2019s law office to discuss a child-custody matter. Fisher had never met respondent before that appointment. Early in the meeting, respondent asked Fisher to remove her jacket, and she did so. Respondent told her that she had a \u201cnice figure\u201d and said that she was \u201cnot as chunky\u201d as he had first thought.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">{\u00b6 4} Respondent told Fisher that he would require a $2,500 retainer to begin working on her case. Fisher said that she could pay $50, and she wrote a check for that amount. Respondent then advised Fisher that $50 would not even cover the court costs that she would be required to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">{\u00b6 5} Respondent asked Fisher if she would be willing to engage in oral sex. Fisher said that she would. Respondent moved Fisher\u2019s shirt and bra to expose her breasts, and he fondled her breasts while she performed oral sex on him. Afterwards, Fisher dressed herself and left respondent\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Later in the evening, Fisher sought treatment at a medical center in Youngstown. The following day, she reported the incident to the Youngstown Police Department, and she stopped payment on the $50 check that she had given to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 7} After examining respondent\u2019s actions, the board concluded that respondent had violated the following Disciplinary Rules: DR 1-102(A)(6) (barring conduct that adversely reflects on a lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law) and 5-101(A)(1) (prohibiting a lawyer from accepting employment if the exercise of professional judgment on behalf of a client will be or reasonably may be affected by the lawyer\u2019s personal interests).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\n<em>Count II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b6 8} In March 2004, Christine Killa visited respondent\u2019s law office to discuss a child-custody matter. Killa had never met respondent before that appointment. They discussed Killa\u2019s efforts to secure legal custody of her children, and respondent said that he was unsure whether he wanted to represent her. Killa offered to pay $1,000 in cash, but respondent did not accept any payment from her at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 9} Killa scheduled a second appointment with respondent for the following week. The day before that second appointment, respondent left a voice-mail message for Killa telling her that he had a scheduling conflict and wanted to meet at a location other than his office. When Killa returned his call, respondent suggested that they meet at Killa\u2019s home, and she agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 10} At the appointed time, respondent visited Killa\u2019s home, and he stayed for about two hours. The two of them discussed Killa\u2019s concerns about the custody of her children, and during their discussion, Killa mentioned that her ex-husband kept pornographic pictures around his house and on his computer. Killa testified at respondent\u2019s disciplinary hearing that respondent became excited when he learned that information, and he asked detailed questions about her ex-husband\u2019s sexual inclinations and habits.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 11} Respondent then walked around Killa\u2019s home, looking in all of her closets and underneath clothing. Killa testified at respondent\u2019s disciplinary hearing that she found this behavior \u201cbizarre,\u201d but she assumed that respondent was confirming whether the home was a suitable place for Killa\u2019s children to live if she gained custody of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">{\u00b6 12} Respondent entered Killa\u2019s bedroom, closed the blinds, and lay down on her bed. He then patted the mattress and asked Killa to come over and lie down next to him. Killa refused, and respondent then stood up, touched her buttocks and breasts, and tried to force her to kiss him. Killa testified at the disciplinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>hearing that she was \u201cshocked and disgusted\u201d by respondent\u2019s behavior, and she ran out of the bedroom and down the stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 13} Respondent found Killa crying in her kitchen. He told her that he did not understand what the big deal was, adding that he did this kind of thing all the time and had helped many women with their legal troubles in exchange for their having sex with him. Killa explained at the disciplinary hearing that she did not want to have sex with respondent but did want legal help on the child-custody issue that they had discussed. Respondent told her that no one else would take her case. Killa then offered respondent $1,000, and he went out to his car to get his receipt book. When he returned, respondent made other lewd comments, such as \u201c[y]ou have great breasts, can I see your tits? If I win your case, can I get a peek at them?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 14} After respondent left Killa\u2019s home that day, Killa called her parents and told them what had happened. She later told the county bar association and Disciplinary Counsel as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 15} The board concluded that by making inappropriate sexual comments, by touching Killa in an unwanted sexual manner, by using force to attempt to compel her to kiss him, and by soliciting sex in exchange for a reduced legal fee, respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and 5-101(A)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">\n<em>Count III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">{\u00b6 16} In June 2003, Tosha McGee visited respondent\u2019s law office to discuss a wage-garnishment matter. Respondent told McGee that he would represent her if she would pay a legal fee of $300. McGee gave respondent a $100 check and asked if she could pay the balance later. Respondent agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">{\u00b6 17} Respondent asked McGee, an African-American, if she had ever thought about dating a white man. McGee said no, and respondent asked her why not. Respondent asked McGee if she had \u201cever given head\u201d or \u201cever sucked a dick.\u201d He also asked McGee, \u201c[D]o you want to give me head?\u201d McGee answered no, and respondent asked her why not. He then closed the door to his office where they were meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">{\u00b6 18} Respondent next asked McGee if she wanted \u201cto see it,\u201d and he unzipped his pants, removed his penis, and asked whether McGee wanted to touch it. McGee declined, looked away, and tried to move her chair. Respondent then zipped his pants, returned to his chair behind his desk, and continued to discuss McGee\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">{\u00b6 19} The board found that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(6) and 5-101(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"Ap-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\">{\u00b6 20} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). As aggravating factors, the board found that respondent had acted with a dishonest or selfish motive, engaged in a pattern of misconduct, committed multiple offenses, failed to cooperate fully in the disciplinary process, made false statements during the disciplinary process, failed to apologize or express remorse for his actions, and caused harm to vulnerable victims. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">{\u00b6 21} Mitigating factors identified by the board included evidence as to respondent\u2019s good character or reputation and his lack of any prior disciplinary record. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (e). The board noted that respondent has been diagnosed as suffering from a generalized anxiety disorder with schizoid and avoidant personality features, but the board found no evidence that this problem caused the episodes of sexual misconduct described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 22} Relators recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. The panel and the board issued similar recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 23} We have reviewed the board\u2019s report and the record, and we find that respondent violated all of the provisions as described above. We conclude, however, that a more severe sanction than the one recommended by the board is warranted. Respondent must be permanently disbarred for his egregious professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 24} First, respondent\u2019s actions were rude, offensive, and thoroughly unprofessional. He used the attorney-client relationship to gratify his own sexual interests rather than focusing on the legal needs of his clients. His crude behavior would not be acceptable in any social setting, and it was outrageously inappropriate in the midst of an attorney-client relationship. Respondent preyed on women who were in vulnerable legal and financial circumstances, and he tried to seduce them for his own selfish gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 25} Second, lawyers must always exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice to their clients. A lawyer who attempts to engage in a sexual relationship with a client \u2014 particularly when the client is clearly not interested in that kind of relationship \u2014 puts the lawyer\u2019s own personal feelings ahead of the objectivity that must be the hallmark of any successful attorney-client relationship. By repeatedly initiating sexual conduct with clients, respondent called into serious doubt his commitment to a profession in which the clients\u2019 interests must always come first.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>{\u00b6 26} As we have explained, \u201c \u2018The attorney stands in a fiduciary relationship with the client and should exercise professional judgment \u201csolely for the benefit of the client and free of compromising influences and loyalties.\u201d [Wisconsin\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct 20.23(1).] By making unsolicited sexual advances to a client, an attorney perverts the very essence of the lawyer-client relationship. Such egregious conduct most certainly warrants discipline.\u2019 \u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Moore, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 261, 2004-Ohio-734, 804 N.E.2d 423, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>In re Disciplinary Proceedings Against Gibson </em>(1985), 124 Wis.2d 466, 474-475, 369 N.W.2d 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 27} Finally, respondent not only committed multiple outrageous sexual misdeeds with clients, but he also lied repeatedly during the disciplinary process. The panel was in a strong position to evaluate his credibility during two days of hearings on the relators\u2019 disciplinary complaint, and that panel described him as \u201cfrequently evasive and argumentative.\u201d According to the panel, respondent lied under oath, engaged in a pattern of deception that was designed to disrupt the disciplinary process, and was even willing to blame and slander his clients \u201cin the interest of self preservation.\u201d Respondent\u2019s dishonesty about his misconduct and his willingness to blame his clients rather than accept responsibility for his own actions demonstrates that he is no longer fit to practice a profession grounded on candor, integrity, loyalty, and fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b628} \u201cWe have consistently disapproved of lawyers engaging in sexual conduct with clients where the sexual relationship arises from and occurs during the attorney-client relationship. A lawyer\u2019s sexual involvement with a client has warranted a range of disciplinary measures depending on the relative impropriety of the situation, including actual suspension from the practice of law.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Kodish, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 162, 2006-Ohio-4090, 852 N.E.2d 160, \u00b6 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 29} As the panel concluded, the many aggravating factors in this case \u201coutweigh if not overwhelm\u201d the mitigating factors. Because those factors tip so decidedly in favor of a more severe sanction, because respondent committed multiple offenses with multiple victims over the course of many months, and because he expressly tried to leverage his clients\u2019 financial and legal vulnerabilities to gratify his own sexual desires and then lied under oath and blamed his victims to hide his wrongdoing, we conclude that respondent\u2019s shameful and selfish misconduct warrants our most severe sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, respondent is hereby permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b379-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Afx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Lori J. Brown, First Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator Disciplinary Counsel.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b380-7\">Ronald E. Slipski and David C. Comstock Jr., for relator Mahoning County Bar Association.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b380-8\">Mary Jane Stephens and John B. Juhasz, for respondent.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b380-4\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6E\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 31} While I agree with the finding of misconduct in the majority opinion, I disagree as to the sanction. The relators, the panel, and the board all recommended an indefinite suspension. They had the best opportunity to judge respondent\u2019s character and the possibility of his rehabilitation. I would adopt their recommendations of indefinite suspension, coupled with professional therapy and written apologies to the victims. The respondent may never satisfy the second condition for reinstatement of being able to rehabilitate himself, but apparently the relators, the panel, and the board felt he ought to be given that opportunity. Disbarment denies respondent that chance forever. While his conduct is despicable, and it is emotionally easy to justify disbarment, I believe disbarment is not objectively consistent with our cases involving more severe disciplinary conduct, although not of a sexual nature, in which we have given lawyers a second chance. Therefore, I dissent as to the sanction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
