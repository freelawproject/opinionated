We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">{\u00b6 2} The mayor\u2019s court for the city of Moraine, Ohio, is held in the council chambers in the city\u2019s municipal building. Mayor\u2019s court proceedings are governed by the United States and Ohio Constitutions, R.C. Chapter 1905, and the Mayor\u2019s Court Education and Procedure Rules. In 2004, over 800 people were incarcerated in the Montgomery County jail as a result of cases originating in the Moraine Mayor\u2019s Court, and as of August 2005, that number was 532. The vast majority of these inmates had not been represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">{\u00b6 3} During proceedings in the Moraine Mayor\u2019s Court, Mayor Robert Rosencrans and the city prosecutor sit next to each other on an elevated bench and the defendants and defense counsel stand facing the bench. According to Mayor Rosencrans and the city, public seating starts about 22.5 feet from the participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">{\u00b6 4} The mayor\u2019s court is equipped with a sound system that also records. During city council meetings, the sound system is always on and the meetings are recorded. Conversely, when Mayor Rosencrans conducts court proceedings, he does not turn the sound system on and does not record the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">{\u00b6 5} Because Mayor Rosencrans does not activate the sound system, members of the public in the audience cannot hear everything that is said during the proceedings. Mayor Rosencrans justifies his decision not to activate the sound-amplification system upon \u201cthe sensitivity of the defendant * * * as to what they are being charged with and not wanting everyone in the courtroom to know what they are being charged with\u201d as well as his conclusion that he is \u201cnot required\u201d to turn the system on.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">{\u00b6 6} Mayor Rosencrans also prevented prisoners who appeared in mayor\u2019s court from being arraigned in open court. He did so because of public-safety concerns expressed by himself, the city prosecutor, and the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">{\u00b6 7} On December 24, 2003, an attorney with the Law Office of the Public Defender, Montgomery County, Ohio, requested that Mayor Rosencrans provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>sound amplification for and record the mayor\u2019s court proceedings. The public defender cited only May.R. 11 in support of the request. On January 13, 2004, Montgomery County Public Defender Glen H. Dewar requested that Mayor Rosencrans conduct proceedings involving all incarcerated persons in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">{\u00b6 8} On March 16, 2004, after Mayor Rosencrans either refused or did not respond to the public defender\u2019s requests, appellants, the Law Office of the Montgomery County Public Defender and Public Defender Dewar (collectively, \u201cpublic defender\u201d) filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Montgomery County for a writ of mandamus to compel appellees, Mayor Rosencrans and the city of Moraine, to (1) \u201cbring all persons appearing in Moraine Mayor\u2019s Court into an open, public forum,\u201d (2) turn on the sound amplification for the mayor\u2019s court proceedings, and (3) record the proceedings of the mayor\u2019s court. The latter two requests were premised upon May.R. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">{\u00b6 9} Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 2004, Mayor Rosencrans ended his previous policy, and agreed to hear all mayor\u2019s court proceedings, including cases involving incarcerated persons, in open court. Since Mayor Rosencrans permitted bringing incarcerated defendants back into open court, no public-safety problems have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">{\u00b6 10} Appellees answered the public defender\u2019s mandamus petition, and the parties submitted evidence and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">{\u00b6 11} On December 14, 2005, the court of appeals denied the writ. The court of appeals concluded that the request to compel appellees to bring all persons into open court was moot and that May.R. 11(B)(2) did not require Mayor Rosencrans to turn on the sound-amplification and recording systems during mayor\u2019s court proceedings. <em>State ex rel. Montgomery Cty. Pub. Defender v. Rosencrans, </em>2d Dist. No. CA20416, 2005-Ohio-6681, 2005 WL 3454738.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">{\u00b6 12} This cause is now before the court upon the public defender\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">{\u00b6 13} The public defender argues that the court of appeals erred in denying the writ. In order to be entitled to a writ of mandamus, the public defender has to establish a clear legal right to have all persons brought before the Moraine Mayor\u2019s Court appear in an open, public forum and to have the sound-amplification and recording systems turned on during the proceedings, a clear legal duty on the part of the mayor and the city to do so, and the lack of an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. <em>State ex rel. Union Cty. Veterans Serv. Comm. v. Parrott, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 302, 2006-Ohio-92, 843 N.E.2d 750, \u00b6 8. Because the public defender requests that the mayor and the city perform three distinct actions, these actions are discussed separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Bringing All Persons into an Open, Public Forum</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">{\u00b6 14} In their answer to the public defender\u2019s petition, Mayor Rosencrans and Moraine conceded that they had a duty to conduct all mayor\u2019s court proceedings in an open, public forum. Although Mayor Rosencrans had previously prevented prisoners appearing in mayor\u2019s court from being arraigned in open court due to public-safety concerns, he stopped this practice shortly after the public defender filed his petition for a writ of mandamus contesting the mayor\u2019s practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">{\u00b6 15} Because Mayor Rosencrans and Moraine performed the act that the public defender had requested in his claim, the court of appeals held that the claim was moot. \u201cMandamus will not issue to compel an act that has already been performed.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Madsen v. Foley Jones, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 178, 2005-Ohio-4381, 833 N.E.2d 291, \u00b6 11. Subsequent performance of the act requested in the mandamus action generally renders the action moot. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Scruggs v. Sadler, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 160, 2004-Ohio-2054, 807 N.E.2d 357, \u00b6 5; <em>State ex rel. Frailey v. Wolfe </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 320, 321, 750 N.E.2d 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">{\u00b6 16} The public defender asserts that his claim is not moot because it is capable of repetition, yet evading review. \u201cThis exception [to the general rule of mootness] applies only in exceptional circumstances in which the following two factors are both present: (1) the challenged action is too short in its duration to be fully litigated before its cessation or expiration, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Calvary v. Upper Arlington </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 229, 231, 729 N.E.2d 1182, citing <em>Spencer v. Kemna </em>(1998), 523 U.S. 1,17-18,118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">{\u00b6 17} The public defender has not established that this exception applies to his request that all prisoners before the Moraine Mayor\u2019s Court be arraigned in open court. First, the challenged action is not too short in its duration to be fully litigated before its cessation or expiration. The public defender challenged the mayor\u2019s general policy of arraigning incarcerated criminal defendants in a nonpublic place. That general practice was not so short in duration as to necessarily preclude its litigation before it was changed. Second, there is no reasonable expectation that the public defender will be subject to having his incarcerated clients again arraigned in a nonpublic place. The mayor and the city now acknowledge that they have a duty to conduct all mayor\u2019s court proceedings in an open, public forum, and the mayor has stopped his practice of preventing prisoners who are being arraigned from appearing in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">{\u00b6 18} The cases the public defender cites in support of his contention that the exception applies are distinguishable. In <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Donaldson </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 173, 175, 586 N.E.2d 101, the court emphasized that \u201c[c]ourtroom closure cases often evade review, since a closure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>order usually expires before an appellate court can consider it.\u201d See, also, <em>State ex rel. The Repository v. Unger </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 418, 28 OBR 472, 504 N.E.2d 37. The public defender in this case is not challenging a solitary closure order in a criminal case that has since expired but is instead contesting Mayor Rosencrans\u2019s previous practice of arraigning incarcerated criminal defendants in a nonpublic forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">{\u00b6 19} Similarly, in <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Louden </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 61, 741 N.E.2d 517, which was cited by the public defender to support his claim that his request was not moot, a judge who had closed a juvenile detention hearing had a 20-year history of closing such proceedings. There was a reasonable expectation that without the requested writ, the judge would again close the detention proceedings because the judge continued to assert that the proceedings should be presumed closed. Id. at 64, 741 N.E.2d 517. Mayor Rosencrans, however, does not have a comparable lengthy history of closing arraignments and now concedes that he has a duty to keep these proceedings open.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">{\u00b6 20} Therefore, the court of appeals did not commit error by denying the public defender\u2019s first claim based on mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Activating the Sound-Amplification System: May.R. 11(B)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">{\u00b6 21} The public defender also sought a writ of mandamus to compel Mayor Rosencrans and the city of Moraine to turn on the available sound-amplification system so that the public can hear the mayor\u2019s court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">{\u00b6 22} The public defender bases his claim upon May.R. 11(B)(2), which provides that in mayor\u2019s court proceedings, <em>\u201c[a]ll participants must be able to hear and be heard. </em>If the room acoustics are unsatisfactory, an efficient public address system shall be provided.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The public defender claims that the term \u201cparticipants\u201d includes the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">{\u00b6 23} To interpret court rules, this court applies general principles of statutory construction. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Potts v. Comm. on Continuing Legal Edn. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 452, 456, 755 N.E.2d 886; <em>Thomas v. Freeman </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 221, 224, 680 N.E.2d 997. Therefore, we must read undefined words or phrases in context and then construe them according to rules of grammar and common usage. See <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 70, 2005-Ohio-3807, 831 N.E.2d 987, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cParticipant\u201d is defined as \u201cone that takes part or shares in something with others.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (2002) 1646. The language of May.R. 11 indicates that the word \u201cparticipant\u201d is more restrictive than the word \u201cpublic.\u201d See, e.g., May.R. 11(C)(2) (\u201cLitigants and other members of the public shall refrain from talking during the proceeding, except when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>addressing the mayor, testifying, or conferring with counsel. All persons participating in the proceeding shall refrain from using foul or abusive language\u201d). As the court of appeals concluded, \u201cit is more logical to read the term \u2018participant\u2019 as a reference to those who take an active role in the outcome of the trial such as the parties, counsel, Mayor, Mayor\u2019s staff and any witnesses who actually \u2018take part\u2019 in the proceedings.\u201d 2005-Ohio-6681, 2005 WL 3454738, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">{\u00b6 25} Moreover, as the mayor and the city persuasively assert, adopting the public defender\u2019s interpretation that \u201cparticipants,\u201d as used in May.R. 11(B)(2), includes the general public would lead to the unreasonable result that members of the general public would have an unfettered right to be heard in mayor\u2019s court proceedings in addition to the right to hear those proceedings. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Asti v. Ohio Dept. of Youth Servs., </em>107 Ohio St.3d 262, 2005-Ohio-6432, 838 N.E.2d 658, \u00b6 28 (courts construe a statute and rule to avoid unreasonable or absurd results). Manifestly, members of the general public in mayor\u2019s court do not have the right to speak in mayor\u2019s court proceedings in which they are not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 26} Insofar as the public defender also argues that constitutional provisions require May.R. 11(B)(2) to be construed to require activation of the sound system, the public defender did not rely on constitutional arguments in either his December 23, 2004 letter or in his petition for mandamus. The court of appeals thus did not err in resolving the public defender\u2019s sound-amplification claim without discussing any constitutional arguments. See, e.g., <em>State ex rel. Musial v. N. Olmsted, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-Ohio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 31 (relator waived claims based upon R.C. 121.22 and a municipal charter because he did not raise them before the court of appeals); <em>State ex rel. R.W. Sidley, Inc. v. Crawford, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 113, 2003-Ohio-5101, 796 N.E.2d 929, \u00b6 32 (appellant waived claims in an appeal from the denial of extraordinary writs \u201cby failing to plead them in its complaint, amend its complaint to include them, or try them with the consent of other parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 27} The lack of a public-address system does not violate any constitutional right. In <em>United States v. Griffin </em>(C.A.5, 1976), 527 F.2d 434, 436, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that a defective public-address system did not violate a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">{\u00b628} \u201cGriffin also argues that he was denied his constitutional right to a public trial and confrontation of witnesses against him by virtue of the defective public address system. He claims that the court and jury were unable to hear the government\u2019s witnesses. The record does not support this assertion. On the contrary, the record shows that the court provided that the necessary participants heard the testimony of the witnesses and all other proceedings. No error was committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>{\u00b6 29} Like the criminal defendant in Griffin, the participants in the Moraine Mayor\u2019s Court proceedings are able to hear the proceedings, as required by May.R. 11(B)(2). Therefore, based upon the plain language of the rule, the court of appeals did not err in holding that there is no clear legal duty on the part of Mayor Rosencrans and the city of Moraine to turn on the sound-amplification system during mayor\u2019s court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Recording Mayor\u2019s Court Proceedings: May.R. 11(B)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">{\u00b6 30} In his final proposition of law, the public defender asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying his claim for a writ of mandamus to compel Mayor Rosencrans and the city of Moraine to record mayor\u2019s court proceedings. In the public defender\u2019s December 24, 2003 written request and the March 16, 2004 mandamus petition, he cited only May.R. 11 in support of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">{\u00b6 31} As the court of appeals correctly concluded, however, May.R. 11(B)(2) does not require that mayor\u2019s court proceedings be recorded. 2005-Ohio-6681, 2005 WL 3454738, \u00b6 25. May.R. 11(B)(2) simply provides that \u201c[a]n audio system to record mayor\u2019s court proceedings should be provided and tapes of proceedings <em>should </em>be maintained in accordance with established records retention schedules.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201cshould\u201d imposes no duty on respondents to record mayor\u2019s court proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Dunlap v. W.L. Logan Trucking Co., </em>161 Ohio App.3d 51, 2005-Ohio-2386, 829 N.E.2d 356, \u00b6 16 (the word \u201cshall\u201d establishes a mandatory duty, but the word \u201cshould\u201d requires the use of discretion and judgment); <em>Lodl v. Progressive N. Ins. </em>(2002), 253 Wis.2d 323, 646 N.W.2d 314, \u00b6 30 (a policy regarding traffic direction and control was cast in discretionary terms when it used the word \u201cshould\u201d throughout); <em>Stewart v. Chevron Chem. Co. </em>(1988), 111 Wash.2d 609, 613, 762 P.2d 1143 (when a layoff policy states that management \u201cshould\u201d consider performance, experience, and length of service, no obligation is created for management to consider all three factors; \u201cshould\u201d may be interpreted as discretionary); cf. <em>State ex rel. Grinnell Communications Corp. v. Love </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 399, 400-401, 16 O.O.3d 434, 406 N.E.2d 809 (use of word \u201cshould\u201d in Code of Judicial Conduct imposes mandatory standards in light of introductory paragraph of code specifying that the canons and accompanying text establish mandatory standards).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 32} The public defender further claims that the Rules of Criminal Procedure impose a duty on the mayor and the city to record certain mayor\u2019s court proceedings. But the public defender never based his written request or the mandamus petition on these rules, instead choosing to rely solely on May.R. 11. The public defender also did not amend his complaint to raise this claim. Therefore, the public defender waived consideration of this claim on appeal. See <em>Musial, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 459, 2005-Ohio-5521, 835 N.E.2d 1243, \u00b6 31; <em>Sidley, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 113. 2003-Ohio-5101, 796 N.E.2d 929, \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 33} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the court of appeals\u2019 denial of the public defender\u2019s first claim for a writ of mandamus based on mootness, and affirm the court of appeals\u2019 denial of the public defender\u2019s remaining mandamus claims, which sought to compel the mayor and the city to activate the available sound-amplification system during mayor\u2019s court proceedings and to record those proceedings, because May.R. 11 imposes no duty on the mayor and the city to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b435-8\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b435-9\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Arn\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">{\u00b6 34} Admittedly, the age-old puzzler \u201cIf a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does it make a sound?\u201d defies an easy answer. However, the question facing us today, \u201cIf a public trial doesn\u2019t make a sound, is it still a public trial?\u201d is not so vexing. It demands a simple answer: No. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">{\u00b6 35} The First Amendment to the United States Constitution, in conjunction with the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits governments from \u201cabridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d See, also, Section 11, Article I, Ohio Constitution (\u201cno law shall be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech, or of the press\u201d). The Sixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\u201d See, also, Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution (\u201cIn any trial, in any court, the party accused shall be allowed to * * * have * * * a speedy public trial\u201d). Under Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, \u201c[a]ll courts shall be open.\u201d \u201cThe right to a public trial is an important, fundamental constitutional guarantee of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions.\u201d <em>State v. Lane </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 112, 119, 14 O.O.3d 342, 397 N.E.2d 1338, citing the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Sections 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">{\u00b6 36} In recent years, this court has moved toward complete openness of juvenile proceedings in cases where the media has sought access to the proceedings. In those cases, this court has trumpeted the necessity of public access:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-13\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe Free Speech and Free Press Clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, the analogous provisions of Section 11, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, and the \u2018open courts\u2019 provision of Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution create a qualified right of public access to court proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ings that have historically been open to the public and in which public access plays a significantly positive role.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Geauga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Div. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 79, 82, 734 N.E.2d 1214. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Floyd, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 56, 2006-Ohio-4437, 855 N.E.2d 35.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">{\u00b6 38} It seems incongruous that this court should open up traditionally private juvenile proceedings to the media while at the same time allowing the mayor\u2019s court of the city of Moraine to maintain its Kafkaesque custom of trial by mime.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 39} If a proceeding meets the \u201ctests of experience and logic\u201d by being the type of proceeding that has historically been open to the public and in which public access has a significantly positive effect, the proceeding is presumed open and may be closed only if the court finds that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve an overriding interest. <em>Press Ent. Co. v. Riverside Cty. Superior Court </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 1, 9, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1; <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v.

Thus, \u201cthe party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Waller v.

The qualified constitutional right of access and its presumption of openness apply to most criminal proceedings. <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Geauga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Div. </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 79, 82, 734 N.E.2d 1214, citing <em>State ex rel. The Repository v.

At issue, however, is whether they violated this constitutional duty by refusing to turn on an available sound-amplification system during mayor\u2019s court proceedings to allow the public in the courtroom to hear the proceedings. In effect, the mayor and the city assert that there is no right to <em>hear </em>the proceedings, only to <em>see </em>them.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 42} The mayor and the city are mistaken. The constitutional right of access to criminal proceedings includes the right \u201cto <em>hear, </em>see, and communicate observations concerning them.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 555, 576, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973; see, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>also, <em>United, States v. Alcantara </em>(CA.2, 2005), 396 F.3d 189, 197, quoting <em>United States v. Santarelli </em>(C.A.11, 1984), 729 F.2d 1388, 1390 (\u201c \u2018[T]he public has a First Amendment right to see and <em>hear </em>that which is admitted in evidence in a public sentencing hearing\u2019 \u201d [emphasis added]); <em>United States v. Beckham </em>(C.A.6, 1986), 789 F.2d 401, 413 (\u201cThe policies underlying the constitutional right to attend a criminal trial are stronger. The right to attend the trial, to see and <em>hear </em>the events that transpire and to publish these events, is a right that is fundamental to the protection of express constitutional guarantees in the First and Sixth Amendments\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Associated Press v. Bost </em>(Miss.1995), 656 So.2d 113, 117 (\u201cUnder the First Amendment, the press and public are guaranteed a right of access to public trials in order to gather information, and report what they see and <em>hear </em>\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>Raper v. Berrier </em>(1957), 246 N.C. 193, 195, 97 S.E.2d 782 (\u201cThe public * * * [is] entitled to see and <em>hear </em>what goes on in the courts\u201d [emphasis added]).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 43} In <em>People v. Ramey </em>(1992), 237 Ill.App.3d 1001, 606 N.E.2d 39, an Illinois appellate court held that a trial court violated a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial when the court turned off the microphones of the courtroom\u2019s public-address system during closing arguments without making the requisite findings to overcome the presumption of openness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c[I]t cannot be successfully maintained that in the case at bar a closure, <em>qua </em>closure, did not occur, even though the microphones were turned off only during closing arguments. The issue, then, becomes one of whether the trial court abused its discretion in shutting off the auditory part of the proceedings to the public portion of the courtroom during closing arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cWe hold that the trial court here abused its discretion in failing to meet the elements set forth in <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>for, assuming, without deciding, that an overriding interest existed, namely, the tainting of a venire from which a jury would be picked to hear the next trial, the closure was broader than necessary to protect this interest. As the record now shows, not only the venirepersons, but also the members of defendant\u2019s family were excluded from the courtroom and were thus prevented from hearing closing arguments. Accordingly, we conclude that on the facts of this case, the \u2018presumption of openness\u2019 * * * was not overcome, and defendant was improperly denied his constitutional right to a public trial.\u201d Id. at 1005, 606 N.E.2d 39.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 47} The mayor\u2019s actions here in refusing to activate the available sound-amplification system for <em>all proceedings </em>in mayor\u2019s court was much more egregious than the impermissible closure caused by turning the sound system off during the closing arguments in <em>Ramey. </em>The specified reasons by the mayor for doing so \u2014 to spare criminal defendants public embarrassment and because he is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>not required to do so under May.R. 11 \u2014 are insufficient to overcome the constitutional presumption of openness of mayor\u2019s court proceedings. Cf. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Norfolk Cty. Superior Court </em>(1982), 457 U.S. 596, 607-608, 102 S.Ct. 2613, 73 L.Ed.2d 248 (state interest of preventing further trauma and embarrassment to alleged minor victims of certain sexual offenses by closing criminal trial during victim\u2019s testimony does not justify a mandatory closure rule without regard to unique facts of each case).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">{\u00b6 48} The mayor and the city erroneously assert that the \u201copen courts doctrine does not give the public a right to hear and be heard.\u201d It is axiomatic that there is a constitutional right of the public <em>to hear </em>criminal proceedings. See <em>Richmond, Alcantara, Santarelli, </em>and <em>Beckham, </em>supra. This right exists regardless of whether there is any additional right for the public \u201cto be heard.\u201d Consequently, the constitutional right is broader than any comparable right under May.R. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 49} As the court recognized in <em>Lane, </em>60 Ohio St.2d at 119, 14 O.O.3d 342, 397 N.E.2d 1338, the \u201cguarantee of a public trial is a cornerstone of our democracy which should not be circumvented unless there are extreme overriding circumstances.\u201d Policy reasons supporting open, public trials include the following: \u201c(1) A public trial serves as an effective restraint upon a possible abuse of power * * *; (2) a public trial assures traditional trustworthiness by inducing fear of testimony falsely given * * *; (3) a public trial makes the proceedings known to a possible material witness who might otherwise be unknown to the parties * * *; and (4) a public trial allows the public to learn about the functioning of their government.\u201d Id.; see, also, <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 46,104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (\u201cIn addition to ensuring that judge and prosecutor carry out their duties responsibly, a public trial encourages witnesses to come forward and discourages perjury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 50} The mayor\u2019s refusal to activate the available sound-amplification system contravenes these purposes. Without the public being able to hear the proceedings, the mayor\u2019s court proceedings are not as effective in checking potential abuse of power, assuring testimonial veracity, providing access to possible material witnesses, or imparting knowledge of government functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 51} Therefore, because the mayor did not articulate findings sufficient to overcome the constitutional presumption of openness, he erred in closing mayor\u2019s court proceedings to the general public by refusing to activate the sound-amplification system. The public defender is entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel the mayor and the city to perform this constitutional duty.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-8\">O\u2019Connor and Lanzinger, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Azj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Glen H.
