Stahl appeals from a decision of the Ninth District Court of Appeals that held that statements to a nurse practitioner during a medical examination at a hospital DOVE unit by a rape victim identifying the accused were nontestimonial pursuant to <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, and therefore admissible at trial. Upon review, we agree and affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 2} On December 22, 2003, in an effort to help her boyfriend regain his lost employment, Ann Mazurek allegedly went to the office of his former boss, James Stahl. The next day, she made a statement to Officer Amy Ellis of the Richfield Police Department, alleging that during her visit, Stahl had orally raped her. After taking a detailed statement from Mazurek, Ellis transported her to the Developing Options for Violent Emergencies (\u201cDOVE\u201d) unit at St. Thomas Hospital in Akron, Ohio. This hospital unit specializes in health-care services for victims of sexual assault and domestic disturbances and provides essentially the same services as a traditional emergency room but in a more efficient and timely fashion. The unit\u2019s specialization allows it to better handle these victims because it is not consumed with other injuries that are presented in typical emergency rooms on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 3} Prior to her examination, Mazurek signed a consent form authorizing the examination and agreeing to release any evidence, information, clothing, and photographs for prosecution of the case. The form, in its entirety, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u201cDOVE Program CONSENT FOR FORENSIC EXAM AND RELEASE OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cI voluntarily consent to this forensic examination and collection of evidence. I have received a detailed description of the steps of the process and understand that I may withdraw my consent to any or all parts of this examination at any time. I authorize the release of evidence, information (including protected health information), clothing, colposcope photos, and photography documentation of injuries to a law enforcement agency for use only in the investigation and prosecution of this crime. I understand that if release of the Sexual Assault Evidence Collection Kit is not authorized, the kit will be kept at the SANE [Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner] Unit for sixty days and then destroyed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">{\u00b6 5} Jenifer Markowitz, a nurse practitioner and coordinator for victim services at the DOVE program, began the examination by taking a detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>medical and incident history from Mazurek and documented the incident in her report as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cAnn states she went to talk with her boyfriend\u2019s boss about giving him his job back. She states she was in his office talking with him and he came around the desk and put his arms around her and patted her back; told her \u2018Let\u2019s go take a walk, you\u2019ll feel better.\u2019 She states she protested, but he grabbed his coat and Ann states she thought they were going outside. She states he whispered to her, T would do anything for you. I\u2019ll always help you.\u2019 She states he walked her out of his office and downstairs. She states she told him she didn\u2019t need a walk. She states he took her into an office and started to hug her, telling her, \u2018I\u2019ll always help you guys out. You do something to me. I don\u2019t know what it is about you.\u2019 She states he kept hugging her, trying to kiss her mouth. She states she told him no, but he got the door closed and turned the lights down. She states he pushed her into a corner and kept kissing her mouth. She states he told her, T helped you guys out, you\u2019re going to do something for me.\u2019 She states he moved his hands around her head, then moved one hand to her neck and pushed her down onto her knees. Ann states she hit her head on a piece of furniture when he pushed her down. She states he held her down, unzipped his pants and took his penis out. She states he tried to penetrate her mouth and was able to get it in after rubbing himself in her face and manually masturbating himself. She states he straddled her shoulders and neck and continued to orally penetrate her until he ejaculated in her mouth, on her face and in her hair. She states he handed her a tissue to clean off with then let her leave without incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 7} Officer Ellis, who had transported Mazurek to the DOVE unit following her statement to police, remained in the examination room while Markowitz took the incident history but did not participate in taking the history or administering the physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 8} After obtaining Mazurek\u2019s medical and incident history, Markowitz performed a physical examination that included the use of a colposcope to photograph Mazurek\u2019s mouth, and also collected materials using an approved forensic evidence-collection kit (see Ohio Adm.Code 109:7-1-01), including nail scrapings, oral swabbings, and material retrieved with dental floss. Additionally, Markowitz used ultraviolet lighting to identify any bodily fluids still present. Markowitz also collected a napkin from Mazurek\u2019s coat pocket that Mazurek had used to wipe her face after the incident. Markowitz then tried to ascertain whether Mazurek would be in any danger upon discharge and informed her about the importance of follow-up care.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">{\u00b6 9} According to defense counsel, Mazurek died about five weeks later on February 1, 2004, from an unrelated seizure disorder, without having given formal testimony. Nonetheless, a Summit County grand jury indicted Stahl on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>one count of rape and one count of kidnapping. In preparing for trial, the prosecutor filed a notice of intent to use medical records, which prompted Stahl to move for an order in limine to exclude Mazurek\u2019s statements to Markowitz during the DOVE unit examination. The trial court conducted a hearing on the motion in limine, at which Stahl argued that introduction of Mazurek\u2019s statement would violate his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights as set forth in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Nurse Markowitz testified that Mazurek alleged that she had been raped by Stahl. Additionally, Markowitz testified about the DOVE unit and its relationship to law enforcement. Following that hearing, the trial court found Mazurek\u2019s statement to be testimonial and therefore inadmissible in accordance with <em>Crawford. </em>Although the court stated that it had granted a motion in limine, it is clear from the hearing and the order that the court treated the motion as a motion to suppress. The state appealed pursuant to R.C. 2945.67 and Crim.R. 12(K). The Ninth District Court of Appeals reversed that determination with respect to the DOVE unit statement and held that Mazurek had made the statement for purposes of diagnosis and treatment and that it was therefore nontestimonial. <em>State v. Stahl, </em>2005-Ohio-1137, \u00b6 21. Stahl appealed to this court, and we granted discretionary review.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">{\u00b6 10} The issue in this case concerns whether Mazurek\u2019s statement to Markowitz at the DOVE unit identifying Stahl as her assailant is testimonial in nature in accordance with <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>and therefore inadmissible pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution or whether it is nontestimonial and therefore admissible against Stahl.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">{\u00b6 11} Stahl advances several arguments contending that Mazurek\u2019s statement is testimonial and therefore inadmissible at trial. First, he argues that the DOVE unit is an arm of the prosecution because it retains evidence for prosecutorial purposes and receives funding from the state Attorney General\u2019s office. Second, he claims that because she signed a consent form prior to the examination, Mazurek reasonably expected her statements to Markowitz to be used by the prosecution. Third, he contends that a reasonable person in Mazurek\u2019s position would believe that her statement would be used in a future prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 12} On the other hand, the state urges that Mazurek made the statement in connection with her medical examination for purposes of medical diagnosis and therefore had no reason to believe that it would be used in a later prosecution of the crime. It also contends that even if the DOVE unit does provide a service for the prosecution, its primary purpose is diagnosis and treatment of rape victims, and therefore Mazurek\u2019s statement is nontestimonial according to <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">{\u00b6 13} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him * *</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>{\u00b6 14} In <em>Crawford, </em>the defendant had stabbed an assailant who, he claimed, had tried to rape his wife. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The defendant\u2019s wife, when questioned by police, provided an account of the stabbing that had been recorded on audio tape. The prosecution moved to introduce the wife\u2019s account of the incident in lieu of her live testimony at trial because the marital privilege barred her from testifying without her husband\u2019s consent. Id. at 40, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The trial court permitted the testimony, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56,100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, and a jury convicted Crawford of assault. Id. at 41,124 S.Ct. 1354,158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 15} On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the conviction, but the United States Supreme Court reversed both courts and held her statement inadmissible. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. After conducting an exhaustive historical analysis of the Confrontation Clause, the court reasoned that the Confrontation Clause applies only to \u201cwitnesses,\u201d meaning those who \u201c \u2018bear testimony\u2019 \u201d against the accused. \u201c \u2018Testimony,\u2019 in turn, is typically \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019\u201d Id. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, quoting 1 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828). Thus, the court ruled that only testimonial statements implicate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">{\u00b6 16} The court held: \u201cWhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law \u2014 as does <em>Roberts, </em>and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether. Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d Id. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Therefore, because Crawford had no opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, the court held that the Confrontation Clause precluded introduction of the wife\u2019s recorded statement that had been given to police authorities in anticipation of prosecution. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">{\u00b6 17} Upon review of the facts in <em>Crawford, </em>we conclude that it does not dispose of this matter. <em>Crawford </em>involved the admissibility of direct police interrogations without an ability to cross-examine. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. In <em>Crawford, </em>the police conducted two formal custodial interrogations following the administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Id. at 65, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. There, the state sought to introduce a statement made by a wife to a <em>police officer </em>during interrogation in an effort to gather evidence of her husband\u2019s stabbing of her assailant. Police interrogations, the court reasoned, \u201cfall squarely within\u201d the class of statements the Framers intended the clause to exclude. Id. at 53, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>These statements are \u201ctestimonial under even a narrow standard.\u201d Id. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">{\u00b6 18} In sharp contrast with the prosecution in <em>Crawford, </em>the state in the instant case seeks to introduce a statement made by a victim to a <em>medical professional </em>during an emergency-room examination identifying a person who allegedly raped her. Though made in the presence of a police officer, the identification elicited during the medical examination came to a medical professional in the ordinary course of conducting a medical examination, and no <em>Miranda </em>warnings preceded its delivery. Unlike <em>Crawford, </em>this case does not involve police interrogation. The court in <em>Crawford </em>concluded that the term \u201ctestimonial statement\u201d applies \u201cat a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d Id. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Mazurek\u2019s statements to Markowitz do not fall within any of these specific examples, and we decline to expand that list to include statements made to a medical professional for purposes of receiving medical treatment or diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">{\u00b6 19} The court in <em>Crawford </em>expressly declined to define \u201ctestimonial,\u201d but it did give three examples of \u201cformulations\u201d for \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d that historical analysis supports. 541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The first deems testimonial all \u201c <em>\u2018ex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent \u2014 that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, quoting Crawford\u2019s brief. The second includes all \u201c \u2018extrajudicial statements * * * contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 52,124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, quoting <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848 (Thomas, J., concurring). And the third includes \u201c \u2018statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting the brief of amicus curiae National Association of Defense Lawyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 20} Stahl acknowledges these formulations and urges us to adopt an expanded version of the third. He argues that \u201ctestimonial statement\u201d means (1) a statement made under circumstances that would lead an objective witness to reasonably expect that the statement would be available for use at a later trial or (2) a statement directed toward prosecutorial agents who intend to use it with an eye toward trial. Id. Thus, Stahl urges us to consider not only Mazurek\u2019s state of mind when giving the statement but both Markowitz\u2019s and Ellis\u2019s motivations in conducting and facilitating the interview and the medical examination. Stahl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>argues that Mazurek, in view of the consent form and the role of Ellis in setting up the interview, reasonably believed that the statement would be used at the trial in the matter. He further argues \u2014 and there is little doubt \u2014 that Markowitz and Ellis intended to use the DOVE unit examination results to further their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 21} Stahl\u2019s modified <em>Crawford </em>formulation, however, raises a significant concern. <em>Crawford </em>narrowed and refined the right to confrontation by focusing on its derivation and held that the right does not extend to nontestimonial hearsay. Thus, we should not allow our definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d to trample other forms of hearsay to which the right of confrontation does not apply. A definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d for Sixth Amendment purposes should therefore focus on the principal evil the clause meant to remedy: \u201cthe civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Stahl\u2019s modified third formulation, which requires review of the motivations of the declarant and the questioner, would at times preclude forms of hearsay that the Framers did not intend to preclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">{\u00b6 22} The United States Supreme Court has provided additional guidance regarding testimonial statements in two recent cases, decided together, dealing with the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule, <em>Davis v. Washington </em>and <em>Hammon v. Indiana </em>(2006), \u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. Both cases instruct that a court should view statements <em>objectively </em>when determining whether they implicate Confrontation Clause protection pursuant to <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Davis, </em>the court held that a 911 telephone call made to seek protection from immediate danger did not constitute a testimonial statement for Sixth Amendment purposes. In contrast, the court in <em>Hammon </em>held as testimonial a victim\u2019s statement to a police officer after the officer arrived at the home in response to a report of domestic disturbance. In its analysis, the court explained that \u201c[statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the <em>primary purpose </em>of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. at 2273,165 L.Ed.2d 224. Conversely, the court stated, statements \u201care testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the <em>primary purpose </em>of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., \u2014 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2273-2274, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. With respect to <em>Davis, </em>the court reasoned that \u201cthe nature of what was asked and answered [during the 911 call] * * *, again viewed objectively, was such that the elicited statements were necessary to be able to <em>resolve </em>the present emergency, rather than simply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>learn (as in Crawford) what had happened in the past.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at -, 126 S.Ct. at 2276, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. Moreover, the call \u201cwas plainly a call for help against bona fide physical threat\u201d and involved \u201cfrantic answers\u201d given \u201cin an environment that was not tranquil, or even (as far as any reasonable 911 operator could make out) safe.\u201d Id. at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2276, 2277, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">{\u00b6 24} Unlike the officers in <em>Davis, </em>the interrogating police officer in <em>Hammon </em>elicited the victim\u2019s statements at the scene <em>following </em>the alleged crime. At the time of the interrogation, any emergency had ceased, and \u201c[o]bjectively viewed, the primary, if not indeed the sole, purpose of the interrogation was to investigate a possible crime \u2014 which is, of course, precisely what the officer <em>should </em>have done.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2278, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. The court also noted the similarity between <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Hammon, </em>stating, \u201cIt is entirely clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an investigation into possibly criminal past conduct * * Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">{\u00b6 25} <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>are factually distinguishable from this case. They involve statements made to law-enforcement officers, while the statement at issue here covers one made to a medical professional at a medical facility for the <em>primary </em>purpose of receiving proper medical treatment and not investigating past events related to criminal prosecution. It is true that the DOVE unit gathers forensic evidence for potential criminal prosecution, but its primary purpose is to render medical attention to its patients. Furthermore, the definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Hammon </em>involves the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay evidence rule as well as other statements made during\u2014 and in response to \u2014 an emergency, and we are not confronted with a claim of excited utterance in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-14\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>State v. Vaught </em>(2004), 268 Neb. 316, 682 N.W.2d 284, the court faced a similar <em>Crawford </em>issue in a trial for sexual assault of a minor where the prosecution, over objection, introduced the child\u2019s identification of the defendant made during an examination by an emergency-room physician following a suspected assault. Id. at 316, 682 N.W.2d 284. The defendant appealed the conviction, arguing that the hearsay violated his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment. Id. at 317, 682 N.W.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">{\u00b6 27} The court there held the identification statements nontestimonial and reasoned that \u201c[t]here was no indication of a purpose to develop <em>testimony for trial, </em>nor was there an indication of government involvement in the initiation or course of the examination.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 326, 682 N.W.2d 284. Moreover, the physician obtained both the identification and history for valid medical purposes. These medical justifications mirror those that Markowitz offered in the present case. First, the treating physician in <em>Vaught </em>believed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>it was \u201c \u2018important for a medical professional in the situation he was in to obtain a thorough history regarding the causation and nature of the injury.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 319, 682 N.W.2d 284, quoting <em>State v. Vaught </em>(2003), 12 Neb.App. 306, 310, 672 N.W.2d 262. The physician further testified that he needed the perpetrator\u2019s identity \u201c \u2018both so that he does not release a patient into the care of a perpetrator and for purposes of treating the patient\u2019s mental well-being.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting 12 Neb.App. at 310-311, 672 N.W.2d 262. The court held that admission of the statements did not violate the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights pursuant to <em>Crawford. </em>Id. at 327-328, 682 N.W.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">{\u00b6 28} The court in <em>Vaught </em>reached its decision without adopting a definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d under the Sixth Amendment. 268 Neb. at 325-326, 682 N.W.2d 284. The court reasoned, however, that under any of the definitions, including the broadest \u201creasonable witness\u201d standard, the statements were nontestimonial because the victim made the statements \u2014 and the doctor elicited the statements \u2014 primarily for the purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 29} The Colorado Supreme Court confronted the same issue in a matter involving a child\u2019s statements to a doctor following a sexual assault. <em>People v. Vigil </em>(Colo.2006), 127 P.3d 916. In applying the third <em>Crawford </em>formulation, the court held that \u201c \u2018a statement is testimonial if a reasonable person in the position of the declarant would objectively foresee that his statement might be used in the investigation or prosecution of a crime.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 925, quoting <em>United States v. Summers </em>(C.A.10, 2005), 414 F.3d 1287, 1302. In that case, the police did not conduct the examination, and the doctor did not perform the examination at the police department. Id. From this, the court concluded that \u201cfrom the perspective of an objective witness in the child\u2019s position, it would be reasonable to assume that this examination was only for the purpose of medical diagnosis.\u201d Id. at 926. The court therefore deemed the statement nontestimonial pursuant to <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 30} The Supreme Court of Minnesota, in reinstating a defendant\u2019s conviction for sexually abusing a child, adopted a broader definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d in <em>State v. Bobadilla </em>(Minn.2006), 709 N.W.2d 243, where a social worker took a child\u2019s account of the alleged abuse in a risk-assessment interview. The court held that a declarant makes a testimonial statement if the \u201cdeclarant or government questioner is acting, to a substantial degree, in order to produce a statement for trial.\u201d Id. at 252. This analysis requires a trial court to look at the entirety of the questioning. But even in <em>Bobadilla, </em>the court reasoned that \u201c[i]f part of the purpose of this interview was to produce a statement for use at a future trial, such a purpose was at best incidental to the main purpose: assessing and responding to imminent risks to [the victim\u2019s] health and welfare.\u201d Id. at 255. The court concluded that the interview \u201c \u2018represented] a response to a call for assistance and preliminary determination of \u201cwhat happened\u201d and whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>was immediate danger, rather than an effort to gather evidence for a future trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Wright </em>(Minn.2005), 701 N.W.2d 802, 813-814. The court held that the child\u2019s statements during the risk-assessment interview were nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">{\u00b6 31} Unlike <em>Vigil, Bobadilla </em>further broadens <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>third formulation by accounting for the expectations of the questioner and of the declarant. The prevailing view among jurisdictions defining \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, however, does not account for the expectations of the questioner, except where the expectations could affect the reasonable expectations of a witness. See, e.g., <em>Bray v. Commonwealth </em>(Ky.2005), 177 S.W.3d 741 (applying third <em>Crawford </em>formulation and holding a declarant\u2019s spontaneous utterances to a sibling to be nontestimonial); <em>State v. Mizenko </em>(2006), 330 Mont. 299, 127 P.3d 458 (applying the third <em>Crawford </em>formulation and holding an excited utterance during a 911 call to be nontestimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 32} Federal appellate decisions also apply the third <em>Crawford </em>formulation, focusing on the reasonable expectations of the declarant at the time of the statement. The First Circuit, in <em>Horton v. Allen </em>(C.A.1, 2004), 370 F.3d 75, 84, held as nontestimonial a declarant\u2019s statements during a private conversation because the declarant \u201cdid not make the statements under circumstances in which an objective person would \u2018reasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The court in <em>Horton, </em>like the majority of state court decisions discussed above, focused on the expectation of the declarant in finding the statement nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 33} Similarly, the Second Circuit held in <em>United States v. Saget </em>(C.A.2, 2004), 377 F.3d 223, that where a declarant had engaged in conversations with a confidential informant regarding a gunrunning scheme, the statements to the informant were nontestimonial despite the fact that the informant had performed an inherently prosecutorial or investigative function at the direction of law enforcement. Thus, the court held that the informant\u2019s motives did not affect the expectations of the declarant in making the statement that incriminated the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 34} In reaching this decision, the court in <em>Saget </em>focused on <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>explanation that the three separate formulations \u201c \u2018all share a common nucleus and then define the Clause\u2019s coverage at various levels of abstraction around it.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 229, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. This, <em>Saget </em>reasoned, \u201csuggests that the Court would use the reasonable expectation of the declarant as the anchor of a more concrete definition of testimony.\u201d Id. The court dismissed the fact that the informant had served an obvious prosecutorial function, because a reasonable declarant in the defendant\u2019s position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>would not have expected that his statement to the undercover agent would later be used against him. Id. at 228-229.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">{\u00b6 35} In <em>United States v. Peneaux </em>(C.A.8, 2005), 432 F.3d 882, 896, the Eighth Circuit held a child\u2019s statements to a physician to be nontestimonial because the medical exam served to protect the child\u2019s health, and the interview lacked the \u201c \u2018formality of * * * questioning\u2019 \u201d and the \u201csubstantial \u2018government involvement\u2019 \u201d seen in other cases. Id., quoting <em>United States v. Bordeaux </em>(C.A.8, 2005), 400 F.3d 548, 556. The <em>Peneaux </em>court further opined that \u201c[w]here statements are made to a physician seeking to give medical aid in the form of diagnosis or treatment, they are presumptively nontestimonial.\u201d Id. Thus, federal courts that have considered this issue generally hold that a witness\u2019s reasonable beliefs or expectations determine the testimonial nature of a statement under <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 36} Given our review of the foregoing authority, we adopt the \u201cobjective witness\u201d test in Ohio. For Confrontation Clause purposes, a testimonial statement includes one made \u201cunder circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. In determining whether a statement is testimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes, courts should focus on the expectation of the declarant at the time of making the statement; the intent of a questioner is relevant only if it could affect a reasonable declarant\u2019s expectations. This test conforms to <em>Crawford </em>and is supported by both state and federal authority. This definition also prevents trampling on other portions of hearsay law that <em>Crawford </em>expressly states do not implicate the right to confront witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Stahl\u2019s Propositions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">{\u00b6 37} Stahl presents two propositions of law for our review. Though they are related, we address these propositions separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">{\u00b6 38} Proposition of Law I: \u201cStatements made by an alleged rape victim to a forensic medical examiner are inherently testimonial in nature, whether or not the alleged victim expects the statements to be used in a subsequent prosecution, where the medical examination and interview are intended by prosecuting officials to serve an inherent \u2018investigative and prosecutorial\u2019 function.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">{\u00b6 39} Stahl directs us to several facts in the record that he argues compel our determination that Mazurek\u2019s statements are testimonial. First, Stahl points to the DOVE unit\u2019s mission statement. Stahl argues that the mission statement expressly sets forth that one of the DOVE unit\u2019s primary purposes is to assist law enforcement. Stahl argues that \u201c[t]his fact standing alone makes Ms. Mazurek\u2019s statements inherently \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d While Stahl correctly argues that the DOVE unit, like other emergency rooms, partly serves a prosecutorial function <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>by collecting evidence, this function is at best secondary to the DOVE unit\u2019s primary motivation, the care of its patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">{\u00b6 40} In addition, Stahl fails to establish how this mission statement could possibly affect an objective witness\u2019s expectations regarding the purpose of the examination. Nothing in the record establishes that a reasonable witness in Mazurek\u2019s position would believe that the DOVE unit serves primarily a prosecutorial function or that the DOVE unit even has a mission statement. The mission statement therefore would not affect an objective witness\u2019s expectation when giving an account of an event. Under the facts of this case and the test we adopt today, the mission statement is irrelevant to the issue of Mazurek\u2019s reasonable expectation when giving the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">{\u00b6 41} Stahl also argues that the DOVE unit receives government reimbursement for each medico-legal exam it performs and acts as an agent of the prosecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stahl, however, ignores Markowitz\u2019s unrebutted testimony that \u201c[a]ny program, any emergency department, any Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners program that completes a medico-legal examination with a sexual assault evidence kit has the opportunity to be reimbursed.\u201d Thus, the DOVE unit does not differ in that respect from any other emergency room in Ohio that collects evidence with an approved kit. Again, Stahl fails to demonstrate that a reasonable witness in Mazurek\u2019s position would know about the reimbursement from the Attorney General. Without a witness\u2019s knowledge of that funding, there would be no effect on a witness\u2019s reasonable expectations regarding the purpose of the medical history, the incident history, or the physical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 42} Similarly, Stahl points out that before bringing Mazurek in, Ellis asked Markowitz whether a rape-evidence-collection kit would be useful under the circumstances, arguing that that communication, like the Attorney General funding and the DOVE unit\u2019s mission statement, supports the notion that Mazurek\u2019s statements are testimonial under <em>Crawford </em>because they show the DOVE unit to be an agent of the prosecution. This argument suffers from the same flaw. The principal inquiry under <em>Crawford </em>focuses on the expectations of the declarant. Stahl does not argue, and the record does not support, that Mazurek knew or had reason to know of the communication between Ellis and Markowitz regarding the examination. Any such communication, without Mazurek\u2019s knowledge, could not be relevant in determining her reasonable expectations in submitting to the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>(\u00b6 43} Finally, Stahl asserts that Markowitz\u2019s taking of evidence, which included swabbing for DNA with the help of ultraviolet light, taking pictures of Mazurek\u2019s mouth, and taking a napkin that Mazurek used after the incident, demonstrates the DOVE unit\u2019s prosecutorial purpose and renders Mazurek\u2019s statements testimonial. Emergency rooms routinely perform these procedures, and a witness in this situation could reasonably believe that the DOVE unit\u2019s medical examination, including the incident history statement, serves primarily a medical function.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 44} Proposition of Law II: \u201cStatements made by an alleged rape victim to a forensic medical examiner are testimonial in nature when the alleged victim is informed and consents that any evidence or information gleaned from the examination will be used in the prosecution of the alleged rape; such statements are therefore inadmissible pursuant to <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>if the alleged victim is unavailable to testify at trial and the defense has not had an opportunity to cross-examine her regarding these statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 45} Stahl emphasizes that the language of the consent form, and specifically the phrase \u201cinformation (including protected health information),\u201d demonstrates that a reasonable person in Mazurek\u2019s position would have expected the police to use her statement in the prosecution of the crime. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">{\u00b6 46} As noted, Mazurek gave a statement to Officer Ellis at the police station prior to her appearance at the DOVE unit examination. That statement, given to police, served an inherently prosecutorial function, and it is reasonable to conclude that Mazurek made her statement to Ellis knowing that the police would use it in prosecution of the crime. Having already identified the perpetrator to police, Mazurek could reasonably have assumed that repeating the same information to a nurse or other medical professional served a separate and distinct medical purpose such as those in this ease: determining whether the assailant had any communicable diseases and whether any specified course of treatment might therefore be appropriate, and for purposes of structuring a release plan to determine the likelihood of repeated activity in a residential or community setting. Where the victim of a criminal offense makes a statement to a police officer identifying the accused, and subsequently presents herself for a medical examination for purposes of gathering evidence of the crime and repeats the identification, the latter statement is not made \u201cunder circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u201d because the declarant had previously made the identifying statement to the police. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53,124 S.Ct. 1354,158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">{\u00b6 47} Moreover, the consent form in this case does not refer to statements made by a patient. Rather, it references \u201cevidence, information (including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>protected health information), clothing, colposcope photos, and photography documentation of injuries.\u201d This wording would naturally create a reasonable belief that the DOVE unit will release <em>physical </em>evidence to the police and any information resulting from the physical examination. But to a reasonable person, questioning by a nurse or other medical professional during an emergency-room examination would appear to serve a primarily health-care-related function. The police, to the contrary, routinely take statements for prosecution purposes, and Mazurek had already given a statement to Officer Ellis. Thus, Mazurek could have reasonably believed that although the examination conducted at the DOVE unit would result in scientific evidence being extracted for prosecution purposes, the statement would be used primarily for health-care purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 48} Based upon the foregoing, we hold that Mazurek\u2019s statement to Markowitz was nontestimonial under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, and we affirm the judgment of the Ninth District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b289-8\">Resnick, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"Aen\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and Lanzinger, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b287-8\">. \u201cMedico-legal exam,\u201d as described by Markowitz during the suppression hearing, refers to the entirety of the examination that DOVE routinely performs for trauma victims. This type of examination contains both a medical and a legal component, but parallels that of typical emergency rooms. See R.C. 2907.29.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b289-9\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8N\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">{\u00b6 49} Although I agree that in determining whether a statement is testimonial pursuant to <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, we should focus on the declarant\u2019s expectation concerning the statement\u2019s use, I dissent from the conclusion that the statements at issue were nontestimonial. I would, therefore, reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">{\u00b6 50} Certain facts are important to highlight. After reporting that she had been raped the previous day, Ann Mazurek was taken by Officer Amy Ellis to an Akron hospital\u2019s \u201cDeveloping Options for Violent Emergencies\u201d (\u201cDOVE\u201d) unit, which specializes in health-care services for victims of sexual assault and domestic disturbances. Before she was examined, Mazurek signed a consent form that included the language <em>\u201cI authorize the release of </em>evidence, <em>information </em>(including protected health information), clothing, colposcope photos, and photography documentation of injuries to a law enforcement agency <em>for use only in the investigation and prosecution of this crime.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">{\u00b6 51} The nurse practitioner, who was also the coordinator for victim services at the DOVE program, elicited detailed statements from Mazurek about the alleged crime and the identity of the perpetrator. Although not participating in the questioning, Ellis remained in the room throughout the interview. The nurse conducted a physical examination that included using a colposcope to photograph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Mazurek\u2019s mouth, collecting materials with a forensic evidence-collection kit, and obtaining nail scrapings, oral swabbings, and material retrieved with dental floss. She also used ultraviolet lighting to identify any bodily fluids still present and retrieved a napkin from Mazurek\u2019s coat pocket that Mazurek had used to wipe her face after the incident. The nurse asked whether Mazurek would be safe upon discharge and informed her about follow-up care. It does not appear that a doctor treated, or even saw, Mazurek in the DOVE unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 52} Unfortunately, Mazurek died of causes unrelated to this alleged crime, and she is not available to be cross-examined by Stahl at trial. The United States Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution bars \u201cadmission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">{\u00b6 53} The majority attempts to distinguish <em>Crawford </em>on the basis that this case does not involve police interrogation or <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Miranda </em>warnings are irrelevant, since Mazurek was the alleged victim rather than an accused making the statements. In two recent domestic-violence cases elaborating on the meaning of \u201ctestimonial statements,\u201d the United States Supreme Court suggested that police may act through agents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Davis v. Washington </em>and <em>Hammon v. Indiana </em>(2006), \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. In <em>Davis, </em>the relevant statements were made to a 911 operator and dealt with an ongoing emergency. In <em>Hammon, </em>the statements were made to police as part of an investigation and reported past events. The present reporting of an emergency was held to be nontestimonial; the reporting of past events was testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 54} Although the majority declines to expand the definition of \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d to include statements made to a medical professional for purposes of receiving medical treatment or diagnosis, that is not what occurred. The primary purpose for the police to take Mazurek to the DOVE unit was for collection of evidence, not medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 55} This case is properly analyzed under the \u201creasonable belief\u2019 formulation set forth in <em>Crawford </em>\u2014 that is, \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Under any objective standard, Mazurek reasonably knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>her statement could be used at Stahl\u2019s trial, and the trial court expressly found that she was aware of this fact. She authorized release of \u201cinformation\u201d to police for their prosecution of the crime. The state argues that \u201cstatements\u201d were not specifically mentioned. As the consent form is written, however, the broad term used reasonably includes anything she tells about the event \u2014 \u201cinformation.\u201d Officer Ellis\u2019s taking Mazurek to the DOVE unit after speaking with her and remaining during the signing of the consent form and the answers to questions about the event strengthen the conclusion that Mazurek knew her information would be used to prosecute.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AU2\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Phillip D. Bogdanoff, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b291-11\">Brian M. Pierce, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 56} This is not the case of a crime victim\u2019s statement to a medical provider who is providing diagnosis or treatment. The forensic aspects of the DOVE unit are clear from the precise nature of the nurse\u2019s activities in collecting evidence. The other cases discussed by the majority relating to medical treatment, <em>State v. Vaught </em>(2004), 268 Neb. 316, 682 N.W.2d 284; <em>People v. Vigil </em>(Colo.2006), 127 P.3d 916; <em>State v. Bobadilla </em>(Minn.2006), 709 N.W.2d 243; and <em>United States v. Peneaux </em>(C.A.8, 2005), 432 F.3d 882, are distinguishable, as they all involved child assault victims. It would be reasonable to suppose that from a child\u2019s point of view, any statements were solely for medical diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b6 57} In contrast, it is reasonable to suppose that Mazurek, an adult, expected that her statements, results of tests and examinations, and physical evidence collected \u2014 in short, the \u201cinformation\u201d- \u2014 would be used in the prosecution of her case. She authorized this release to law enforcement for that purpose. In Mazurek\u2019s case, the nurse\u2019s primary purpose was forensic \u2014 no actual medical treatment was provided in the DOVE unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 58} Although the majority speculates about her state of mind, the record, which includes the consent form, leads me to conclude that Mazurek reasonably expected that her statement would be used during trial. Because her statement given at the DOVE unit was testimonial and its admission would violate the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution, I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b291-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Pfeifer, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\">. In <em>Davis, </em>the court noted that if 911 operators are not themselves law-enforcement officers, they may at least be agents of law enforcement when they interrogate 911 callers. Without deciding the point, the court considered the acts of the 911 operators to be acts of the police; whether and when statements made to someone other than law-enforcement personnel are testimonial was not decided. <em>Davis, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. at 2274,165 L.Ed.2d at 224, fn. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
