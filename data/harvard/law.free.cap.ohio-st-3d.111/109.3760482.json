The press accommodates conductive and nonconductive materials, and its safety system adapts to either press setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">{\u00b6 3} Instead of barrier guards or restraints between the operator\u2019s hands and the danger zone, the system relies on an elaborate pressure-sensing system contained in the upper tool holder. The upper tool holder is activated by depressing a covered foot pedal. When the press is running nonconductive material, the sensor releases the downward pressure from the ram. The ram descends and touches the object with under two ounces of pressure. The ram then returns to its upper position and stops. Only by pressing the foot pedal again will the ram descend with force and complete the assembly process. This process may be described as a \u201ctwice-pushed foot pedal system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">{\u00b6 4} According to appellant Industrial Commission of Ohio, the safety system had \u201ca long-standing excellent history of safety.\u201d It effectively relied, however, on the operator\u2019s not hitting the foot pedal a second time before removing the hands from the danger zone. Appellant Gloria Knowles apparently pressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>foot pedal a second time by accident on April 21, 2000, when her hand was crushed as she adjusted a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">{\u00b6 5} After a workers\u2019 compensation claim was allowed, Knowles alleged a violation of specific safety requirements (\u201cVSSR\u201d). The commission found a violation of former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201411(E)(6) (requiring employers to establish \u201cpractices, means or methods\u201d that will prevent the hands or fingers of a hydraulic or pneumatic press operator from \u201centering the danger zone during the operating cycle\u201d). The Court of Appeals for Franklin County, however, in mandamus, held that finding to be an abuse of discretion. Relying on <em>State ex rel. Aspinwall v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 55, 531 N.E.2d 681, and <em>State ex rel. Garza v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 397, 763 N.E.2d 174, cases that stated that the term \u201cduring the operating cycle\u201d meant only during intended press activation, the court held that because the operator did not intend to activate the press, the injury did not occur during the press\u2019s operating cycle, and no VSSR occurred. A writ of mandamus followed, which vacated the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">{\u00b6 6} This cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right. S.Ct.Prac.R. II(1)(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">{\u00b6 7} Former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-ll(E) required that the operator\u2019s hands be kept from the danger zone \u201cduring the operating cycle.\u201d <em>Aspinwall </em>and <em>Garza </em>limited the phrase to intentional press activation. This definition is too restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cOperating cycle\u201d is not defined in the safety code, and the term defies easy interpretation judicially, for any workable definition balances the need for safety with the need for danger-zone accessibility. Because the danger zone is hazardous, the temptation is to say that the zone should be completely inaccessible. With certain types of manufacturing processes, inaccessibility is possible. Many manufacturing and assembly processes, however, require an employee\u2019s hands to, at some point, enter the danger zone. The reasons are many: part insertion or removal, part adjustment, and positioning of sleeves or molds. In this case, Knowles had to align a PEM (a screw-like fastener) with a hole on the bottom tooling.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">{\u00b6 9} It is equally tempting to say that if a press is cycling when a press accident occurs, the press is operating and is therefore in an \u201coperating cycle.\u201d <em>Garza, </em>citing <em>Aspinwall, </em>rejected this logic, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe hidden danger in this approach, however, is that, in effect, it declares that because there was an injury there was <em>by necessity </em>a <em>VSSR </em>\u2014 i.e., someone was injured; therefore, the safety device was inadequate. This violates two workers\u2019 compensation tenets: (1) the commission determines the presence or absence of a violation and (2) all reasonable doubts as to a specific safety requirement\u2019s applicability must be resolved in the employer\u2019s favor. It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>creates two practical problems, because it (1) renders the manufacturing process impossible by preventing claimant\u2019s hands from <em>ever </em>entering the danger zone and (2) conflicts with the safety code\u2019s enumeration of a \u2018two-hand control\u2019 as an acceptable means of protection.\u201d (Emphasis sic; citation omitted.) <em>Garza, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 400, 763 N.E.2d 174.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">{\u00b6 11} From this analysis, the court reasoned that the \u201coperating cycle\u201d is limited to press cycling that is intentionally activated by the operator. Id. at 401, 763 N.E.2d 174. Therefore, VSSR liability is eliminated when the press (1) malfunctions without warning, <em>State ex rel. M.T.D. Prods., Inc. v. Stebbins </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 114, 118, 72 O.O.2d 63, 330 N.E.2d 904, (2) is activated by someone other than the operator, <em>State ex rel. Gentzler Tool &amp; Die Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 103, 105, 18 OBR 137, 480 N.E.2d 397, or (3) is accidentally started by the operator. <em>Garza, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 401, 763 N.E.2d 174. Unfortunately, this last (and current) scenario conflicts with a basic workers\u2019 compensation principle: specific safety requirements are designed to protect employees \u201c \u2018against their own negligence and folly as well as to provide them a safe place to work.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Cotterman v. St. Marys Foundry </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 42, 47, 544 N.E.2d 887, quoting <em>State ex rel. U.S. Steel Corp. v. Cook </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 183,186,10 OBR 254, 461 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">{\u00b6 12} Reviewing <em>Garza </em>four years later, we see flaws in its reasoning, as well as in the reasoning of <em>Aspinwall, </em>which underlies it. We had feared that defining \u201coperating cycle\u201d to include accidental operation would impose strict liability on employers and/or compromise the commission\u2019s discretion to find a VSSR in the appropriate case. These concerns were unwarranted. The commission can deny a VSSR if the safety device experienced a one-time failure or if the press was activated by someone other than the operator (effectively bypassing the safety device). <em>M.T.D. Prods, </em>and <em>Gentzler, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">{\u00b6 13} Including accidental operation within the definition of \u201coperating cycle\u201d does not offend the principle of resolving reasonable doubt as to specific-safety-requirement applicability in the employer\u2019s favor. <em>Cotterman, </em>46 Ohio St.3d at 47, 544 N.E.2d 887, leaves <em>no </em>doubt that specific safety requirements may cover injuries resulting from employees\u2019 negligence or inadvertence. It is not, therefore, legitimate to exclude accidents from the purview of specific safety requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">{\u00b6 14} The safety devices listed in former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-ll(E) that anticipate some necessary insertion of the hands into the danger zone protect the hands from both accidental and intentional operator activation without compromising the assembly process. This includes the two-hand control cited so prominently in both <em>Aspinwall </em>and <em>Garza.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>{\u00b6 15} A two-hand control or tripping device is commonly composed of two separately placed buttons located outside the danger zone, which require continuous simultaneous depression by each hand to cycle the press. <em>Garza, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 401, 763 N.E.2d 174, reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThis protection is designed to work only when the employee <em>deliberately </em>removes his or her hands from the danger zone in order to press the two buttons. Since the code\u2019s authors deemed this to be an acceptable method of protection during the \u2018operating cycle,\u2019 then \u2018operating cycle\u2019 can mean only a cycle that is operator-intended.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">{\u00b6 17} <em>Garza </em>and <em>Aspinwall, </em>however, placed too much importance on the need for intentional conduct in the use of the two-hand control as an approved means of compliance. Rather than reading into the regulatory language regarding two-hand controls a legislative intent to confine \u201coperating cycle\u201d to intentional activity, the better course is to view the language as seeking to ensure that the press cannot cycle with the operator\u2019s hands in the danger zone. <em>Garza </em>states that the safety device is designed to work only when an employee deliberately removes his or her hands from the danger zone to make a part. Id. at 399, 763 N.E.2d 174. <em>Garza, </em>however, overlooks the fact that in requiring the operator to use both hands to press the dual activation buttons, the operator\u2019s hands are necessarily removed from the danger zone. Thus, a two-handed trip also forecloses accidental activation of the press with the operator\u2019s hands in the danger zone. To therefore say that a two-handed trip anticipates protection only when activation is deliberate is not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">{\u00b6 18} In light of these observations, we believe that the time has come to consider abandoning both <em>Aspinwall </em>and <em>Garza, </em>and to do so, we turn to <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, for guidance. <em>Galatis </em>authorizes us to depart from stare decisis and overrule a prior decision when \u201c(1) the decision was wrongly decided at that time, or changes in circumstances no longer justify continued adherence to the decision, (2) the decision defies practical workability, and (3) abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship for those who have relied upon it.\u201d Id., paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">{\u00b6 19} All three elements of <em>Galatis </em>are satisfied. First, <em>Garza </em>and <em>Aspinwall </em>contradict the purpose of specific safety regulations by excluding certain injuries caused by negligence or inadvertence. Second, <em>Garza </em>and <em>Aspinwall </em>defy practical workability because they specifically exclude <em>accidental </em>injuries, although those are the very injuries covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Finally, abandoning the precedent would not create an undue hardship on those who relied upon those cases. To the contrary, it would foster a safer work environment.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A1z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Marshall &amp; Melhorn, L.L.C., Thomas W. Palmer, David L. O\u2019Connell, and Roman Arce, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b203-13\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, Dennis L. Hufstader, and Shawn W.

Grego, for appellant Gloria Knowles.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, we overrule <em>Garza </em>and <em>Aspinwall </em>and hold that the term \u201coperating cycle\u201d in former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-ll(E) encompasses all operator-activated press activity, whether intentional or accidental. Therefore, the commission correctly found that Knowles\u2019s injury, caused by accidental press operation, occurred during the press\u2019s operating cycle. The question then remains as to whether the Haeger press safety system satisfied former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:l-5-ll(E)(6), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAcceptable methods of guarding are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cOther practices, means or methods which will provide safeguards, preventing the hands or fingers of the operator from entering the danger zone during the operating cycle and which are equivalent in result to one of the types specified above.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">{\u00b6 23} We defer to the commission\u2019s expertise and uphold its conclusion that the Haeger press safety system did not provide protection equivalent to the means specified in former Ohio Adm.Code 4121:1 \u2014 5\u201411(E)(1) through (5). The twice-pushed foot-pedal safety system did not make activation impossible with hands in the danger zone, nor did it bar, remove, or otherwise restrict entry of the hands into the danger zone during the operating cycle. The finding of a VSSR in this case was, therefore, not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b203-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b203-11\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-15\">.
