Donnelley &amp; Sons Company for services performed in the production of telephone directories for distribution in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">{\u00b6 2} Ameritech distributed telephone directories to customers in Ohio between March 1, 1996, and December 31, 1998. Ameritech had negotiated a price for the paper for the directories from various paper mills, and those paper mills delivered the paper directly to Donnelley in Illinois. Donnelley then printed the directories for Ameritech and shipped them to Ohio for distribution. Pursuant to a contract between Ameritech and Donnelley, Donnelley also provided \u201cpaper management services\u201d to Ameritech, through which Donnelley ensured that the paper arrived at the printing plant in Illinois at the right time, checked the quality of the paper, and visited the paper mills to ensure that those mills were complying with applicable laws and contracts. The paper mills sent invoices for the paper to Donnelley, which in turn billed Ameritech for the paper and for Donnelley\u2019s paper-management services and printing services. The price that Donnelley billed Ameritech for the paper-management services was 4.04 percent of the cost of the paper used in producing the telephone directories for Ameritech.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">{\u00b6 3} As a result of an audit of Ameritech for the period March 1, 1996, through December 31, 1998, the Tax Commissioner concluded that Ameritech owed more than $218,000 in unpaid use taxes, penalties, and interest charges on the amount that Ameritech had paid Donnelley for paper-management services during the audit period.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-14\">{\u00b6 4} The Tax Commissioner rejected Ameritech\u2019s petition for reassessment, concluding that Ameritech owed use tax on the paper-management fee paid to Donnelley because the service provided by Donnelley was \u201cnot a service independent from the sales of products\u201d to Ameritech. The Board of Tax Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>(\u201cBTA\u201d) affirmed, holding that the fee for services had been \u201cpaid in conjunction with the sale of tangible personal property.\u201d The matter is before this court as an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">{\u00b6 5} In reviewing a BTA decision, this court determines whether that decision is reasonable and lawful. <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783; R.C. 5717.04. We \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d this court will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150,152, 648 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">{\u00b6 6} It is the taxpayer\u2019s burden to prove \u201cthe manner and extent of the error in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.\u201d <em>Stds. Testing Laboratories, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 240, 2003-Ohio-5804, 797 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b6 30. A statute granting an exemption from taxation \u201cmust be strictly construed,\u201d and a taxpayer \u201cmust affirmatively establish his or her right\u201d to the exemption. <em>Campus Bus Serv. v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-1915, 786 N.E.2d 889, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 5741.02(A) levies a tax on \u201cthe storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property or the benefit realized in this state of any service provided.\u201d The consumer that realizes the benefit of a service is liable for use tax on the price of that service. R.C. 5741.02(B). Under R.C. 5741.01(M) and 5739.01(X), however, the only services taxable in Ohio are those denoted in R.C. 5739.01(B)(3), and during the audit period, neither printing services nor paper-management services were listed. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 215 (\u201cH.B. 215\u201d), 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 909, 1802-1803; Am.Sub.S.B. No. 266 (\u201cS.B. 266\u201d), 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, 10735, 10737-10738.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">{\u00b6 8} In contrast, the use of most tangible personal property is subject to the Ohio use tax, and that tax applies to both the use of paper and the use of printed materials. See R.C. 5739.02 (sales tax is \u201clevied on each retail sale made in this state\u201d); R.C. 5741.02(C)(2) (providing that the use tax does not apply to an acquisition of tangible personal property or services that \u201cwould be a sale not subject to the [sales] tax imposed by sections 5739.01 to 5739.31 of the Revised Code\u201d); R.C. 5739.01(B)(1) (\u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 include * * * [a]ll transactions by which title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property, is or is to be transferred\u201d); R.C. 5739.01(B)(4) (\u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 include * * * [a]ll transactions by which printed, imprinted, overprinted, lithographic, multilithic, blueprinted, photostatic, or other productions or reproductions of written or graphic matter are or are to be furnished or transferred\u201d); R.C. 5739.01(B)(5) (\u201c \u2018Sale\u2019 and \u2018selling\u2019 include * * * [t]he production or fabrication of tangible personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>property for a consideration for consumers who furnish either directly or indirectly the materials used in the production of fabrication work\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">{\u00b6 9} Donnelley purchased paper on Ameritech\u2019s behalf and produced telephone directories for Ameritech by transforming raw materials into a finished product. Donnelley then transferred possession of the finished product to Ameritech in Ohio. That transaction was a \u201csale\u201d as that term is defined in R.C. 5739.01(B). We must decide whether the 4.04 percent paper-management fee that Donnelley charged Ameritech when it sold the paper to Ameritech should be treated as part of the price of the paper itself. See R.C. 5739.025 (imposing use tax on the \u201cprice\u201d that is paid).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">{\u00b6 10} The version of R.C. 5739.01(H)(1) in effect during the audit period defined \u201cprice\u201d for sales- and use-tax purposes as \u201cthe aggregate value in money of anything paid or delivered * * * in the complete performance of a retail sale, without any deduction on account of the cost of the property sold, cost of materials used, labor or service cost * * * or any other expense.\u201d H.B. 215, 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 1807 and S.B. 266,146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, at 10742. Thus, the price for a product produced and sold by a vendor is the full amount paid for that product, including any charges for services rendered by the vendor in the production of the finished product. Accordingly, the paper-management fee that Ameritech paid Donnelley was part of the price of the paper. That fee was designed to compensate Donnelley for its efforts to ensure that the correct quantity and quality of paper arrived timely at Donnelley\u2019s printing plant so that Donnelley could print the telephone directories and ship them to Ameritech in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">{\u00b6 11} Ameritech maintains that the paper-management fee should not be included as part of the price of the paper for use-tax purposes, because the statutory language excludes from the definition of \u201csale\u201d and \u201cselling\u201d \u2014 and therefore excludes from the sales and use tax \u2014 any \u201cpersonal service transactions which involve the transfer of tangible personal property as an inconsequential element, for which no separate charges are made.\u201d R.C. 5739.01(B)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">{\u00b6 12} We have held that \u201c[i]n a * * * personal service transaction in which the charge for the services is not separated from the charge for the property, if the overriding purpose of the purchaser is to obtain tangible personal property produced by the service, the transfer of the property is a consequential element of the transaction and the entire transaction is taxable. If the purchaser\u2019s overriding purpose is to receive the service, the transfer of the personal property is an inconsequential element of the transaction, and the entire transaction is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>taxable.\u201d <em>Emery Industries, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 134, 539 N.E.2d 608, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cPersonal service\u201d as used in R.C. 5739.01(B)(5) means \u201cany intellectual or manual act involving a recognized skill performed by a person who is specifically engaged by the purchaser to perform the act.\u201d Id. at 136, 539 N.E.2d 608. Even if the paper-management service that Donnelley provided was a \u201cpersonal service\u201d under R.C. 5739.01(B)(5), Ameritech still must demonstrate that the transfer of tangible personal property here was an inconsequential element of the transaction by showing that the overriding purpose of the transfer was not to obtain the property but to receive the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">{\u00b6 14} The transfer of the directories to Ameritech from Donnelley cannot be described as an inconsequential element of the transactions between those two companies. The production of telephone directories and the transfer of those tangible objects was the very purpose of the business relationship between Donnelley and Ameritech, as their contract makes clear. The paper-management services that Donnelley provided under that contract were intended to facilitate the efficient production of high-quality bound books for Ameritech. There is nothing inconsequential about the transfer of those books to Ameritech; the R.C. 5739.01(B)(5) exclusion does not apply to the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">{\u00b6 15} The fact that Donnelley listed the 4.04 percent paper-management fee separately from the price of the paper itself on the invoices sent to Ameritech does not change this conclusion. The fee was part of the \u201caggregate value * * * paid\u201d by Ameritech in return for Donnelley\u2019s delivery of the paper, and it was therefore part of the price of that paper under former R.C. 5739.01(H)(1), even though listed separately on the invoices.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">{\u00b6 16} To be sure, the version of R.C. 5739.01(H)(1) in effect during the audit period required vendors to list any \u201ccharge for tangible personal property\u201d separately from any charge for \u201cproviding a service\u201d so that the sales tax could be \u201ccorrectly computed and charged.\u201d H.B. 215, 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 1808; S.B. 266, 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, at 10742. That language has no relevance in this case because \u201cproviding a service\u201d as defined during the audit period by R.C. 5741.01(M), 5739.01(X), and former R.C. 5739.01(B)(3) did not include providing paper-management services. Ameritech was not required under former R.C. 5739.01(H)(1) to separately state the charge for paper-management services, and listing the charges for those \u201cservices\u201d separately from charges for tangible, personal property did not carry any talismanic significance for sales- or use-tax purposes under R.C. 5739.01(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">{\u00b6 17} The fee for the paper-management services performed by Donnelley compensated Donnelley for the \u201clabor or service cost\u201d associated with \u201cthe complete performance\u201d of Donnelley\u2019s contractual promise to deliver paper to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Ameritech. See former R.C. 5739.01(H)(1), H.B. 215, 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, at 1807 and S.B. 266, 146 Ohio Laws, Part VI, at 10742. Because sales or use tax is collected on the full price of retail sales under R.C. 5739.025, Ameritech owes use tax on the total amount paid to Donnelley, including the 4.04 percent fee.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqMA\">Jones Day, Maryann B.
