Smith filed a motion to suppress evidence found in his car and in an apartment. The search of the car and the apartment arose from an anonymous tip to police. The evidence that was the subject of the suppression motion formed the basis of the state\u2019s case against Smith. After the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas denied Smith\u2019s motion, he entered a plea of no contest to the charges against him. The common pleas court found Smith guilty of the charges and sentenced him to eight years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-17\">{\u00b6 3} On appeal, the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County reversed Smith\u2019s convictions and remanded the cause for further proceedings. <em>State v. Smith, </em>163 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Ohio App.3d 567, 2005-Ohio-5204, 839 N.E.2d 451. The court of appeals concluded that the anonymous tip that led to the discovery of the state\u2019s evidence against Smith was unreliable and did not create either reasonable suspicion necessary to stop Smith\u2019s car or probable cause to search his car and an apartment. Id. at \u00b6 18. The court of appeals thus held that the trial court erred in denying Smith\u2019s suppression motion. Id. at \u00b6 24. The state then appealed from the court of appeals\u2019 judgment to this court. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1474, 2006-Ohio-665, 842 N.E.2d 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 4} On October 26, 2005, the common pleas court conducted a hearing to set a new bond pending this court\u2019s determination of the state\u2019s appeal. Smith requested that he be released on his own recognizance, while the state opposed any bond, contending that it had a strong case on appeal. The trial court set a bond of \u201c$500,000 NO 10%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 5} On October 27, 2005, Smith filed a petition in the court of appeals for a writ of habeas corpus to compel appellant, Hamilton County Sheriff Simon Leis Jr., to release him at a reduced bail. Smith claimed that he was indigent and unable to post bail. Sheriff Leis filed a motion to dismiss the petition based on his claim that the bail was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 6} On November 16, 2005, the court of appeals granted the writ and ordered that Smith \u201cbe released pending the disposition of a new trial upon execution of a $50,000 bail as set forth in Crim.R. 46(A)(2) or (3).\u201d The court held that the trial court\u2019s bail of \u201c$500,000 NO 10%\u201d was tantamount to an impermissible, unconstitutional cash-only bail. <em>Smith v. Leis, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 309, 2005-Ohio-5125, 835 N.E.2d 5, syllabus (\u201cCash-only bail is unconstitutional under Section 9, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and is not authorized by either Crim.R. 46 or R.C. 2937.222\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 7} On November 23, 2005, Sheriff Leis applied for reconsideration of the November 16, 2005 judgment granting the writ of habeas corpus. In his application, Sheriff Leis claimed that the trial court\u2019s bail of \u201c$500,000 NO 10%\u201d was appropriate and was not tantamount to cash-only bail. Smith filed a memorandum in response in which he requested that the court of appeals modify its November 16, 2005 judgment so that he be granted a recognizance bond. The state also appealed the November 16, 2005 judgment granting the writ to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 8} On February 3, 2006, the court of appeals granted Sheriff Leis\u2019s motion for reconsideration and specified that it had mistakenly treated the trial court\u2019s \u201cNO 10%\u201d condition as a cash-only bail. <em>Smith v. Leis, </em>165 Ohio App.3d 581, 2006-Ohio-450, 847 N.E.2d 485, \u00b6 20. The court of appeals nevertheless held that Smith should be released on his own recognizance because Smith would have been entitled to release on recognizance under Crim.R. 12(K), \u201c[i]f the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>had suppressed the evidence, <em>which we held that it should have done.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">{\u00b6 9} On February 22, 2006, we declined to accept for review the state\u2019s discretionary appeal of the judgment reversing the trial court\u2019s suppression ruling. <em>State v. Smith, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1474, 2006-Ohio-665, 842 N.E.2d 1053. On February 27, 2006, we dismissed, for want of prosecution, Sheriff Leis\u2019s appeal of the November 16, 2005 grant of the writ of habeas corpus. <em>Smith v. Leis, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 1481, 2006-Ohio-854, 843 N.E.2d 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 10} On March 8, 2006, the trial court dismissed the criminal charges against Smith for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 11} On March 20, 2006, Sheriff Leis filed this appeal from the court of appeals\u2019 February 3 decision on reconsideration, which granted the writ of habeas corpus and ordered Smith released on his own recognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 12} We dismiss this appeal as moot for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">{\u00b6 13} Smith has been released from custody and no criminal charges are now pending against him. Therefore, even if Sheriff Leis\u2019s claim on appeal has merit, it could not result in Smith\u2019s incarceration. The objective of the state\u2019s resistance to bail was to keep Smith in prison while its discretionary appeal from the reversal of the trial court\u2019s suppression decision was pending in this court. Once we declined to accept that appeal for review, the state\u2019s reason to keep Smith incarcerated ceased to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 14} Moreover, the issue raised by Sheriff Leis in this appeal does not raise a substantial constitutional question or other matter of great public or general interest. Cf. <em>Smith v. Leis, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 309, 2005-Ohio-5125, 835 N.E.2d 5, \u00b6 15 (propriety of cash-only bail raises a debatable constitutional issue and is of great public or general interest because it affects the types of bail that trial courts are authorized to grant in criminal cases throughout the state). The issue raised here \u2014 whether a reviewing court can order the release of a criminal defendant on his own recognizance, after it has reversed a trial court\u2019s decision denying a motion to suppress and thus rendered the state\u2019s proof so weak that any possibility of effective prosecution has been destroyed \u2014 is much more limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">{\u00b6 15} Finally, this is not an issue that is capable of repetition yet evading review. \u201cThis exception applies when the challenged action is too short in duration to be fully litigated before its cessation or expiration, and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dispatch Printing Co. v. Louden </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 61, 64, 741 N.E.2d 517. If the state sought and obtained a stay of an appellate court\u2019s judgment granting a writ of habeas corpus in these unique circumstances, the challenged action could be fully litigated before its cessation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Further, there is no reasonable expectation that the sheriff will be subject to the same action, which would arise only under the same unique circumstances presented in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aej\">Rubenstein &amp; Thurman, L.P.A., Inc., and Scott A. Rubenstein, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b586-9\">Joseph T. Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Phillip R. Cummings, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 16} Based on the foregoing discussion, we dismiss this appeal as moot. The criminal charges against Smith were dismissed before the sheriff filed this appeal, and the case does not fall within a recognized exception to the general doctrine. This is consistent with well-settled precedent that we will not indulge in advisory opinions. <em>State ex rel. White v.
