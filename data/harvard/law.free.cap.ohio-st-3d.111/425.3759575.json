Watkins</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">{\u00b6 2} On February 27, 1998, the Allen County Court of Common Pleas convicted petitioner Thomas B. Watkins of aggravated robbery (a felony of the first degree) with a firearm specification and sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of seven years. The trial court\u2019s sentencing entry included the following postrelease-control language:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cThe Court has further notified the defendant that post release control is optional in this case up to a maximum of FIVE (5) years, as well as, the consequences for violating conditions of post release control imposed by the Parole Board under R.C. 2967.28. The defendant is ordered to serve as part of this sentence any term of postrelease control imposed by the Parole Board, and any prison term for violation of that post release control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">John Warren Ivy</p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\">{\u00b6 4} In June 1998, after petitioner John Warren Ivy was convicted of two counts of aggravated robbery (a felony of the first degree) with a firearm specification for one count, the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas sentenced Ivy to an aggregate prison term of six years. The trial court included the following language regarding postrelease control in its sentencing entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-17\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cFollowing the defendant\u2019s release from prison, the defendant will/may serve a period of post-release control under the supervision of the parole board;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-18\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cShould the defendant violate any post-release control sanction or any law, the adult parole board may impose a more restrictive sanction. The parole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>board may increase the length of the post-release control. The parole board could impose an additional nine (9) months prison term for each violation for a total of up to fifty percent (50%) of the original sentence imposed by the court. If the violation of the sanction is a felony, in addition to being prosecuted and sentenced for the new felony, the defendant may receive from the court a prison term for the violation of the post-release control itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Joseph Lavun Ramey</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 7} On February 28, 1997, after petitioner Joseph Lavun Ramey was convicted of two counts of aggravated robbery (a felony of the first degree) with a firearm specification on one count, the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas sentenced Ramey to an aggregate prison term of eight years. The trial court included the identical postrelease-control language in Ramey\u2019s sentencing entry that it had included in Ivy\u2019s sentencing entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Johnny Streeter</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 8} On March 9, 2005, after petitioner Johnny Streeter was convicted of intimidation (a felony of the third degree), the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas sentenced him to one year in prison. The trial court included the following postrelease-control language in its sentencing entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe court has further notified the defendant that post release control is (mandatory/optional) in this case up to a maximum of (3/5) years, as well as the consequences for violating conditions of post release control imposed by the Parole Board under Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2967.28. The defendant is ordered to serve as part of this sentence any term of post release control imposed by the Parole Board, and any prison term for violation of that post release control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">William A. Maddox</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">{\u00b6 10} On February 28, 2000, after petitioner William A. Maddox was convicted of sexual battery (a felony of the third degree), the Highland County Court of Common Pleas sentenced him to three years in prison. The trial court included the following postrelease-control language in its sentencing entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe Court, in imposing this sentence, finds pursuant to Sections 2929.11 to 2929.19 ORC, * * * that defendant is subject to post-release control which is (mandatory/optional) for up to (three/five) years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">Darnelle A. Moore</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">{\u00b6 12} On April 2, 1999, after petitioner Darnelle A. Moore was convicted of robbery (a felony of the third degree), the Lake County Court of Common Pleas sentenced him to three years in prison. The trial court included the following postrelease-control language in its sentencing entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe Court has further notified the defendant that post release control is optional in this case up to a maximum of 3 years, as well as the consequences for violating conditions of post release control imposed by the Parole Board under Revised Code section 2967.28. The defendant is ordered to serve as part of this sentence any term of post release control imposed by the Parole Board, and any prison term for violation of that post release control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Jerry L. McGlone</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 14} On March 13, 2003, the Scioto County Court of Common Pleas convicted petitioner Jerry L. McGlone of burglary (a felony of the third degree), breaking and entering (a felony of the fifth degree), receiving stolen property (a felony of the fourth degree), and forgery (a felony of the fifth degree), and sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of three and one-half years. The trial court included the identical postrelease-control language used by the trial court in Moore\u2019s sentencing entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Jam\u00f3n K. Gaskins</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">{\u00b6 15} On August 13, 2002, after petitioner Jam\u00f3n K. Gaskins was convicted of two counts of trafficking in crack cocaine (a felony of the second degree) with a specification that he had committed the offense within 100 feet of a juvenile on one count, the Clark County Court of Common Pleas sentenced Gaskins to an aggregate prison term of two years. The trial court included language regarding postrelease control that is identical to the language used by the trial courts in the sentencing entries for Moore and McGlone.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Arlene Bowling</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">{\u00b6 16} On November 17, 1998, after petitioner Arlene Bowling was convicted of burglary (a felony of the second degree), the Greene County Court of Common Pleas sentenced her to three years of community control. In the sentencing entry, the trial court included the following language regarding community control and postrelease control:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cViolation of this sentence may lead to a longer or more restrictive sanction for defendant, up to and including a prison term of up to 3 years. Defendant is notified that if a prison term is imposed for violation of community control, the Parole Board may extend prison time up to <em>lk </em>of the stated prison term in 15, 30, 60, or 90 day increments for certain violations committed while in prison. After prison release, if post release control is imposed, for violation of post release control conditions, the Adult Parole Authority or Parole Board could impose a more restrictive or longer control sanction, or return defendant to prison for up to nine months for each violation, up to a maximum of /\u00a3 of the stated prison term. If the violation is a new felony, defendant may receive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>prison term of the greater of one year of the time remaining on post release control, in addition to any other prison term imposed for the new offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 18} On June 14, 2000, the trial court found that Bowling had violated the community control and sentenced her to three years in prison. The trial court did not include any term of postrelease control in this sentencing entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Michael E. Abbott</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 19} On March 30, 2000, the Noble County Court of Common Pleas convicted petitioner Michael E. Abbott of gross sexual imposition (a felony of the third degree) and sentenced him to three years in prison. The trial court included postrelease-control language comparable to that used by the trial court in Bowling\u2019s initial sentencing entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Paul D. McGowan III</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 20} On June 11, 2002, the Marion County Court of Common Pleas convicted petitioner Paul D. McGowan III of burglary (a felony of the third degree) and sentenced him to two years in prison. The trial court included the following postrelease-control language in its sentencing entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cThe defendant may be subject to a period of three (3) years of post-release control by the parole board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cDuring any period of post-release control, the Defendant will be under the supervision of the Adult Parole Authority which will require the Defendant to comply with one or more post-release control sanctions. In the event the Defendant violates a post-release control sanction, the parole board may then impose a more restrictive post-release control sanction, and may increase the duration, or period, of the post-release control subject to a statutory maximum. The more restrictive sanction that the parole board may impose may consist of a prison term, provided that the prison term cannot exceed nine months and the maximum cumulative prison term imposed for all violations during the period of post-release control cannot exceed one-half of the stated prison term originally imposed. If the violation of the post-release control sanction is a felony, the Defendant may be prosecuted for the new felony and, in addition to any sentence the court imposes for the new felony, the court may also impose a prison term for the violation, subject to the statutory maximum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">Jamie Kearns</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">{\u00b6 23} On August 23, 2000, after petitioner Jamie Kearns was convicted of corruption of a minor (a felony of the fourth degree) and burglary (a felony of the fourth degree), the Butler County Court of Common Pleas sentenced him to an aggregate prison term of two years and ten months. The trial court included the following postrelease-control language in its sentencing entry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe Court has further notified the defendant that post release control is optional in this case up to a maximum of 3 years, as well as the consequences for violating conditions of post release control imposed by the Parole Board under Revised Code Section 2967.28. The defendant is ordered to serve as part of this sentence any term of postrelease control imposed by the Parole Board, and any prison term for violation of that post release control.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Actions of the Adult Parole Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 25} According to the parties, all of the petitioners were released from their original prison sentences and placed on postrelease control, were found to have violated the terms of that control by the Adult Parole Authority and respondent, Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Director Terry Collins, and were resentenced to prison. The petitioners are currently incarcerated. The scheduled release dates for the petitioners under the Parole Authority\u2019s decisions are as follows: Watkins (Nov. 26, 2006), Ivy (Mar. 17, 2007), Ramey (Nov. 29, 2006), Streeter (Dec. 8, 2006), Maddox (Mar. 23, 2007), Moore (Apr. 7, 2007), McGlone (Feb. 22, 2007), Gaskins (Jan. 16, 2007), Bowling (Jan. 23, 2007), Abbott (Feb. 3, 2007), McGowan (Dec. 27, 2006), and Kearns (Nov. 22, 2006). www.drc. state.oh.us/offendersearch.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Federal District Court Case</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 26} The petitioners are members of a plaintiff class in a pending federal class action, <em>Hernandez v. Wilkinson </em>(N.D.Ohio filed Jan. 24, 2006), No. 1:06-CV-158, 2006 WL 500042. In that case, the federal district court has certified a class described as \u201c[a]ll persons who have been subjected to postrelease control in Ohio between January 24, 2004 and the present.\u201d The class-action plaintiffs seek to be restored to the status they would have held if postrelease control had not been imposed. The federal district court issued a remedial order in which the parties agreed that the class members who did not have postrelease control incorporated into their sentencing entries were entitled to relief. The parties have not yet agreed on the proper disposition of challenges to postrelease control by those plaintiffs who were subject to mandatory postrelease control but whose sentencing entries incorrectly indicated that postrelease control was conditional.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">Habeas Corpus</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">{\u00b6 27} On August 31, 2006, petitioners filed this action for a writ of habeas corpus to compel Collins to immediately release them from prison. Petitioners claim that they are entitled to the writ because they failed to receive adequate notice of postrelease control and their sentencing entries failed to incorporate adequate notice of postrelease control into their sentences. The parties have stipulated to the facts set forth in the petition. Petitioners did not attach a verification to their petition, swearing to the truth of the allegations. Petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>did attach copies of their trial court sentencing entries but did not attach copies of the Parole Authority decisions imposing the postrelease-control sanctions that are the cause of their current incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 28} On September 7, 2006, we allowed the writ and ordered Collins to file a return within three days of service of the petition. <em>Watkins v. </em>Collins, 110 Ohio St.3d 1477, 2006-Ohio-4578, 853 N.E.2d 672. On September 14, Collins submitted a return. On September 18, petitioners filed their response to the return.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 29} This cause is now before us for our consideration of the petition, the return, and the response.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Commitment-Paper and Verification Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 30} R.C. 2725.04(D) requires that copies of the commitment papers be attached to the petition for a writ of habeas corpus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cA copy of the commitment or cause of detention of such person shall be exhibited, if it can be procured without impairing the efficiency of the remedy; or, if the imprisonment or detention is without legal authority, such fact must appear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-10\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThese commitment papers are necessary for a complete understanding of the petition. Without them, the petition is fatally defective. When a petition is presented to a court that does not comply with R.C. 2725.04(D), there is no showing of how the commitment was procured and there is nothing before the court on which to make a determined judgment except, of course, the bare allegations of petitioner\u2019s application.\u201d <em>Bloss v. Rogers </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 145, 146, 602 N.E.2d 602.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">{\u00b6 33} R.C. 2725.04 also requires that the petition be verified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-12\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cApplication for the writ of habeas corpus shall be by petition, signed and verified either by the party for whose relief it is intended, or by some person for him * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">{\u00b6 35} For purposes of R.C. 2725.04, \u201c \u2018[v]erification\u2019 means a \u2018formal declaration made in the presence of an authorized officer, such as a notary public, by which one swears to the truth of the statements in the document.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chari v. Vore </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 744 N.E.2d 763, quoting Garner, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 1556.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">{\u00b6 36} The habeas corpus petition here did not contain any copies of the Adult Parole Authority decisions that resulted in the petitioners\u2019 current confinement. Nor does the petition include any sworn statement verifying the allegations of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-15\">{\u00b6 37} In general, a habeas corpus petition that fails to comply with the commitment-paper and verification requirements of R.C. 2725.04 is fatally defec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tive and is subject to dismissal. <em>State ex rel. McCuller v. Callahan, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 307, 2003-Ohio-858, 784 N.E.2d 108, \u00b6 4; <em>Hawkins v. S. Ohio Correctional Facility, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 299, 2004-Ohio-2893, 809 N.E.2d 1145, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 38} Nevertheless, the petition here includes a stipulation of the parties agreeing to all the pertinent facts, including that \u201c[e]ach and every Petitioner is currently detained in an Ohio prison, serving a sanction imposed by Respondent for violating the terms of his/her postrelease control.\u201d Therefore, because the stipulated facts as well as the sentencing entries included in the petition are sufficient for a complete understanding of the petitioners\u2019 habeas corpus claim, we refrain from invoking our general rules requiring dismissal and proceed to address the merits of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Habeas Corpus Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA writ of habeas corpus is warranted in certain extraordinary circumstances \u2018where there is an unlawful restraint of a person\u2019s liberty and there is no adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson v. Timmerman Cooper </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 614, 616, 757 N.E.2d 1153, quoting <em>Pegan v. Crawmer </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 97, 99, 666 N.E.2d 1091. \u201c \u2018Like other extraordinary-writ actions, habeas corpus is not available when there is an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Bradshaw, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 50, 2006-Ohio-1829, 845 N.E.2d 516, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>In re Complaint for Writ of Habeas Corpus for Goeller, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 427, 2004-Ohio-5579, 816 N.E.2d 594, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">{\u00b6 40} Generally, \u201c[sentencing errors by a court that had proper jurisdiction cannot be remedied by extraordinary writ\u201d because the petitioner \u201chas or had adequate remedies in the ordinary course of law, e.g., appeal and postconviction relief, for review of any alleged sentencing error.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Jaffal v. Calabrese, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 440, 2005-Ohio-2591, 828 N.E.2d 107, \u00b6 5. In accordance with this general rule, \u201c[w]e have consistently held that sentencing errors are not jurisdictional and are not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Majoros v. Collins </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 442, 443, 596 N.E.2d 1038, and cases cited therein; see, also, <em>Smith v. Walker </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 431, 432, 700 N.E.2d 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 41} With these guides in mind, we next consider the petitioners\u2019 habeas claim, which challenges the authority of the Adult Parole Authority to place them on postrelease control and sanction them for violations of that control in the absence of appropriate language in their sentencing entries.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">Postrelease-Control Language In Sentencing Entries</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">{\u00b6 42} R.C. 2967.28 governs postrelease control. Under R.C. 2967.28, \u201c[e]ach sentence to a prison term for a felony of the first degree, for a felony of the second degree, for a felony sex offense, or for a felony of the third degree that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>not a felony sex offense and in the commission of which the offender caused or threatened to cause physical harm to a person shall include a requirement that the offender be subject to a period of post-release control imposed by the parole board after the offender\u2019s release from imprisonment.\u201d The terms for this mandatory postrelease control are either three or five years. R.C. 2967.28(B)(1)-(3). According to the parties, each of the petitioners was subject to a mandatory term of postrelease control based upon their convictions. Nevertheless, the language of their trial court sentencing entries mistakenly included some discretionary language concerning their terms of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 43} The petitioners claim that by misrepresenting the mandatory nature of their postrelease control, the trial courts never properly imposed such control and that they therefore could not be imprisoned by the Parole Authority and Collins for violating that control. Petitioners rely on the court\u2019s opinions in Woods <em>v. Telb </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 504, 733 N.E.2d 1103; <em>State v. Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864; <em>Hernandez v. Kelly, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-Ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, and <em>Gensley v. Eberlin, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1474, 2006-Ohio-4474, 853 N.E.2d 313, to support their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 44} In Woods, we held, \u201cPursuant to R.C. 2967.28(B) and (C), a trial court must inform the defendant at sentencing or at the time of a plea hearing that post-release control is part of the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d 89 Ohio St.3d 504, 733 N.E.2d 1103, at paragraph two of the syllabus. \u201cBecause the record clearly indicates that the petitioner was advised of discretionary post-release control both in his signed plea form and in his sentencing entry, we find no violation of the separation of powers doctrine in this case.\u201d Id. at 513, 733 N.E.2d 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Jordan, </em>we held, in consolidated appeals from criminal convictions, \u201cWhen sentencing a felony offender to a term of imprisonment, a trial court is required to notify the offender at the sentencing hearing about postrelease control and is further required to incorporate that notice into its journal entry imposing sentence.\u201d 104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864, at paragraph one of the syllabus. \u201cAccordingly, if a trial court has decided to impose a prison term upon a felony offender, it is duty-bound to notify that offender at the sentencing hearing about postrelease control and to incorporate postrelease control into its sentencing entry, which thereby empowers the executive branch of government to exercise its discretion.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 22. The remedy for improper notification about postrelease control at the sentencing hearing is resentencing \u2014 not release from prison. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 46} Neither Woods nor <em>Jordan </em>entitles the petitioners to release from prison. Those cases focused on whether the offenders were properly notified about postrelease control at their sentencing hearings. There was no dispute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>regarding the language incorporated into the sentencing entries. Here, while not specifying the postrelease control as mandatory, the trial courts did at least notify the petitioners at their sentencing hearings that they could be subject to postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">{\u00b6 47} Respondent also relies on the Woods and <em>Jordan </em>sentencing entries, but that reliance is not particularly helpful in assessing the petitioners\u2019 claims. The sentencing entries in <em>Woods </em>and in one of the cases consolidated for review in <em>Jordan </em>involved discretionary instead of mandatory postrelease control, so conditional language was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">{\u00b6 48} Petitioners\u2019 citation of <em>Hernandez, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-Ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, and <em>Gensley, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1474, 2006-Ohio-4474, 853 N.E.2d 313, is more relevant. In these cases as well as in the court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Adkins v. Wilson, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1454, 2006-Ohio-4275, 852 N.E.2d 749, we granted writs of habeas corpus and ordered the immediate release of petitioners who were incarcerated following the Parole Authority\u2019s imposition of a postrelease-control sanction of imprisonment because the petitioners\u2019 trial court sentencing entries did not impose a term of postrelease control. In <em>Hernandez, </em>the sentencing entry contained no reference to postrelease control. In <em>Adkins, </em>the sentencing entry did not contain any reference to postrelease control, and we, in effect, held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to issue a nunc pro tunc entry adding postrelease control to the sentence after Adkins\u2019s original sentence had expired. In addition, following <em>Hernandez, </em>Adkins\u2019s trial court issued two entries specifically ordering the Parole Authority to terminate his postrelease-control sanction. In <em>Gensley, </em>the sole reference to postrelease control in the sentencing entry was a vague statement that Gensley understood the possibility of postrelease control.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">{\u00b6 49} In <em>Hernandez, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-Ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, at \u00b6 20, we emphasized the statement from <em>Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 19, that \u201cunless a trial court includes postrelease control in its sentence, the Adult Parole Authority is without authority to impose it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 50} By contrast, the sentencing entries for the petitioners here specified that postrelease control was, at a minimum, discretionary and was part of their sentences. For example, the trial courts stated that petitioners Watkins, Street-er, Moore, McGlone, Gaskins, and Kearns were \u201cordered to serve as part of this sentence any term of post release control imposed by the Parole Board, and any prison term for violation of that post release control.\u201d The sentencing entries for petitioners Ivy and Ramey stated that \u201c[following the defendant\u2019s release from prison, the defendant will/may serve a period of post-release control under the supervision of the parole board.\u201d For petitioner Maddox, the sentencing entry likewise provided that \u201cdefendant is subject to post-release control which is (mandatory/optional) for up to (three/five) years.\u201d The sentencing entry for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>petitioner McGowan stated that he \u201cmay be subject to a period of three (3) years of post-release control by the parole board.\u201d Finally, for petitioners Bowling and Abbott, the trial court sentencing entries stated that \u201cif post release control is imposed, for violation of post release control conditions, the Adult Parole Authority or Parole Board could * * * return defendant to prison * *</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 51} While these entries erroneously refer to discretionary instead of mandatory postrelease control, they contain significantly more information than any of the sentencing entries held insufficient by the court in <em>Hernandez </em>(no reference to postrelease control), <em>Adkins </em>(no reference to postrelease control), and <em>Gensley </em>(vague reference about petitioner\u2019s understanding of possible penalties). Consequently, the sentencing entries are sufficient to afford notice to a reasonable person that the courts were authorizing postrelease control as part of each petitioner\u2019s sentence. A reasonable person in the position of any of the petitioners would have had sufficient notice that postrelease control could be imposed following the expiration of the person\u2019s sentence. Any challenge to the propriety of the sentencing court\u2019s imposition of postrelease control in the entries could have been raised on appeal. The same could not be said about the sentencing entries at issue in <em>Hernandez, Adkins, </em>and <em>Gensley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 52} This conclusion is consistent with the preeminent purpose of R.C. 2967.28 that offenders subject to postrelease control know at sentencing that their liberty could continue to be restrained after serving their initial sentences. Cf. <em>Hernandez, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-Ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, \u00b6 31 (\u201cIn this case, neither the trial judge, the prosecutor, nor the defense counsel advised the defendant at the hearing, or in a journal entry, that his liberty would continue to be restrained after he served his sentence. That omission violated not only the statute, but the spirit of the changes in criminal sentencing underlying Senate Bill 2 [146 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7136]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 53} The petitioners\u2019 sentencing entries, although they mistakenly included wording that suggested that imposition of postrelease control was discretionary, contained sufficient language to authorize the Adult Parole Authority to exercise postrelease control over the petitioners. Consequently, in accordance with our general precedent, habeas corpus is not available to contest any error in the sentencing entries, and petitioners have or had an adequate remedy by way of appeal to challenge the imposition of postrelease control. Accordingly, we deny the writ.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b525-4\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b525-5\">Lanzinger, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-10\">.

The question here is how accurate a trial court must be in notifying a defendant about postrelease control. I would answer that for notification to be proper, a defendant subject to mandatory postrelease control must be informed that postrelease control is mandatory, rather than discretionary, with the parole authority. Because none of the 12 petitioners were so notified in their cases, I would grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 55} The 12 petitioners are currently in prison for violating their postreleasecontrol terms. Although all were subject to mandatory terms of postrelease control based upon their underlying convictions, they all claim they did not receive adequate notice of postrelease control in the sentencing entries issued by the trial courts. In denying the writ, the majority concludes that \u201c[t]he petitioners\u2019 sentencing entries, although they mistakenly included wording that suggested that imposition of postrelease control was discretionary, contained sufficient language to authorize the Adult Parole Authority to exercise postrelease control over the petitioners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">{\u00b6 56} Previously, this court has explained the importance of notification in criminal cases. \u201c[I]n order to properly impose a sentence in a felony case, a trial court must consider and analyze numerous sections of the Revised Code to determine applicability and must provide notice to offenders at the sentencing hearing and incorporate that notice into its journal entry.\u201d <em>State v. Jordan, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 21, 2004-Ohio-6085, 817 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 9. With respect to community-control violations, we have stated that \u201c[w]hen an offender violates community control conditions and that offender was not properly notified of the specific term that would be imposed, an after-the-fact reimposition of community control would totally frustrate the purpose behind [statutory] notification, which is to make the offender aware <em>before a violation </em>of the specific prison term that he or she will face for a violation.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Brooks, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 134, 2004-Ohio-4746, 814 N.E.2d 837, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">{\u00b6 57} The petitioners in this case may have received some notice of the possibility of postrelease control, but the notice they received was neither proper nor adequate. Proper notification concerning postrelease control for these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>petitioners would have stated that postrelease control was mandatory, not just a possibility. Defendants are to be informed of the exact consequences of a conviction. See <em>Hernandez v. Kelly </em>(2006), 108 Ohio St.3d 395, 2006-Ohio-126, 844 N.E.2d 301, at \u00b6 31 (stating that the objective of Ohio\u2019s sentencing laws is to ensure all interested parties \u201cknow precisely the nature and duration of the restrictions that have been imposed by the trial court on the defendant\u2019s personal liberty\u201d). This includes statements by the trial court about whether postrelease control is optional or mandatory and how long it will last. I disagree with the majority view that mere substantial compliance is sufficient.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGb\">Gerhardstein, Branch &amp; Laufman Co., L.P.A., and Alphonse A. Gerhardstein; and Ohio Justice <em>&amp; </em>Policy Center and David A. Singleton, for petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b526-7\">Jim Petro, Attorney General, and M. Scott Criss, Assistant Attorney General, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">{\u00b6 58} This court\u2019s opinion in <em>Hernandez </em>supports petitioners\u2019 claims. Like petitioners, Hernandez was not notified properly of mandatory postrelease control at his initial sentencing although he had been told that \u201che was \u2018being sent to prison and placed on post-release control by the Parole Board for a period of up to five years.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 2. He appealed and was resentenced, but postrelease control was not mentioned during resentencing. Id. at \u00b6 4. After a seven-year prison term, the parole authority imposed five years of postrelease control, which Hernandez violated and for which he was returned to prison. Id. at \u00b6 5-6. When he filed a writ of habeas corpus, seeking release from prison and from postrelease control, we granted the writ rather than remanding for resentencing. In granting the writ, we emphasized the importance of proper notification to defendants of the penalties they would face. Id. at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 59} The length of time ordered for postrelease control and whether that time will be optional or mandatory are important factors for a defendant to know as part of the penalty imposed and, in my view, should be part of the defendant\u2019s notification. I conclude that the improper notifications to petitioners did not adequately inform them of the postrelease-control conditions that they faced and, therefore, I would grant the writ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
