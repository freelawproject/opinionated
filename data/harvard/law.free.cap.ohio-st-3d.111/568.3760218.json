The appellants and cross-appellees are the Ohio Federation of Teachers, the Ohio Congress of Parents and Teachers, the Ohio School Boards Association, other education associations and teachers\u2019 unions, certain parents, taxpayers, school district boards of education, and residents of various school districts (\u201cappellants\u201d). Their lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of laws for the establishment and operation of Ohio\u2019s community schools enacted by the General Assembly by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 215 in 1997 and codified at R.C. Chapter 3314.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-14\">{\u00b6 2} The appellees and cross-appellants include the State Board of Education, Ohio\u2019s Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Ohio Department of Education, various Ohio community schools, Ohio community-school operators, and White Hat Management, L.L.C., a company that manages 28 community schools in the state (\u201cappellees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The parties filed jurisdictional memoranda asking us to accept this case as a discretionary appeal to determine the constitutionality of R.C. Chapter 3314. We accepted the appeal and the cross-appeals solely to determine the constitutional issues. Appellants\u2019 charges regarding the establishment and operation of community schools are still pending at the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">{\u00b6 4} After first providing an overview of the enabling legislation and the history of this case, this opinion will analyze the constitutional claims arising under the Ohio Constitution, specifically (1) Section 2, Article VI, the Thorough and Efficient Clause, (2) Section 3, Article VI, governing city school districts, (3) Section 5, Article XII, limiting proceeds of taxes to their stated purposes, and (4) Sections 4 and 5, Article VIII, restricting the lending of the state\u2019s credit and the state\u2019s assumption of debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">I. Overview of the Community-Schools Act, R.C. Chapter 3314</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">{\u00b6 5} Ohio adopted charter-school legislation when the Ohio General Assembly enacted R.C. Chapter 3314 in 1997. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 215, 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 909, 1187. As legislatively created, community schools are independently governed public schools that are funded from state revenues pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3314.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">{\u00b6 6} In enacting R.C. Chapter 3314, the General Assembly declared that its purposes included \u201cproviding parents a choice of academic environments for their children and providing the education community with the opportunity to establish limited experimental educational programs in a deregulated setting.\u201d Am.Sub. H.B. No. 215, Section 50.52, Subsection 2(B), 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2043. Community schools are permitted to target and tailor programs for small student populations such as learning-disabled students or dropouts from traditional schools. R.C. 3314.06(B), 3314.03(A)(2), and 3314.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">{\u00b6 7} The General Assembly explained that \u201c[a] community school created under this chapter is a public school, independent of any school district, and is part of the state\u2019s program of education.\u201d R.C. 3314.01(B). Community schools are state-funded, R.C. 3314.08(D), but each is privately run, R.C. 3314.01 and 3314.02(B) and (C)(1). Each community school must be formed as either a nonprofit corporation or a public-benefit corporation. R.C. 3314.03(A)(1). Community schools cannot charge tuition, R.C. 3314.08(1), and must be nonsectarian, R.C. 3314.03(A)(ll)(c), with enrollment policies that comply with R.C. 3314.06. While community schools are exempt from certain state laws and regulations, R.C. 3314.04, they must comply with many of the same statewide academic standards, R.C. 3314.03(A)(11). Community schools contract with sponsors, which are responsible for monitoring their performance and compliance with applicable standards and requirements. R.C. 3314.03(A)(4). In turn, sponsors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>are monitored and overseen by the Ohio Department of Education (\u201cODE\u201d). R.C. 3314.015.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">{\u00b6 8} Formerly, sponsors were required to be public entities (i.e., local boards of education, the ODE, educational service centers, or trustees of universities or their designees). Former R.C. 3314.02(A)(1) and (C)(1), 1999 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 282, 148 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2022-2023. Since April 8, 2003, certain other approved, nonprofit, education-oriented entities may also be sponsors. R.C. 3314.02(C)(1)(f), 2002 Sub.H.B. No. 364, 149 Ohio Laws, Part V, 10,208 and 10,210. Under R.C. 3314.015(A), the ODE must approve sponsors, monitor the effectiveness of their oversight of their schools, and issue reports on the effectiveness of the schools\u2019 academic programs, operations, and legal compliance and on their financial condition. Sponsors must seek ODE approval, according to criteria, procedures, and deadlines established by ODE. R.C. 3314.015(B). If a sponsor becomes unwilling or unable to complete its duties, ODE may revoke approval to act as a sponsor and assume direct sponsorship of the community school in question for up to two years. R.C. 3314.015(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">{\u00b6 9} Each community school is governed by a contract between the governing authority of the school and its sponsor. R.C. 3314.03. The initial contract term may last no more than five years. R.C. 3314.03(A)(13). If the school does not meet its contract objectives, the sponsor may choose not to renew the contract. Alternatively, the sponsor may terminate the contract for good cause before the end of the contract\u2019s term. R.C. 3314.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">{\u00b6 10} Ohio is not alone in adopting charter-school legislation. As of 1992 a majority of states allow for the creation of charter schools, typically allowing those schools to use a per-pupil funding stream from government sources (either state or local) to pay for the schools. With the increasing prevalence of charter schools has come increased statutory oversight and regulation, especially for licensing, regulatory inspections, and academic testing. 50 State Statutory Survey, \u201cCharter School Licensing Requirements, Inspections, and Testing\u201d (2006). R.C. Chapter 3314 has been amended frequently since it was enacted,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the law governing community schools continues to evolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>II. Procedural History of Case</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">{\u00b6 11} The appellants filed suit on May 14, 2001, requesting declaratory and injunctive relief and writs of mandamus, raising several constitutional challenges to various aspects of R.C. Chapter 3314. The appellants filed a third amended complaint asserting ten different claims, including several as bases for the trial court to issue a declaratory judgment stating that R.C. Chapter 3314 is unconstitutional on its face and as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">{\u00b6 12} At a status conference on November 9, 2001, the trial judge bifurcated the litigation to reduce the potential burden on the parties. In the first phase, they were to focus solely on legal issues that could be decided without discovery \u2014 these issues relate to the constitutional challenges to Ohio\u2019s community-school program. In the second phase, which is still pending, the trial court will examine the factual claims that address compliance with statutes and with sponsorship contracts. As already noted, the first phase is the subject of the parties\u2019 discretionary appeal and cross-appeals, which we accepted solely to decide the constitutional challenges.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">{\u00b6 13} On May 20, 2002, several motions were filed: (1) the appellants filed motions for summary judgment on counts four, five, seven, eight, nine, and ten, (2) the state appellees filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint and for summary judgment, (3) the community-school appellees filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings on counts three, four, five, six, seven, and eight, and (4) White Hat filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court identified counts four, five, six, and seven of the third amended complaint as the legal claims to be resolved based on the pleadings and motions filed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">{\u00b6 14} In its decision, the trial court first considered count four of the third amended complaint. This count is a facial challenge to R.C. Chapter 3314, alleging that the statute violates both Section 3, Article VI and Section 5, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution, sections that deal with the powers of city school boards and restrictions on the use of tax revenue. Count four contains two underlying claims. First, the appellants allege that Section 3, Article VI has been violated because R.C. Chapter 3314 has \u201cusurped this constitutional right of local educational self-determination by allowing the creation of privately owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>\u2018community schools\u2019 not authorized or governed by locally elected school boards.\u201d The trial court disagreed and held that the General Assembly has the power to create and modify school districts as it believes necessary, without the approval of the school districts. Second, the appellants claim that the method of funding community schools violates Section 5, Article XII of the Constitution by in effect diverting local tax dollars to community schools. The trial court disagreed again and found that the appellants \u201ccannot show a diversion of local tax levies to community schools in violation of Section 5, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">{\u00b6 15} Counts five and six are challenges to R.C. Chapter 3314 on its face and as applied. In these counts, the appellants allege that community schools violate Section 2, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution, the Thorough and Efficient Clause. The appellants argue that community schools are not part of the thorough and efficient system of common schools, because they have been allowed to operate with different standards. They also claim that the manner in which community schools are funded takes money away from traditional school districts, making them less thorough and efficient. The trial court found these claims barred by res judicata because <em>DeRolph v. State </em>(2002), 97 Ohio St.3d 434, 2002-Ohio-6750, 780 N.E.2d 529, had determined already that the public school system, of which community schools are part, is not constitutionally thorough and efficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">{\u00b6 16} Count seven alleges that R.C. 3314.08(J), 3318.50, and 3318.52 violate Sections 4 and 5, Article VIII, which restrict the lending of the state\u2019s credit and the state\u2019s assumption of debt. The statutory provisions at issue under this count allow community schools to borrow money in anticipation of state payments and to receive state-guaranteed loans for buildings and other facilities. Because community schools are organized for a public purpose (educating children), the trial court found that R.C. 3314.08(J), 3318.50, and 3318.52 permit community schools to borrow money and the state to guarantee loans without constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">{\u00b6 17} The trial court granted the state appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss, the community-school appellees\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings, and White Hat\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings on counts four through seven. The trial court denied appellants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">{\u00b6 18} The Court of Appeals for Franklin County agreed with the trial court on count four that the General Assembly\u2019s exercise of its broad power to create, change, or modify the state\u2019s school districts does not impinge on Section 3, Article VI. However, the court disagreed with the decision to dismiss the portion of count four that implicates Section 5, Article XII, the constitutional provision that requires that local levy funds go to their intended purpose. The court of appeals found that the appellants\u2019 claim that the method of funding community schools diverts state funds from local school districts raises issues of fact. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Accordingly, the court remanded this claim, as well as counts five, six, and seven.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Both sides filed jurisdictional memoranda asking this court to address the legal merits of all of appellants\u2019 constitutional claims. We accepted all propositions of law (except the proposition addressing the res judicata effects of <em>DeRolph).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">III. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">A. Summary of Constitutional Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">{\u00b6 19} The complaint in this case asserted that numerous constitutional provisions were implicated in this case, so we will first summarize the constitutional provisions and the relevant standards of proof before analyzing each claim in turn. We are asked to determine whether R.C. Chapter 3314 violates Section 2, Article VI, which contains the Thorough and Efficient Clause; Section 3, Article VI, which governs the organization of city school districts; Section 5, Article XII, which limits tax proceeds to their stated purposes; and Sections 4 and 5, Article VIII, which restricts the state\u2019s lending of credit and assumption of debt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">B. Standard of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">{\u00b6 20} Initially, we must acknowledge that legislative enactments are entitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality. <em>N. Ohio Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Assn. v. Parma </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 375, 377, 15 O.O.3d 450, 402 N.E.2d 519. When the constitutionality of legislation is attacked, we must interpret the applicable constitutional provisions and acknowledge that \u201ca court has nothing to do with the policy or wisdom of a statute. That is the exclusive concern of the legislative branch of the government. When the validity of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, the sole function of the court is to determine whether it transcends the limits of legislative power.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bishop v. Mt. Orab Village School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 427, 438, 22 O.O. 494, 40 N.E.2d 913. A statute should not be declared unconstitutional \u201cunless it \u2018appear[s] beyond a reasonable doubt that the legislation and constitutional provision are clearly incompatible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kelleys Island Caddy Shack, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 375, 2002-Ohio-4930, 775 N.E.2d 489, \u00b6 10, quoting <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number><em>Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus. Furthermore, a statute \u201cmust be enforced unless it is in clear and irreconcilable conflict with some express provision of the constitution.\u201d <em>Spivey v. Ohio </em>(N.D.Ohio 1998), 999 F.Supp. 987, 999. Thus, in reviewing these constitutional claims, we must give due deference to the General Assembly. But this still means, of course, that we must conduct an independent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">{\u00b6 21} The constitutional challenges to the statutes involve facial challenges as well as challenges to the application of R.C. Chapter 3314. The two types of challenges require different standards of proof. To prevail on a facial constitutional challenge, the challenger must prove the constitutional defect, using the highest standard of proof, which is also used in criminal cases, proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher, </em>164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus. To prevail on a constitutional challenge to the statute as applied, the challenger must present clear and convincing evidence of the statute\u2019s constitutional defect. <em>Belden v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1944), 143 Ohio St. 329, 28 O.O. 295, 55 N.E.2d 629, paragraph six of the syllabus. \u201c \u2018Clear and convincing evidence is that measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere \u201cpreponderance of evidence,\u201d but not to the extent of such certainty as is required \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d in criminal cases, and which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lansdowne v. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 176, 180-181, 512 N.E.2d 979, quoting <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 22} With this background in mind, we turn to the appellants\u2019 specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">C. Counts Five and Six: The \u201ccommon schools\u201d argument</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">\n<em>1. Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">{\u00b6 23} Because counts five and six both implicate the Thorough and Efficient Clause of the Ohio Constitution, we will discuss both counts in this section. The appellants claim that R.C. Chapter 3314, the Ohio Community-Schools Act, violates the Thorough and Efficient Clause of Section 2, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution. Section 2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe General Assembly shall make such provisions, by taxation, or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">{\u00b6 25} The appellants argue in count five that community schools violate the Thorough and Efficient Clause because they are not part of the system of common schools, being publicly funded but privately owned and not subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>uniform statewide standards. Count six provides the second part of their argument, asserting that because community schools are state-funded, they have diverted money from local school districts, thus depriving the districts of the ability to provide a thorough and efficient educational system. Both claims allege that the statutes, as applied, are unconstitutional. Thus, the appellants must present clear and convincing evidence of the statutes\u2019 constitutional defect. <em>Belden v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co., </em>143 Ohio St. 329, 28 O.O. 295, 55 N.E.2d 629.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 26} In response to the argument that community schools are unconstitutional because they are privately owned and subject to different standards, the appellees contend that the General Assembly is authorized by the Thorough and Efficient Clause to create community schools as part of Ohio\u2019s system of common schools. The appellees maintain that community schools do not have to be owned or operated by the public to be part of the common-school system. Community schools have been declared to be \u201cpublic schools, independent of any school district, and * * * part of the state\u2019s program of education.\u201d R.C. 3314.01(B). Furthermore, the appellees assert that because the term \u201ccommon schools\u201d is not defined in the Constitution, and because there is no constitutional requirement that all public schools must be governmentally owned and operated, the General Assembly should be allowed to determine the requirements of \u201ccommon schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\n<em>2. Count Five: Different standards for schools under private ownership</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 27} Throughout time, new educational movements have faced opponents and detractors. But just as the common-school movement of the 1800s increasingly gained supporters throughout the United States, so too has the charter-school movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 28} The Thorough and Efficient Clause was adopted at the 1851 Constitutional Convention, largely in response to the common-school movement. Before Section 2, Article VI was adopted, Ohio had officially encouraged, but had not required, education. Section 3, Article VIII, Ohio Constitution of 1802. Originally, \u201c[sjchools received no public aid except through revenues from lands set aside by Congress for the purpose in the Northwest Territory. * * * Early Ohio schools were private, organized by individual schoolmasters, a group of neighbors, a church, or a charitable society. Some were free, but many charged tuition in addition to receiving a share of the school lands revenue * * *.\u201d Editor\u2019s Comment to Section 2, Article VI, in Baldwin\u2019s Ohio Revised Code Annotated (2004). The common-school movement, originating in Massachusetts through the work of Horace Mann, held the basic ideology that all citizens should have \u201ca common foundation of literacy, morality, and patriotism, regardless of their origins, through free public schools supported by taxes, with compulsory school attendance and supervision at the state level.\u201d Id. Common schools were highly controversial at first, but gained wide acceptance after 1841. By 1851, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>common-school movement had wide support in Ohio, leading to the adoption of the Thorough and Efficient Clause. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">{\u00b6 29} As early as 1923, this court had the opportunity to interpret this clause and to set forth a standard for evaluating a thorough and efficient system of common schools. <em>Miller v. Korns </em>(1923), 107 Ohio St. 287, 140 N.E. 773. We recognized that the purpose of providing a thorough and efficient system was statewide in nature and \u201c[w]ith this very state purpose in view, regarding the problem as a state-wide problem, the sovereign people made it mandatory upon the General Assembly to secure not merely a system of common schools, but a system thorough and efficient throughout the state.\u201d Id. at 297-298, 140 N.E. 773. Furthermore, in <em>DeRolph v. State, </em>Chief Justice Moyer noted that \u201cour Constitution commits the responsibility for ascribing meaning to the phrase \u2018thorough and efficient\u2019 to the General Assembly and not to this court.\u201d <em>DeRolph v. State </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 193, at 264, 677 N.E.2d 733, 747 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting). As the statewide body, the General Assembly has the legislative authority and latitude to set the standards and requirements for common schools, including different standards for community schools. In fulfilling its governmental role, it must still function according to its constitutional directive.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 30} In enacting community-school legislation, the General Assembly added to the traditional school system by providing for statewide schools that have more flexibility in their operation. Community schools were designed to give parents a choice and give educators \u201cthe opportunity to establish limited experimental educational programs in a deregulated setting.\u201d 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 215, Section 50.52, Subsection 2(B), 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2043. Deregulation implies exemption, and while it is true that community schools are exempted from certain state standards,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> there are others to which the schools must also adhere. Community school students must pass the same graduation test that students in traditional public schools must pass. R.C. 3314.03(A)(ll)(f). Community schools must administer proficiency and achievement tests, R.C. 3314.03(A)(ll)(d), and diagnostic tests, R.C. 3314.03(A)(3), maintain adequate facilities and meet all health and safety standards, R.C. 3314.05, and comply with numerous Revised Code sections as if they were school districts, R.C. 3314.03(A)(ll)(d). (See Appendix A for additional requirements from which community schools are <em>not </em>exempt.) Community-school sponsors are monitored and supervised by the ODE, the same department that oversees traditional public schools. R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>3314.015. Although Justice Resnick\u2019s dissent focuses on the requirements that community schools are exempted from, upon closer examination, many of these exemptions are picayune in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 31} The Ohio Community-Schools Act was drafted with the intent that parental choice and sponsor control would hold community schools accountable, in a fashion similar to traditional school management. In exchange for enhanced flexibility, community schools face heightened accountability to parents and sponsors. Either can threaten shutdown, sponsors by suspending operations pursuant to R.C. 3314.072, and parents by withdrawing their children. In fact, internet- or computer-based community schools lose their funding if they do not show expected gains for two years, and any community school will be permanently shut down if it fails to meet expected goals for three years. R.C. 3314.36. Traditional schools, on the other hand, may not be shut down no matter how poorly they perform (although they will face decreased funding). R.C. 3302.04(F). Because community schools may serve a targeted student population, their requirements may be more narrowly tailored. This idea is not totally new to Ohio\u2019s system of education. In the past, for example, the General Assembly has permitted different requirements for vocational education and special education and has allowed traditional schools to establish magnet schools and specialized schools in arts and science. The General Assembly\u2019s statutory scheme sets forth a framework, in keeping with its constitutional directive, for alternative accountability and academic standards for community schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 32} Contrary to Justice Resnick\u2019s statement in dissent, we do not approve of just \u201cany schooling arrangement.\u201d \u00b6 82. The Ohio Constitution requires establishment of a system of common schools. This requirement is grounded in the state\u2019s interest in ensuring that all children receive an adequate education that complies with the Thorough and Efficient Clause. To achieve the goal of improving and customizing public education programs, the General Assembly has augmented the state\u2019s public school system with public community schools. The expressed legislative intent is to provide a chance of educational success for students who may be better served in their educational needs in alternative settings. Requiring community schools to be operated just like traditional public schools would extinguish the experimental spirit behind R.C. Chapter 3314.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 33} While the wide discretion granted to the General Assembly is not without limits, <em>Cincinnati City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Walter </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 368, 387, 12 O.O.3d 327, 390 N.E.2d 813, we hold that the General Assembly has not transgressed the limits of its legislative power so as to render R.C. Chapter 3314 unconstitutional under the Thorough and Efficient Clause. Over time, the General Assembly has increased the number of state requirements with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>which community schools must comply,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and has also enacted additional, specific, and unique requirements such as control and oversight by sponsors, R.C. 3314.03, mandated forms of entity status, R.C. 3314.03(A)(1), and annual reporting requirements on fiscal, operational, and academic issues, R.C. 3314.03(A)(ll)(g) and 3314.03(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">{\u00b6 34} The General Assembly is the branch of state government charged by the Ohio Constitution with making educational policy choices for the education of our state\u2019s children. Our personal choices are not relevant to this task. The appellants have not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional on its face; nor have they met their high burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence of the statute\u2019s unconstitutionality as applied. We hold that the General Assembly has the authority to set the standards and requirements for a system of common schools. In providing for community schools within that system, the state legislature has not exceeded its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\"><em>3. Count </em>Six: <em>Funding community schools and a thorough and efficient system</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b6 35} Count six of the complaint alleges that the funding method used to support community schools diverts funds from city school districts, depriving them of the ability to provide a thorough and efficient system of common schools. Once again, as this claim is a constitutional challenge to R.C. Chapter 3314 as applied, the appellants must present clear and convincing evidence that R.C. Chapter 3314 is unconstitutional. <em>State v. Renalist, Inc. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 276, 279, 10 O.O.3d 408, 383 N.E.2d 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 36} Appellants argue that the community schools have made urban districts more reliant on local property taxes because when a student leaves a district for a community school, the state reduces the state funding that the district receives for the student. Nothing in the Constitution, however, prohibits the General Assembly from reducing funding because a school district\u2019s enrollment decreases. If a child moves out of the district altogether, the state is permitted to reduce its funding to that child\u2019s district because state money follows the child. For example, if a child leaves a school district to attend private school, or to be schooled at home, the state is required to reduce its funding to that district.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The same thing occurs when a child opts to attend a community school. R.C. 3314.08. Whenever a student leaves, for any reason, the school district\u2019s funding is decreased, and the district continues to receive state funding based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>students actually attending. Traditional schools still receive the full amount of state funds for the actual number of students enrolled.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 37} The state adjusts its level of funding to a school district based on enrollment, but the local share works differently, as a constant. The local share of funding remains the same no matter who attends the district school. If district enrollment decreases, the local share, being constant, constitutes a higher percentage of district funding. On the other hand, if district enrollment increases, the local share constitutes a lower percentage of district funding. In dissent, Justice Pfeifer argues that community schools unconstitutionally increase reliance on local funding for district schools, invoking <em>DeRolph v. State. </em>The dissent\u2019s citation of <em>DeRolph </em>is a red herring. <em>DeRolph </em>focused on R.C. Chapter 3317, the School Foundation Program, for the allocation of state basic aid. The School Foundation Program conditioned the receipt of state aid on the levy of local property tax revenues. R.C. 3317.01(A). What the <em>DeRolph </em>majority found so egregious was Ohio\u2019s public schools\u2019 heavy dependence upon local property taxes for their support. That simply is not the case here. Community schools do not rely on local property taxes, as they are funded entirely by the state, under an entirely different formula, set forth in a different statute. Community schools cannot levy or spend local taxes. Furthermore, Ohio\u2019s traditional school system is not made more reliant on local taxes because of community schools. The state treats community-school students in the same way it has treated any student who has ever left a school district. It reduces its per-pupil funding to the school district, just as it does when students leave for private schools, for other school districts, or for home schooling.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 38} The mere increase or decrease in the local share <em>percentage </em>does not violate the Thorough and Efficient Clause, because the district still receives state funding for the children actually attending the district traditional schools. Community schools never receive any local tax money. In fact, the Legislative Office of Education Oversight stated that \u201cit should be clarified that community schools do <em>not </em>take locally-generated tax dollars away from districts * * (Emphasis sic.) LOEO, Community Schools in Ohio: Second-Year Implementation Report, Volume I: Policy Issues (Apr. 2001) 27. It explained that \u201c[o]nce the local share is subtracted from the total base cost funding, the state is responsible for providing any amount thereafter.\u201d In other words, the state still fulfills its obligation to fund each student at a specific level according to the statutory formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 39} Section 2, Article VI expressly provides that the General Assembly shall make provisions to secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools. The General Assembly has the exclusive authority to spend tax revenues to further a statewide system of schools compatible with the Constitution. Exercis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>ing its discretion, the General Assembly made provisions for community schools when it directed that the state would be the sole source of funding for community schools for their base formula amounts. R.C. 3314.08. Community schools cannot levy local taxes or charge tuition. R.C. 3314.08(H) and (I). When a student leaves a traditional school to attend a community school, the state funds follow the student. Accordingly, we find that R.C. Chapter 3314, as applied, is constitutional. The appellants have not presented clear and convincing evidence that community schools are raiding local funds that school districts are otherwise entitled to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 40} The next claim that we will examine contains two constitutional provisions: one dealing with the authority of city school boards, and the other with the levy of local taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">D. Count Four: Section 3, Article VI and Section 5, Article XII authority of city school boards and diversion of local tax money</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 41} Count four of the third amended complaint is a facial challenge to the statutes, claiming that R.C. Chapter 3314 violates local citizens\u2019 rights under Section 3, Article VI because community schools within city school districts are not under the control of local voters or of school boards. Count four also contends that the statute offends Section 5, Article XII because local tax dollars are in effect diverted to community schools. To overcome the presumption of constitutionality, the appellants must prove that the statute is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt, the highest standard of proof. <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher, </em>164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">\n<em>1. Authority of city school boards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">{\u00b6 42} Section 3, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-10\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cProvision shall be made by law for the organization, administration and control of the public school system of the state supported by public funds: provided, that each school district embraced wholly or in part within any city shall have the power by referendum vote to determine for itself the number of members and the organization of the district board of education, and provision shall be made by law for the exercise of this power by such school districts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">{\u00b6 44} Under R.C. 3314.01(B), a community school is a \u201cpublic school, independent of any school district.\u201d The appellants argue that citizens of cities have the exclusive right to exercise authority over public education through the election of school boards and approval of local school tax levies, and because community schools are not authorized or governed by city school boards, this constitutional right of local educational self-determination is usurped.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>{\u00b6 45} This court has held that the General Assembly has the power to create and modify school districts. In <em>State ex rel Core v. Green </em>(1953), 160 Ohio St. 175, 51 O.O. 442, 115 N.E.2d 157, the court stated, \u201cThe General Assembly has the power to provide for the creation of school districts, for changes and modifications thereof, and for the methods by which changes and modifications may be accomplished.\u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. An Ohio federal court recognized the General Assembly\u2019s authority to provide for the modification of school districts when it approved the creation of a new classification of school districts called \u201cmunicipal school districts.\u201d <em>Spivey v. Ohio, </em>999 F.Supp. at 997. In <em>Spivey, </em>the legislation under review gave the mayor of Cleveland authority to appoint members of the Cleveland City School District Board of Education, and local voters were not given the opportunity to preapprove any changes in the school board. R.C. 3311.71 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 46} In analyzing this specific issue in the case before us, the Court of Appeals for Franklin County opined that the plain language of Section 3, Article VI \u201cdoes not give those [local] voters more power than the General Assembly to create policy and organize and administer a system of public education throughout the state.\u201d 2004-Ohio-4421, \u00b6 39. We agree with this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 47} Voters in city school districts have the right to vote on the number of members and the organization of their city school boards. In turn, the school boards have authority over the districts they are elected to serve. Section 3, Article IV governs questions of size and organization, not the power and authority, of city school boards. In <em>Marion Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Manon Cty. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 543, 545, 5 O.O.2d 216, 150 N.E.2d 407, this court held that \u201c[b]oards of education have only such powers as are conferred by statute.\u201d A board of education is \u201ca mere instrumentality of the state to accomplish its purpose in establishing and carrying forward a system of common schools throughout the state.\u201d <em>Cincinnati Bd. of Edn. v. Volk </em>(1905), 72 Ohio St. 469, 485, 74 N.E. 646. By choosing to create community schools as part of the state\u2019s program of education but independent of school districts, the General Assembly has not intruded on the powers of city school boards. Applying the facial-challenge standard, we hold that the appellants have not proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the powers of city school districts have been usurped, rendering R.C. Chapter 3314 unconstitutional. Section 3, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution does not prevent the General Assembly from creating additional schools that are located within city school districts but are not part of the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\n<em>2. Diversion of local tax money</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 48} Count four also alleges that R.C. Chapter 3314 violates Section 5, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution by diverting local tax dollars to community schools, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>contention similar to the constitutional claim asserted under the Thorough and Efficient Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 49} Section 5, Article XII of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cNo tax shall be levied, except in pursuance of law; and every law imposing a tax, shall state, distinctly, the object of the same, to which only, it shall be applied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 51} In support of this claim of diversion of local tax dollars, the appellants maintain that the community-school funding scheme violates voters\u2019 rights by taking the locally voted property taxes approved for the local school districts and giving them to community schools. While the appellants admit that \u201cthe money given to community schools comes from the State\u2019s bank account,\u201d they contend that deducting the full per-pupil formula amount from the school district\u2019s money when a student leaves for a community school is equivalent to taking local tax money.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">{\u00b6 52} Community schools are funded differently than are traditional schools. Funding for traditional schools is set forth in R.C. 3317.012; funding for community schools is set forth in R.C. 3314.08. Community schools are primarily funded by a per capita subsidy taken from the state\u2019s basic aid to the school districts that the students in community schools are entitled to attend. R.C. 3314.08 clearly confirms that funding for community schools comes from state funds pursuant to the funding formula. Funds raised by local school districts, such as funds derived from local levies, are never sent from the local school district to the community schools, nor are any funds from the local school district to the state ever redirected to the community schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">{\u00b6 53} Funding formulas for traditional and community schools are complex, although we may summarize them by saying that state money follows the student. In general, under both formulas, the state guarantees a basic minimum level of funding for each student, called the \u201cformula amount.\u201d R.C. 3317.02. The General Assembly has determined the formula amount for both school districts and community schools, and these amounts have been codified in separate sections of the Revised Code. For community schools, the formula amount of R.C. 3314.03 can never exceed the traditional schools\u2019 amount of R.C. 3317.02(B). Community schools must set forth this amount in their annual financial plans under R.C. 3314.03(A)(15). Each district and each community school also has a cost-of-doing-business factor assigned to it, which varies from county to county. R.C. 3317.02(N) and 3314.08(A)(2) and (C)(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">{\u00b6 54} Under the school districts\u2019 formula, they are funded from a combination of state and local tax dollars. To reach the state and local amount for a school district, the state multiplies the formula amount by the cost-of-doing-business factor to reach a preliminary amount. R.C. 3317.022.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>{\u00b6 55} The \u201ccharge-off amount,\u201d representing the local tax dollars raised, comes into play next in the formula. Local property-tax contributions are not determined on a per-student basis, but are instead determined by property wealth and the tax rate within a district. Each district is assumed to contribute 23 mills times the value of local tax base to its funding level, R.C. 3317.022, and as stated earlier, this local district share is a constant amount that does not fluctuate based upon student population. The charge-off amount is then subtracted from the preliminary amount. Once the charge-off amount is deducted, the remaining funding comes from the state in order to reach the formula amount specified in R.C. 3317.12 by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 56} In using the formula for community schools,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the ODE multiplies the number of students enrolled in a community school times the base formula amount times the cost-of-doing-business factor. R.C. 3314.08(D). For each student, the state then deducts the formula amount, adjusted by the cost-of-doing-business factor, from the funding for the school district that the student would have attended. R.C. 3314.08(C). Consequently, when a student transfers to a community school from a school district, the district loses as much funding as it would if the student leaves for another school district, for a private school, or to be home schooled.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 57} The appellants argue that because the state deducts the entire formula amount for any student who leaves a traditional school for a community school, the deduction has the effect of increasing school districts\u2019 local share. However, a change in the number of students does not affect the amount of the school district\u2019s local share, because local tax dollars are contributed by the district\u2019s taxpayers and do not depend upon the number of students attending the school. R.C. 3314.08 and 3317.022. The full amount of the local tax money will continue to be available to the local school district. In other words, state funds follow the student; local funds do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 58} We are not persuaded by appellants\u2019 argument that local tax money is diverted to community schools under the funding formula. Certain traditional schools may rely more on local tax dollars, but students who leave the district leave with their own per-student allocation of state money, so this means that local tax dollars are never actually paid to community schools. Under the funding provisions of R.C. 3314.08(D), the tax dollars that fund community schools come entirely from the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>{\u00b6 59} The appellants are concerned that students are leaving traditional schools for community schools and that traditional schools are bearing the burden of competition. Community-school opponents point to certain community schools that have experienced financial and operational issues as reason for rejection of the whole concept. Today\u2019s question, however, is not whether particular schools are operating within the law but whether R.C. Chapter 3314, as enacted, satisfies the Constitution. Any allegations about the manner in which certain community schools are run are properly addressed in the appellants\u2019 second cause of action, pending in the trial court. School funding continues to be an educational policy matter of immense concern and heated debate. Educational policy matters, however, are best left to the General Assembly, which is charged with enacting legislation that reflects the policy choices of the state\u2019s constituents.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 60} We are now considering only the constitutional challenges in this case, and from a constitutional perspective, we conclude that appellants have not proved a violation of the prohibition in Section 5, Article XII against the application of local taxes, because local tax dollars are not diverted to the state-funded community schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 61} The final claim at issue in this case deals with the financial relationship between the state and community schools under two constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">E. Count Seven: Sections 4 and 5, Article VIII: Community schools and state credit and loans</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 62} Count seven of the third amended complaint alleges that R.C. 3314.08(J), which permits community schools to borrow money from the state, and R.C. 3318.50 and 3318.52, which provide loan guarantees to community schools, are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">\n<em>1. Extending state credit to community schools</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">{\u00b6 63} Section 4, Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-11\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cThe credit of the state shall not, in any manner, be given or loaned to, or in aid of, any individual association or corporation whatever; nor shall the state ever hereafter become a joint owner, or stockholder, in any company or association, in this state, or elsewhere, formed for any purpose whatever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">{\u00b6 65} The provisions of the statutes at issue here, R.C. 3314.08(J), 3318.50, and 3318.52, allow community schools to borrow money in anticipation of state funding, establish a classroom-facilities loan-guarantee program, and establish a community-school loan-guarantee fund. Citing Section 4, Article VIII, the appellants contend that guaranteeing loans and funding to community schools constitutes an unconstitutional lending of the state\u2019s credit to aid individual associations or corporations. In challenging the statute on its face, they must prove its constitutional defect beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number><em>Defenbacher, </em>164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 66} Section 4, Article VIII has generally been interpreted to prohibit lending the state\u2019s credit to private business enterprises, but not to organizations created for a public purpose, even if they are corporations. <em>State ex rel. Kauer v. Defenbacher </em>(1950), 153 Ohio St. 268, 282, 41 O.O. 278, 91 N.E.2d 512. In opposing the appellants\u2019 argument, the appellees argue that community schools are not private business enterprises, so statutory provisions for the state\u2019s guarantee of loans to community schools are constitutional. The plain language of R.C. 3314.03(A)(1) does not permit for-profit entities to become community schools. Community schools may be organized only as nonprofit corporations or as public-benefit corporations. R.C. 3314.03(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 67} We have held that Section 4, Article VIII is satisfied where the state\u2019s credit is used by a public organization to advance a \u201cpublic purpose.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kauer v. Defenbacher, </em>153 Ohio St. at 282, 41 O.O. 278, 91 N.E.2d 512 (\u201cwhether it is a corporation or not, the turnpike commission is * * * a public organization created for a public purpose,\u201d and so advancement of state funds to the commission is constitutional). See <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher, </em>164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59 (state grants to veterans\u2019 organizations are constitutional); <em>State ex rel. Leaverton v. Kerns </em>(1922), 104 Ohio St. 550, 554, 136 N.E. 217 (county grant to a county agricultural fair is constitutional because it is \u201ca public institution designed for public instruction\u201d); <em>Perkins v. Stockert </em>(1975), 45 Ohio App.2d 211, 74 O.O.2d 334, 343 N.E.2d 340 (funding of legislatively created \u201cnew community authorities\u201d to assist private entities in community development is constitutional because each authority is created for a public purpose). In <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher, </em>we held that under Section 4, Article VIII, the legislature could validly appropriate public funds to a private entity for a public purpose. 164 Ohio St. at 151, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 68} Community schools were developed to further the state\u2019s public school system of education. We cannot imagine a greater public purpose than educating our state\u2019s children. Applying the facial-challenge standard to R.C. 3314.08(J), 3318.50, and 3318.52, we hold that the appellants have not established that the statutes are unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">\n<em>2. Funding community schools through loan guarantees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">{\u00b6 69} Under this claim, the appellants assert that the loan guarantees for community schools allowed by R.C. 3318.50 and 3318.52 violate the provisions of the Constitution that prohibit the state\u2019s assumption of the debt of any corporation unless certain exceptions apply. Section 5, Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>{\u00b6 70} \u201cThe state shall never assume the debts of any county, city, town, or township, or of any corporation whatever, unless such debt shall have been created to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, or defend the state in war.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 71} Turning to the plain language of the Constitution, the appellants highlight the statement \u201cThe state shall never assume the debts * * * of any corporation whatever.\u201d Because community schools must be formed as nonprofit or public-benefit <em>corporations, </em>R.C. 3314.03(A)(1), they argue that the statute offends this constitutional provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 72} Ohio\u2019s school districts are not included within this provision\u2019s prohibition, for Section 5, Article VIII does not forbid the state\u2019s assumption of the debt of political subdivisions that are not of the types named. <em>Butler Cty. Transp. Improvement Dist. v. Tracy </em>(1997), 120 Ohio App.3d 346, 359, 697 N.E.2d 1089 (Section 5, Article VIII does not apply to many types of political subdivisions in Ohio, such as school districts, regional water and sewer authorities, solid waste authorities, or transportation-improvement districts). The appellees argue that community schools are regarded as school districts because they are required to comply with certain Ohio laws as if they were school districts. See, e.g., R.C. 3314.03(A)(ll)(d) and 3314.08(F). Earlier in this opinion, we concluded that community schools belong to the state\u2019s system of common schools. By statute, they are \u201cpart of the state\u2019s program of education.\u201d R.C. 3314.01(B). Like traditional schools, community schools are funded by the state, cannot charge tuition, and are charged with educating Ohio children. As a result, they are not private business corporations the debt of which the state is prohibited from assuming under Section 5. Therefore, community schools are also exempt from this provision. Accordingly, we do not find a constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt under Section 5, Article VIII of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 73} We hold that the appellants in this case have not shown constitutional defects in R.C. Chapter 3314, on its face or as applied. When the General Assembly enacted Ohio\u2019s Community-Schools Act, it was entrusted with making complicated decisions about our state\u2019s educational policy. These policy decisions are within the purview of its legislative responsibilities, and that legislation is entitled to deference. <em>Brady v.

Chapter 3314, the Ohio Community-Schools Act, violates Section 2, Article VI of the Ohio Constitution because it produces a hodgepodge of uncommon schools financed by the state. Rather than \u201cadd[ing] to the traditional school system,\u201d \u00b6 30, or \u201cproviding for community schools within that system\u201d of common schools, as the majority postulates, \u00b6 34, R.C. Chapter 3314 effects a schismatic educational program under which an assemblage of divergent and deregulated privately owned and managed community schools competes against public schools for public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">{\u00b6 76} Section 2, Article VI provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cThe general assembly shall make such provisions, by taxation, or otherwise, as, with the income arising from the school trust fund, will secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-13\">{\u00b6 78} Since this provision does not prescribe a specific method for securing a system of common schools, it necessarily grants the General Assembly broad discretion in fulfilling its obligation. Accordingly, I agree with the majority that \u201cthe General Assembly has the authority to set the standards and requirements for a system of common schools.\u201d \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-14\">{\u00b6 79} But the General Assembly\u2019s discretion under Section 2, Article VI is not unlimited. \u201cTo state that the General Assembly must be granted wide discretion and that it is not the function of this court to question the wisdom of the statutes, is not to say that the General Assembly\u2019s discretion in this area is absolute.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Cincinnati City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Walter </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 368, 386, 12 O.O.3d 327, 390 N.E.2d 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 80} Specifically, the General Assembly does not have the authority under Section 2, Article VI to establish something other than a system of common schools. It is empowered to do only what it is charged with doing, which is to secure a thorough and efficient system of common schools throughout the state. Thus, as the court explained in <em>Simmons-Harris v. Goff </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 1, 11, 711 N.E.2d 203, \u201cIt can be argued that implicit within this obligation is a prohibition against the establishment of a system of uncommon (or nonpublic) schools financed by the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 81} Nor does Section 2, Article VI displace the power of judicial review. While the General Assembly has the exclusive authority and duty to establish a system of common schools, it is for the courts to determine the constitutional criteria against which the exercise of that power is to be measured. We may act with deference to legislative pronouncements,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but we are still obliged to make an independent determination of what constitutes a system of common schools. Defining the parameters of legislative power under Section 2, Article VI, and ensuring conformity thereto, remains a judicial function. See <em>Walter, </em>58 Ohio St.2d at 382-387, 12 O.O.3d 327, 390 N.E.2d 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 82} While the majority describes some of the history leading to the adoption of the Thorough and Efficient Clause, it nevertheless treats the mandate for a system of common schools as standardless, denoting any schooling arrangement that the General Assembly decides to support by general taxation. Yet the formative history of Section 2 discloses that the common-schools requirement does impose an articulable and meaningful standard upon the legislature and that R.C. Chapter 3314 recreates much of the mischief that the clause was intended to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 83} As generally explained by Molly O\u2019Brien and Amanda Woodrum, The Constitutional Common School (2004), 51 Clev.St.L.Rev. 581:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-9\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cRecent school reform initiatives have adopted the mechanisms of vouchers and charters to provide public funding for parental choice of schools. * * * Virtually all of these programs, however, envision a proliferating variety of available schools, competition among schools for tax support, and attendance by parental selection, rather than by public assignment. Even though charter and voucher schools are prohibited from discriminating in admissions on the basis of religion, by statute and by the federal Constitution, they permit like-minded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>people to flock together. They permit parental choice of a school based on the parents\u2019 unique set of values and priorities, biases and prejudices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 85} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 86} \u201cThe constitutional \u2018common school\u2019 has specific meaning that must be referenced in the evaluation of school reform programs. Central to that meaning is the requirement that the publicly-supported school system educate children of all classes, religions, and ethnic backgrounds together. * * * For the framers of the Ohio Constitution\u2019s education clauses, the only education worthy of public support was a \u2018common\u2019 education, not in the sense that it was provided for the common folks, but in the sense that it would bring diverse people together. They chose the common school concept to promote social harmony, create a sense of national identity, and develop affinity. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cMoreover, in choosing to mandate the creation of a system of common schools, the constitutional framers rejected the idea of simply subsidizing the existing diverse, parent-initiated and tuition-based schooling arrangements in favor of creating state organization and oversight. They viewed the diversity of the existing arrangements as an impediment to educational progress. The constitutional framers rejected the proliferation of diverse schools in favor of a single system. They also rejected the idea of competition among school districts and a variety of sectarian schools, viewing competition as inefficient, divisive, and ineffective. The rivalry among schools was seen as the greatest impediment to the advancement of education. Indeed, the problems created by the continuing disparities and competition among local districts generated further constitutional amendments in 1912. These amendments [i.e., Sections 3 and 4, Article VI] centralized state oversight of the system of public schools by creating a state superintendent; they further provided for public oversight of the districts through election. Thus, programs that create competition among schools for public funds or remove schools from state and public oversight also run counter to the constitutional vision and mandate.\u201d (Emphasis sic; footnotes omitted.) Id. at 638-641.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 88} Community schools under R.C. Chapter 3314 are nonprofit or public-benefit corporations that operate independently of any school district. R.C. 3314.01(B) and 3314.03(A)(1). They are governed by the terms of their individual contracts, have their own governing authorities, and are directly accountable to their sponsors. R.C. 3314.02(D) and (E), 3314.03(D), 3314.04, and 3314.07. Any qualified tax-exempt entity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code that has been in operation for five years, has assets of $500,000, and is considered by the Department of Education to be an education-oriented entity may sponsor up to 50 community schools (potentially more for some sponsors) and receive from each an \u201coversight and monitoring\u201d fee of up to three percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>payments for operating expenses that the school receives from the state. See R.C. 3314.015(B)(1), 3314.02(C)(1)(f), and 3314.03(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 89} Community schools were originally introduced in Ohio on a limited basis through a pilot project in the Lucas County area. 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 215, Section 50.52, Subsection 2(B), 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2043. They have since grown at a steady rate. According to a preliminary report on community schools in Ohio that was issued on April 11, 2002, by the Legislative Office of Education Oversight (established by R.C. 3301.68), \u201cSince 1998, the number of community schools in Ohio has increased annually, from the first 15 that began operating during the 1998-1999 school year to 92 schools during the 2001-2002 school year. The number of participating students has grown tenfold from 2,245 to over 23,000 during these years.\u201d Based on the listings in the March 2005 School Directory issued by the Office of Community Schools (see R.C. 3311.11) and information contained in a research bulletin published by the Ohio Education Association (\u201cOEA\u201d) in March 2005, there were over 62,000 students enrolled in approximately 250 community schools throughout Ohio during the 2004-2005 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 90} Community schools receive state funds that are deducted from payments to the school districts in which the enrolled students are entitled to attend school. R.C. 3314.08. In an affidavit filed on behalf of appellants in the trial court, William P. Driscoll, a former Ohio Deputy Tax Commissioner from 1985 to 1991, calculated that community-school deductions in fiscal year 2002 amounted to more than $133 million. According to Ohio Department of Education records, state funding for community schools for fiscal year 2005 totals over $400 million. In its March 2005 research bulletin, OEA calculated that \u201c[b]y the end of the current [2004-2005] school year, Ohio\u2019s charter schools will have received over $1.2 billion * * * in funding since the inception of the state\u2019s charter school program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 91} Yet community schools are exempt from the bulk of state standards and regulations that govern the operation of public schools. In fact, the stated purpose of R.C. Chapter 3314 is to establish \u201cindependent community schools throughout the state * * * in a deregulated setting.\u201d 1997 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 215, Section 50.52, Subsection 2(B), 147 Ohio Laws, Part I, 2043. Accordingly, R.C. 3314.04 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cExcept as otherwise specified in this chapter and in the contract between a community school and a sponsor, such school is exempt from all state laws and rules pertaining to schools, school districts, and boards of education, except those laws and rules that grant certain rights to parents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 93} On October 23, 2003, the Legislative Service Commission issued a research memorandum, No. R-125-1824, on the \u201cLaws from Which Community Schools Are Exempt and Specifically Not Exempt.\u201d The memo enumerates over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>150 state measures from which community schools are exempt, which run the gamut of education laws from curriculum and enrollment requirements to discipline policies and building standards. These are not random exclusions from insubstantial provisions. The exemptions are pervasive, extensive, and diffused throughout the entirety of Title 33 of the Revised Code. See Appendix B.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">{\u00b6 94} Largely unregulated and privately operated, community schools are free to adopt their own specific instructional approaches, educational goals, and philosophical agendas. Indeed, they are exempt from the provisions of R.C. 3313.602(B) and (C), which require public schools to ensure that \u201cthe principles of democracy and ethics ar\u00e9 emphasized and discussed wherever appropriate in all parts of the curriculum\u201d and to encourage all employees to be aware of their roles \u201cin instilling ethical principles and democratic ideals in all district pupils.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">{\u00b6 95} Section 2, Article VI was intended to bring order to the chaos of individualized approaches that resulted from the nascent m\u00e9lange of loosely regulated and diverse schooling arrangements by mandating the creation and funding of a uniform and coherent body of governmentally controlled schools. R.C. Chapter 3314 contravenes that intent by reversing the process. It creates a jumble of ad hoc community schools that flourish on state funds otherwise inuring to the account of district schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">{\u00b6 96} Although I disagree with the majority\u2019s view of Section 2, Article VI on a fundamental level, our differences are primarily grounded in constitutional analysis. However, I find the following passage in the majority\u2019s opinion to be questionable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-8\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cThroughout time, new educational movements have faced opponents and detractors. But just as the common-school movement of the 1800s increasingly gained supporters throughout the United States, so too has the charter-school movement.\u201d \u00b6 27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">{\u00b6 98} This court\u2019s function is to determine the constitutionality of charter schools as established by statute in Ohio, not to promote their cause. Whether the \u201ccharter-school movement\u201d has truly gained supporters or opponents, nationally or in Ohio, is a subject of social discourse for the political branches of our government. I also point out that the common-school movement of the 1800s resulted in a constitutional amendment, i.e., Section 2, Article VI and eventually also Sections 3 and 4, Article VI. That is not the case with charter schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">{\u00b6 99} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-10\">. The General Assembly declares in R.C. 3314.01(B), \u201cA community school created under this chapter is a public school, independent of any school district, and is part of the state\u2019s program of education.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b681-11\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AzV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>{\u00b6 100} Although I agree with the main premise of the majority opinion, that the Ohio Constitution does not prohibit the establishment of charter schools, I write separately because I conclude that charter schools as currently established are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 101} To many, the establishment of an alternative to public schools is a noble experiment, designed to enable students to escape failing public schools. Sadly, in many instances, the cure is worse than the disease. An August 16, 2006 article in the Columbus Dispatch indicates that 50 percent of the charter schools in Franklin County received the lowest possible rating: emergency. Presumably, most of the students attending charter schools in Franklin County left the Columbus School District, the largest school district in Franklin County and the school district that met the lowest percentage of state standards: 20 percent. In aggregate, the charter schools in Franklin County met even fewer state standards: 18.5 percent. In Franklin County, only three charter schools that met more than one state standard met 50 percent of the standards that were calculated: Graham School met nine of 12 standards, Great Western met five of six, and Upper Arlington I.B. met six of six. The other 33 charter schools in Franklin County met only 12.4 percent of state standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 102} Whether charter schools are the answer to failing public schools has not been settled, though the early results are not especially encouraging. Still, the Ohio Constitution does not prohibit the establishment of charter schools. What the Ohio Constitution does prohibit is an excessive reliance on locally raised funds to finance public schools. <em>DeRolph v. State </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 193, 677 N.E.2d 733; <em>DeRolph v. State </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 1, 728 N.E.2d 993; and <em>DeRolph v. State, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 434, 2002-Ohio-6750, 780 N.E.2d 529. Irrespective of the noble intentions of charter-school legislation, one undeniable effect is that public schools receive less state money than they would in the absence of charter schools. The mathematically unavoidable result is that public schools receive a greater percentage of their funding from local sources, which is unconstitutional pursuant to our <em>DeRolph </em>decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 103} Finally, if charter schools are to be part of a thorough and efficient system of common schools \u2014 as they must \u2014 then they should be held to the same standards as public schools. Though the General Assembly has taken steps in that direction, it is clear, as the majority opinion concedes and as Justice Resnick\u2019s dissenting opinion explains in detail, that charter schools are currently exempt from many standards that public schools are required to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 104} I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahs\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 105} In my view, this court has prematurely accepted review over a very limited but important constitutional issue regarding the establishment and operation of community schools statewide, and the majority has considered it on a scant record. Even a cursory reading of the majority and dissenting opinions reveals the complexity of the issue and the divergent positions taken by the members of the judiciary who have reviewed it at all levels. Regrettably, appellants have not fully developed this record, as the trial court originally bifurcated the case into the legal issues, which are allegedly before us, and the remaining factual issues, which are still before the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 106} The better course would have been to deny review and later accept the case in its entirety. The majority opinion states, \u201cThe appellants have not presented clear and convincing evidence that community schools are raiding local funds that school districts are otherwise entitled to receive.\u201d \u00b6 39. Justice Resnick\u2019s opinion assumes the point, stating that R.C. Chapter 3314 \u201ccreates a jumble of ad hoc community schools that flourish on state funds otherwise inuring to the account of district schools.\u201d \u00b6 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 107} I cannot understand how a constitutional review of a legal issue may be resolved on a yet-to-be-developed record of whether local or state tax money is or is not being diverted to community schools under the funding formula. This appears to me to be a factual question capable of being resolved by presentation of evidence, and the court of appeals, at least in part, so held.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 108} I did not vote to accept this case, because I believed the record needed development, despite the entreaties from both parties to resolve the constitutional issue. I still believe that to be the correct course for this court to follow, i.e., to dismiss this appeal as having been improvidently accepted, to await further record development, and to approach the entire case on a complete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">{\u00b6 109} I would therefore dismiss this appeal as having been improvidently accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"AqX\">{\u00b6 110} According to the Legislative Service Commission memorandum No. R-125-1824, community schools are <em>not </em>exempt from the requirements of the following Revised Code sections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">{\u00b6 111} \u201c9.90 and 9.91 Provision regarding insurance benefits for educational employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>{\u00b6 112} \u201cChapter 102 Ohio Ethics Law (except that a member of a community school governing board specifically may also be an employee of the board and may have an interest in a board-executed contract that is not a contract with a for-profit firm for the operation of management of a school under the auspices of the governing board (R.C. 3314.03(A)(ll)(e)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">{\u00b6 113} \u201c109.65, 3313.672, and 3313.96 Requirements for missing children reporting, information, and student fingerprinting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AML\">{\u00b6 114} \u201cChapter 117.
