One bullet killed three-month-old Jiyen Dent Jr., who was in the living room. John E. Drummond Jr., was indicted, tried, and convicted by a jury of the aggravated murder of the infant Jiyen.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">{\u00b6 2} Drummond was charged with two counts of aggravated murder. Count One charged Drummond with the aggravated murder of Jiyen with prior calculation and design. Count Two charged Drummond with aggravated murder for purposely causing the death of a child under 13 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-15\">{\u00b6 3} Both counts included death-penalty specifications for a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of, or attempt to kill, two or more persons, R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>2929.04(A)(5), and murder of a child under 13 years of age, R.C. 2929.04(A)(9). Drummond was also charged with attempted murder in Counts Three and Four, felonious assault in Counts Five and Six, and improperly discharging a firearm in Count Seven. Each count included a firearm specification. Count Eight, having a weapon while under a disability, was severed from the other counts and later dismissed. Drummond\u2019s friend, Wayne Gilliam, was indicted, tried, and convicted in a separate case and was sentenced to 54 years to life in prison. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State v. Gilliam, </em>Mahoning App. No. 03-MA-176, 2005-Ohio-2791, 2005 WL 1324751.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">{\u00b6 4} Drummond now appeals his convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\n<em>State\u2019s Evidence at Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">{\u00b6 5} The state presented several witnesses who testified at Drummond\u2019s trial that Drummond and Brett Schroeder were members of the Lincoln Knolls Crips gang and considered themselves \u201coriginal gangsters,\u201d or \u201cOGs.\u201d Schroeder died from gunshot wounds in May 1998 in a death ruled a homicide. The perpetrator was convicted and is serving time in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">{\u00b6 6} The Dent family, Jiyen Dent Sr., Latoya Butler, his girlfriend, and their son, Jiyen Dent Jr., had moved into a home at 74 Rutledge Drive in Youngstown around March 20, 1998. Dent did not know Drummond, Gilliam, or Schroeder.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">{\u00b6 7} In the early evening of the shooting, a few days after Dent moved in, ten to 20 people gathered for a party outside the home of Gail Miller on Duncan Avenue in Youngstown to drink and listen to music. Sometime that evening, Drummond and Gilliam arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">{\u00b6 8} During the party, James \u201cCricket\u201d Rozenblad overheard Drummond, Gilliam, and Andre Bryant talking about a \u201cguy moving in in [their] neighborhood [who] could have had something to do with the death of Brett Schroeder.\u201d Yaraldean Thomas also saw Drummond and Gilliam whispering to one another and heard Drummond say \u201cIt\u2019s on\u201d after they finished talking.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">{\u00b6 9} Drummond left the party and returned a short time later with an assault rifle. He and Gilliam then got into Gilliam\u2019s burgundy Chevrolet Monte Carlo and drove down Duncan Lane toward Rutledge Drive. Approximately five to 15 minutes later, 11 shots were fired from an assault rifle into the Dent home. Within a few seconds, a 9 mm round was fired into the Dent home, and five 9 mm rounds were fired into the home of Diane Patrick, the Dents\u2019 next-door neighbor, who lived at 76 Rutledge Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-13\">{\u00b6 10} At around 11:25 p.m. that evening, Dent was in the living room watching a movie, Butler was in the kitchen, and Jiyen was in a baby swing in the living room. While watching TV, Dent heard gunshots and saw \u201cbullets start coming through the windows and the walls.\u201d He then picked up the baby and ran down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the hallway towards the bathroom. Dent fell in the hallway and noticed that Jiyen had been shot in the head. After making sure that his girlfriend was safe, Dent called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">{\u00b6 11} That same night, Rebecca Perez, who lived nearby on Rutledge Drive, heard two series of shots when taking her trash outside. She saw shots coming from the corner of Duncan Lane and Rutledge Drive and noticed \u201ca shadow up the street.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Perez saw a maroon car pull out of the driveway next to 65 Rutledge Drive, where Drummond lived. The car then drove without any headlights on past the Perez home. Approximately half an hour to 45 minutes later, Perez noticed that the maroon car had returned to the driveway next to Drummond\u2019s home. At trial, Perez identified Gilliam\u2019s Monte Carlo as the car she had seen that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">{\u00b6 12} Leonard Schroeder, the brother of Brett Schroeder, who had been killed nearly five years before, lived near Rutledge Drive. On the evening of March 24, Leonard heard a series of gunshots. Shortly afterwards, Drummond and Gilliam arrived at Leonard\u2019s home in Gilliam\u2019s car. Leonard asked Drummond about the shots, and Drummond said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know who it is. It was probably Cricket and Wany.\u201d Gilliam said only that \u201csome fools are shooting over there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">{\u00b6 13} Arriving police and paramedics found that Jiyen had been killed. Investigators secured the scene and began their investigation. Officer Kerry Wigley walked down Rutledge Drive, looking for shell casings, and noticed two men in the dark, leaning against a car parked in a driveway. Wigley intercepted the two men, asked for their identification, and identified them as Drummond and Gilliam.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">{\u00b6 14} During the investigation, Patrolman David Wilson found ten cartridge casings from assault-rifle ammunition lying between two houses that were across the street and several houses away from the Dent home on Rutledge Drive. The police also found six 9 mm shell casings at the corner of Rutledge Drive and Duncan Lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">{\u00b6 15} Investigators found that someone had fired 11 bullets from an assault rifle into the Dent home. Three bullets had hit the house near the front door, three others had hit elsewhere on the front of the house, and five bullets had hit the west side of the house where the bedrooms were located. A 9 mm bullet hole was also found on the east side of the Dent home.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">{\u00b6 16} Ed Carlini, an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) agent, examined the trajectory of the bullets entering the Dent home. Carlini determined that the shots had originated from a location on Rutledge Drive where ten shell casings were found. He also determined that the 9 mm shot that hit the Dent home originated from east of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Carlini and Officer Anthony Marzullo, a crime lab technician, examined bullet holes inside the Dent home. There were five bullet holes inside the southwest bedroom and three bullet holes inside the northwest bedroom. One bullet entered the living room, fragmented, and was found in the far living-room wall. A 9 mm slug was found in the kitchen wall. Marzullo recovered other bullet fragments and copper-jacketed slugs inside the house. He also recovered bullet fragments and bits of blue plastic that had been removed from the victim during the autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">{\u00b6 18} Andrew Chappell, a ballistics expert, compared the ten 7.62 x 39 mm assault-rifle cartridge casings and concluded that they could have been fired from the same firearm. He stated that an assault rifle such as an AK-47 semiautomatic rifle would have fired this ammunition. Chappell examined the six 9 mm cartridge casings and concluded that each of the casings had been fired from the same firearm. Chappell also examined the slugs and bullet fragments obtained from the Dent home and identified one 9 mm Luger bullet, a 7.62 mm bullet, a 7.62 mm bullet jacket fragment, a piece of metal, and a couple of lead fragments. He determined that the 7.62 bullet and the 7.62' bullet jacket fragment were fired from the same weapon, but he was unable to make any comparisons with the lead fragment and the blue plastic recovered from the victim at the autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">{\u00b6 19} As the murder investigation progressed, Drummond and Gilliam were identified as suspects. On March 27, 2003, the police searched Drummond\u2019s Rutledge Drive residence and arrested him. When he was arrested, Drummond told police \u201cthat he had nothing to do with the shooting of the baby. He was on Duncan Lane that night and heard gunshots and he walked to Rutledge to see what had happened.\u201d During the search, the police seized a drum containing 75 rounds of 7.62 x 39 mm ammunition, three boxes containing 46 rounds of 7.62 x 39 mm ammunition, a single round of 7.62 x 39 mm ammunition, an empty AK magazine, a Taurus 9 mm handgun with no barrel, a bulletproof vest, and several rounds of 9 mm, .45 caliber, and .357 caliber ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">{\u00b6 20} During the search of Drummond\u2019s residence, police also seized an album of gang photographs of the Lincoln Knolls Crips. Drummond appears in many photographs. The album also contained a number of photographs and tributes to Brett Schroeder and other members of the gang who had been killed. One page of the album shows two photographs of Drummond with a cake that says, \u201cRIP Brett.\u201d Another photograph shows tattoos of guns, tombstones, and other symbols on Drummond\u2019s back. The tombstone tattoo contains Schroeder\u2019s name and names of Drummond\u2019s other dead friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">{\u00b6 21} Dr. Dorothy Dean, Deputy Coroner for Franklin County, conducted the autopsy of three-month-old Jiyen. Dean testified that Jiyen died from a gunshot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>wound to the head. The entry wound was on the back of Jiyen\u2019s head, and the exit wound was just below the left eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">{\u00b6 22} Between March and August 2003, Chauncey Walker and Drummond were incarcerated in the same cellblock at the Mahoning County jail. Drummond talked to Walker about his case almost \u201c[ejvery single day.\u201d Walker testified, \u201c[A]s soon as he\u2019d come out of his cell, he\u2019d come directly to my cell * * * [and] he\u2019d be talking to me about that case.\u201d As to what happened on March 24, Drummond told Walker that he \u201cwas sitting in his sister[\u2019s] driveway and Wayne pulled up, and * * * he asked Wayne to take him to go get a gun somewhere. * * * So Wayne gave him a ride to go get the gun. * * * [W]hen Wayne backed up in the driveway after he * * * got the gun, the dude, Jiyen, supposed to have stayed * * * a couple houses up from his sister or right around the corner, * * * [and] he said he got out the car and fired some shots at the house and then he got back in the car and pulled off.\u201d Drummond told Walker that \u201che intended to hurt whoever the bullet hit,\u201d but \u201che didn\u2019t intend to kill no baby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">{\u00b6 23} Nathaniel Morris was another inmate in the same cellblock with Drummond and Walker. During May 2003, Morris overheard Drummond tell Walker that \u201che didn\u2019t meant [sic] to kill the baby; he was trying to get at somebody else * * *.\u201d On more than one occasion, Morris overheard Drummond asking Walker, \u201c[Y]ou think I\u2019m going to get convicted on this, you think they have anything on me, stuff like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\n<em>Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">{\u00b6 24} Drummond called five witnesses. William Harris, an inmate at the Mahoning County jail, was incarcerated in a cell adjacent to Walker\u2019s. He said that in March 2003, Walker told Harris that \u201che knew how [Walker] could get outta of jail. [Walker] would have to go over and talk to the prosecutor and say that John [Drummond] admitted to his part in the case.\u201d Harris also said that Walker\u2019s cell was some distance from Drummond\u2019s cell and that Drummond and Walker \u201ccouldn\u2019t talk unless they yelled across the range.\u201d On another occasion, Harris saw Walker enter Drummond\u2019s cell after he \u201ctold the deputy he was gonna get a magazine, and he come out with [Drummond\u2019s] discovery pack [i.e., court papers].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">{\u00b6 25} Elisa Rodriguez, who lived next door to Drummond on Rutledge Drive, testified that on the evening of March 24, she was at home with her eight-year-old son. Rodriguez observed Gilliam\u2019s car parked in front of her house. While in her back bedroom, she heard voices, looked into the back yard, and saw Gilliam and a \u201ctall, skinny guy.\u201d She saw them walk towards the front of her home and then heard shooting. Rodriguez and her son went to the living room, looked out the front window, and saw Gilliam standing in her neighbor\u2019s front yard shooting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>a \u201cbig gun\u201d at a house across the street. Rodriguez said that after the shooting stopped, Gilliam got into his car alone and fled the scene. Rodriguez then saw Jawany, who was a \u201ctall, skinny black man\u201d from the neighborhood, running down Rutledge Drive shooting a gun. She next said that she heard Jawany firing his last gunshot in front of the Dent home and saw him flee down an alleyway between two houses. Rodriguez testified that she did not see Drummond in the area when the gunshots were fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">{\u00b6 26} Rodriguez\u2019s son, Jimmy Figuera, testified that on that evening, he heard gunshots while at home with his mother. He looked out the front window and saw Wayne shooting a \u201cbig\u201d gun. He then saw \u201cWayne cornin\u2019 down the street shootin\u2019 from Duncan.\u201d Jimmy did not see Drummond, whom he referred to as \u201cUncle J,\u201d when the shootings took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\n<em>Trial Result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">{\u00b6 27} The jury found Drummond guilty as charged, and Drummond was sentenced to death. Drummond now appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\n<em>Pretrial and Trial Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">{\u00b6 28} Pursuant to our order on November 4, 2005, the parties submitted supplemental briefs on the issue of whether Drummond was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Facts of Public-Trial Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">{\u00b6 29} Following a luncheon recess on February 4, 2004, the trial court announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-12\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cLadies and gentlemen that are here to watch the trial, the Court is going to clear the courtroom for the remainder of the afternoon. You are invited back tomorrow morning at 9 o\u2019clock in the morning. Okay? Deputies, clear the courtroom. And leave the building, not only to leave the courtroom but leave the building.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">{\u00b6 31} Afterwards, the trial court explained why it cleared the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-14\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cThe Court: It\u2019s come to the attention of the Court that some of the jurors \u2014 or witnesses feel threatened by some of the spectators in the court. The Court\u2019s making a decision that until we get through the next couple of witnesses I\u2019m going to clear the courtroom. That includes the victim\u2019s family, the defendant\u2019s family and all other spectators. The Court had two incidents yesterday involving one of the spectators where he showed total disrespect to the Court in chambers and gave the deputies a very hard time. I didn\u2019t hold him in contempt of court, but just after that then another individual \u2014 there was a physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>altercation between that individual who also came to watch the trial. His name\u2019s Damian Williams. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-5\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe Court: Who ultimately got charged with assault on a peace officer. So over the objection of the defendant I\u2019m clearing the courtroom just for today only. Mr. Gentile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c[Defense Counsel] Mr. Gentile: * * * We would object to the Court\u2019s ruling. The defendant is entitled to a public trial under the United States Constitution. I don\u2019t disagree that there has been some sort of misconduct here that has been brought to my attention. However, that has not been attributable to the defendant, to Mr. Drummond, and we, therefore, don\u2019t think that he should be punished in terms of not having the support, people \u2014 his family, that in the nature of this case, a capital case, that he would require making.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-7\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThe Court: Just to perfect the record, I do believe that the one individual who was not charged with contempt of court yesterday, Michael Peace, is in fact John Drummond\u2019s brother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-8\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c[Prosecuting Attorney] Mr. Franken: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe Court: No?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cMr. Franken: Michael Peace says he\u2019s family. Others have said he isn\u2019t. He told Deputy Schmuck that he was family to Drummond. He\u2019s not a brother though.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-11\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe Court: Right. And we go back to when we were seating the jury and John Drummond approached a potential juror\u2019s husband in the jail, so. There\u2019s been a string of things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-12\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-13\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe Court: * * * We would all agree that the media is permitted in so at least we have a record by a disinterested outside source.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">{\u00b6 43} In an entry dated February 5, the trial court stated, \u201cDue to the behavior of some of the Courtroom spectators and the fear of retaliation expressed by various witnesses, the Court, upon motion of the State, ordered all spectators removed from the Court for the duration of February 4, 2004 beginning at 1:30 p.m. This over the objection of the Defendant. The media will be permitted access.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">{\u00b6 44} The cross-examination of James \u201cCricket\u201d Rozenblad and the testimony of two other prosecution witnesses, Nathaniel Morris and Yaraldean Thomas, occurred while the courtroom was closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-16\">{\u00b6 45} Before Leonard Schroeder\u2019s testimony the next day, the trial court announced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>{\u00b6 46} \u201cThe Court: * * * We\u2019re going to continue on with the testimony. And at this time I\u2019m going to clear the courtroom until another witness is called. So for the people that are spectators in the courtroom, you may remain in the courthouse but you probably will not be permitted back in till about quarter till 3:00 or so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">{\u00b6 47} In an entry that day, the trial court stated, \u201cDue to the safety concerns expressed by witness Leonard Schroeder Jr., the Court ordered the Courtroom closed (February 5, 2004) to all except the media during his testimony only. This without objection from either party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">{\u00b6 48} Schroeder then testified while the courtroom was partially closed. The spectators were allowed to return to the courtroom following his testimony, and the trial resumed without any further closure.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Discussion of Public-Trial Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">{\u00b6 49} The right to a public trial is a fundamental constitutional guarantee under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution. See <em>State v. Lane </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 112, 119, 14 O.O.3d 342, 397 N.E.2d 1338. This guarantee is a \u201ccornerstone of our democracy which should not be circumvented unless there are extreme overriding circumstances.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">{\u00b6 50} The violation of the right to a public trial is considered structural error and not subject to harmless-error analysis. <em>Waller v. Georgia </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 39, 49-50, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31, fn. 9; <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 461, 468-469, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718. A structural error is a \u201cdefect affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 310, 111 S.Ct. 1246,113 L.Ed.2d 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">{\u00b6 51} The right to a public trial is not absolute, and in some instances must yield to other interests, such as those essential to the administration of justice. A trial judge has authority to exercise control over the proceedings and the discretion to impose control over the proceedings. Nonetheless, the abridgement of a defendant\u2019s right to a public trial may occur only when necessary, and any closure must be narrowly drawn and applied sparingly. See <em>State ex rel. The Repository, Div. of Thompson Newspapers, Inc. v. Unger </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 418, 421, 28 OBR 472, 504 N.E.2d 37; <em>Lane, </em>60 Ohio St.2d at 121, 14 O.O.3d 342, 397 N.E.2d 1338; <em>State v. Clifford </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 207, 213, 733 N.E.2d 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">{\u00b6 52} In <em>Waller, </em>in the context of a suppression hearing, the United States Supreme Court set forth the following four-pronged test that courts must use to determine whether closure of a courtroom is necessary: \u201cthe party seeking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 U.S. at 48, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">{\u00b6 53} <em>Waller </em>dealt with the suppression hearing during which \u2022 all persons other than witnesses, court personnel, the parties, and their lawyers were excluded for the entire duration. Id. at 42, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31. This case differs, as it deals with partial closure of a trial. The trial court excluded members of the public and the defendant\u2019s family, but did so only for the length of a single cross-examination and two other witnesses\u2019 testimony. The trial court permitted media representatives to remain in the courtroom throughout the testimony of these witnesses. Federal courts have concluded that when a trial judge orders a partial, as opposed to a total, closure of a court proceeding, a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d rather than Waller\u2019s \u201coverriding interest\u201d will justify the closure. See <em>Woods v. Kuhlmann </em>(C.A.2, 1992), 977 F.2d 74, 76; <em>United States v. Sherlock </em>(C.A.9, 1989), 962 F.2d 1349, 1357; <em>Nieto v. Sullivan </em>(C.A.10, 1989), 879 F.2d 743, 753; <em>Douglas v. Wainwright </em>(C.A.11, 1984), 739 F.2d 531, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">{\u00b6 54} The trial court\u2019s closure order on February 4, 2004, satisfied the <em>Waller </em>criteria. First, the trial court\u2019s interest in maintaining courtroom security and protecting witness safety supported the trial court\u2019s limited closure of the courtroom. There had been a physical altercation between a spectator and courtroom deputies, and a second incident occurred in the judge\u2019s chambers. The trial court also stated that \u201cthe fear of retaliation expressed by various witnesses\u201d was a basis for its action. In this regard, we acknowledge the dangerous nature of gang violence and the genuine need to protect witnesses testifying against gang members from the deadly threat of retaliation. Cf. <em>Brown v. Kuhlmann </em>(C.A.2,1998), 142 F.3d 529, 537-538 (concern for undercover officer\u2019s safety in testifying against drug dealers justified partial closure where closure was brief and testimony given during the closure was merely corroborative). Thus, the trial court had a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d to order the partial closure of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">{\u00b6 55} Second, the closure was no broader than necessary. The courtroom was closed only while Rozenblad was cross-examined and while Morris and Thomas testified. Spectators were readmitted afterwards. Also, the trial judge provided expressly that the media could remain in the courtroom during the testimony of all these witnesses. The media presence helped safeguard Drummond\u2019s right to a public trial. Indeed, the witnesses\u2019 awareness of the media minimizes the risk that they would alter their testimony when the proceeding was partially closed. Moreover, the transcript of the trial became a public record. In sum, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>none of the secrecy prohibited by the Sixth Amendment. See <em>United States v. Sherlock, </em>962 F.2d at 1358.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">{\u00b6 56} Drummond contends that the closure was overly broad because his family was excluded from the courtroom along with the general public during the testimony of these three witnesses. The Supreme Court has noted a special concern for allowing a defendant\u2019s family members to attend a trial. See <em>In re Oliver </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 257, 272, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682 (\u201can accused is at the very least entitled to have his friends, relatives and counsel present, no matter with what offense he may be charged\u201d); see, also, <em>Vidal v. Williams </em>(C.A.2, 1994), 31 F.3d 67, 69. Although we do not condone the removal of family members from the courtroom, in this case, we hold that the trial court\u2019s decision in excluding them for a limited time, after considering the defendant\u2019s rights and the need to protect witnesses, did not violate Drummond\u2019s right to a public trial. See <em>Sherlock, </em>962 F.2d at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">{\u00b6 57} With respect to the third <em>Waller </em>factor, the record does not show that the trial court considered alternatives to closure. However, the partial closure of the courtroom only during the cross-examination of Rozenblad and the testimony of Morris and Thomas is narrower than full closure for the entire trial. See <em>Brown, </em>142 F.3d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">{\u00b6 58} As to the final <em>Waller </em>factor of adequate findings, the trial court stated that there had been a physical altercation between spectators and courtroom deputies. The trial court also mentioned that another incident had occurred in the judge\u2019s chambers and that witnesses had expressed fear of retaliation by testifying in open court. The trial court also identified Damian Williams and Michael Peace as involved in the earlier disturbances. Although the trial court should have made additional findings to clarify the reasons for closing the court, the strength of the judge\u2019s actual findings must be evaluated in reference to the limited scope of the closure. By that standard, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings were adequate. See <em>Brown, </em>142 F.3d at 538; Woods, 977 F.2d at 77-78 (the fourth <em>Waller </em>factor was satisfied, despite the lack of specific findings of fact, where the \u201cinformation gleaned\u201d from the record was \u201csufficient to support the partial, temporary closure of petitioner\u2019s trial\u201d). There was a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d for the partial closure, partial closure of the courtroom was narrowly drawn and limited in scope, and the trial court made sufficient findings in support of its order. Under these circumstances, where there is an interest in maintaining courtroom order and security, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering the limited closure of the courtroom. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not violate Drummond\u2019s constitutional right to a public trial by closing the trial on the afternoon of February 4, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>{\u00b6 59} Regarding closure on February 5, 2004, the defense did not object to the trial court\u2019s action. Defense counsel were present during the entire proceedings and were fully aware of the exclusion of the spectators from the courtroom. Thus, counsel\u2019s failure to object to the closing of the courtroom constitutes a waiver of the right to a public trial during Schroeder\u2019s testimony. See <em>Peretz v. United States </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 923, 936, 111 S.Ct. 2661, 115 L.Ed.2d 808, citing <em>Levine v. United States </em>(1960), 362 U.S. 610, 619, 80 S.Ct. 1038, 4 L.Ed.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">{\u00b6 60} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that Drummond\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial was not violated by the partial closure of his trial on February 4 and February 5, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">{\u00b6 61} <em>Jury view. </em>In proposition of law VII, Drummond argues that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting opening statements prior to a jury view. He also argues that the jury view was conducted improperly because the jurors were separated into groups when viewing the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">{\u00b6 62} R.C. 2945.16 provides, \u201cWhen it is proper for the jurors to have a view of the place at which a material fact occurred, the trial court may order them to be conducted in a body, under the charge of the sheriff or other officer, to such place, which shall be shown to them by a person designated by the court.\u201d Furthermore, the \u201ctrial court is vested with a broad discretion in such matters, and its judgment will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Zuem </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 58, 512 N.E.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">{\u00b6 63} In this case, the parties agreed that opening statements would be made before the jury view. Thus, Drummond invited any error that occurred and cannot complain. <em>State v. Seiber </em>(1990), 56 Ohio St.3d 4, 17, 564 N.E.2d 408; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 535, 747 N.E.2d 765. Moreover, trial counsel objected to neither the prosecutor\u2019s references to the jury view during his opening statement nor the separation of the jurors into groups at the scene. Thus, Drummond waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">{\u00b6 64} We find no plain error. R.C. 2945.16 does not prohibit jury views after opening statements have been presented. The trial court properly exercised its discretion by allowing opening statements before the jury view because the parties agreed to do so. See <em>State v. Watson </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 1, 10-11, 572 N.E.2d 97 (no abuse of discretion by allowing the jury to view the scene a second time, <em>after </em>it had already begun deliberations).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">{\u00b6 65} Drummond has also not demonstrated how the presentation of opening statements before the jury view prejudiced him. The trial court instructed the jury that opening statements were not evidence, but a \u201cconcise and orderly description of each side\u2019s claim and defense and the evidence they expect to be produced in support of those claims and defenses.\u201d Similarly, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>advised the jurors that the \u201conly purpose of [the jury view] is to help [them] understand the evidence as it is presented in the courtroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">{\u00b6 66} No plain error occurred when the jurors were divided into groups during the jury view. Before leaving for the jury view, the trial court advised the jurors: \u201cBecause of the conditions and the size of the home, probably only four to six jurors will leave the bus at one time. So you\u2019ll be told accordingly to go in and look around. You may not ask any questions. Bernice will be pointing things out to you that the attorneys have asked her to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">{\u00b6 67} Drummond interprets the R.C. 2945.16 phrase that the \u201cthe trial court may order them to be conducted in a body\u201d to require that the jurors not be separated at the crime scene. However, separate viewing was the only means of getting all the jurors inside the Dent home to view the crime scene. Drummond does not claim that the separate groups were shown different parts of the house or given briefings once inside. Thus, Drummond has failed to demonstrate error. Cf. <em>State v. Collins </em>(Jan. 5, 2001), Greene App. No. 2000 CA 8, 2001 WL 9924, *3 (two separate vehicles taking jurors to jury view did not result in prejudicial error).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">{\u00b6 68} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">{\u00b6 69} <em>\u201cOther acts\u201d evidence. </em>In proposition of law I, Drummond argues that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his gang-related activity. Drummond also argues that the trial court erred by admitting ammunition and a bulletproof vest seized from his residence that were not clearly linked to the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">{\u00b6 70} 1. Gang-related evidence. During a search of Drummond\u2019s bedroom, the police seized a photo album of Drummond\u2019s gang-related activity with the Lincoln Knolls Crips. Album photos and other loose photos in the book showed Drummond making gang-related hand gestures. The pictures revealed gang-related tattoos on his back. Drummond\u2019s tattoos included a tombstone with the name of deceased gang members, including Brett Schroeder. The photo album also contained obituary notices and tributes to deceased gang members, including Brett Schroeder.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">{\u00b6 71} Detective Sergeant Michael Lambert, a Youngstown police gang-unit detective, described the photo album as a \u201cgang book\u201d and testified what the police learned from such materials. Over defense objection, the trial court admitted the photo album.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">{\u00b6 72} Other prosecution witnesses discussed Drummond\u2019s gang-related activities as a member of the Lincoln Knolls Crips. William and Wanda Greer live near the location of the shooting. Wanda testified that Drummond and other members of the Lincoln Knolls Crips would hang around their street. William <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>testified that the outline of a tombstone with the initials RIP was carved on a tree in front of their home as a tribute to \u201cBrett.\u201d The defense, however, failed to object to this testimony and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">{\u00b6 73} Rozenblad testified over defense objection that Drummond and Brett Schroeder were members of the Lincoln Knolls Crips. The defense did not object to the testimony of Yaraldean Thomas, who also identified Drummond and Schroeder as members of the Lincoln Knolls Crips and stated that they considered themselves \u201cOGs.\u201d The failure to object to Thomas\u2019s testimony waives all but plain error. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">{\u00b6 74} Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\u201d a defendant\u2019s character in order to show criminal propensity. \u201cIt may, however, be admissible * * * [to show] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Furthermore, \u201c[t]he admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">{\u00b6 75} The state\u2019s theory of this case was that Drummond, a member of the Lincoln Knolls Crips, fired shots into the Dent home to retaliate for the murder of Schroeder, a fellow gang member. Evidence relating to Drummond\u2019s and Schroeder\u2019s gang involvement therefore was admissible to prove Drummond\u2019s motive for firing shots into the Dent home. See <em>United States v. Santiago </em>(C.A.9, 1995), 46 F.3d 885, 889; <em>State v. Lewis </em>(Dec. 26, 1991), Cuyahoga App. No. 59465,1991 WL 281001, *6. Drummond\u2019s tattoo with Schroeder\u2019s name inside a tombstone, the tombstone carved on the tree in Schroeder\u2019s memory, and Drummond\u2019s photo album with obituary notices and tributes to Schroeder were relevant to prove motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">{\u00b6 76} Drummond\u2019s photo album and testimony from other witnesses provided evidence of the Lincoln Knolls Crips culture, symbols, hand gestures, and traditions. This evidence provided the context, motive, and set-up of the crime and was admissible \u201cto make the actions of the participants understandable to the jurors.\u201d <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 113; see, also, <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 69, 723 N.E.2d 1019. Background information about the Lincoln Knolls Crips showed the jury how the belief that Dent was somehow responsible for Schroeder\u2019s death explained why Drummond shot into the home of a person he had never met. <em>United States v. Mills </em>(C.A.11, 1983), 704 F.2d 1553, 1559; <em>State v. Carillo </em>(Oct. 13, 2000), Clark App. No. 00CA0025, 2000 WL 1513912, *3.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">{\u00b6 77} Drummond argues that gang testimony was not admissible because Dent testified during cross-examination that he did not know Schroeder or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Drummond and did not know why shots would be fired at his house. Other testimony, however, indicated that retaliation for Schroeder\u2019s murder motivated Drummond to fire shots into the Dent home. Rozenblad testified that he had overheard Drummond and Gilliam talking about \u201ca guy moving in in [their] neighborhood [who] could have had something to do with the death of Brett Schroeder.\u201d Thomas heard \"Drummond say \u201cIt\u2019s on\u201d after Drummond and Gilliam had finished their discussion. Finally, within a few minutes after this discussion, Drummond drove to Rutledge Drive and fired shots into the Dent home.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">{\u00b6 78} Drummond also argues that the trial court erred by failing to give cautionary instructions on the photo album and the other gang-related testimony until final instructions. However, \u201c \u2018the trial judge need not at that early stage completely instruct the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 285, 731 N.E.2d 159, quoting <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 164, 694 N.E.2d 932. During final instructions, the trial court did instruct the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-6\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cDuring the course of the trial, evidence was received about the commission of other acts other than the offenses with which the defendant is charged in this trial. That evidence was received only for a limited purpose. It was not received, and you may not consider it to prove the character of the defendant in order that it show that he acted in conformity or in accordance with the character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-7\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cIf you find the evidence of the other acts is true and that the defendant committed it, you may consider that evidence only for the purpose of deciding whether it proves the absence of mistake or the defendant\u2019s intent or purpose to commit the offense charged in this trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">{\u00b6 81} In light of these instructions and the probative value of the photo album and the other gang-related testimony, we hold that the trial court committed no plain error in admitting the gang-related testimony of the Greers and Thomas. Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in permitting Rozenblad\u2019s testimony and admitting the photo album.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">{\u00b6 82} 2. Admissibility of Drummond\u2019s ammunition and bulletproof vest. During a search of Drummond\u2019s residence, the police seized a drum containing 75 rounds of 7.62 x 39 mm ammunition, three boxes containing 46 rounds of 7.62 x 39 mm ammunition, a single round of 7.62 x 39 mm ammunition, and an empty AK magazine. Police also seized a Taurus 9 mm handgun with no barrel, a bulletproof vest, and several rounds of 9 mm, .45 caliber, and .357 caliber ammunition. Drummond argues that this evidence was not relevant because the state failed to fink this ammunition to the shell casings found near the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>{\u00b6 83} The admission of Drummond\u2019s ammunition rested upon a question of relevance. Evid.R. 401 provides: \u201c \u2018Relevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. See <em>Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">{\u00b6 84} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the ammunition and the 9 mm handgun seized from Drummond\u2019s residence. Drummond\u2019s possession of numerous rounds of ammunition shortly after the murder tended to prove that he had timely access to the means to commit the murder. In addition, Drummond\u2019s possession of 7.62 x 39 mm rounds of ammunition tended to prove that he had access to a weapon of the type used to kill Jiyen. See <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 281, 754 N.E.2d 1150 (defendant\u2019s set of knives admissible as showing his easy access to a possible murder weapon and his familiarity with using knives). Further, Drummond\u2019s possession of a 9 mm handgun and 9 mm ammunition was relevant because a 9 mm weapon was fired at the Dent home on the evening of March 24. The bulletproof vest was of questionable relevance, but its admission did not result in prejudicial error in view of other evidence establishing Drummond\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">{\u00b6 85} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">{\u00b6 86} <em>Impeachment. </em>In proposition of law II, Drummond claims that the trial court erred by refusing to permit his counsel to cross-examine Rozenblad, Morris, and Thomas about criminal charges pending against each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">{\u00b6 87} Rozenblad. Trial counsel moved to cross-examine Rozenblad about pending drug charges to show his potential bias. The prosecutor then informed the court that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s an open case\u201d and that Rozenblad had not been indicted. The trial court ruled that Rozenblad could not be cross-examined \u201cabout pending charges in municipal court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">{\u00b6 88} During a later defense proffer, Rozenblad testified that he had been charged with trafficking in marijuana and had waived a preliminary hearing. Rozenblad also stated that he had not made any deals with the state in exchange for his testimony and did not expect to receive a benefit on his charges if he testified against Drummond.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">{\u00b6 89} Morris. Trial counsel sought to cross-examine Morris about pending charges for the offense of escape to show \u201chis bias or motive [for] pleasing the state.\u201d According to a defense proffer, Morris pleaded guilty to charges of cocaine possession. Morris was then \u201cput in a work release program and walked away from that place. He was then charged with escape.\u201d When Morris was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>stopped for traffic charges in Mahoning County, he was \u201cbooked * * * into the county jail on the drug cases and on the escape charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">{\u00b6 90} During the hearing, trial counsel provided the court with additional information about the disposition of the escape charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-7\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cMr. Gentile: * * * He was * * * charged with escape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cThe Court: But never convicted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cMr. Gentile: Was not convicted. When he came back\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-10\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cThe Court: \u2014to Columbus\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cMr. Gentile: \u2014it was dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">{\u00b6 96} The trial court ruled that the defense could not cross-examine Morris about the escape because \u201cthere\u2019s no conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">{\u00b6 97} Thomas. Trial counsel moved to cross-examine Thomas on pending drug charges to show his potential bias. Charges were pending against Thomas for a 1992 offense for possession of cocaine. The prosecutor informed the court that the charges \u201cwill be dismissed eventually\u201d because the case is old, and the evidence may no longer exist to support prosecution. The prosecutor also stated that no deals about the disposition of the drug charges had been made with Thomas. However, the trial counsel averred that three joint motions to continue the case had been filed. The trial court ruled that the defense could not question Thomas about the 1992 drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">{\u00b6 98} During a defense proffer, Michael Rich, Thomas\u2019s attorney, stated that Thomas was indicted on drug charges in 1992, but was never served with the indictment and never appeared for his arraignment. In 2003, Thomas was arrested when he was questioned about gang activity and the state discovered that he was wanted on the 1992 drug charges. Rich stated that the prosecutor indicated to him indirectly that \u201cbased on the length of the case, how old the case was, lack of evidence, that [Thomas\u2019s] case would get dismissed.\u201d However, Rich thought that the state \u201cwanted to keep some control over\u201d Thomas until he testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">{\u00b6 99} Drummond first argues that the trial court\u2019s rulings prohibiting cross-examination of Rozenblad, Morris, and Thomas on their pending charges violated Evid.R. 608(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">{\u00b6 100} Evid.R. 608(B) provides, \u201cSpecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness, other than conviction of a crime as provided in Evid.R. 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if <em>clearly probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, </em>be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness * * (Emphasis added.) The decision to admit evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>earlier misconduct of a witness for impeachment under Evid.R. 608(B) is \u201cwithin the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v.

Rozenblad\u2019s marijuana trafficking and Thomas\u2019s cocaine possession were not \u201cclearly probative\u201d of their character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. See <em>State v. Norwood </em>(Mar. 22, 2002), Lake App. No. 2000-L-146, 2002 WL 445839, *3 (cross-examination as to general drug use not clearly probative of truthfulness); see, also, Giannelli &amp; Snyder, Evidence (2d Ed.2001) 447, Section 608.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 102} Similarly, Morris\u2019s escape from a work-release program was not \u201cclearly probative of his character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.\u201d <em>Hamm v. State </em>(1990), 301 Ark. 154, 158, 782 S.W.2d 577 (\u201cAn escape is not probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness * * * under * * * Rule 608(b)\u201d); cf. <em>State v.

Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 152, 661 N.E.2d 1030; <em>State v. Hector </em>(1969), 19 Ohio St.2d 167, 48 O.O.2d 199, 249 N.E.2d 912, paragraph five of the syllabus (predates evidentiary rules); see 1 McCormick, Evidence (5th Ed.1999) 147, Section 39 (bias includes evidence that \u201can indictment is pending against [the witness], the witness has not been charged with a crime, has been promised leniency, * * * [or] is awaiting sentence\u201d); see, also, Giannelli <em>&amp; </em>Snyder, Evidence (2d Ed.2001) 562, Section 616.3. In <em>Hector, </em>we recognized, \u201c[T]he testimony of [a prosecution] witness is or may be influenced by the expectation or hope that, by aiding in the conviction of the defendant, he might be * * * rewarded by leniency in the disposition of his own case.\u201d 19 Ohio St.2d at 178, 48 O.O.2d 199, 249 N.E.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">{\u00b6 105} The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not permitting the defense to cross-examine Thomas about his pending drug charges. <em>State v. Webb </em>(Dec. 8, 1999), Summit App. No. 19318, 1999 WL 1215163, *1 (the trial court exercises broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence under Evid.R. 616). The defense had been informed before Drummond\u2019s trial that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>charges against Thomas would eventually be dismissed because of the age of the charges and the lack of evidence. There was no evidence that Thomas was offered a plea bargain or any other inducement to testify. Thus, the pending drug charges were not relevant in proving his bias in testifying against Drummond. See <em>State v. Gavin </em>(1977), 51 Ohio App.2d 49, 54, 5 O.O.3d 168, 365 N.E.2d 1263 (\u201ca stale charge is irrelevant to credibility because the element of pressure is not there\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">{\u00b6 106} The trial court also did not abuse its discretion by not allowing the defense to cross-examine Morris about the escape charge because those charges had already been dismissed. Thus, cross-examination about the dismissed charges would not have shown bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">{\u00b6 107} The trial court should have permitted the defense to cross-examine Rozenblad about his pending charges, however. Rozenblad had been charged with trafficking in marijuana, and an indictment was pending on the charges. Rozenblad said that no deals had been reached in exchange for his testimony and that he did not expect to receive a benefit on the charges if he testified against Drummond. Nevertheless, if the defense had been permitted the opportunity to question Rozenblad about the pending charges, the jury could have tested his credibility. See <em>State v. Durant, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 208, 2004-Ohio-6224, 823 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 34 (\u201cPrejudice ensues from <em>a denial of the opportunity </em>to place the witness in his proper setting and put the weight of his testimony and his credibility to a test * * *\u201d [Emphasis sic]).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">{\u00b6 108} Nonetheless, we hold that any error in denying cross-examination of Rozenblad was harmless. The trial court allowed counsel to fully cross-examine Rozenblad about all aspects of his activities on the night of the murders. Rozenblad admitted that over a period of five hours on March 24, he had taken six Valium and had drunk six beers. He acknowledged during cross-examination that he did not get along with Drummond, although he had been friends with Brett Schroeder. Thus, the jury knew that Rozenblad\u2019s perceptions on the night of the murder were affected by his drug and alcohol use. The jury also knew of motivations that might have influenced his testimony. See <em>Brooks, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 152, 661 N.E.2d 1030 (Evid.R. 616 violation resulted in harmless error where other concrete examples of the witness\u2019s truthfulness, or lack thereof, and motivations that might have influenced his testimony were presented to the jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">{\u00b6 109} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">{\u00b6 110} <em>Evidentiary and procedural issues. </em>In proposition of law V, Drummond argues that the trial court erred by admitting expert testimony on gangs and evidence of gang activity. He also argues that the trial court erred by refusing to grant a mistrial after the state improperly elicited a prejudicial comment from a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>{\u00b6 111} 1. Expert testimony on gang-related activities. Detective Sergeant Michael Lambert testified that Drummond and Brett Schroeder were members of the Lincoln Knolls Crips. He also described the photo album found during the search of Drummond\u2019s residence as a \u201cgang book\u201d because it included \u201cpictures and any other significant events that affected the gang.\u201d Lambert identified photos in the album of Drummond, Schroeder, and other gang members. He described a photo showing tattoos on Drummond\u2019s back as showing \u201ctombstones, guns, graffiti type stuff.\u201d Lambert also described gang-related hand signals that Drummond was making in some of the photos. Finally, he stated that Drummond and Schroeder were called original gangsters because they were original members of the gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 112} Drummond asserts that expert testimony on gangs was irrelevant. We disagree. Gang affiliation can be relevant in cases in which the interrelationship between people is a central issue. <em>United States v. Thomas </em>(C.A.7, 1996), 86 F.3d 647, 652; <em>United States v. Sloan </em>(C.A.10, 1995), 65 F.3d 149, 151. As we discussed in proposition I, evidence relating to Drummond\u2019s and Schroeder\u2019s gang involvement was admissible to prove Drummond\u2019s motive for firing shots into the Dent home. The evidence of the Lincoln Knolls Crips culture, symbols, hand gestures, and traditions provided the jury with crucial background information in considering the evidence. See <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 113} Drummond also argues that Lambert was not qualified as an expert witness and should not have been allowed to testify about gang-related activity. Under Evid.R. 702(B), an expert may be qualified by reason of his or her specialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to give an opinion that will assist the jury in understanding the evidence and determining a fact at issue. Neither special education nor certification is necessary to confer expert status upon a witness. The individual offered as an expert need not have complete knowledge of the field in question, as long as the knowledge he or she possesses will aid the trier of fact in performing its fact-finding function. <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">{\u00b6 114} Pursuant to Evid.R 104(A), the trial court determines whether an individual qualifies as an expert, and that determination will be overturned only for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 58, 4 OBR 144, 446 N.E.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">{\u00b6 115} While the state never formally tendered Lambert as an expert, defense counsel never challenged his qualifications to testify and thus waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B); <em>Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 286, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Here, there was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>{\u00b6 116} Lambert had worked in the gang unit for the Youngstown Police Department since 1999 and at the time of his testimony was in charge of the unit. Lambert gained his knowledge and experience about Youngstown gangs through investigating gang activities in the Youngstown area. Lambert\u2019s testimony showed that he possessed specialized knowledge about gang symbols, cultures, and traditions beyond that of the trier of fact. See <em>State v. Jefferson </em>(Mar. 21, 2001), Summit App. No. 20156, 2001 WL 276343, *5; <em>State v. Lewis </em>(Apr. 4,1997), Greene App. No. 96 CA 12, 1997 WL 156596, *6-7. Thus, Lambert was qualified to testify as an expert about gang-related matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 117} Finally, relying on <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, Drummond claims that the trial court erred by failing to conduct a hearing on the reliability of Lambert\u2019s testimony. However, Drummond never challenged the relevance and reliability of Lambert\u2019s testimony and waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Biros </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 426, 452, 678 N.E.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 118} In <em>Daubert, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that under Fed. R.Evid. 702, the trial judge has a special obligation to ensure that scientific testimony is not only relevant but reliable. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589-590, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469. In <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 137, 147, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238, the United States Supreme Court extended this gate-keeping obligation to include all expert testimony \u2014 i.e., testimony based on technical and other specialized knowledge. The court added that in assessing reliability, the trial court may, at its discretion, consider the <em>Daubert </em>factors to the extent relevant. Id. at 148, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">{\u00b6 119} Without a defense objection, the trial court was not required to conduct a hearing to determine the relevance and reliability of Lambert\u2019s testimony on gangs. In a similar case involving testimony by a police gang expert, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the <em>Daubert </em>factors (peer review, publication, potential error rate, etc.) do not apply to this kind of testimony. The court recognized that unlike scientific testimony, expert testimony about gangs depends heavily on the expert\u2019s knowledge and experience rather than on the expert\u2019s methodology and theory. <em>United States v. Hankey </em>(C.A.9, 2000), 203 F.3d 1160, 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 120} Nothing in Lambert\u2019s testimony about gangs raises any reliability question. His testimony was based on his knowledge and experience with the Lincoln Knolls Crips and its members. Thus, the trial court committed no plain error by admitting Lambert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">{\u00b6 121} 2. Gang-related evidence. Drummond renews his argument that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of his gang-related activity. However, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>we discussed in proposition I, the trial court committed neither plain error nor prejudicial error in admitting gang-related evidence against Drummond.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">{\u00b6 122} 3. Questioning of Dent. Drummond argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant a mistrial after the state asked a highly prejudicial question of Dent, the victim\u2019s father. During redirect examination of Dent, the prosecutor asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 123} \u201cQ: Mr. Gentile asked you a lot of questions. Do you think any of those questions that you were asked gives anyone permission to kill your son?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 124} \u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 125} \u201cMr. Gentile: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-8\">{\u00b6 126} \u201cThe Court: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-9\">{\u00b6 127} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-10\">{\u00b6 128} \u201cThe Court: The jurors are instructed to disregard the last question and answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">{\u00b6 129} The defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial because of the prosecutor\u2019s question was overruled. The trial court also instructed the jurors to disregard stricken evidence \u201cas though [they] never heard\u201d it during final jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">{\u00b6 130} The trial court did not err by refusing to grant a mistrial. While the prosecutor\u2019s question was improper, the trial court sustained the defense objection and immediately instructed the jury to disregard the testimony. Thus, the trial court\u2019s actions cured the effect of improper testimony. <em>State v. Heinish </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 231, 241, 553 N.E.2d 1026 (\u201cWhere a jury is cautioned and a correction is given to the jury, the effect of improper evidence may be cured\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">{\u00b6 131} Moreover, \u201c[m]istrials are necessary \u2018only when the ends of justice so require and a fair trial is no longer possible.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 105, quoting <em>State v. Garner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 49, 59, 656 N.E.2d 623. Here, Dent\u2019s isolated comment did not deny Drummond a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">{\u00b6 132} Accordingly, we reject proposition V.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">{\u00b6 133} <em>Due process claims. </em>In proposition of law VI, Drummond argues that he was denied due process and a fair trial because the trial court (1) failed to record all sidebar discussions, (2) permitted the state to ask witnesses leading questions during direct examination, (3) allowed Detective Lambert to provide hearsay testimony, and (4) improperly admitted a 911 tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">{\u00b6 134} 1. Unrecorded sidebar discussions. The record, including voir dire and both phases of the trial, reflects more than 130 unrecorded sidebar discussions. Drummond failed to object or ask that these sidebar discussions be recorded and thereby waived the issue. <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 182; <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 26, 752 N.E.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 135} \u201cThe requirement of a complete, full, and unabridged transcript in capital trials does not mean that the trial record must be perfect for purposes of appellate review.\u201d <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 687 N.E.2d 685, syllabus. We will not reverse because of unrecorded proceedings when the defendant failed to object and fails to demonstrate material prejudice. Id. at 554, 687 N.E.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 136} Nothing in the record substantiates Drummond\u2019s speculation that the unrecorded sidebar discussions dealt with substantial and important legal issues. Drummond has not shown, nor does the record reveal, that these conferences concerned matters vital to appellate review. See <em>Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 184; <em>Palmer, </em>80 Ohio St.3d at 554, 687 N.E.2d 685 (\u201cprejudice will not be presumed from the mere existence of * * * unrecorded bench and chambers conferences in capital cases\u201d). Based on the foregoing, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 137} 2. Leading questions. Drummond complains that the trial court erred by permitting the prosecutor to ask leading questions of Rozenblad, Morris, and Walker on direct examination, but cites no specific instance where improper leading questions were asked. Except where noted, defense counsel did not object to leading questions asked of the three witnesses and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 185, 190, 616 N.E.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">{\u00b6 138} A leading question is \u201cone that suggests to the witness the answer desired by the examiner.\u201d 1 McCormick, Evidence (5th Ed.1999) 19, Section 6. Under Evid.R. 611(C), \u201c[Heading questions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as may be necessary to develop his testimony.\u201d However, the trial court has discretion to allow leading questions on direct examination. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>67 Ohio St.3d at 190, 616 N.E.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">{\u00b6 139} On direct examination, the prosecutor asked Morris the following questions about the date he first entered the Mahoning County jail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">{\u00b6 140} \u201cQ: Do you remember when that was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-11\">{\u00b6 141} \u201cA: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-12\">{\u00b6 142} \u201cQ: Could it have been in May of 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-13\">{\u00b6 143} \u201c[Defense Counsel] Mr. Gentile: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-14\">{\u00b6 144} \u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll note your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-15\">{\u00b6 145} \u201cA: Okay. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-16\">{\u00b6 146} \u201cThe Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>{\u00b6 147} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">{\u00b6 148} \u201cQ: Was it May when you overheard the conversations between Mr. Drummond and Mr. Walker?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 149} \u201cA: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">{\u00b6 150} \u201cMr. Gentile: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">{\u00b6 151} \u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll note it. Overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">{\u00b6 152} The first question merely directed Morris\u2019s attention to the date that he had first entered the Mahoning County jail, which Morris had trouble remembering during earlier testimony. The prosecutor\u2019s leading questions about the date oriented the witness to the time and moved the trial forward without unnecessary delay. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">{\u00b6 153} The prosecutor\u2019s question whether it was May when Morris overheard the conversations was inappropriate. However, during subsequent cross-examination, Morris pinpointed May 6, 2003, as the exact date that he overheard Drummond and Walker discussing the murder. This answer showed that Morris\u2019s earlier response was not provided simply because of his susceptibility to the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion about the date. Thus, no prejudicial error resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">{\u00b6 154} Additionally, the prosecutor asked Morris leading questions after Morris experienced some difficulty in testifying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">{\u00b6 155} \u201cQ: You\u2019re in a disciplinary pod?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">{\u00b6 156} \u201cA: Right. Right. Basically, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\">{\u00b6 157} \u201cQ: Now the jury not having your experience, can you explain to them what a pod is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-15\">{\u00b6 158} \u201cA: A pod is, is where a lot of peoples is at.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-16\">{\u00b6 159} \u201cMr. Franken: May I help him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-17\">{\u00b6 160} \u201cThe Court: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-18\">{\u00b6 161} The prosecutor then asked leading questions to assist Morris in describing the layout of the jail and in explaining why, where, and how long he had been in jail. Here, there was no plain error because these leading questions helped to develop the witness\u2019s testimony, and the answers concerned matters easily proved by other testimony. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 110-111, 684 N.E.2d 668 (no abuse of discretion in permitting leading questions on direct where the witness appeared nervous, \u201ca little slow,\u201d and \u201cstraining\u201d with his answers).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-19\">{\u00b6 162} During Walker\u2019s direct examination, the prosecutor addressed what Drummond told Walker about the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>{\u00b6 163} \u201cQ: Now, did he talk about killing a baby?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">{\u00b6 164} \u201cMr. Gentile: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">{\u00b6 165} \u201cThe Court: Note your objection. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 166} \u201cA: He said he didn\u2019t intend to Mil no baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 167} \u201c * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">{\u00b6 168} \u201cQ: Does that mean he told you he intended to Mil anybody but the baby?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">{\u00b6 169} \u201cMr. Yarwood: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">{\u00b6 170} \u201cMr. Gentile: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">{\u00b6 171} \u201cThe Court: I\u2019ll note to the form of the question. Sustained. Put another question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-13\">{\u00b6 172} \u201cQ: Okay. Did he say that he intended to Mil?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-14\">{\u00b6 173} \u201cA: He intended to Mil whoever the bullet hit but not directly towards the baby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">{\u00b6 174} The prosecutor\u2019s question about whether Drummond talked about \u201cMlling a baby\u201d directed the witness\u2019s attention to the subject of inquiry and was proper. However, the question whether Drummond \u201ctold [Walker] he intended to Mil anybody but the baby\u201d was improperly leading. Nevertheless, the trial court sustained the objection, and no prejudicial error resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">{\u00b6 175} As for Rozenblad, no improper leading questions were asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">{\u00b6 176} 3. Hearsay. Drummond claims that the trial court erred by permitting Detective Lambert to identify members of the Lincoln Knolls Crips. Counsel failed to object to that testimony and waived all but plain error. <em>Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus. There was no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">{\u00b6 177} Lambert described photographs, obituary notices, and other material found in the photo album seized from Drummond\u2019s residence. During his testimony, Lambert identified two newspaper tributes to Brett Schroeder and identified the names of the individuals making the tribute from their nicknames:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-19\">{\u00b6 178} \u201cQ: Would you tell the jury at the bottom of each one whose names are there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-20\">{\u00b6 179} \u201cA: On the first one it says Love, Michael, Leonard, Jay, JP, Damien, Dre, and all your homies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-21\">{\u00b6 180} \u201cQ: Now, do you know who those people are?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-22\">{\u00b6 181} \u201cA: Some of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-23\">{\u00b6 182} \u201cQ: Which ones do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>{\u00b6 183} \u201cA: I believe Leonard would be Leonard Schroeder, Jay would be John Drummond, Damien would be Damien Williams, Dre would most likely be Andre Bryant, and I\u2019m not sure about JP.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">{\u00b6 184} \u201cQ: Michael, do you know who Michael is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">{\u00b6 185} \u201cA: Could be John Drummond\u2019s brother, Michael Brooks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">{\u00b6 186} As we discussed in proposition V, Detective Lambert properly provided expert testimony on gang activities of the Lincoln Knolls Crips. His identification of the individuals was based upon his personal knowledge and experience in investigating and dealing with the gang and its members. Lambert\u2019s testimony was not based upon mere hearsay and speculation. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(June 13, 2000), Franklin App. No. 99AP-704, 2000 WL 756843, *6. Thus, we hold that Lambert\u2019s testimony did not result in plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">{\u00b6 187} 4. The 911 tape. Finally, Drummond asserts that the prosecutor failed to authenticate and establish the chain of custody before the 911 tape of Dent\u2019s call to the police was played in court. As the defense failed to object to the 911 tape at trial, all but plain error was waived. See <em>State v. Kinley </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 491, 497, 651 N.E.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">{\u00b6 188} The 911 tape recorded Dent\u2019s call to the police reporting that Jiyen had been shot. Drummond makes no claim that there was any problem with the authenticity or the chain of custody of the 911 tape. The 911 tape was played during Dent\u2019s testimony when Dent identified his own voice and Butler\u2019s voice on the tape. Under these circumstances, no plain error resulted from admitting the 911 tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">{\u00b6 189} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition YI.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">{\u00b6 190} <em>Manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence. </em>In proposition of law XIV, Drummond challenges both the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence to convict him of aggravated murder and the aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">{\u00b6 191} Although both are raised in one proposition of law, a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence differs from a challenge to the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-13\">{\u00b6 192} A claim of insufficient evidence invokes a due process concern and raises the question of whether the evidence is legally sufficient to support the jury verdict as a matter of law. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. In reviewing such a challenge, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307. 99 S.Ct. 2781. 61 L.Ed.2d 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>{\u00b6 193} A claim that a jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence involves a separate and distinct test that is much broader. \u201c \u2018The court, reviewing the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting State <em>v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172,175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">{\u00b6 194} Drummond\u2019s sufficiency claims lack merit. Drummond\u2019s admissions to two cellmates, testimony from people who saw Drummond on the night of the murder, expert forensic testimony, and evidence seized from Drummond\u2019s residence were sufficient to establish his guilt. The facts showed that on the evening of March 24, 2003, Drummond and Gilliam attended a party in the neighborhood into which Dent and his family had just moved. Drummond, a member of the Lincoln Knolls Crips, Gilliam, and Bryant were overheard stating that the new neighbor might have had something to do with Schroeder\u2019s death. Drummond was then overheard saying \u201cIt\u2019s on\u201d after they finished talking.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 195} Witnesses at the party saw Drummond leave the party and return with an assault rifle. Drummond and Gilliam then left the party in Gilliam\u2019s car and drove toward the Dent home. Approximately five to 15 minutes later, ten shots were fired into the Dent home, and Jiyen was killed. A neighbor then observed Gilliam\u2019s car, with no headlights on, pull out of a driveway near the Dent home and drive down the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 196} Police found ten 7.62 x 39 mm shell casings from an assault rifle a short distance from the Dent home. Forensic examiners determined that the shots were fired into the Dent home from the spot where the shell casings were found. During a later search of the Drummond residence, police seized a number of rounds of 7.62 x 39 mm ammunition and a photo album depicting Drummond\u2019s gang-related activities and postmortem tributes to Schroeder. Drummond admitted to Walker, a fellow jail inmate, that he had fired shots into the Dent residence, although \u201che didn\u2019t intend to kill no baby.\u201d Morris, another inmate, also overheard Drummond state that \u201che didn\u2019t meant [sic] to kill the baby; he was trying to get at somebody else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 197} Nevertheless, Drummond argues that this evidence is insufficient to convict him. First, he asserts that the evidence fails to establish that he fired a weapon on the night of the murder. However, several witnesses saw Drummond with an assault rifle then. He and Gilliam were also seen driving toward the Dent home just before the shots were fired. Drummond himself admitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Walker that he had fired the shots into the Dent home that night, and Morris overheard his admissions to Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">{\u00b6 198} Drummond emphasizes Elisa Rodriguez\u2019s testimony that she saw Gilliam firing a weapon towards the Dent home but did not see Drummond in the area when the shots were fired. Rodriguez said that she then saw Gilliam get into his car alone and flee the scene. She also said that she saw Jawany running down Rutledge Drive, shooting a gun and saw him fire his last gunshot in front of the Dent home. Rodriguez\u2019s testimony, however, is contradicted by testimony that Drummond and Gilliam went to Schroeder\u2019s home after the shooting and by evidence that six 9 mm shots were fired towards the Dent home from the corner of Rutledge Drive and Duncan Lane. No evidence was presented that a person running down the street fired additional shots towards the Dent home.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">{\u00b6 199} Second, Drummond argues that the person shooting the 9 mm weapon might have killed Jiyen because no evidence was presented proving the caliber of the bullet that killed him. However, expert testimony established that only one 9 mm bullet hit the Dent home, and this slug was recovered from the kitchen wall inside the house. The baby was in the living room, not the kitchen, when the shots were fired. Thus, Jiyen was not killed by a 9 mm bullet, but by a shot fired from the assault rifle into the Dent home.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 200} Third, Drummond claims that Walker\u2019s testimony was unreliable because, in exchange for his testimony, Walker received a two-year reduction on a kidnapping charge and was released from jail on a recognizance bond. Drummond argues that Morris\u2019s testimony should also be disregarded because it completely depended on Walker\u2019s credibility. This contention, however, calls for an evaluation of Walker\u2019s credibility, which is not proper on review of evidentiary sufficiency. <em>State v. Yarbrough, 95 </em>Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, \u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 201} Finally, Drummond argues that the evidence was insufficient because there were discrepancies in witness testimony on the timeline of events and Rozenblad and Thomas were under the influence of drugs and alcohol when they witnessed anything. Drummond also claims that Rozenblad had no independent memory of these events when he testified and that Thomas\u2019s testimony was unreliable because he never told police what he testified to in court and his testimony contradicted what he said at Gilliam\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">{\u00b6 202} Despite some discrepancies, the jury accepted the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses. Furthermore, a review of the entire record shows that the testimony was neither inherently unreliable nor unbelievable. Therefore, witness testimony, circumstantial and forensic evidence, and Drummond\u2019s own statements provided sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Drummond was guilty of aggravated murder and the aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>{\u00b6 203} With respect to Drummond\u2019s manifest-weight challenges, this is not an \u201c \u2018exceptional ease in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. The jury neither lost its way nor created a miscarriage of justice in convicting Drummond of the aggravated murder charges and the accompanying aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 204} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\n<em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 205} In proposition of law IV, Drummond argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">A. Pretrial Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">{\u00b6 206} 1. Failure to request bail. Drummond argues that his counsel were ineffective by not requesting bond at arraignment. However, Drummond was an indigent defendant, and he does not establish how he would have been able to post bond. See <em>State v. Tibbetts </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 146, 152, 749 N.E.2d 226. Moreover, during arraignment, the trial court noted that Drummond was pending sentencing on a separate cocaine charge, and the state had just filed a motion to have bond revoked on those charges. Further, following conviction, \u201cany error concerning the issue of pretrial bail is moot.\u201d <em>State v. Patterson </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 264, 271, 673 N.E.2d 1001</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">{\u00b6 207} Thus, counsel were not ineffective by failing to request bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">{\u00b6 208} 2. Failure to file a motion to suppress. Drummond claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to file a motion to suppress evidence seized as the result of an unconstitutional search. Drummond fails to indicate where this search took place. Assuming that he is referring to the search of his residence, we note that the police obtained a search warrant beforehand. Drummond also presents no evidence of an illegal search. \u201cWhere the record contains no evidence which would justify the filing of a motion to suppress, the appellant has not met his burden of proving that his attorney violated an essential duty by failing to file the motion.\u201d <em>State v. Gibson </em>(1980), 69 Ohio App.2d 91, 95, 23 O.O.3d 130, 430 N.E.2d 954. Further, \u201c \u2018failure to file a suppression motion does not constitute per se ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 721 N.E.2d 52, quoting <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>(1986), 477 U.S. 365, 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305. Thus, we find that this claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">{\u00b6 209} 3. Co-counsel\u2019s belated appointment. Drummond asserts that his lead trial counsel was ineffective because his co-counsel had only 32 days to prepare for trial. The trial court allowed Gary Van Brocklin, Drummond\u2019s co-counsel, to withdraw from the case because of a conflict of interest. James Gentile, Drummond\u2019s lead counsel, remained on the case. The trial court appointed Ronald Yarwood as replacement co-counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">{\u00b6 210} Drummond does not explain how Yarwood\u2019s later appointment prejudiced his defense. Before being appointed co-counsel, Yarwood informed the court that he believed he had adequate time to prepare for the case. In addition, review of the record shows no evidence that Drummond was prejudiced by Yarwood\u2019s appointment. See <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 674, 687 N.E.2d 1358 (lead counsel\u2019s appointment to represent a capital defendant two weeks before the start of trial did not result in ineffective assistance). Accordingly, this claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 211} 4. Delay in hiring a private investigator. Drummond claims that his counsel were ineffective because they did not request funds to hire a private investigator until six months after the indictment. Again, Drummond fails to specify how counsel\u2019s failure to hire a private investigator at an earlier date prejudiced him. He does not claim that his investigator did not adequately investigate facts or interview witnesses in his case. Because Drummond has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 212} 5. Waiver of oral argument. Drummond argues that his counsel were ineffective by waiving oral argument on his motion to dismiss the death specifications. However, trial counsel filed a lengthy brief challenging the death specifications. Given the \u201cstrong presumption\u201d under <em>Strickland </em>that counsel\u2019s performance constituted reasonable assistance, counsel\u2019s decision to waive oral argument was a \u201ctactical decision.\u201d See <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>Moreover, </em>Drummond fails to show that a \u201creasonable probability\u201d exists that but for counsel\u2019s waiver of oral argument, the trial court\u2019s ruling would have been different. See <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 144, 538 N.E.2d 373. Thus, we also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">{\u00b6 213} 6. Failure to challenge witnesses. Drummond asserts that his counsel were ineffective by failing to challenge Walker and Morris from testifying about his jailhouse confession. Drummond does not provide any basis for a defense challenge of these witnesses. Because their testimony was properly admitted, counsel were not deficient by failing to challenge them. See <em>Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 298, 754 N.E.2d 1150; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 31, 676 N.E.2d 82 (\u201cCounsel need not raise meritless issues * * * \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>{\u00b6 214} 7. Failure to take an active approach. Drummond claims that his counsel\u2019s comment that they were \u201cnot looking to explore the state\u2019s case\u201d and counsel\u2019s admission that his \u201cconfidence was a little shaken\u201d showed that his counsel took a \u201claissez-faire\u201d approach to his case. Drummond\u2019s complaint takes these remarks out of context. First, counsel\u2019s remarks that they were \u201cnot looking to explore the state\u2019s case\u201d were made during argument requesting a bill of particulars. Counsel\u2019s remarks were not deficient because this argument was successful, and the state provided the defense with a bill of particulars. Second, counsel\u2019s comment that his \u201cconfidence was a little shaken\u201d responded to Drummond\u2019s complaint to the Mahoning County Bar Association about counsel\u2019s representation. Counsel\u2019s remarks reflected no unwillingness to continue actively defending his client. The record shows that counsel vigorously represented Drummond throughout the trial. In sum, Drummond fails to demonstrate how counsel\u2019s two isolated comments resulted in deficient performance or were prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">B. Guilt-Phase Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">{\u00b6 215} 1. Failure to object to instructions. Drummond argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s instruction that \u201c[h]e has a constitutional right not to incriminate himself\u2019 because it conveyed to the jury that Drummond would incriminate himself if he did testify. But this instruction was followed by the admonition, \u201cIf he does not testify, that fact must not be considered by you for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d We hold that the trial court\u2019s instruction was proper and overrule this claim. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 216} Drummond also claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to instructions that \u201cshould the panel of 12 jurors plus four alternates determine the State did prove beyond a reasonable doubt Count 1 or Count 2, we will * * * reconvene to determine the potential penalty.\u201d During the same set of instructions, the trial court explained that an alternate juror would take part in the jury\u2019s deliberations only if the alternate replaced one of the regular jurors. Thus, none of the regular or alternate jurors were misled about their role at trial. Thus, we also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 217} 2. Questioning of prospective jurors. Drummond asserts that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object when the trial court informed prospective jurors that \u201ca chronic alcoholic or drug dependent person\u201d could be challenged for cause. According to Drummond, the trial court\u2019s \u201cblunt approach\u201d in asking about possible alcohol or drug dependence diminished the likelihood that a prospective juror having such a problem would admit it. However, Drummond fails to demonstrate that any of the prospective jurors failed to disclose drug or alcohol dependency. The trial court properly listed the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>for a challenge for cause. See Crim.R. 24(C). The trial court also informed the prospective jurors that if any of them had a reason for being challenged, they should remain in the courtroom after the other jurors departed to discuss it with the lawyers and the judge. This procedure helped to eliminate any reluctance that a prospective juror might have in disclosing alcohol or drug dependency. Thus, Drummond has failed to show that counsel\u2019s failure to object was deficient or prejudicial, and this claim is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">{\u00b6 218} 3. Failure to review and object to gang-related evidence. Drummond argues that his counsel did not properly identify and analyze gang-related evidence and did not obtain photographs relating to gang activity before trial. The record belies these claims. As the result of reviewing gang-related evidence before trial, counsel filed a motion in limine objecting to photographs of gang-related activities contained in the photo album seized from Drummond\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 219} Drummond also argues that counsel were ineffective by failing to request cautionary instructions on gang-related testimony. As we discussed in proposition I, the trial court did provide such cautionary instructions. We also reject Drummond\u2019s claim that counsel were ineffective by failing to object to Detective Lambert\u2019s hearsay testimony. As we discussed in proposition V, Lambert\u2019s expert testimony about gangs was admissible. Drummond was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to make continuing objections to evidence concerning gang activity or the state\u2019s use of \u201cgang affiliation\u201d during opening statement, direct testimony, and closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 220} 4. Failure to object to unrecorded sidebars. Drummond claims that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to unrecorded sidebar conferences. As we discussed in proposition VI, there were more than 130 unrecorded sidebar conferences. Drummond cannot show prejudice because there is no evidence about what happened during those sidebars. <em>State v. Tyler </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 24, 38, 553 N.E.2d 576. \u201cActs of omissions by trial counsel which cannot be shown to have been prejudicial may not be characterized as ineffective assistance.\u201d <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 332, 686 N.E.2d 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 221} 5. Withdrawal of pro se motion. Drummond contends that his counsel were ineffective by withdrawing his pro se motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence. There is no evidence, however, that the police search of his residence was improper. Drummond fails to show that counsel\u2019s withdrawal of the pro se motion was prejudicial, and therefore, we also reject this claim. See <em>Nields, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 34, 752 N.E.2d 859 (withdrawal of motion to suppress was not ineffective assistance of counsel when doing so was a \u201ctactical decision, there was no reasonable probability of success, or there was no prejudice to the defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>{\u00b6 222} 6. Failure to object to police opinion. Drummond complains that his counsel were ineffective by failing to object to Officer Brian Butler\u2019s testimony identifying \u201cbrain matter\u201d at the crime scene. Officer Butler testified that a photograph taken at the crime scene shows \u201cbrain matter * * * leading from the living room to the hallway.\u201d Trial counsel\u2019s failure to object was not deficient because the testimony was proper. Butler\u2019s testimony was lay opinion based upon his perception of evidence at the Dent residence. See Evid.R. 701; <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 28-29, 559 N.E.2d 464 (police officer\u2019s testimony on footprint comparisons admissible as lay opinion); <em>State v. Stout </em>(1987), 42 Ohio App.3d 38, 536 N.E.2d 42, paragraph two of the syllabus (police officer may give lay opinion that a stain depicted in a photograph appears to be blood). Moreover, Drummond suffered no prejudice from Butler\u2019s testimony because other evidence clearly established that Jiyen died of a gunshot to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 223} 7. Other acts of alleged ineffectiveness of counsel. Drummond claims that his lead counsel was remiss in failing to fully investigate Walker\u2019s file but does not mention any specific instances of counsel\u2019s failure to investigate or explain how he was prejudiced. Thus, this claim lacks merit. As discussed in proposition VI, Drummond was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the playing of the 911 tape. He was also not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to the state\u2019s leading questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 224} In summary, none of Drummond\u2019s claims establish ineffective assistance of counsel, and proposition IV is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">{\u00b6 225} In proposition of law VIII, Drummond argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking leading questions on direct, permitting hearsay testimony, introducing gang-related testimony, and barraging the jury with inflammatory and highly prejudicial evidence. However, with respect to each claim, Drummond provides no examples of the misconduct or record references showing when the misconduct occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">{\u00b6 226} The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14-15, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of our analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">{\u00b6 227} First, Drummond recasts his objections to the prosecutor\u2019s leading questions on direct examination into claims of prosecutorial misconduct. However, as discussed earlier in proposition VI, none of the leading questions asked during direct examination resulted in either prejudicial error or plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>{\u00b6 228} Second, Drummond\u2019s claim that the prosecutor committed misconduct by introducing hearsay testimony is the same issue as that relating to Detective Lambert\u2019s testimony raised in proposition VI. However, as we discussed in proposition VI, Drummond failed to object, and no plain error was committed by introducing Detective Lambert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 229} Third, Drummond asserts that the prosecutor committed misconduct by introducing gang-related evidence. However, as we discussed in propositions I and V, no prejudicial error or plain error was committed in introducing that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">(\u00b6 230} Finally, the record fails to disclose that the prosecutor improperly introduced inflammatory and prejudicial evidence. We also reject Drummond\u2019s claim that the cumulative effect of the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct denied him a fair trial. Drummond received a fair trial, and none of the instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct, either individually or collectively, amounted to prosecutorial misconduct. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 424, 444, 721 N.E.2d 93; <em>State v. Hawkins </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 339, 348, 612 N.E.2d 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">{\u00b6 231} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">{\u00b6 232} In proposition of law III, Drummond makes various claims that the death-penalty specifications are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">{\u00b6 233} First, Drummond asserts that the child-murder aggravating circumstance, R.C. 2929.04(A)(9), is unconstitutional because the statute fails to require that an accused knew that the victim was under 13 years of age at the time of the offense. Drummond argues that the absence of such a requirement makes the statute void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">{\u00b6 234} R.C. 2929.04(A)(9) provides that the imposition of the death penalty for aggravated murder may be imposed if \u201c[t]he offender, in the commission of the offense, purposefully caused the death of another who was under thirteen years of age at the time of the commission of the offense, and either the offender was the principal offender * * * or, if not the principal offender, committed the offense with prior calculation and design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">{\u00b6 235} R.C. 2929.04(A)(9) is not unconstitutionally vague. The statute is very clear that the murder of a child under the age of 13 makes the killer eligible for the death penalty. This statutory language is easily understood, unlike other statutes that the Supreme Court has found vague. See, e.g., <em>Maynard v. Cartwright </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 356, 363-364, 108 S.Ct. 1853, 100 L.Ed.2d 372 (holding \u201cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\u201d to be vague). Moreover, the General Assembly\u2019s desire to protect child victims independent of the offenders\u2019 knowledge or intent that a victim is a young child is rationally based on the need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>to protect young children from violence. Thus, the fact that the state is not required to prove that Drummond knew that the victim was under the age of 13 does not make the statute void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 236} Further, the constitutionality of similar statutory provisions not requiring a culpable mental state as to the age of the victim has been upheld in other jurisdictions. See <em>State v. Colon </em>(2004), 272 Conn. 106, 380-381, 864 A.2d 666; <em>Black v. State </em>(Tex.Crim.App.2000), 26 S.W.3d 895, 897-899; see, also, <em>Stevens v. State </em>(Ind.1997), 691 N.E.2d 412, 431-432. Thus, Drummond\u2019s challenge is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">{\u00b6 237} Second, Drummond argues that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(9) specification fails to narrow the class of offenders eligible for the death penalty. However, we reject this claim. See <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 73-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 238} Third, Drummond contends that the R.C. 2929.04(A)(9) specification is unconstitutional because it alleges that Drummond was either \u201cthe principal offender in the commission of the offense or, if not the principal offender, committed the offense with prior calculation and design.\u201d However, no alternative theories under R.C. 2929.04 were presented to the jury because the guilt-phase and penalty-phase instructions referred only to \u201cprincipal offender\u201d and not to prior calculation and design. Thus, we also reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 239} Finally, we summarily reject Drummond\u2019s claim that the course-of-conduct specification is unconstitutionally vague. See <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 305, 533 N.E.2d 701. Accord <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 569, 715 N.E.2d 1144.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">{\u00b6 240} Based on the foregoing, proposition III is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">{\u00b6 241} In propositions of law XII and XIII, Drummond challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. However, we summarily reject such claims. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-12\">{\u00b6 242} We also reject Drummond\u2019s argument that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international law and treaties to which the United States is a party. <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 502, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-13\">\n<em>Proportionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-14\">{\u00b6 243} In propositions of law IX, X, and XI, Drummond disputes the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s proportionality review. We also find that these claims lack merit. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u00b6 23; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">{\u00b6 244} Having considered Drummond\u2019s propositions of law, we now independently review Drummond\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires us to do. The evidence at trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that Drummond was properly convicted of a course of conduct in killing or attempting to kill two or more people, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and murder of a child under 13 years of age, R.C. 2929.04(A)(9), in Counts One and Two. Before submitting the case to the jury during the penalty phase, the trial court merged Count Two with Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">{\u00b6 245} Against these aggravating circumstances, we now weigh the mitigating factors contained in R.C. 2929.04(B). Drummond called five mitigation witnesses and made an unsworn statement for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">{\u00b6 246} Cynthia Drummond, the defendant\u2019s mother, testified that Drummond has two brothers, two sisters, and a stepsister. Drummond\u2019s mother was divorced from his father when Drummond was 14 years old. Drummond then lived with his father in the family home. However, he did not do well in school and received failing grades. Later, Drummond moved in with his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">{\u00b6 247} When Drummond was 16 years old, he was shot five times, and his injuries resulted in the amputation of his leg. Drummond and his mother then returned to the family home. Drummond went through rehabilitation and received a prosthetic leg. He never finished school. Drummond\u2019s mother suspected that Drummond and his friends were involved in gang activity, but he denied it. In 2001, Drummond was shot in his other leg. Drummond is also a father of twins. According to his mother, he \u201cloves his kids\u201d and interacts well with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">{\u00b6 248} John Drummond Sr., the defendant\u2019s father, testified that Drummond moved into his home following the loss of his leg. During the past two or three years, father and son have \u201cgotten closer, sort of seeing things on the same lines.\u201d His father has also noticed a positive change in Drummond since the birth of his twins, a boy and a girl. The father testified that in interacting with his children, Drummond shows patience and understanding and tries to deal with the children on their level. Drummond\u2019s father testified that he loves his son and sees a lot of good in him. Drummond has made some wrong choices, but his father believes that he can communicate his experiences to others and educate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>{\u00b6 249} Shalise DeMarco is the mother of Drummond\u2019s two-year-old twins. DeMarco and Drummond are no longer together, but they remain friends. She also states that Drummond \u201cloves his kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 250} Lovely Atkins and Drummond were neighbors in the Lincoln Knolls area. They have known each other for several years, and Atkins considers Drummond a good friend. She says Drummond \u201cwas always nice. He looked out for a lot of people to make sure no harm would come\u201d to them. Drummond would often ask Atkins how she was doing in school. He would also tell her, \u201c[A]lways be a good girl. Never get in any mess around here. * * * [K]eep it up, and * * * make sure you do good.\u201d Atkins \u201clooked up\u201d to Drummond and took what he told her \u201cto heart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">{\u00b6 251} Dr. John Fabian, a clinical psychologist, performed psychological testing and a clinical assessment of Drummond. Fabian found that Drummond is \u201csignificantly below average in verbal skills and vocabulary.\u201d Results from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale showed that Drummond has an IQ of 82. However, Fabian does not believe that Drummond is neurologically impaired, and he has no history of any serious brain trauma. Nevertheless, \u201coverall he is below average in intellectual functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 252} Drummond grew up in the Youngstown area. Although his parents were divorced in 1991, Drummond was raised in a \u201c[pjretty intact home.\u201d Drummond\u2019s parents seemed involved in his life. His mother attended \u201cparent-teacher conferences, and there was care and support.\u201d Moreover, Drummond was never sexually abused or seriously neglected. According to the psychologist, \u201cthere was some evidence of whippings, [and] normal spankings,\u201d but there was no family history of domestic violence or serious abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 253} Drummond was involved with the Crips from ages 13 to 19. According to Fabian, Drummond \u201cmade a choice as an adolescent to run the streets, involve himself in a gang.\u201d However, it was a choice based on \u201cpeers and social environment, not his family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">{\u00b6 254} While involved with gangs, Drummond witnessed many shootings and experienced other violence. When Drummond was 16, he was shot, and his leg was amputated. In 2001, he was shot twice. However, Drummond claims that he is no longer in a gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">{\u00b6 255} Dr. Fabian testified that Drummond was \u201cnonchalant\u201d about being shot. \u201cIt was not a big deal to him.\u201d In explaining Drummond\u2019s attitude, Fabian said, \u201cIt\u2019s the way he lived. It\u2019s the way his world was. It\u2019s violence. * * * It\u2019s losing friends. It\u2019s being shot at. It\u2019s shoot first, ask questions later. It\u2019s that kind of environment that needs to be explained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>{\u00b6 256} Fabian also testified that Drummond has a juvenile record but nothing too serious. He believes that Drummond can adjust well to prison because he has had no violent infractions while in jail during the past year, and is \u201colder.\u201d During cross-examination, Fabian acknowledged that Drummond has been in a segregation unit of the jail during the past year and that when Drummond was in jail in 1999, he was involved in a fight with another inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 257} During further cross-examination, Fabian said that Drummond has no history of mental illness. He also reported that Drummond has been convicted of \u201cdrug abuse, cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 258} During a brief unsworn statement, Drummond extended his \u201ccondolences to Jiyen and his girlfriend Latoya Butler * * * for the passing away of their son.\u201d Drummond also said, \u201cI object to these charges that has been brought against me. I know that you or nobody you hang with had nothing to do with the death of Brett Schroeder. I feel very sad about the passing of Jiyen Dent, Jr. but I did not commit this crime that I have been accused of.\u201d In closing, Drummond said, \u201cI ask the jury to have mercy for the crime that I have been accused of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 259} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offense to be mitigating. On the evening of March 24, 2003, Drummond drove by the home occupied by Dent, Butler, and their three-month-old baby, Jiyen, and fired his assault rifle into the residence. One bullet killed three-month-old Jiyen. Thus, Jiyen\u2019s murder was part of a course of conduct involving the murder of a child under 13 years of age.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">{\u00b6 260} Drummond\u2019s character offers nothing in mitigation, and his history and background also provide little in the way of mitigation. Drummond was raised in a home where both parents loved and supported him. However, Drummond dropped out of school and became involved in violent gang activity that led to the crimes in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">{\u00b6 261} The statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable: R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation); (B)(3) (mental disease or defect); and (B)(6) (accomplice only). Drummond does not assert the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor (lack of significant criminal record), nor is there any evidence that the (B)(5) mitigating factor applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">{\u00b6 262} We also conclude that the R.C. 2929.04(B)(4) mitigating factor (youth of the offender) is entitled to little, if any, weight because Drummond was 25 years of age at the time of the offenses. See <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 91, 723 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>1019; <em>State v. Brewer </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 50, 64, 549 N.E.2d 491 (25-year-old defendant not a \u201cyouthful offender\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">{\u00b6 263} We recognize and give weight to other mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). First, the love and support that Drummond shares with his family deserve some weight in mitigation. Additionally, testimony that Drummond is a loving and supportive father to his two young children is entitled to weight. See <em>State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 178; <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 194, 631 N.E.2d 124 (defendant\u2019s love and care of his daughter is a mitigating factor).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">{\u00b6 264} Second, Drummond\u2019s below-average intelligence (IQ of 82) is entitled to weight in mitigation. However, there was no evidence of any significant connection between Drummond\u2019s low IQ and Jiyen\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">{\u00b6 265} We accord little weight to Dr. Fabian\u2019s opinion that Drummond may adapt well to prison life. This testimony is negated by evidence that Drummond fought with another inmate during a previous jail term.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 266} Drummond expressed \u201ccondolences\u201d for Jiyen\u2019s death, but never acknowledged any responsibility for his death. Drummond\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for Jiyen\u2019s murder negates any mitigating weight that might otherwise exist for his recognition of the pain the Dent family suffered. See <em>State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 178. The evidence does not suggest any other (B)(7) mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">{\u00b6 267} The aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Drummond\u2019s murder of three-month-old Jiyen is a grave aggravating circumstance. So is his course of conduct in killing Jiyen and in attempting to kill Dent and Butler. In contrast, no substantial mitigation weighs against these aggravating circumstances. Thus, we hold that the death penalty is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">{\u00b6 268} Finally, we find that the death penalty is proportionate to death sentences approved for other child murders under R.C. 2929.04(A)(9). <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 119 (12-year-old victim); <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 196 (six-year-old victim); <em>State v. Smith, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-6659, 780 N.E.2d 221, \u00b6 79 (six-month-old victim). Furthermore, the death penalty is proportionate to death sentences approved for other course-of-conduct murders. <em>State v. Foust, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 137, 2004-Ohio-7006, 823 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 203; <em>State v. Gapen, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-6548, 819 N.E.2d 1047, \u00b6 182; <em>State v. Mink. </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350. 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>{\u00b6 269} Accordingly, we affirm Drummond\u2019s convictions and sentences, including his sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-6\">Resnick, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b142-7\">Moyer, C.J., Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b142-8\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">{\u00b6 270} I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision holding that Drummond was not denied his right to a public trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">{\u00b6 271} In my view, the trial court\u2019s closure of the courtroom on February 4, 2004, resulted in structural error. See <em>Waller v. Georgia </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 39, 49-50,104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31, fn. 9; <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 461, 468-469, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718. \u201cUnlike a garden-variety trial error, a structural error \u2018transcends the criminal process\u2019 by depriving a defendant of those \u2018basic protections [without which] a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence, and no criminal punishment may be regarded as fundamentally fair.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>United States v. Padilla </em>(C.A.1, 2005), 415 F.3d 211, 219, quoting Rose <em>v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 577-578, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460. The United States Supreme Court has identified structural error in a very limited class of cases, such as the complete denial of counsel, trial by a biased judge, racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury, denial of self-representation at trial, a defective reasonable-doubt instruction, and <em>denial of a public trial. Neder v. United States </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 1, 8, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35; <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. at 469, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">{\u00b6 272} In upholding the trial court\u2019s decision to close the courtroom on February 4, the majority places undue emphasis on the presence of representatives of the news media in the courtroom after it was closed. Moreover, the majority\u2019s application of the <em>Waller </em>four-pronged test in justifying the courtroom\u2019s closure is fatally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">{\u00b6 273} As to the first <em>Waller </em>factor, there is little evidence that courtroom security and witness safety justified closing the courtroom on February 4. The trial court mentioned two incidents to support courtroom closure, but these had occurred <em>the previous day. </em>One incident occurred in the judge\u2019s chambers, and the second incident involved an altercation between a spectator and the deputies. In both instances, the responsible individuals were identified and sanctioned. The record also does not support closing the courtroom because of the \u201cfear of retaliation expressed by various witnesses,\u201d because no such witnesses were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>identified. Moreover, no spectators were identified who posed a threat to disturb the courtroom or intimidate any of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 274} As to the second <em>Waller </em>factor, the majority emphasizes that closure was no broader than necessary because the courtroom was closed only during the testimony of Thomas and Morris, and Rozenblad\u2019s cross-examination. However, Thomas, Morris, and Rozenblad were key prosecution witnesses, and their testimony was crucial in securing Drummond\u2019s conviction. Thomas saw Drummond with an assault rifle prior to the shooting and overheard Drummond tell Gilliam \u201cIt\u2019s on\u201d before the shootings. Morris was in pretrial confinement with Drummond and overheard him tell another inmate that \u201che didn\u2019t meant [sic] to kill the baby; he was trying to get at somebody else * * Rozenblad testified on direct examination (in the presence of spectators) that he saw Drummond before the shooting talking \u201cabout a guy moving in * * * [their] neighborhood [who] could have had something to do with the death of Brett Schroeder.\u201d During cross-examination, when the courtroom was closed, Rozenblad testified that he did not get along with Drummond and that they were never friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 275} Additionally, Drummond\u2019s family members were not allowed to remain in the courtroom during closure. Defense counsel requested that Drummond\u2019s family members be allowed to remain in court to provide support for the defendant. Despite this request, the trial court expelled from the courtroom all spectators except for news reporters. The Supreme Court of the United States has specifically emphasized the importance of allowing members of a defendant\u2019s family to remain in court. See <em>In re Oliver </em>(1948), 333 U.S. 257, 272, 68 S.Ct. 499, 92 L.Ed. 682; see, also, <em>State v. Washington </em>(2001), 142 Ohio App.3d 268, 272, 755 N.E.2d 422 (\u201cThe state bears a heavy burden when seeking to exclude relatives of a defendant from trial\u201d). The record provides no justification for excluding family members from the courtroom. No evidence was presented showing that any family members posed a risk of disturbing the court or threatening any of the witnesses or jurors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>State v. Clifford </em>(1999), 135 Ohio App.3d 207, 213-214, 733 N.E.2d 621; <em>State v. Sanders </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 92, 98, 719 N.E.2d 619 (trial court erred in expelling defendant\u2019s wife and parents because of the \u201cdearth of evidence relating to their involvement in the disturbances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 276} Surely, it cannot be reasonably argued that the news reporters who remained in the courtroom can stand in the shoes of members of defendant\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>{\u00b6 277} In finding that closure was no broader than necessary, the majority stresses that the trial court allowed the media to remain in the courtroom. The presence of the media does not satisfy the requirements for Drummond\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. There must still be a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d established to permit a partial, as opposed to a total, closure of the courtroom. See <em>Woods v. Kuhlmann </em>(C.A.2, 1992), 977 F.2d 74, 76; <em>Nieto v. Sullivan </em>(C.A.10, 1989), 879 F.2d 743, 753. The record contains insufficient evidence establishing a \u201csubstantial reason\u201d justifying the closure in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 278} Third, nothing in the record shows that the trial court considered other reasonable alternatives to closing the courtroom, as <em>Waller </em>requires. Damian Williams and Michael Peace were identified by the trial court as having been involved in the disturbances the previous day. Thus, the trial court could have barred Williams and Peace from the courtroom as an alternative to closing the court to all spectators except the media. See <em>Sanders, </em>130 Ohio App.3d at 98, 719 N.E.2d 619 (trial court erred by failing to consider alternative of identifying spectators responsible for disturbances and expelling them).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 279} The trial court also failed to discuss alternatives such as enhancing courtroom security, screening spectators allowed to remain in the courtroom, or placing a screen between the witnesses and the spectators to conceal the witnesses from public view. See <em>Ayala v. Speckard </em>(C.A.2, 1997), 131 F.3d 62, 71-72 (where the petitioners suggested \u201cplacing a screen between the witness and the courtroom spectators\u201d as an alternative to closure). Taking these reasonable measures would have ensured courtroom security while maintaining the open courtroom that the Sixth Amendment requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 280} Fourth, regarding the final <em>Waller </em>factor, the trial court failed to make findings adequate to support the courtroom closure. \u201cThe requirement of specific, on-the-record findings is intended to give appellate courts a basis for determining the propriety of closure.\u201d <em>Bell v. Jarvis </em>(C.A.4, 1999), 198 F.3d 432, 441. Moreover, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment requires that consideration of these concerns be on the record and occur in the context of a case-by-case examination of the competing interests at stake.\u201d Id. at 441, citing <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. at 48, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31; see, also, <em>United States v. Thunder </em>(C.A.8, 2006), 438 F.3d 866, 868 (closure of courtroom during testimony of allegedly abused children violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial absent findings that the closure was necessary to preserve some higher interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 281} Here, the record contains little information to aid a reviewing court in determining whether the trial court\u2019s order was reasonable and necessary. The trial court\u2019s judgment entry states that the prosecution moved to close the courtroom, but the record does not include the prosecution\u2019s evidence or argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ments supporting its position. These matters may have been considered by the court during a sidebar discussion, but no such discussions were included in the record, as <em>Waller </em>requires. See <em>State v. Morris, </em>157 Ohio App.3d 395, 2004-Ohio-2870, 811 N.E.2d 577, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A2H\">Paul J. Gains, Mahoning County Prosecuting Attorney, Timothy E. Franken, Chief Criminal Prosecutor, and Rhys B. Cartwright-Jones, Appellate Counsel, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b145-10\">Dennis A. DiMartino, L.P.A., Dennis A DiMartino, and John P. Laczko, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 282} The majority justifies the absence of specific findings of fact because of the limited scope of the closure. However, the closure was not as limited as the majority suggests. Key prosecution testimony was presented while the courtroom was closed. Thus, the trial court erred by failing to make specific findings before closing the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 283} I would reverse Drummond\u2019s convictions and death sentence because Drummond was denied his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b145-8\">Pfeifer and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. The record shows that the trial court mistakenly believed that Michael Peace, who showed disrespect to the court the previous day, was Drummond\u2019s brother. However, the prosecutor informed the court that Peace was not Drummond\u2019s brother, although Peace claimed to be \u201cfamily to Drummond.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
