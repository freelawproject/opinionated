On November 3, 2004, he applied to take the February 2005 Ohio bar examination. The applicant was granted a waiver of the November 1 application deadline on the condition that the Board of Commissioners on Character and Fitness approved his character, fitness, and moral qualifications three weeks prior to the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 2} On June 6, 2005, the Admissions Committee of the Toledo Bar Association disapproved the applicant\u2019s qualifications, citing his criminal record and the fact that he had committed an honor-code violation in law school. The applicant appealed, and a panel of the board heard the cause on December 14, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 3} Based on the application materials submitted prior to and at the hearing, the board recommended that the applicant be disapproved but that he be permitted to \u201creapply for the July 2007 Bar Examination upon the filing of a new application and re-interview [with] the Admissions Committee of the Toledo Bar Association.\u201d The applicant has not objected to the board\u2019s findings of fact or recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 4} On review, we agree that this applicant has not shown that he is a proper candidate for admission to the practice of law in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 5} An applicant has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he or she possesses the requisite character, fitness, and moral qualification for admission to the practice of law. Gov.Bar R. I(11)(D)(1). An applicant\u2019s record of conduct must justify \u201cthe trust of clients, adversaries, courts and others with respect to the professional duties owed to them\u201d and demonstrate that the applicant \u201csatisfies the essential eligibility requirements for the practice of law\u201d as defined by law. Gov.Bar R. I(11)(D)(3). To ensure that the record does not manifest \u201ca significant deficiency in the honesty, trustworthiness, diligence or reliability\u201d of an applicant, the rule lists several factors that weigh against approval, including whether the applicant has committed any crimes, engaged in academic misconduct, or has habitually disregarded the law in a pattern of behavior. Gov.Bar R. I(ll)(D)(3)(a), (d), and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 6} This applicant\u2019s bar examination and admission materials are saturated with these three ethical impediments. First, the applicant has a troubling criminal record of misdemeanor convictions. He pleaded no contest in 1997 to obstructing official business, he was convicted in 1999 for disorderly conduct, and he was convicted again in 2000 for attempted possession of marijuana. Of equal concern are the many other times that the applicant was accused of criminal conduct, even though the charges were dismissed. From 1995 until 2001, the applicant\u2019s record reveals charges for assault and battery, underage possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>alcohol, possession or use of marijuana, burglary, and aggravated menacing, as well as multiple traffic offenses and criminal building-code violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 7} At the hearing, the applicant assured the panel that when he decided to become a lawyer, he had changed his lifestyle and turned over a new leaf. The board was not convinced, noting that the applicant had been charged with four crimes in 2001, just about the time he was accepted into law school. We share the board\u2019s skepticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 8} The applicant also has a significant record of academic misconduct. On June 2, 2003, after his purported reformation, the applicant was suspended for a semester from the University of Toledo College of Law because he plagiarized material for a writing assignment. While an undergraduate, the applicant was also issued a \u201cletter of warning\u201d for copying another student\u2019s homework assignment during the 1995 autumn quarter at the Ohio State University.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{\u00b6 9} The applicant also tended to avoid or shade the truth during the character and fitness proceedings, which constitutes a false statement or an omission to be considered under Gov.Bar R. I(ll)(D)(3)(h). The board doubted the applicant\u2019s credibility because he was vague and evasive when answering questions about his criminal record. So do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 10} As one example, the board referred to the assault and aggravated-menacing charges against the applicant, conduct that evidently arose out of an altercation between the applicant and a former girlfriend in a bar. The charges were ultimately dismissed because the complaining witnesses, the girlfriend and a friend who was with her in the bar, did not appear for the trial. Upon initial inquiries at the panel hearing, the applicant claimed that he did not recall the specifics of the incident other than that he had thrown a drink at a woman and had told another woman that he was going to kill her. After more intense questioning, however, the applicant reluctantly remembered precisely who the women were and that his former girlfriend had also accused him of having grabbed her arm and having thrown her against a wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">(\u00b6 11} Similarly, the board was not impressed with respondent\u2019s explanation for why he had pleaded guilty to the marijuana-possession charge. The applicant had been charged with felony drug possession because authorities found approximately half a pound of marijuana in his bedroom while executing a search warrant on his family\u2019s home. The applicant denied all responsibility for the marijuana, which he said belonged to one of his brothers, and claimed that he was living at his summer cottage at that time. The applicant nevertheless pleaded guilty to the reduced misdemeanor charge, purportedly on his lawyer\u2019s advice that the applicant would be charged even if he inculpated his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">{\u00b6 12} Evidence also suggested that the applicant had not been forthright and candid when he initially discussed his law school honor-code violation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>members of the bar association. According to the chairman of the bar admissions committee that interviewed the applicant, he first suggested that his plagiarism involved only an initial draft of a paper and that he had not understood that copying was unacceptable in his preliminary work. The applicant\u2019s law professor, however, confirmed to the committee that the applicant had plagiarized material in both the draft and the final version of his paper.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 13} Finally, we also share the board\u2019s reservations about the applicant\u2019s asserted lack of responsibility for rental property that he co-owned. The applicant at one time owned various rental properties jointly with his brothers, and they eventually formed the Four Howards, L.L.C., to manage it. While he was co-owner, the applicant was sued relative to several property disputes. The applicant claimed that he was named by mistake, inasmuch as he was a law student at the time, had held only lower-level jobs in his brothers\u2019 business, and was not actively involved in managing their property. Attached to one of the complaints against the Four Howards, however, is an October 2003 letter to a tenant that the applicant signed as \u201cPresident of Four Howards, L.L.C.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 14} In summary, the board concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[T]he past record of conduct of the applicant * * * seems to reflect a pattern of disregard for the law and action that involves deceit or misrepresentation. These concerns are only magnified by the seemingly evasive and less than candid demeanor of the applicant during the hearing. While counsel for the applicant sought to explain this by arguing that Mr. Howard was simply nervous, not evasive, the Board disagrees. The Board remains unconvinced that the applicant was being candid, forthright and open during the hearing before the panel. He appeared to be withholding information and making it difficult to obtain a full and complete picture of his various activities. The Board, therefore, concludes that the applicant does not currently possess the requisite character, fitness and moral qualifications for admission to the practice of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 16} We adopt the board\u2019s findings and recommendation to disapprove applicant\u2019s request. We make no finding as to whether the applicant can rehabilitate his character, fitness, and moral qualification, however, or as to when rehabilitation might permit him to reapply as a candidate for admission pursuant to Gov.Bar R. 1(2). Accordingly, the application to register as a candidate for admission to the Ohio bar is therefore disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b313-10\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aga\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Robison, Curphey &amp; O\u2019Connell, L.L.C., and David W.
