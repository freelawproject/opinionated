We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant Marvin Van Gundy filed workers\u2019 compensation claims for five workplace injuries that he sustained over the course of several years. The Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation found that Van Gundy\u2019s first injury in 1982 left him ten percent permanently partially disabled. The bureau also determined that the second injury in 1987 caused an additional 46 percent permanent partial disability (\u201cPPD\u201d), the third injury in 1997 caused an additional 18 percent PPD, the fourth injury in 2000 caused an additional 18 percent PPD, and the last injury in 2003 caused an additional six percent PPD. His award of PPD was therefore 98 percent after the fifth and final injury, and he evidently received the appropriate compensation from the bureau for each of his workplace injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 3} In 2003, Van Gundy advised the bureau that he believed that the percentage of PPD resulting from his 2000 injury \u2014 the fourth injury \u2014 had increased from the 18 percent award initially recognized by the bureau. The bureau agreed and increased his percentage of PPD for that injury to 20 percent. Van Gundy nonetheless objected to the bureau\u2019s action, and a district hearing officer at the Industrial Commission agreed with him that the bureau should have increased the disability percentage for the 2000 injury by five percent rather than two percent. The hearing officer ordered that the percentage of PPD for Van Gundy\u2019s fourth workplace injury be increased to 23 percent from the original 18 percent figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b64} In 2004, the bureau asked the Industrial Commission to vacate the hearing officer\u2019s order. According to the bureau, the commission\u2019s order violated R.C. 4123.57 by allowing Van Gundy\u2019s percentage of permanent partial disability to exceed 100 percent. A staff hearing officer at the Industrial Commission agreed, finding that R.C. 4123.57 \u201cprecludes an award which would cause the total in all claims to exceed 100% permanent partial disability.\u201d He therefore vacated the district hearing officer\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">{\u00b6 5} Van Gundy next filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in October 2004 in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, alleging that the ten percent PPD award from his first workplace injury in 1982 should not have been counted by the staff hearing officer toward the 100 percent statutory cap on PPD compensation. That first injury claim had \u201clapsed,\u201d he alleged, and therefore any consideration of it was contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">{\u00b6 6} The court of appeals denied Van Gundy\u2019s mandamus claim, finding that the commission\u2019s staff hearing officer had properly applied the 100 percent cap to Van Gundy\u2019s five PPD claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">{\u00b6 7} Van Gundy has now filed an appeal as of right. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>{\u00b6 8} R.C. 4123.57(A) provides that the bureau cannot award PPD compensation to an injured worker \u201cbased upon a percentage of disability which, when taken with all other percentages of permanent disability, exceeds one hundred per cent.\u201d The record shows that the district hearing officer\u2019s order increasing the PPD award for Van Gundy\u2019s fourth injury by five percent gave Van Gundy 103 percent PPD status.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">{\u00b6 9} Van Gundy argues that the order was permissible under the statute and should not have been vacated by the staff hearing officer. His argument rests on the fact that he received his last workers\u2019 compensation payment for his oldest injury \u2014 the 1982 injury \u2014 more than ten years ago. That passage of time is significant, he contends, because R.C. 4123.52 directs that any \u201cmodification, change, finding, or award\u201d for a workers\u2019 compensation claim be made by the bureau \u201cwithin ten years from the date of the last payment of compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 10} Yet, as the court of appeals below concluded, the staff hearing officer who vacated the order increasing the award of PPD did not modify, change, or make a finding concerning the 1982 claim. Van Gundy requested and was granted an increase for his fourth injury, which he incurred in 2000. The staff hearing officer who vacated the order allowing that increase simply added up the various percentages of PPD awards from Van Gundy\u2019s five workplace injuries and then applied the 100 percent cap from R.C. 4123.57(A). The fact that the first injury was then more than 20 years old did not lessen the permanency or the relevance of the ten percent PPD determination for that injury, for as one member of the court has very recently noted, \u201cin the permanent-partial-disability context, \u2018permanent\u2019 refers to a claimant\u2019s lasting physical or mental impairment caused by the industrial injury.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Advantage Tank Lines v. Indus. Comm., </em>107 Ohio St.3d 16, 2005-Ohio-5829, 836 N.E.2d 550, \u00b6 16 (Lanzinger, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 11} A \u201cpermanent\u201d injury does not disappear or become irrelevant for purposes of R.C. 4123.57(A) simply because the worker is no longer receiving compensation for the injury. Nothing in R.C. 4123.57(A), in which the 100 percent cap is imposed, suggests that the bureau can or should ignore long-dormant claims \u2014 like Van Gundy\u2019s claim from his 1982 permanent injury \u2014 when calculating the percentages of permanent disability mentioned in that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">{\u00b6 12} We addressed this same issue 16 years ago when we explained that the 100 percent cap now codified at R.C. 4123.57(A) \u201crequires[s] the Industrial Commission to aggregate all permanent partial disability awards * * * to determine when the one hundred percent permanent partial disability ceiling * * * has been reached.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 144, 146, 556 N.E.2d 467. To be sure, we concluded in that earlier case that the 100 percent cap could not be applied retroactively to injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>sustained before the 1963 effective date of the provision, but that portion of our holding is not relevant to this case, because Van Gundy\u2019s first injury occurred in 1982. We explained in the <em>Sears </em>decision that the General Assembly had expressed its clear and unambiguous intention, by amending the statute, \u201cto have all permanent partial compensation percentage awards after 1963 aggregated in calculating the statutory one hundred percent ceiling.\u201d Id. at 148, 556 N.E.2d 467. That statement still holds true today.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AeY\">Philip J.

Luna v. Huffman </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 486, 487, 659 N.E.2d 1279. In light of the 100 percent cap on awards of PPD in R.C. 4123.57(A), Van Gundy cannot establish that he has a clear legal right to PPD compensation that would fix his percentage of permanent disability at 103 percent. The commission did not abuse its discretion when it applied that cap in Van Gundy\u2019s case. He was therefore not entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling the commission to reinstate the order awarding him a five percent increase in PPD, and the court of appeals properly granted judgment in the commission\u2019s favor on the mandamus complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b488-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor, O\u2019Donnell and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
