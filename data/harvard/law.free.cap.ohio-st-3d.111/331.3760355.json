The Tax Commissioner and the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) concluded, however, that the trusts\u2019 income passed through the trusts and was taxable to the husband and wife themselves. That conclusion was a sound one, and we therefore affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">{\u00b6 2} The appellants \u2014 David G. Knust and Susan Purkrabek-Knust \u2014 are a married couple in Cincinnati. They established a corporation in 1983 called Precision Packaging &amp; Services, Inc. As the name suggests, the company provided packaging services, and both David and Susan worked at the company, served as officers of the company, and were its sole shareholders initially.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">{\u00b6 3} Starting in 1995, David and Susan elected to treat the packaging company as a Subchapter S corporation (often referred to as an \u201cS corporation\u201d). As this court has explained, \u201cSubchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 1361 <em>et seq., </em>Title 26, U.S.Code) permits the owners of qualifying corporations to elect a special tax status under which the corporation and its shareholders receive conduit-type taxation that is comparable to partnership taxation.\u201d <em>Ardire v. Tracy </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 409, 674 N.E.2d 1155, fn. 1. \u201cFor tax purposes, a Subchapter S corporation differs significantly from a normal corporation in that the profits generated through the S corporation are taxed as personal income to the shareholders. The taxable income of an S corporation is computed essentially as if the corporation were an individual.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">{\u00b6 4} Then, in 1998, David and Susan created separate trusts, which they named the David Knust Grantor Trust and the Susan Purkrabek Grantor Trust. Both David and Susan transferred their shares of the packaging company\u2019s stock to their respective trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">{\u00b6 5} David named himself as the sole trustee of his trust, and Susan named herself the sole trustee of her trust. Each of them also chose in 1998 to designate their respective trusts as \u201celecting small business trusts\u201d or \u201cESBTs\u201d under the Internal Revenue Code. See Section 641(c), Title 26, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">{\u00b6 6} On February 26, 2000, the two trusts sold their shares of the packaging company to a separate corporate entity in which David and Susan held no interest. Each trust received more than $16 million for the sale of the company\u2019s shares, and both trusts paid federal income tax on those sale proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">{\u00b6 7} On their joint Ohio income tax return for the year 2000, David and Susan reported the proceeds from the sale as personal income to them, and they paid Ohio income tax on those proceeds in April 2001. They then asked the Tax Commissioner in late April 2001 to refund more than $2 million of the income taxes that they had just paid for tax year 2000, contending that the income received by the two trusts from the sale of the packaging company\u2019s shares should not have been treated by Ohio as taxable personal income to David and Susan themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">{\u00b6 8} The Tax Commissioner issued a final determination in 2004 denying David and Susan\u2019s refund claim for tax year 2000. David and Susan then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>challenged that decision before the BTA, which held a hearing on the matter in December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">{\u00b6 9} The BTA agreed with the Tax Commissioner, concluding that the two trusts were \u201cgrantor trusts\u201d \u2014 that is, they were trusts over which David and Susan, as the creators and trustees of the trusts, retained substantial control\u2014 and therefore the income received by the trusts was properly taxable to David and Susan themselves. The ordinary rule for the taxation of a grantor trust\u2014 that any income earned by the trust is taxed not to the trust but rather to the grantor himself or herself \u2014 is not changed, according to the BTA, by the fact that the trust has been designated as an \u201celecting small business trust\u201d under the Internal Revenue Code. The BTA therefore affirmed the Tax Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny David and Susan\u2019s refund claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">{\u00b6 10} David and Susan have now appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">{\u00b6 11} In reviewing a BTA decision, this court must determine whether that decision was \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 496, 497, 739 N.E.2d 783; R.C. 5717.04. The court \u201cwill not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Gahanna-Jejferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. But \u201c[t]he BTA is responsible for determining factual issues and, if the record contains reliable and probative support for these BTA determinations,\u201d this court will affirm them. <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150,152, 648 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">{\u00b6 12} The burden of proof rests on the taxpayer \u201cto show the manner and extent of the error in the Tax Commissioner\u2019s final determination.\u201d <em>Standards Testing Laboratories, Inc. v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 240, 2003-Ohio-5804, 797 N.E.2d 1278, \u00b6 30. The Tax Commissioner\u2019s findings \u201care presumptively valid, absent a demonstration that those findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Nusseibeh v. Zaino, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784 N.E.2d 93, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">{\u00b6 13} We must determine in this case whether the income earned in the year 2000 by David and Susan\u2019s trusts was part of David and Susan\u2019s own \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">{\u00b6 14} As we previously explained, \u201cOhio has imposed \u2014 in R.C. 5747.02(A) \u2014 a tax on the \u2018adjusted gross income\u2019 of individuals and has defined \u2018adjusted gross income\u2019 in R.C. 5747.01(A) as \u2018federal adjusted gross income, as defined and used in the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as provided in this section.\u2019 In other words, the adjusted gross income of Ohio residents and those who earn or receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>income in Ohio is taxed, and in calculating each taxpayer\u2019s \u2018adjusted gross income,\u2019 Ohio looks to the definition that Congress has given to that term in the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d <em>Buckley v. Wilkins, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 350, 2005-Ohio-2166, 826 N.E.2d 811, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 15} An individual taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income under the Internal Revenue Code includes \u201cgross income\u201d minus certain deductions not at issue in this case, and gross income includes income from various sources, including income received by the taxpayer from a trust. See Sections 61(a)(15) and 62(a), Title 26, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 16} The Internal Revenue Code also indicates that income earned by a grantor trust is taxable to the grantor rather than to the trust itself. See Sections 671 to 679, Title 26, U.S.Code. Time and again, federal courts have applied those statutory provisions to grantor trusts. See, e.g., <em>Schulz v. Commr. of Internal Revenue </em>(C.A.7, 1982), 686 F.2d 490, 495 (\u201cThe main thrust of the grantor trust provisions is that the trust will be ignored and the grantor treated as the appropriate taxpayer whenever the grantor has substantially unfettered powers of disposition\u201d); <em>Neely v. United States </em>(C.A.9, 1985), 775 F.2d 1092, 1094 (\u201cUnder 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671-677 (1982), a grantor of a trust who has retained certain powers of disposition which may be exercised without the approval or consent of an adverse party is treated as the owner of the trust and, thus, is taxed individually\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 17} The Tax Commissioner concluded that the two trusts in question were in fact grantor trusts, and the BTA agreed. That conclusion is a sound one and is not challenged by David or Susan, who were each entitled \u2014 according to the trust documents that they signed in 1998 \u2014 to \u201csell or exchange, publicly or privately, any assets, real or personal\u201d in their respective trusts. Also, they both expressly designated their trusts as grantor trusts, they both named themselves as the sole trustee of their respective trusts, they were each entitled to reclaim all or part of the trust assets and to receive all net income earned by their respective trusts, and they both reserved the right under the trust agreements to amend or revoke those agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 18} Even though their trusts were grantor trusts, David and Susan contend that the income earned by those trusts was not taxable to them personally, because they had designated the trusts as \u201celecting small business trusts\u201d or \u201cESBTs.\u201d That special designation, they claim, changes the basic rule that the income earned by a grantor trust should be treated as taxable income to the grantor himself or herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">{\u00b6 19} Congress created the ESBT designation in 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-188, 110 Stat. 1755, and gave trusts that were designated as ESBTs the power to own stock in S corporations. See Section 1361(e)(2)(A)(v), Title 26, U.S.Code. A trust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>can qualify as an ESBT if its only beneficiaries are individuals, estates, or certain organizations listed in the Internal Revenue Code. See Section 1361(e)(l)(A)(i), Title 26, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 20} There is no dispute in this ease that David and Susan designated their trusts as ESBTs when they created those trusts in 1998. And, as the BTA found, both David and Susan undeniably transferred all of the shares of their packaging company \u2014 an S corporation- \u2014 to those trusts in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">{\u00b6 21} The only question, then, is whether the trusts\u2019 status as ESBTs changed the taxability of the income that those grantor trusts earned. We conclude \u2014 like the Tax Commissioner and the BTA \u2014 that it did not. The income that the trusts earned when they sold the shares of the packaging company in 2000 is properly treated as part of David and Susan\u2019s own adjusted gross income for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 22} According to David and Susan, the income earned by their trusts should be taxed under Section 641(c), Title 26, U.S.Code. That provision explains how taxes are to be calculated on any portion of an ESBT that owns stock in one or more S corporations when an income tax is \u201cimposed by this chapter [Section 1 et seq., Title 26, U.S.Code] on such separate trust.\u201d Section 641(c)(1)(A) and (B), Title 26, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">{\u00b6 23} Title 26 of the U.S.Code, however, does not impose an income tax on grantor trusts. See Ferguson, Freeland &amp; Ascher, Federal Income Taxation of Estates, Trusts, and Beneficiaries (3d Ed.2000) 10-25 to 10-26, Section 10.05[C] (\u201cIf a grantor is treated as owner of an entire trust, * * * the trust has no tax liability to compute. Basically, therefore, the trust is completely ignored for income tax purposes\u201d); Danforth, A Proposal for Integrating the Income and Transfer Taxation of Trusts (1999), 18 Va. Tax Rev. 545, 546 (\u201cunder the so-called grantor trust rules of [Sections 671 to 679, Title 26, U.S.Code], a trust is not treated as a separate taxable entity if the grantor retains a sufficient degree of control over or beneficial interest in the trust\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">{\u00b6 24} Instead, the income earned by a grantor trust passes through to the grantor and is taxed to him or her under Sections 671 to 679, Title 26, U.S.Code. See Rev. Rui. 90-7, 1990-1 C.B. 153 (\u201cWhen a grantor is treated as the owner of an entire trust, the grantor is considered to be the owner of the trust assets for federal income tax purposes\u201d); Ferguson, Freeland &amp; Ascher, supra, at 10-26, Section 10.05[C] (\u201cThe grantor takes into account all its items of income, deductions, and credits in computing his or her tax liability\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">{\u00b6 25} Nothing in the statutory provision cited by David and Susan \u2014 Section 641(c), Title 26, U.S.Code \u2014 suggests that that principle changes when the grantor trust is designated as an ESBT. That statute simply says that when an income tax is imposed on a trust, that tax is to be calculated in a specified way if the trust is an ESBT. Where, as in this case, no income tax is imposed on the trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>however, the statute does not come into play. In other words, a grantor trust can elect ESBT status, but that status does not change the ordinary requirement that the grantor trust\u2019s income is taxed to the grantor and not to the trust itself. Grantor trusts pay no tax on the income they earn, and therefore the provisions of Section 641(c) concerning the calculation of taxes on an electing-small-business trust do not apply if the ESBT is a grantor trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">{\u00b6 26} The BTA reached that same conclusion, explaining that \u201cthe determination that an ESBT trust is a grantor trust * * * controls the manner of taxation\u201d for that trust. According to the BTA, there is no support \u201cfor the appellants\u2019 claim that an ESBT election overrides grantor trust rules.\u201d As explained above, the BTA\u2019s decision is consistent with the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 27} It is notable that the two trusts filed separate federal income tax returns for the year 2000 claiming the income earned by the trusts during that year as taxable to the trusts themselves rather than to David and Susan individually. That is, the appellants failed to include, as part of their own 2000 federal adjusted gross income, the income that their grantor trusts earned. Yet as the BTA rightly explained, \u201cthe Tax Commissioner is not confined to follow\u201d a taxpayer\u2019s statement that certain income should be excluded from the taxpayer\u2019s federal adjusted gross income.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 28} Like the Tax Commissioner and the BTA, we conclude that David and Susan should have included on their individual federal income tax returns the income that the grantor trusts earned. The failure of the Internal Revenue Service to insist that the returns be changed to reflect the trust income as personal income \u2014 a failure explained, perhaps, by the fact that ESBT trusts pay \u201cthe highest rate of tax\u201d under Section 641(c)(2)(A), Title 26, U.S.Code, on any taxable income \u2014 does not prevent the Tax Commissioner or this court from applying the federal statutes as they are written.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b629} The BTA\u2019s conclusion is also supported by a federal regulation that amplifies the statutory provisions discussed above. According to Section 1.641(c)-l(c), Title 26, C.F.R., an ESBT that is also a grantor trust is taxed like an ordinary grantor trust: \u201c[t]he grantor * * * includes\u201d in his or her own taxable income those \u201citems of income * * * attributable to * * * the ESBT under [Section 671, Title 26, U.S.Code].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 30} Admittedly, that regulation is \u201capplicable for taxable years of ESBTs that end on and after December 29, 2000.\u201d Section 1.641(c)-l(k), Title 26, C.F.R. David and Susan argue that the regulation does not apply to their trusts because the trusts sold the packaging company\u2019s shares on February 26, 2000. The <em>taxable year </em>in question for David and Susan\u2019s trusts ended on December 31, 2000, however, as is shown on the face of the federal income tax returns that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>filed for those trusts. Even if, as they contend, the ESBT status of their trusts ended once the packaging company\u2019s assets were sold by the trusts in February 2000, they have offered no separate tax returns suggesting that they treated the taxable year for the ESBTs as having ended on any date earlier than December 31, 2000. The regulation therefore <em>does </em>apply to them, and that regulation reinforces the conclusion that the BTA rightly drew from the relevant statutes: that David and Susan themselves owed state income tax on the income earned by their grantor trusts during tax year 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">{\u00b6 31} The BTA\u2019s conclusion that income earned by a grantor trust is taxable to the grantor rather than to the trust itself \u2014 even if the trust is an ESBT \u2014 is supported by the relevant federal statutes. The BTA\u2019s decision is reasonable and lawful, and we therefore affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton and Lanzinger, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b427-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b427-10\">O\u2019Donnell, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AkH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">{\u00b6 32} In 1998, David and Susan Knust created separate grantor trusts funded with shares of their packaging company, Precision Packaging &amp; Services, Inc. At that time, they designated those trusts as \u201celecting small business trusts\u201d (\u201cESBTs\u201d) pursuant to Section 641(c), Title 26, U.S.Code. On February 26, 2000, David and Susan sold their shares of Precision Packaging, which resulted in the termination of both ESBTs as of that date. Because this sale terminated the trusts prior to the applicability of the Treasury Regulation upon which the majority relies, the income earned by the trust is not taxable to David and Susan individually. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the decision of the majority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">{\u00b6 33} Section 443(a), Title 26, U.S.Code, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cA return for a period of less than 12 months (referred to in this section as \u2018short period\u2019) <em>shall </em>be made under any of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-14\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(2) When the taxpayer is in existence during only part of what would otherwise be his taxable year.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">{\u00b6 36} The trusts in question terminated on February 26, 2000, and, therefore, their taxable year ended on that date. Treasury Regulation 1.641(c)-l(k), upon which the majority relies, is \u201capplicable for taxable years of ESBTs that end <em>on and after </em>December 29, 2000.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 1.641(c)-l(k), Title 26, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>C.F.R. Because the ESBTs had terminated prior to December 29, 2000, the Treasury Regulation does not apply to them. The majority attempts to circumvent this regulation and the plain language of Section 443(a) by stating that David and Susan \u201coffered no separate tax returns suggesting that they treated the taxable year for the ESBTs as having ended on any date earlier than December 31, 2000.\u201d In my view, this point is not persuasive, because Section 443(a) provides that a \u201cshort period\u201d tax return \u201cshall be made\u201d when a taxpayer ceases to exist during a tax year. The tax year in question, therefore, terminated when the taxpayer ceased to exist regardless of the date indicated on the tax return.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AN0I\">Taft, Stettinius &amp; Hollister, L.L.P., and Stephen M.

Because this case involves the application of a federal tax statute, and because the Internal Revenue Service did not require David or Susan to amend their tax returns as the Commissioner has, I would hold that the ESBT income is not taxable to David or Susan individually.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
