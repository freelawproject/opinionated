Robinette </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 234, 245, 685 N.E.2d 762, we stated, \u201cSection 14, Article I of the Ohio Constitution affords protections that are coextensive with those provided by the Fourth Amendment [to the Constitution of the United States].\u201d This court can impose a more stringent standard than the federal standard when \u201cthere are persuasive reasons\u201d to do so. Id. at 239, 685 N.E.2d 762. See, also, <em>Arnold v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 616 N.E.2d 163, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-14\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cIt is a \u2018basic principle of Fourth Amendment law1 that searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>Payton v. New York </em>(1980), 445 U.S. 573, 586, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639, quoting <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire </em>(1971), 403 U.S. 443, 477, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564. See, also, <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 366, 372, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334. The officers in this case did not have a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-15\">{\u00b6 4} The presumption of unreasonableness applies \u201cexcept in a few well-defined and carefully circumscribed instances,\u201d including consent. <em>State v. Roberts, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 71, 2006-Ohio-3665, 850 N.E.2d 1168, at \u00b698, citing <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 454-455, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564. See <em>Georgia v. Randolph </em>(2006), \u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1515,1518-1519,164 L.Ed.2d 208 (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>Fourth Amendment recognizes a valid warrantless entry and search of premises when police obtain the voluntary consent of an occupant who shares, or is reasonably believed to share, authority over the area\u201d); <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez </em>(1990), 497 U.S. 177, 110 S.Ct. 2793, 111 L.Ed.2d 148. The officers in this case did not have express consent to enter.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AK2\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard Kasay, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b711-12\">David H. Bodiker, Ohio Public Defender, and Katherine A. Szudy, Assistant Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">{\u00b6 5} Consent to search must be given voluntarily, and the subject of a search has the right to refuse consent. <em>Georgia v. Randolph, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 126 S.Ct. at 1518-1519, 164 L.Ed.2d 208; <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte </em>(1973), 412 U.S. 218, 249, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854. The record contains little evidence (facial expressions and an opened door) that the officers received voluntary consent to enter the home. Negating that evidence is Officer Engelhart\u2019s statement, \u201cIn my line of work * * * if you wait for them to invite you in, you are wasting your time.\u201d There is evidence that indicates that the appellant refused to consent to the officer\u2019s entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">{\u00b6 6} When the state claims that a defendant consented to a warrantless entry, and the defendant disputes it, the burden rests on the state to show consent. <em>Vale v. Louisiana </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 30, 34, 90 S.Ct. 1969, 26 L.Ed.2d 409, citing <em>Chimel v. California </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 752, 762, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685, <em>United States v. Jeffers </em>(1951), 342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59, and <em>McDonald v. United States </em>(1948), 335 U.S. 451, 456, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153. The record does not contain sufficient evidence to establish that the state has satisfied its burden to show that the officers involved obtained voluntary consent to enter the home. I would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b711-10\">Moyek, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
