The state argues that the trial court erred in granting the estate\u2019s motion for summary judgment because the estate failed to establish that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Shortly after midnight on February 11, 1997, Officer Paul Thurman of the Independence Police Department spotted a truck parked in front of a closed gun shop. As Officer Thurman approached the vehicle, he detected the odor of burning marijuana. He asked the driver, Eicholz, to exit the vehicle so he could investigate further. Eicholz agreed to do so, but then attempted to physically restrain the officer from entering the vehicle. After a short struggle, Eicholz succeeded in closing the vehicle\u2019s door, locking the keys inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Eicholz was placed under arrest for interference with the lawful duty of a police officer. Officer Thurman ordered a tow for the vehicle. Upon arrival, the tow company unlocked the vehicle\u2019s door so that an inventory search could be conducted before the vehicle was towed. Officer Thurman found a black nylon gym bag on the passenger-side floorboard. The bag contained the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-8\">1) One clear bag containing 8.2 grams of methamphetamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-9\">2) One clear bag containing 1.5 grams of methamphetamine;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">3) One clear bag containing 23.2 grams of marijuana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-11\">4) Miscellaneous drug paraphernalia, including scales, nine plastic baggies, one syringe and a crack pipe;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-12\">5) One 25 caliber Falcon semi-automatic handgun with an empty magazine; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-14\">6)One black bag containing $10,500.00.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-15\">During a search incident to his arrest, $172.00 was recovered from Eicholz\u2019s left sock.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-16\">Eicholz was charged with the class C felony of possession of a controlled substance and the class A misdemeanor of possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to use. On February 14, 1997, the state filed a petition for forfeiture pursuant to the Criminal Activity Forfeiture Act (\u201cCAFA\u201d), \u00a7 513.600, <em>et seq., </em>RSMo 1994,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the $10,672.00 and Eicholz\u2019s truck.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The petition alleged that the seized property was \u201cused or intended for use in the course of, derived from, or realized through\u201d Eicholz\u2019s criminal activity. Alternatively, the petition alleged that the seized property was subject to forfeiture pursuant to \u00a7 195.140 because it \u201cwas in close proximity to amphetamines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-17\">A Jackson County Sheriff personally served Eicholz with a copy of the petition on March 4, 1997. Eicholz\u2019s answer to the petition was due on April 3, 1997. He did not file an answer by that date, nor did he otherwise challenge the seizure. On October 3, 1997, the state filed a motion for an interlocutory order of default, which was granted. Also on October 3, 1997, the court stayed the CAFA forfeiture proceeding, pending the outcome of Eicholz\u2019s criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-18\">Eicholz died approximately a month later, as a result of injuries he received from an explosion at a methamphetamine lab. The court was informed of Eicholz\u2019s death on November 10, 1997, and the pending criminal case against Eicholz was subsequently dismissed. Pursuant to a Rule 52.13 motion, Eicholz\u2019s estate was substituted for Eicholz in the CAFA forfeiture action on January 8,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>On January 21, 1998, the estate filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that pursuant to \u00a7 513.617, the state needed a criminal conviction before the money could be forfeited. The estate argued that because Eicholz was dead, the state could not obtain a conviction, and therefore the money could not be forfeited. In response, the state argued that the money was found in close proximity to drugs and was therefore presumed to be illegal drug proceeds under \u00a7 195.140. The state argued that Eicholz had not rebutted that presumption prior to his death. The state also argued that a guilty plea or a conviction was not a condition precedent to the forfeiture of the money and sought an entry of summary judgment in its favor. On March 30, 1998, after hearing arguments, the court entered an order granting the estate\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The state appeals, arguing that the estate failed to establish it was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. The state argues that a conviction or guilty plea is not a condition precedent to a judgment of forfeiture in a case such as this, where the currency was found in close proximity to a controlled substance and the estate failed to rebut the presumption of forfeitability. Also, the state argues that the court should have issued summary judgment in the state\u2019s favor because the currency in question was found in close proximity to controlled substances, an interlocutory order of default had been issued against Eicholz and the estate had never rebutted the presumption of forfeitability.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">Our standard for <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s entry of summary judgment is set forth in <em>ITT Commercial Fin. v. Mid-Am. Marine, </em>854 S.W.2d 371, 376 (Mo. banc 1993). We review the record in the light most favorable to the state, the party against whom the summary judgment was entered, and give the state the benefit of all reasonable inferences. <em>Id. </em>at 382. In order to be entitled to summary judgment, the estate must establish: (1) facts negating any one of the state\u2019s element facts; (2) that the state would not have been able to produce sufficient evidence allowing the trier of fact to find the existence of any one of the state\u2019s elements; or (3) that there is no genuine dispute regarding the existence of facts necessary to support the estate\u2019s properly-pleaded affirmative defense. <em>Id. </em>at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Presumption of Forfeitability</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">There are two statutes to be considered. One is \u00a7 195.140, which states in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAJB\">1. All controlled substances, imitation controlled substances or drug paraphernalia for the administration, use or manufacture of controlled substances or imitation controlled substances and which have come into the custody of a peace officer or officer or agent of the department of health as provided by sections 195.010 to 195.320, the lawful possession of which is not established or the title to which cannot be ascertained after a hearing as prescribed in Rule 34 of Rules of Criminal Procedure for the courts of Missouri or some other appropriate hearing, shall be forfeited, and disposed of as follows: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAHf\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-11\">2. (1) Everything of value furnished, or intended to be furnished, in exchange for a controlled substance, imitation controlled substance or drug paraphernalia in violation of sections 195.010 to 195.320, all proceeds traceable to such an exchange, and all moneys, negotiable instruments, or securities used, or intended to be used, to facilitate any violation of sections 195.010 to 195.320 shall be forfeited, except that no property shall be forfeited under this subsection to the extent of the interest of an owner by reason of any act or omission established by him to have been committed without his knowledge or consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-12\">(2) Any moneys, coin, or currency found in close proximity to forfeitable con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>trolled substances, imitation controlled substances, or drug paraphernalia, or forfeitable records of the importation, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances, imitation controlled substances or drug paraphernalia are presumed to be forfeitable under this subsection. The burden of proof shall be upon claimants of the property to rebut this presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">\u00a7 195.140, RSMo 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">The other is \u00a7 513.617, which is part of \u201cThe Criminal Activity Forfeiture Act\u201d [CAFA]. That section states in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-8\">In the event criminal charges arising from the same activity giving rise to the CAFA proceeding are filed against any individual claiming an interest in the property subject to the CAFA proceeding, such CAFA proceeding shall be stayed by the court until the disposition of the criminal charges. In such cases, no property shall be forfeited unless the person charged is found guilty of or pleads guilty to a felony offense substantially related to the forfeiture. The property of persons arrested, detained or apprehended and not subsequently charged is not subject to forfeiture for that arrest, detention or apprehension. The rights of an innocent owner of property are superior to any right or claim of the state or county, and such rights shall be enforced pursuant to the provisions of sections 513.610 to 513.620.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">\u00a7 513.617.1, RSMo 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">The two statutes are tied together by \u00a7 195.140.2(3), which provides that forfeiture proceedings under Chapter 195 shall be conducted pursuant to CAFA. Under CAFA \u201c[a]ll property of every kind used or intended for use in the course or, derived from, or realized through criminal activity is subject to civil forfeiture\u201d in a CAFA forfeiture proceeding. \u00a7 513.607.1, RSMo 1994. The state commences a CAFA action by filing a petition which sets forth: (1) the property sought to be forfeited; (2) that the property sought to be forfeited is within .the jurisdiction of the court; (3) the grounds for forfeiture; (4) the names of all known persons having or claiming an interest in the property; and (5) the date and place the property was seized. \u00a7 513.607.5(1) &amp; (2), RSMo 1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The burden of proving each of these elements is upon the investigative agency. \u00a7 513.607.5(2), RSMo 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-13\">In the present case, with undisputed evidence from Officer Thurman, the state proved four elements: the property sought to be forfeited; the date and place the property was seized; that the seized property was within the jurisdiction of the court; and the names of all known persons having or claiming an interest in the property. Additionally, the state argued that it had proved the fifth element because the money was found in close proximity to controlled substances, namely marijuana and methamphetamine, and under \u00a7 195.140.2, the money was presumed for-feitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-14\">CAFA defines \u201ccriminal activity\u2019-\u2019 with reference to several chapters of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, including Chapter 195 which relates to drug regulations. \u00a7 513.605(3)(a), RSMo 1994. Chapter 195 provides that \u201c[a]ll controlled substances, imitation controlled substances or drug paraphernalia ... which have come into the custody of a peace officer!,] ... the lawful possession of which is not established ... shall be forfeited.... \u201d \u00a7 195.140.1, RSMo 1994. Further, \u00a7 195.140.2(2) provides that money found in close proximity to contraband are \u201cpresumed to be forfeitable\u201d under \u00a7 195.140. The statute places the burden of rebutting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>the presumption upon the claimants of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In the present case, the $10,672.00 in question was found in close proximity to marijuana and methamphetamine, both of which are classified 'as controlled substances. <em>See </em>\u00a7 195.017.2(4X5), RSMo Supp.1998; \u00a7 196.017.4(3)0\u00bb), RSMo Supp. 1998. Therefore, the presumption was raised that the currency was forfeitable. The state\u2019s petition for forfeiture was filed on February 14, 1997, and Eicholz was personally served with a copy of the petition on March 4,1997. Eicholz\u2019s answer to the state\u2019s petition was due thirty days from March 4, 1997. Rule 55.25(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ei-cholz never answered the state\u2019s petition and consequently failed to rebut the presumption that the $10,672.00 was forfeita-ble. Therefore, we agree with the state\u2019s contention that the currency in question was forfeitable under \u00a7 195.140.2(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Requisite Guilty Plea or Criminal Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">The fact that the currency was <em>forfeitable </em>does not mean that the currency must be forfeited to the state. Although currency found in close proximity to a controlled substance is deemed <em>forfeitable </em>by \u00a7 195.140.2(2), the actual forfeiture proceeding which must be conducted before the property is forfeited is governed by CAFA. \u00a7 195.140.2(3), RSMo 1994. CAFA requires that \u201c[u]pon acquittal or dismissal of a criminal action against a person also named in a CAFA action, the civil action shall be dismissed.\u201d \u00a7 513.645.6, RSMo, 1994. Also, \u00a7 513.617.1, RSMo 1994, requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">In the event criminal charges arising from the same activity giving rise to the CAFA proceeding are filed against any individual claiming an interest in the property subject to the CAFA proceeding, such CAFA proceeding shall be stayed by the court until the disposition of the criminal charges. In such cases, <em>no property shall be forfeited unless </em>the person charged is found guilty of or pleads guilty to a felony offense substantially related to the forfeiture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-10\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-11\">Section 513.617 was added to CAFA in 1993. Prior to the amendment there was no provision requiring a guilty plea or a conviction as a condition precedent to a CAFA forfeiture. <em>State v. Residence Located at 5708 Paseo, Kansas City, Missouri, </em>896 S.W.2d 532, 537 (Mo.App. 1995). The addition of \u00a7 513.617 to CAFA evinces \u201cthe General Assembly\u2019s desire to restrain what it perceived to be overzealous use of federal and state forfeiture statutes.\u201d <em>State v. Sledd, </em>949 S.W.2d 643, 646 (Mo.App.1997). \u201c[T]he statute is ... clear that, if criminal proceedings <em>are </em>initiated by the state, the CAFA forfeiture action must be dismissed if those criminal proceedings <em>result </em>in an acquittal <em>or </em>dismissal.\u201d <em>State v. Residence Located at 5708 Paseo, </em>896 S.W.2d at 538 (second emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">As we have noted, \u00a7 195.140.2(3), subjects the forfeiture of controlled substances and currency found in proximity to controlled substances to the requirements of CAFA. The state contends that \u201c[t]he fact that \u00a7 195.140.2 remained virtually untouched [by changes the General Assembly made to various other sections of Chapter 195] demonstrates a direct intent to create a distinction between illegal proceeds and property used to facilitate criminal activity.\u201d We do not agree that \u00a7 195.140.2 remained \u201cvirtually untouched\u201d \u2014 the General Assembly added paragraph (3) to \u00a7 195.140.2, which states, <em>\u201cAll </em>forfeiture proceedings shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of sections 513.600 to 513.660, RSMo.\u201d \u00a7 195.140.2(3), RSMo 1994 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">The state urges us to draw a distinction between the forfeiture of \u201cillegal proceeds\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>and the forfeiture all other property, claiming that \u201c[a] distinction between illegal proceeds and property used to facilitate criminal activity is necessary in drug-related forfeitures and is widely accepted in other jurisdictions.\u201d We find no basis for drawing the distinction, in view of the statutory language, which specifies that CAFA applies to <em>\u201c[a]ll </em>property <em>of every kind </em>used or intended for use in the course of, derived from, or realized through criminal activity....\u201d \u00a7 513.607.1, RSMo 1994 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">No such distinction was noted in <em>Residence Located at 5708 Paseo. </em>That case involved a forfeiture action against a house alleged to have been the site of various illegal activities. <em>Residence Located at 5708 Paseo, </em>896 S.W.2d at 534. The owners of the house were never arrested or charged with any crime related to the crimes alleged to have been committed at the house. <em>Id. </em>at 536. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the forfeiture action, finding that the state did not prove the requisite criminal activity associated with the house necessary for forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>at 541. In <em>dictum, </em>this court also stated, \u201c[W]hen \u00a7 513.617 went into effect, a guilty plea or criminal conviction became necessary as a prerequisite to CAFA forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Three years after the decision in <em>5708 Paseo, </em>this court in <em>State ex rel. Callahan v. Collins, </em>978 S.W.2d 471, 473 (Mo.App. 1998), dealt with an appeal of a judgment ordering forfeiture of a handgun and $869.00 in currency. On appeal, Collins, the claimant, argued that the trial court had erred in finding that he had been convicted of a felony related to the forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>The state, in defending the appeal, apparently argued only that the trial court had sufficient evidence of the conviction to make the finding. The state did not argue that the showing of a conviction was unnecessary, and all parties apparently assumed that the proof of the conviction was necessary to the forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The state claims that the governing authority is <em>State v. Meister, </em>866 S.W.2d 485 (Mo.App.1993). Officers searching Meis-ter\u2019s van after a speeding arrest found marijuana and related materials along with $9,500.00 in currency. <em>Id. </em>at 487. The trial court\u2019s decision forfeiting the currency was affirmed, and this court made no mention of any conviction of Meister. <em>Meister, </em>however, was decided before \u00a7\u00a7 513.617 and 195.140.2(3), the statutory sections at issue in this case, became effective. Because the later enactment of \u00a7 195.140.2(3) caused the provisions of CAFA to become applicable to forfeiture actions pursuant to Chapter 195, <em>Meister </em>is not authoritative on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Thus, while no case directly on point refutes the contention of the state that no conviction is necessary, the statutory provisions seem clear in requiring the conviction, and the state has no pertinent authority in support of its contention. Consequently, we conclude that even property which is presumed forfeitable under \u00a7 195.140.2(3) requires a conviction of guilt before a judgment of forfeiture can be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Given the undisputed facts before it, the trial court did not err in entering summary judgment in favor of the estate and denying summary judgment for the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-11\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">HANNA and LAURA DENVIR STITH, JJ. concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-13\">.
