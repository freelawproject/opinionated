Boone <em>v. </em>Roberts, 1 Tex., 152-3, and authorities there cited. Counsel also insisted that the judgment of the court below was not a final judgment, citing 3 Black.

The court will not reverse a judgment because it is informal, if from the record the intention of the court can be clearly ascertained and the judgment can be intelligently executed.; The judgment declares the existence of the dormant judgment and awards execution thereon. Bullock <em>v. </em>Ballew, 9 Tex., 498; Camp <em>v. </em>Gainer, 8 Tex., 373-4; Minkhart <em>v. </em>Hankler, 19 Ill., 48; Freeman on Judgments, secs. 2, 47, 50, 51.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>II.

The facts judicially ascertained, with the manner of ascertaining them entered of record. 2. The recorded declaration of the court, pronouncing the legal consequences of the facts thus judicially ascertained. Mayfield <em>v. </em>The State, 40 Tex., 290; Hanks <em>v. </em>Thompson, 5 Tex., 10; Warren <em>v. </em>Shuman, id., 449; Scott v. Burton, 6 Tex., 322; Hancock <em>v. </em>Metz, 7 Tex., 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">The purported judgment under consideration is but a recital of the former one, showing that execution was ordered thereon, .but did not adjudge that execution again issue. Freeman on Judgments, \u00a7443; Camp v. Gainer, 8 Tex., 373; Bullock <em>v. </em>Ballew, 9 Tex., 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">There being no final judgment in this case sufficient to support the appeal, the same, under the long established practice of this court, is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">[Opinion delivered June 15, 1880.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
