Fraud\u2014Charge of court.\u2014It is only when the fact or intention which avoids a deed is patent upon the face of the instrument, or is a necessary deduction from it, that the court can pronounce it void. Nor is it authorized to tell the jury, upon proof of a given fact, that they should find against the instrument, unless fraud is a legal and indisputable deduction from the existence of the fact.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-8\">2. Fraud \u2014Bankrupt.\u2014A bankrupt, within six months prior to being adjudged a bankrupt, executed a deed of trust upon his entire stock of goods to secure a creditor; the deed was not filed for record until two months after its execution. No provision was made for other creditors. The trustee was to take possession only on the non-payment of the debt at maturity, and the business was to be conducted by the debtor, as usual, in the ordinary course of trade. <em>Held, </em>that the transaction was not fraudulent <em>per se; </em>for a court to hold otherwise would be a usurpation of the province of the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-10\">\"3. Assignee in bankruptcy\u2014Fraud \u2014 Deed of trust.\u2014An assignee in bankruptcy who failed to show that he represented creditors who were hindered, delayed or defrauded by a deed of trust, made and recorded by the bankrupt within six months before the adjudication in bankruptcy, was bound by it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-11\">Bankrupt law.\u2014The bankrupt law did not absolutely avoid all transfers made by the bankrupt within six months prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, but only those in which the grantee had reasonable cause to believe that the conveyance was made contrary to, or in fraud of, the law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-12\">5. Fraud\u2014Due diligence\u2014Notice. \u2014 The execution of a deed of trust by a debtor, out of his usual course of business, to secure a creditor, does not affect the creditor with notice of the debtor\u2019s insolvency, but imposes on him the duty of using due diligence to ascertain the fact.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b90-14\">6.

Deed of trust\u2014Fraud. \u2014A stipulation in a deed of trust executed on a stock of goods to secure a creditor, which attempts to create a lien on such goods as may be afterwards added to the stock, cannot affect the other provisions of the deed, if it be in other respects valid.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-18\">Error from Galveston.

Armstrong, assignee under the voluntary general assignment, entered a disclaimer, declaring that he did not claim the stock as against the assignee in bankruptcy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-12\">The deed of trust was to M. C. McLemore, trustee, and recited that it was to secure certain drafts, dated August 16, and due thirty, ninety, and one hundred and twenty days after date. The description of the property conveyed is:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-13\">\u201c All that stock of goods, wares and merchandise belonging to us, in our storehouse on the Strand, in the city of Galveston, as well as our future stock of goods as it may be hereafter acquired in the conduct of our mercantile business as general grocers, in the said city of Galveston, consisting, and to consist, of a general stock of groceries, Western produce, whiskies, wines and tobaccos.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-14\">In event of non-payment of said drafts, or any one of them, it was provided, in \u201c that event,\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-15\">\u201c The said trustee, or his successor, as hereinafter provided for, shall be entitled to the possession of all such property as is hereby conveyed, and intended to be conveyed, and he shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>be and is hereby authorized to enter the premises in which the same may be stored at the time of default, and to take possession of said premises, and the contents of said storehouse, and at request of the holder of any or all of said drafts, shall sell so much of said property at public auction as may be sufficient to satisfy said drafts.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-4\">In the amended petition Alford alleged, in explanation of not having sooner recorded the deed of trust, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-5\">\u201c It was not recorded earlier than 9th November, 1869, because plaintiffs wished to avoid the expense of its record, and relied on the good faith and ability of defendants to pay said drafts at maturity.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-6\">The testimony of M.

The objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\">Huffman, Musick &amp; Co. were indebted to other creditors on the 16th of August, 1869, about \u00a75,000, and previous to September 12, about \u00a77,000. They were adjudged bankrupts on December 19,1869. The court charged the jury, among other things, that if they believed from the evidence that plaintiff had not shown' that he acted in good faith in the matter of taking the mortgage, retaining it unrecorded, and permitting the mortgagors to remain in possession and continue to sell, with a view only to secure his debt, and not with a view to hinder, delay and defraud other creditors of the mortgagors, they would find the mortgage to be valid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-9\">Musick testified that at the time of the sale the firm owned no other property, but their stock on hand was worth about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>$4,000.

The first assignment of error is relied on as a proposition and is as follows: \u201cThe court erred in overruling exceptions of defendant to admission in evidence of deed of trust sued on, as said deed of trust shows on its face in express terms that it was given by Huffman, Musick <em>&amp; </em>Co., as merchants, on their stock of goods, wares and merchandise then on hand, and on all after-acquired stock, and gives no possession or right of possession of said stock to the trustee unless the makers fail to pay the notes for the security of which it was given.\u201d Peiser &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Peticolas, 50 Tex., 638; Baldwin <em>v. </em>Peet, 22 Tex., 708; Rev.

We rely on the third assignment of error also as a proposition, viz.: \u201c The court erred in refusing the following charge asked by defendants: If the jury find from the evidence that the deed of trust was given with the understanding and agreement between Huffman, Musick &amp; Co., or any other member of that firm, that it was not to be recorded until it should be necessary to use it, then the jury will find for the defendant.\u2019\u201d Gill <em>v. </em>Griffith, 2 Md., Ch. Dec., 270.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-7\">IV. The fourth assignment of error, which is also relied on as a proposition, is: \u201cThe court erred in refusing the following charge asked by defendant: \u2018As the deed of trust was given within six months prior to adjudication in bankruptcy, if the jury find that the stock of goods on which it was given constituted the sole capital of the firm, then it operated necessarily as a preference and in contemplation of insolvency, and the jury will find for the defendant.\u2019\u201d U. S. Revised Statutes, 1873, sec. 5129; Toof <em>v. </em>Martin, 13 Wall., 40; Wager <em>v. </em>Hall, 16 Wall., 277, 584; <em>In re </em>Kingsbury, 3 N. B.

The fifth assignment of error, which is relied on as a proposition, is as follows: The court erred in refusing the following charge asked by defendant: \u201cIf the jury believe that the mortgage was out of the usual course of business of Huffman, Musick &amp; Co., it was sufficient to put the plaintiff on inquiry as to the solvency of Huffman, Musick &amp; Co., and if the latter firm were actually insolvent at the time, the plaintiff was affected with notice of it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-9\">The deed of trust and the proof showed that Huffman, Musick &amp; Co. were wholesale grocers at the time of the transaction ; that they mortgaged their entire stock, on hand and to arrive, and all additions that might be made to it in the course of trade; that Huffman, Musick &amp; Co. continued in possession of the mortgaged property and carried on their business as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>before. The debt secured by the deed was about $6,800, the value of the stock of goods bought by them from the plaintiff) and they had, besides the stock thus purchased, about $4,000 worth of goods on hand, which were included in the mortgage, and had no other property. The inquiry made by plaintiff as to their solvency was of Geo. Sealy, of Ball, Hutchings &amp; Co. (Huffman, Musick &amp; Co.\u2019s bankers), and he said he considered them good; that they had been as prompt in meeting their obligations as any house in the city, and it was understood that Mr. Huffman was quite wealthy. P. A. Huffman stated that Ball, Hutchings &amp; Co. thought at the time of the sale that the credit and prospects of Huffman, Musick &amp; Co. were good, and W. A. Huffman stated that he did not suppose Alford at the time had any reason to suppose the firm was insolvent or contemplating insolvency; their financial condition at the time was somewhat embarrassed, but they had good reason to suppose they could pay all their debts.

Reg., p. 317.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-6\">VI. The deed of trust upon which the suit and judgment are founded extends its lien over after-acquired property, and permits the grantee to keep possession of the goods and deal with them as his own, and is therefore void, and more especially as to after-acquired goods, and judgment should have been rendered for the assignee in bankruptcy.

The court properly overruled exceptions to admission in evidence of trust deed. The fact that the trust deed expressed that it was given by Huffman, Musick &amp; Co., as merchants, on their stock of goods then in hand and thereafter to be acquired, and gave no possession, or right of possession, of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>stock to the trustee, except in the event of the makers\u2019.failing to pay the drafts to secure which the deed was executed, was no objection to its admission in evidence, or to its validity.

The court did not err in refusing to charge, \u201cThat there being no provision in the deed of trust allowing trustee to take possession of the goods of Huffman, Musick <em>&amp;. </em>Co. until the notes fell due, makes the instrument void, and the jury will find for defendant.\u201d Baldwin <em>v. </em>Peet, 22 Tex., 708, and cases cited under first counter proposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">III.

The court did not err in refusing to charge, \u201c As the deed of trust was given within six months prior to the adjudication in bankruptcy, if the jury find that the stock of goods on which it was given constituted the sole capital stock of the firm, then it operated necessarily as a preference and in contemplation of insolvency, and the jury will find for the defendant,\u201d because the charge as asked omitted altogether the controlling elements of <em>knowledge </em>and <em>intention.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-5\">Ewart v.

The court did not err in refusing to charge, \u201c If the jury' believe that the mortgage was out of the usual course of business of Huffman, Musick <em>&amp; </em>Co., it was sufficient to put the plaintiff on inquiry as to the solvency of Huffman, Musick &amp; Co., and if the latter firm were actually insolvent at the time, the plaintiff was affected with notice of it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">The court charged the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, \u201cThe mortgage, if it was in fact given in part consideration of the purchase made of the plaintiff at the time of said purchase, though its execution may not have been completed until a day subsequent, is not rendered invalid by the bankrupt act, and is valid, unless rendered invalid by the acts of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-8\">\u201c The mortgage is invalid as to all creditors, if you find from the proof that it was given, not in consideration of the purchase of plaintiff\u2019s goods at the time of said purchase, or subsequently in carrying out the contract then made, but that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>in fact made subsequently to said purchase, as a new arrangement to secure the debt made previously in said purchase, and that the mortgagors were insolvent at the time of making of said mortgage.\u201d (R. 37.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b98-5\">VI.

Where a trust deed is in the usual form, containing no stipulation that the makers thereof shall sell the goods conveyed in the usual course of trade and apply the proceeds to their own benefit, or to the purchase of other goods, and not to the payment of the secured debt, it is not void upon its face. And where the facts do not tend to show that the makers applied the proceeds of the sale of the goods to their own benefit, or to the purchase of other goods, but, on the contrary, the proof is that part of the debt <em>was </em>paid by the makers while in charge of the goods, such trust deed is valid. Crow, Hargadine <em>&amp; </em>Co. <em>v. </em>Red River County Bank, Tex. Law J. of 24 Dec., 1879; S. C., Tyler Term.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b98-8\">Moore, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AgC\">The correctness of the verdict of the jury upon the evidence submitted to them, is not controverted. The errors assigned relate solely to the action of the court in overruling an exception of appellant to the admission in evidence of the deed of trust given by Huffman, Musick &amp; Co. to secure the payment of the notes to Alford, upon which the suit is founded, and to the refusal of the court to give certain charges requested. by appellant as to the effect of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>deed. These errors are substantially exhibited in the following summary, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Note.\u2014Moody <em>v. </em>Wright, 13 Met. (54 Mass.), 17, cited by plaintiff in error in support of his last, or sixth, proposition, is expressly overruled in Brett <em>v. </em>Carter, 2 Lowell\u2019s Decisions, 458, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>1st. It appearing upon the face of the deed that the grantors were authorized to retain possession of the stock of goods, wares and merchandise covered by it, and to continue selling in their usual course of business until default in the payment of the notes for security of which it was given, the deed was fraudulent and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">2d. If the deed was given upon the understanding with Huffman, Musick &amp; Co., or with any member of the firm, that it was not to be recorded until it should become necessary to use it, the jury should find for appellant, the defendant in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">3d. If the stock of goods upon which the deed was given constituted the entire capital of the firm of Huffman, Musick &amp; Co., as it was given within six months prior to their adjudication in bankruptcy, it necessarily operated as a preference and in contemplation of insolvency, and the jury should find in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">4th. If the giving of the deed was out of the usual course of business of Huffman, Musick &amp; Co., this was sufficient to put Alford upon inquiry as to their solvency, and if they were in fact insolvent at the time, Alford was charged with notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">No complaint is made by appellant of the instruction given the jury by the court, or, as we have said, to their finding on the evidence submitted to them. It would seem that the theory upon which appellants counsel sought to have the case tried in the court below, and asks that it shall be determined in this court, is, that the facts exhibited by the deed, or the finding by the jury of either of those referred to in the charges asked, is conclusive evidence, of fraud, irrespective of the purpose and intent of the parties executing the deed. In other words, the retention of possession and power to sell in the ordinary course of trade, by the mortgagors, the failure to record the deed, the giving of a deed upon the entire capital Stock of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>a firm within six months prior to its adjudication in bankruptcy, or the giving a deed of trust on their entire stock, the bankrupts, in conformity to the agreement upon which they purchased the bulk of it, if not in their usual course of trade, was <em>per se </em>conclusive evidence of fraud sufficient to avoid a deed, though the evidence might be ample to rebut. the presumption of fraud which these matters would warrant, if unexplained.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Such, in our opinion, is not the law as established and maintained by the unbroken current of decisions of this court from its organization down to the present time. (Bryant <em>v. </em>Kelton, 1 Tex., 417; Converse v. McKee, 14 Tex., 20; Earle <em>v. </em>Thomas, Id., 583; Linn <em>v. </em>Wright, <em>18 </em>Tex., 317; Baldwin <em>v. </em>Peet, 22 Tex., 708; Howerton <em>v. </em>Holt, 23 Tex., 57; Green <em>v. </em>Banks, 24 Tex., 508; Kerr <em>v. </em>Hutchins, 46 Tex., 384.)</p>\n<p id=\"Ae6\">It is only where the fact or intention which avoids the deed is patent upon the face of the instrument, or is a necessary deduction from it, that the court can pronounce it void. Nor is it authorized to tell the jury, upon proof of a given fact, they should find against the instrument, unless fraud is a legal and indisputable deduction from the existence of the fact, or matter in question.</p>\n<p id=\"Acu\">How, although the objections made by appellant to the <em>bona fides </em>of the deed in question in this case, are certainly obvious badges of fraud, and, it may be, would have fully justified the jury, or even, taken in connection with the other testimony, have required them to return a different verdict from that found, as the matters indicated in the instructions asked are neither singly nor collectively such as to warrant a conclusive deduction of fraud, it was not error for the court to decline giving them. To have done otherwise would have been an usurpation by the court of the province of the jury, or rather to have made the decision of the case turn upon proof of a badge of fraud, instead of actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"AG_\">\u2022 The deed of trust was good as between the parties and those charged with notice of it, whether recorded or not. And it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>seems to be well established, that, as it was recorded before appellant was appointed assignee, he stands in no better position in respect to it than would the grantees, especially as it has not been made to appear that he represents creditors who have been delayed, hindered or defrauded by the deed. (Winsor <em>v. </em>McLellan, <em>2 </em>Story, 492; <em>In re </em>Dow, 6 N. B. R. Rep., 10; Sawyer <em>v. </em>Turpin, 1 Otto, 114.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The bankrupt law does not absolutely avoid all transfers by the bankrupt within six months prior to the adjudication, but only where the party to whom the property is conveyed has reasonable cause to believe the conveyance is contrary to, or in fraud of, the law. (Rev. St. U. S., sec. 5120; Craig <em>v. </em>Carmichael, 2 Dill. C. C. Rep., 519.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Nor does the fact that the deed of trust given by Huffman, Musick &amp; Co. was out of their usual course of business (though there is nothing in the record on which to base such a conclusion), affect Alford with notice of their insolvency, if they were insolvent, but imposes upon him the duty of using due diligence to inform himself upon the subject. (Schulenburg <em>v. </em>Kabureck, 2 Dill. C. C. Rep., 132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">So obvious is the conclusion from what we regard as the well established law and practice of this court,'that the court did not err in its rulings, that it seems to us unnecessary to add to what has been already said, nor would we do so but for the zeal and learning displayed by appellant\u2019s counsel, and the evident good faith with which they refer to a recent decision of the court (Peiser <em>v. </em>Peticolas, 50 Tex., 638), as supporting their first assignment of error, as well as a fundamental error, which, as they insist, is shown by the record, viz.: That the deed of trust is void, because it purports to convey subsequently acquired property.</p>\n<p id=\"ABP\">It is said in Peiser <em>v. </em>Peticolas, in accordance with previous decisions of the court (Baldwin v. Peet, 22 Tex., 708; Bailey <em>v. </em>Mills, 27 Tex., 434), that \u201cwhere well defined legal fraud is shown upon the face of the instrument itself, without resort to extrinsic testimony,\u201d it is the duty of the court to declare its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>legal effect and pronounce the instrument void. And if the fact that Huffman, Musick &amp; Co. were to retain the goods conveyed by them, with the right to sell in the usual course of business until they should make default in payment of the notes for security of which the deed was given, \u201cis well defined legal fraud,\u201d it cannot be defined that the court below erred in refusing to exclude the deed from the jury. But while there is no doubt great conflict in the decisions upon the point, we are not prepared to say that such a stipulation in a deed of trust, without reference to the facts, is legal fraud. In our opinion the weight of authority is against it. To hold that authority to sell in his usual course of business invalidates the deed,would virtually deny to a trader the right to give a mortgage 'upon his stock for ever so short a time, however inconsiderable the debt might be in comparison with the mortgaged property, or however clearly the facts might demonstrate that there was no intent or purpose to defraud. (Fletcher <em>v. </em>Morey, <em>2 </em>Story, 555; Briggs <em>v. </em>Parkman, <em>2 </em>Met., 258; Jones <em>v. </em>Hoggendon, 3 Met., 507; Hughes <em>v. </em>Craig, 20 Iowa, 399.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Ordinarily, when possession is held in accordance with the terms of the deed, such possession is not even a badge of fraud; while in other cases its retention by the grantor, and especially with the power of disposition, is the strongest evidence of fraud; and if it appear on the face of the deed that it will operate to an unreasonable advantage of the grantor or to the detriment and injury of his creditors, the deeds will be pronounced fraudulent <em>per se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The case of Peiser v. Peticolas, evidently, in the opinion of the judge by whom the opinion was prepared, belonged, if the facts before the court and admitted by the grantee were shown by the deed, to the last class of cases. While there are some very strong expressions in the opinion which seem to give countenance to the conclusion that the retention of possession of mortgaged property, coupled with the right to sell, authorizes the court to pronounce a deed fraudulent in law, it must be remembered that the opinion and judgment of a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>must always be measured and interpreted by the facts and points to be decided, and in this case the court was exercising the blended functions of court and jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The deed in that case, it should also be noted, was given to secure a debt past due. The possession and right to sell the existing and subsequently acquired stock was for a period of indefinite duration. The effect of such a transaction, if legal, was to permit an insolvent party to do business under cover of deed of trust in favor of friendly and preferred creditors, in defiance of and at the expense of his other creditors, for an indefinite period of time. It might well be said, when such a case as that is shown on the face of the deed, that the court could only construe it as a fraudulent device to hinder and delay creditors, irrespective of the real intent and purpose of the parties. Such a possession and power of disposition was unreasonable and inconsistent with the <em>bonce fide </em>security of a debt already past due, and a delay and hinderance of the creditor's. The agreement seems evidently to have contemplated a continuance for such a length of time that the entire stock on hand would be disposed of in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The facts of this case are altogether different. Possession was to be retained merely until there was a default or failure to meet the notes, which had but a short time to run. The amount of goods was considerably in excess of the debt with which they were charged. This excess was apparently sufficient to permit of sales in the ordinary course of business by the owner without impairing the security. Under these circumstances we do not think it can be said that the court would have been warranted in holding the deed absolutely void or in instructing the jury that it was their duty to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In response to the objection that the deed is invalid because it attempts to create a lien upon such goods, wares and merchandise as might be subsequently added to their stock by the grantors, it will suffice to say that the record does not show that there were any additions made to the stock after the execution of the deed. Such a stipulation in a deed certainly does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>not affect its provisions, if otherwise valid, in respect to the stock on hand at the date of the deed. There is, therefore, nothing in the record to sustain the objection, even if it had been assigned as error; much less can it be said that the court should reverse the judgment because it goes, as claimed, to the foundation of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">There is no error in the judgment of which appellant has complained, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahz\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
