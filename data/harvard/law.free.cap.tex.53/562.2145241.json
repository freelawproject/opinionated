Afterwards, B. brought suit against C. on an account embracing charges . antedating the bankruptcy, for ties and other merchandise furnished him, in which C. was credited with net proceeds of different lots of cotton consigned by him.

H. Reed and others, creditors of the defendants, filed their petition in the United States district court for <em>the western </em>district of Texas, at Austin, praying the court to adjudge them bankrupts under the bankrupt law then in force; that afterwards, according to the provisions of the bankrupt law, the requisite number of creditors accepted a proposition from defendants for composition; that the resolution of defendants\u2019 creditors, accepting the composition, was filed in that court; that the proposition so accepted on composition proceedings in bankruptcy by defendants\u2019 creditors was, that defendants pay to their creditors thirty-two and one-half cents on each dollar due, to wit: ten cents within ten days of record of resolution to accept composition, and twenty-two and one-half cents on the dollar in two installments in four and eight months, for which defendants would execute notes indorsed by A. Harris &amp; Bro., Houston, Texas; that they, defendants in bankruptcy proceedings, did file names of creditors and amount due each, including names of plaintiffs and amount due them; that after such composition proceedings were had, plaintiffs accejffed from defendants the ten cents cash payment proposed in composition on the amount due them, and notes for the balance as specified in the proposition and resolution for composition, of twenty-two and one-half cents, indorsed by Harris &amp; Bro., which notes defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>averred had been paid plaintiffs by them, and that the money was paid and notes given, and the notes were received and accepted in satisfaction of the plaintiffs\u2019 debt sued on, under bankruptcy proceedings, and therefore that defendants had no cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">Defendants, by a further special plea, alleged that if the contract between plaintiffs and defendants, in regard to grip ties, was a trust contract, and not discharged by the bankrupt proceedings, then defendants claim credit for $1,001.48, being amount of cotton shipped to plaintiffs, and amount of allowance on grip ties, as made in plaintiffs\u2019 account sued on, and the further sum of $544.05, being thirty-two and one-half per cent, on $1,674, the amount charged for the ties, which defendants paid to plaintiffs as represented in special answer, on the whole account claimed by plaintiffs, and which plaintiffs were not entitled to receive under composition proceedings, if the account for said ties was not liable to be settled thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">The court, the cause being submitted without a jury, rendered judgment for defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-8\">The following is a copy of the contract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-9\">\u201c Messrs.

The evidence shows a written agreement in July, 1877, between B. Alexander &amp; Bro., merchants in McLennan county, and Kaufman &amp; Runge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>carrying on a general mercantile and commission business in Galveston, the purport of which was, that Kaufman &amp; Runge were to furnish Alexander &amp; Bro. the grip cotton tie on consignment, they agreeing \u201cto handle the grip cotton tie as follows, viz.: Paying $2.50 per bundle, with invoice rendered (after first sixty days) every thirty days for number of bundles ties sold (less ten per cent.).\u201d They to give K. &amp; R. \u201c their entire shipments of cotton, and influence,\u201d and to bear \u201call expenses on consignment, such as fire insurance, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The account sued on embraces charges for grip ties, bagging and twine, in the fall of 1877, and is credited with net proceeds of different lots of cotton consigned during that season to K. &amp; R. by Alexander &amp; Bro. A subsequent credit is admitted, growing out of payments under the proceedings in bankruptcy, on a composition by B. Alexander &amp; Bro. with their creditors, plaintiffs not having signed said composition proceedings. Plaintiffs say their demand is for goods delivered to defendants to be sold on commission, and is based on the failure of defendants to account for said goods in kind, or to pay for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">There is nothing in the evidence from which it can be inferred that Alexander &amp; Bro. appropriated any of the articles consigned to them otherwise than by sale, as contemplated by their agreement. Their default is in failing to pay for ties sold at the end of every thirty days. From the terms of the written agreement, we think it clear that it was not contemplated by the parties that Alexander &amp; Bro. should keep separate the proceeds of each sale to be handed over as the money of Kaufman &amp; Runge. Indeed, it would seem that they were not prohibited from selling on time, or on such terms as they saw fit. For ties sold, Alexander &amp; Bro. were to make report and payment at a stipulated price every thirty days. Kaufman &amp; Runge looked to them for pay, not for the mere transmission of what they might have actually received for sales. In fact, the only payments made during the season were in shipments of cotton.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Our conclusion is that the demand of plaintiffs is for a debt due them by their agents, growing out of and contemplated by the contract between them, and not, so far as the evidence shows, involving any bad faith or breach of trust on the part of the agents in appropriating as their own that which, by reason of their fiduciary relation, they were bound to hold in trust for their principals. Whilst there is quite a conflict of decisions as to the proper construction of this clause of the bankrupt act, and especially as to its application to a demand by a consignor against a factor, it is not believed that any of the cases would require the exclusion from the benefits of the bankrupt law of all debts growing out of an agency to sell, or of such a debt as we understand this to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">An important element in this case, and not in some of the cases as to factors and commission merchants, is, that under the contract the proceeds of sales did not become the property of the principal, so as to make it wrongful in defendants to use those proceeds or mingle them with their own money. Bonning <em>v. </em>Bleakey, 27 La. An., 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">This court has held \u201c a debt growing out of the conversion by an attorney of his client\u2019s money or property in his hands as such, \u201d to be a debt created whilst acting in a fiduciary character. Flanagan <em>v. </em>Pearson, 42 Tex., 1. Such a breach of duty involves moral delinquency by one held to be acting in a fiduciary capacity within the spirit of the decisions construing the bankrupt law of 1841. We are inclined to regard the better rule as laid down in those decisions which accept the clause in question as substantially the same as in the law of 1841, and thus adopt and retain the benefit of the \u201cfixed judicial construction \u201d given to the expression <em>\u201c </em>fiduciary capacity,\u201d under the act of 1841. Woolsey <em>v. </em>Cade, 54 Mo., 378; Cronan <em>v. </em>Cotting, 104 Mass., 245; Hennequin <em>v. </em>Cleves, N. Y. Court of Appeals, 1879 (8 Rep., 210); Kisme <em>v. </em>Graf &amp; Co., U. S. C. C., West. Dist. Pa., 1878 (5 Rep., 489); Chapman <em>v. </em>Forsyth, 2 How., 202; Neal <em>v. </em>Clark, 95 U. S., 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In the last cited case the supreme court of the United States, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>whose decision \u201c would be authoritative on questions of federal cognizance,\u201d quote largely from Chapman <em>v. </em>Forsyth, the quotation winding up with the proposition: \u201cA factor is not, therefore, within the act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">But, according to our view of the present case, it is not necessary for us to go to that extent. \u201cThe demand of the plaintiffs, as developed in the record, was not of a fiduciary character, and was discharged by the proceedings in bankruptcy and composition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">[Opinion delivered June 4, 1880.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
