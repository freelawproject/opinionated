The agent issuing the ticket was authorized, by custom among railroads, only to issue tickets of a certain prescribed form. The ticket purchased was not of the prescribed form, and on being presented was not accepted by the conductor, who ejected the passenger from the car, after the train had proceeded a few miles from the station, on his refusing to pay his fare as a passenger.

Jones, a railroad ticket from Galveston to Waco; that there were two tickets on one piece of paper, one being for the Galveston, Houston &amp; Henderson Railroad, from Galveston to Houston, the other being, for the Texas Central Railroad, from Houston to Waco; that the conductor from the Galveston road tore off the ticket for his road and returned the other half; that when he presented his ticket to the conductor on the Central road, he refused to receive it because it was detached from its stub, and demanded fare, which being refused, Ford was compelled to leave the train at Eureka, six miles from Houston; that the ticket was signed \u201cH.

On March 21, 1874 (Laws of 1874, p. 31), the legislature passed an act permitting such corporations to be sued in the county where the cause of action accrued, or in the county where it might have an agent. On April 17, 1874 (Laws of 1874, p. 107), the legislature passed an act permitting such corporations to be sued in the county where the cause of action accrued. This last act repeals so much of the act of March 21, 1874, as permitted such a corporation to be sued wherever it might have an agent. It will be perceived that both acts, up to the end of the first clause of the first act, cover and include the same character of parties, to wit, all corporations, whether public or private, whether foreign or domestic, except towns, cities and counties, and that both legislate upon the same subject matter, viz.: suits against corporations; and that the evident intention and effect of both of these acts is to regulate the whole of the matters they respectively treat of. The last act provides that service of process may be had upon the agent or person representing such company, not as in the first act upon any agent in any county, but upon the agent where the suit can be brought, <em>i. e., </em>the county where the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>of action accrued. This last act makes no provision for the bringing of a suit and for service of process against a corporation in any county where it may happen to have an agency, as did the first act, and an attempt may be made from this to contend that that act is still in force. But this cannot be done logically and successfully, because a further reading of the last act will clearly demonstrate that it was the evident intention of the legislature that that provision of law should no longer exist. This last act, to show that the legislature had the whole subject matter under consideration, and to leave no room for construction as to the meaning of the words, \u201cin which [county] the cause of action, or a part thereof, accrued\u201d-\u2014for though in cases of personal injuries inflicted by a carrier, or a breach of contract by it, for instance, there can be no question as to whore the cause of action accrued, yet there might be room for argument as to where a cause of action on a policy of life or fire insurance accrued, the foundation of the suit being the contract, evidenced by the policy, and not the loss or the death. To show, therefore, that the legislature had the whole subject in its mind, this last act further provides that suits against a fire or marine insurance company may he commenced in any county where the property (or any part of the same) insured may he situated; and in case of any suit against any life or accident insurance company, in any county where the person insured may reside. But it may be suggested that the word \u201c may \u201d in this last act leaves it optional with a plaintiff whether he will sue a railroad company, for instance, as in the case at bar, in any county where it has an agent under the first act, in the county where the loss occurred under the second act, or in the county of its domicile under the general law. The answer to this is that the word \u201cmay\u201d means \u201cmust\u201d about as often as it means \u201cmay;\u201d that the word \u201c may \u201d in a statute means \u201c must \u201d whenever the object of the statute and its connection with the context and subject matter show that that is its meaning; that the word \u201cmay\u201d in a statute often means \u201c must\u201d in one appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>cation of the statute and \u201cmay\u201d in another. These propositions are so elementary as not to need the support of authority. The meaning of these words is not fixed, but depends entirely upon the context and the intention of the statute, and upon the evils to be remedied by it. See Fowler <em>v. </em>Pirkins, 77 Ill., 271; 3 Hill, 602; 5 Selden (9 <em>N. </em>Y.), 163. If the word \u201cmay\u201d in this second statute is to be taken in its optional sense, then the whole of the second statute becomes entirely inoperative, because it leaves the law in precisely the same condition in which it was after the passage of the first act and before the passage of the second. This last act then becomes a dead letter; its space in the statute might as well be blank. The only way in which a meaning and an effect can be given to it is by construing it to mean that no suit shall be brought against a corporation in a county where it may have an agency, as might be done under the first act, unless that county is also the one where the cause of action accrued, and where the suit may be brought under the provisions of the second act. The residence of appellant is in Harris county. The injury complained of took place in Harris county. Appellant is a railroad company, and has an agent in Travis county.

The act of March 21, 1874, referred to in appellant\u2019s brief, is operative, and is the law of this state as to venue in such cases as this. It has been construed by this court, and is <em>stare decisis. </em>It was admitted that appellant had an agency in Travis county, and a copy of citation and of petition was served on him. Gen.

The action was based on a violation of the rights of appellee, and the duty of appellant to appellee and the public, and in such case the supreme court will not grant a new trial upon the ground of excessive damages when it does not appear at first blush that the damages are flagrantly excessive, or that the jury have been influenced by passion, prejudice or partiality. Cook <em>v. </em>Garza, 9 Tex., 358; Hoggland <em>v. </em>Cothren, 25 Tex., 345.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b377-11\">Bonner, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ANk\">The assignment of errors raises, among other questions, the following: That the court erred in rendering judgment against the defendant company on its plea to the jurisdiction; that upon the law and the evidence the defendant was entitled to judgment upon the merits, and that the verdict was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">1. It is objected that though the trespass was committed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the county of Harris, in which the defendant had its domicile, the suit was brought in the county of Travis, in which it had simply an agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Section 1, acts 14th Leg., 31, approved March 21, 1874, provides: \u201cThat hereafter any public or private corporation, including railroad companies, * * * may be sued in any court in this state having jurisdiction of the subject matter, in any county where the cause of action or a part thereof accrued, or in any county where such corporation has an agency, or representative, or in the county in which the principal office of such corporation is situated.\u201d By section 1 of a subsequent act, same session of the legislature (14th Leg., 107), approved April 17, 1874, it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201cThat any public or private corporation, * * * or any association or joint stock company, may be sued in any court having jurisdiction of the amount in controversy, in any county in this state, in which the cause of action, or a part thereof, arose; * * * <em>provided, </em>that any suit against a fire or marine insurance company or association may be commenced. in any county where the property or any part of the same insured may be situated; and in case of any suit against any life or accident insurance company or association, suit may be commenced in any county where the persons insured, or any of them, may reside at the date of the suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Neither of these statutes contain a repealing clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">It is contended by appellant, that as these two acts embrace the same subject matter the former is repealed by implication by the latter, and as this contains no provision to fix the venue simply by reason of agency in a particular county, the fact of such agency in Travis county did not give the district court of that county jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">As said in the recent case of Railway Co. <em>v. </em>Willie, <em>ante, </em>p. 325, we are not advised why the legislature at the same session passed two separate acts so similar in their provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">It would seem, from the two sections above quoted, that the first act was intended to extend the right to institute suits, more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>particularly against railroad companies, in other courts than that of the county of the domicile of the company; and that the second was intended to extend like remedy to any association, joint stock and insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">As they were passed at the same session of the legislature, a more liberal rule of construction should be allowed against the repeal by implication of the first by the passage of the second, and we are of opinion that there is not such irreconcilable repugnancy between them as to authorize us to say that it was thus repealed. Neill <em>v, </em>Keese, 5 Tex., 23; Cain <em>v. </em>State, 20 Tex., 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">We do not say that a ease might not arise which would not come within the intention of the legislature, as where suit should be brought in some county so disconnected with the principal business of the company, under such circumstances as would show that the law which was intended for the protection of plaintiffs had been designedly used to the injury of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">2. The ticket presented by the plaintiff to the conductor was detached from the stub, and had upon it the words which the plaintiff admits that he had seen \u2014\u201c not good if detached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">As thus presented, by its express terms it was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to demand that he should be carried by the company, and the conductor was justified in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">The liability of the company then, if any, must rest upon the improper issuance and sale of the ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">The testimony shows that it was sold to plaintiff by Jones, who had no connection as agent or otherwise with the defendant company, and which consequently was not bound by his act. That it was issued by Andrews, who was the general ticket agent of the Galveston, Houston &amp; Henderson Railroad, a different company from the defendant. That he was not the agent of the defendant company, and had no authority whatever to issue tickets over its road, such as that presented by plaintiff; his only authority for this purpose being derived from a custom among railroad companies to issue tickets of a certain prescribed form.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>At most, then, he occupied toward the defendant company but the relation of a special agent, with certain prescribed duties, and not having been held out by the defendant as its agent, the plaintiff dealt at his peril with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Whatever may have been the individual liability of Jones or Andrews, or of the company represented by him, for the wrongful act of the issuance and sale of an improper ticket, the defendant, under the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence, was not liable in damages. Story on Agency, \u00a7 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">3. Even had the defendant been liable, we feel constrained to say that under the evidence the verdict seems excessive. His recovery was for actual damages only. He was carried but a few miles from Houston, and was detained but a few hours, and no special damage from inconvenience, disappointment or loss of time was proven. His slight sickness is not shown to have been occasioned by the delay, as he left Galveston on account of his health, and he was politely treated by the conductor.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Under these circumstances, it would seem that a verdict for $750 was excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">[Opinion delivered May 21, 1880.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
