Inasmuch as defendants have not sustained their burden of proof as movants for summary judgment, plaintiff\u2019s failure to submit sworn competent, admissible, material evidence in opposition is not dispositive <em>(compare, McLoyrd v Pennypacker, </em>178 AD2d 227, <em>lv denied </em>79 NY2d 754).
