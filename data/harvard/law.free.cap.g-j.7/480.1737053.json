Does this deed under the circumstances of this case in <em>Delaware, </em>and never acknowledged or recorded agreeably to the laws of <em>Maryland, </em>defeat the operations of the attachment from Cecil county court, which was levied on the lands and credits of the debtor within the <em>State of Maryland </em>?</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b493-9\">It will not be denied, that it is legal for a debtor, in this <em>State </em>in failing circumstances, to convey and assign all his property to trustees for the general benefit of creditors, 6 <em>Gill and Johnson, </em>205. But then such deed, is in all respects to be tested by the laws and rules which decide the validity of all other deeds embracing the same species of property. The deed in this case, was executed, acknowledged and recorded in conformity with the laws of <em>Delaware, </em>as is admitted; but it was never authenticated and recorded, as required by the laws of <em>Maryland; </em>of the plaintiffs knowledge of its existence there is furnished no evidence, either constructively, by the recording of it, in this <em>State, </em>nor actually, by information in relation to the subject. On account of not being recorded within the time limited by our law, it clearly did not convey any interest in the lands in this <em>State, </em>but the legal title therein, still continues in the grantor or debtor, and of course remained subject to his debts, and to all those remedies which the law gives for the recovery and collection of debts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>At the time then of issuing the attachment, (and even now,) the legal title in the land remained in <em>D. Wilson, </em>and was itself a fund, on which the attachment might be laid, and the debt levied. For although, there existed between <em>D. Wilson </em>and <em>George Ford, </em>a bond for the conveyance of the said land, on the payment of a certain sum of money, yet that bond of itself, did not divest the legal title of <em>D. Wilson </em>to the land ; nor ever entitle the purchaser to demand the transfer of the legal title, until the whole of the purchase money was paid or tendered, which had not been done in this case, for it is admitted, that a large part was still due at the time of the attachment. So that there remained in <em>Wilson </em>an interest in the land, which wras rightfully subject to his debts and rightfully attached. And so great was his interest therein, that a court of Chancery would, (on his application, and on a failure of the purchaser to comply with his payments in conformity with the terms of the contract of conveyance, and the decree of the court,) have cancelled all the interest of the purchaser in it, and placed the possession back into the hands of <em>Wilson. </em>To transfer then, this interest of <em>Wilson </em>in the land legally, even to the purchaser under the contract, it would have been necessary for him to execute a deed, and have it recorded in all respects conformably to the laws of <em>Maryland. </em>To transfer his interest therefore, to any other persons, it would be equally necessary that the deed of conveyance should comply with all the forms required by our law \u2014 a conformity with these laws has not been observed in this case. The due registration of a deed affecting lands, has been made essential to its very validity by our acts of assembly, for they declare, that otherwise it shall not pass any estate therein, &amp;c. Acts of assembly, 1715, ch. 47, sec. 8 \u2014 1766, ch. <em>14, </em>sec. 1 \u2014 1807, ch. 154, sec. 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-5\">If then <em>David Wilson </em>had any interest in the land attached, it clearly has not passed from him by reason of the said deed, and that he had an interest is above shown. And not only had he an interest but that interest still exists as is further shown by the fact, that to perfect the title of the purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>( <em>George </em>Ford) it is still necessary that he should derive it by deed from <em>D. Wilson </em>himself, or if dead from his heirs at law. If then <em>David Wilson </em>had an interest in the land, and that interest was not legally transferred by him at the time of suing out the attachment, the attachment was rightfully laid on the land, and is entitled to be satisfied (so far as that interest is sufficient for the purpose) out of the land. For the reasons already stated it cannot be contended, that the contract of sale converted the interest of <em>Wilson </em>into a mere personal debt. But if it did, then the deed cannot be con' strued as effecting an assignment of this debt, because it has not conferred (as already shown) on the assignees any power to fulfil the assignor\u2019s covenants with the purchaser, by conveying the land on payment, nor of course any power to-coerce payment against the consent of' the purchaser, who would have a right to demand the perfection of this title when required to pay the money. Besides if it be a debt, then as to it, and the other debts which are attached a train of reasoning similar to that already pursued may be applied. The law throws about the transfer of personal property, certain guards to protect innocent men from fraud and imposition, which have not been observed in this case. Where the actual possession of that species of property does not accompany the act of sale or transfer, there it is made necessary to execute a deed in writing, to be recorded within a limited time. The act of Assembly requires this form to be observed in regard to the transfer of all personal property, without distinction or exception. It is no quibble to insist, that a debt is equally within, the purview of the statute, for although a debt be of no tangible form, that it may be delivered, yet the- evidence of that debt is of such a nature as will admit of its specific delivery. And if the reason of the law be as stated, to prevent fraud and imposition, then the necessity of requiring the delivery of the note, bond or other-evidence of the debt at the time of transfer, or of executing and recording a deed of its transfer, is as great as if the subject of transfer was a horse, or cattle. The possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>note or bond in the hands of the party to whom it was originally given and due, would surely justify the debtor in paying it to such party, notwithstanding the existence of a transfer unknown to the debtor. Now in the present case, there was no transfer of these debts, either by a specific delivery of the bond, &amp;c. or by any deed executed and recorded in conformity with our laws, and no evidence that the transfer set up was known to the attaching creditor or to the debtor. It would operate as a serious evil to the community, if such secret and informal transfers of debts or other personal property were permitted or tolerated by law, because as soon as a creditor should commence any proceeding, to apply to himself the debts due to his debtor, either residing here or elsewhere, although he could shew that at the time of instituting the suit the evidence of the debt was held by his debtor himself, it would be competent for the debtor to defeat the suit, by the production of a distinct paper transferring his interest in the claim, secretly executed and antedated. Nor can it be said, that no such risk exists or can be apprehended inasmuch, as the execution of the deed on the day mentioned is proved by the corresponding date of the acknowledgments, for an acknowledgment in another <em>State, </em>not duly authenticated, is no evidence under our laws to establish a fact that it contains or alleges. So far I have argued this case on the hypothesis, that the deed embraced the lands and debts attached in this <em>State. </em>But it is a matter of great doubt whether such was ever the intention of the grantor or assignor. The recital of the deed set forth, that the lands of which <em>D. Wilson, </em>is seized, and of course the lands which were intended to be conveyed, are afterwards particularly described. The deed then proceeds to describe with great accuracy, and particularly all the lands of the grantor in the <em>State of Delaware, </em>and at the end of the description thereof are added these words, and \u201calso all other real estate of which the said <em>David Wilson, </em>may be seized or possessed of, or in any manner entitled to.\u201d No mention is made of any of the lands designed to be conveyed as lying elsewhere than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>in <em>Delaware. </em>This fact taken in connection with the circumstance, that the whole execution and disposition of the deed were made in conformity with the laws of Delaware, merely, and without any regard to the demands of the acts of Assembly of <em>Maryland, </em>in relation to the subject, goes very far to create the presumption, if not to establish the conclusion, that it never entered into the mind or meaning of the grantor, that, he was disposing of <em>his </em>property in <em>Maryland. </em>There is no particular description of the lands in. <em>Maryland, </em>and no reference to them, unless included in the general words above quoted. But even if the deed do by its phraseology take in the lands in <em>Maryland, </em>still it is denied that inasmuch as it has been executed in <em>Delaware, </em>for the purpose of vesting in trustees, property for the benefit of creditors, without the assent of the creditor in this case, it can be regarded as valid and operative here to defeat this attachment. To give it such effect, would be opposed by every consideration of sound policy. It will be seen by reference to the said deed, that all the trustees or grantees belong to, and reside in <em>Newcastle county, </em>in the <em>State of Delaware, </em>and consequently beyond the reach of any process from the courts of <em>Maryland. </em>If they should refuse to execute the trust, or in executing should abuse it, what remedy would exist in this <em>State </em>against them? No discovery or execution of the trust could be enforced by our courts, and even supposing, that a special action at law could be maintained on such a deed when executed here, no action either at law or in equity, could under the circumstances,of this case be sustained in <em>Maryland. </em>The creditors not being in possession of the deed, nor the deed so authenticated as to make a copy of it evidence in our courts, nor any person or fund against whom, or which, process could be directed and served. The deed then, so far as it purports to transfer property in trust here, for the benefit of creditors cannot be construed to have that effect, because there is no mode known to the law, by which in this case, a creditor can be secured in the enjoyment and application of the debtor\u2019s property in this <em>State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>towards the liquidation and payment of his debt. There is no redress in- <em>Maryland </em>for him, nor can the courts of <em>Delaware </em>afford- him relief, because their jurisdiction cannot be extended- to property and funds here. He is-therefore without remedy; unless he can avail himself of the laws relating to attachments as has been done in- this ease. These positions- are sustained too, by the analogies of the-law. It has been repeatedly decided, that a commission of bankruptcy in <em>England, </em>and a delivery of property into the hands of the assignee for the benefit of creditors, do not secure the debtor\u2019s effects in this country, but they remain liable to attachment by creditors. <em>Kirby, </em>313. <em>Taylor and others vs. Geary and others, </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>353. <em>Milne vs. Morton, </em>5 <em>Cranch, </em>289, 302. See also, <em>Douglass, R. </em>170. So in the case of <em>Ingraham, vs. Geyer, </em>13 <em>Mass. </em>146, an assignment by an insolvent debtor in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>for certain <em>creditors, </em>was held under its circumstances to be void, as against a creditor in <em>Massachusetts, </em>and it was there stated by the court, that a creditor who had actually siezed the debt by attachment before it was paid over to the assignee, would be protected in his lien. So in this <em>State, </em>the same principle has been decided, as in the case in Kirby, <em>Wallace et al, vs. Patterson et al, </em>2 <em>Har, and McHenry, </em>463, which is a case precisely analogous to the present case, except that the transfer was made under a commission of bankruptcy. In that case it is stated, in the argument for which <em>Coke\u2019s B. L. </em>370, is cited, that any creditor in <em>England, </em>might either prove his debt under the commission; or if the bankrupt has property beyond sea, might attach his debt in the- foreign country. I can conceive no reason why an assignment under a commission of bankruptcy elsewhere, should not operate to transfer property here, which does not with equal force apply to such cases as the present, where a deed is executed according to the laws of one <em>State, </em>and claiming to affect property lying in another, whose laws in relation to the execution of such deed have been wholly overlooked, and where neither the production of the deed, the appearance of the parties, nor the execution of the trust it creates, can be coerced-</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Page, for the appellees, contended :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-5\">That the deed of trust was obligatory upon the appellant, notwithstanding the absence of his consent, so far as to prevent him from proceeding against the property by attachment, in the mode attempted in this case, the same property being a part of the property conveyed as aforesaid to the trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-6\">For the purpose of maintaining the foregoing proposition, the appellee\u2019s counsel refers to the case of <em>Marbury and </em>Brooks, 7 <em>Wheaton, </em>556. And the case of the <em>Bank of Maryland, </em>6 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>205, and again at June term, 1835, in which this court% understood to have declared the law to <em>be settled, </em>upon this subject.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b499-7\">Stephen, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A1es\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The question to be decided in this case, arises upon a case stated, and must be determined according to the construction and legal efficacy of the deed referred to, by the litigating parties. By that deed, <em>Wilson </em>the absent debtor, contemplated a transfer of all his property of every description, to certain trustees therein mentioned, for the benefit of all his creditors. That such a deed is available in this <em>State, </em>as being founded upon a good and valuable consideration, has been solemnly settled by a very recent adjudication of this court, in the case of the <em>State of Maryland vs. the Bank of Maryland, </em>6 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>205. In that case the Chief Justice in delivering the opinion of the court, expresses himself in the following emphatic terms; <em>\u201c </em>it has been more than once decided by this court, that a debtor in failing circumstances, may prefer one creditor to another, by a transfer of his property made in good faith, and if according to circumstances, one creditor may be preferred to another, it would be difficult to imagine an objection to the validity of a transfer by a debtor, of his whole estate to trustees, for the equal benefit of all his creditors. Equality is equity, and when a debtor makes a transfer of his property, for the fair purpose of equal distribution among his creditors, he does an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>honest act, and discharges a moral duty, which none can reasonably complain of, and to which, objection can seldom be made, except by such as may seek to secure their own claims at the expense of the other <em>creditors; </em>\u201d so in <em>4th Johns. C. Rep. </em>529, <em>Chancellor </em>Kent, maintaining the same doctrine, says ; <em>\u201c </em>it is settled by a series of cases referred to, in <em>Hendricks vs. </em>Robinson, 2 <em>John. C. Rep. </em>307, 308, and to which may be added the case of <em>Pickstock vs. Lyster, </em>3 <em>Maul and Selw. </em>371, <em>and Brown vs. Minturn, 2 Gallison. </em>557, that an insolvent debtor may at any time, before his property becomes bound by any lien, assign it over to trustees for the benefit of all his creditors, by an act made <em>bona fide. </em>The assignment is to be referred to an act of duty, attached to his character of debtor to make the fund available, Tor the whole body of the creditors.\u201d In the case last cited, it was held, that the assignment was good against a subsequent attachment, if the creditors had assented to the assignment prior to the attachment, and the inclination of the learned judge seemed to be in favour of the validity of the assignment, even without such intervening assent, and which I apprehend is not indispensable. If the assignment was directly to the creditors, their assent would be necessary to give validity in law to the deed. But if the assignment as in this case, be to trustees for their use, the legal estate passes and vests in the trustees, and Chancery will compel the execution of the trust, for the benefit of the creditors, though they be not at the time assenting, and parties to the conveyance. The case of <em>Marbury and Brooks, </em>reported in <em>7th Wheaton, </em>556, is also an authority to shew, that the assent of the creditors is not necessary to legalize, and give efficacy to the assignment. This court speaking of that case in 6 <em>Gill and Johns. </em>219, say, <em>Marbury vs. Brooks, </em>and <em>Brooks vs. Marbury, </em>was a case of attachment, sued out by <em>Brooks </em>a creditor, against the lands, tenements, <em>goods, </em>chattels and credits of <em>Fitzhugh </em>an absconding debtor, and laid in the hands of <em>Marbury, </em>who claimed and held the property under a deed of assignment to him by <em>Fitzhugh, </em>of all his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>estate, executed before the attachment was issued, for the particular benefit of certain preferred creditors, several banks in the <em>District of Columbia; </em>and the question was, whether the deed so given to Marbury, was valid and effectual to pass the property from <em>Fitzhugh </em>the debtor, to <em>Marbury </em>the trustee, who was not a creditor of <em>Fitzhugh ; </em>and it was held that it was, and that it vested, <em>ab initio, </em>the legal estate in the trustee, although the banks for whose particular benefit it was made, had not expressed their assent to it, and were in fact, ignorant of its execution at the time it was given. It is true, the deed of <em>Wilson </em>to his trustee, did not operate to transfer his real estate in Maryland, it not being executed, acknowledged, and recorded according to our laws ; but the case stated, upon which the judgment of the court below was rendered, shews that the land upon which the attachment was laid in this case, had been previously sold by Wilson, to a certain <em>George Ford, </em>that he was in the possession of it, that <em>Wilson </em>had given him a bond, to convey the legal title on the payment of the purchase money, that a part had been paid, and the balance which was due, was payable in virtue of the assignment, not to <em>Wilson, </em>but to his trustees, for the benefit of his creditors. Under these circumstances, <em>Wilson </em>had no interest in the land attached, except the dry legal title, which he held in trust for <em>Ford, </em>or his legal representatives, and which he was bound to convey to them, so soon as the balance of the purchase money should be paid to his trustees, for the benefit of his creditors. Such an interest not being a beneficial one, we do not think a fit subject matter for the operation of an attachment, and that the opinion of the court below, was in that respect correct. We think that the judgment of the court below was also correct, so far as the same relates to the operation of the assignment upon the <em>choses in action, </em>attached in this case. Such assignment operated to transfer them to the trustee, at least in equity, and left as in the case of the land, nothing but a dry legal title in the assignor, which being scarcely any thing more than a mere <em>scintilla juris, </em>was not the subject of an attachment, 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Cranch, </em>300, <em>1st Atkins, </em>162. Upon the whole, we think the judgment of the court below was correct, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
