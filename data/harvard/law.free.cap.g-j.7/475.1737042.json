The plaintiff declared upon the bond of <em>Thomas Coward, </em>(with <em>Daniel and </em>Edward, as his sureties) dated 23d March, 1830, in the penalty of $10,000, conditioned to perform the office of administrator of <em>Thomas Coward, </em>late of said county, deceased. The defendants pleaded general performance by <em>Thomas Coward.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-4\">The plaintiffs replied, that the said <em>Thomas, </em>as administrator, &amp;c. did not make a true and perfect inventory of all, &amp;c. together with a list of the debts, sperate and desperate of, &amp;c. which came, <em>See. </em>and the same so made, did not exhibit to the Registry of the Orphans\u2019 Court of, &amp;c. within the time prescribed by law, and the same goods and chattels, &amp;c. and other goods and chattels, &amp;c. of, &amp;c. which did come to the hands, &amp;c. did not well and truly administer according to law, to wit, &amp;c. That the next of kin, and only representatives of the said deceased, were two children, that is, &amp;c. the said <em>Thomas Coward, </em>and <em>Nancy, </em>wife of <em>Thomas Worrel, </em>at whose request, &amp;c. That the residue of the personal estate of, &amp;c. in the hands, &amp;c. of the said <em>Thomas, </em>(the just debts and funeral charges of the said captain <em>Thomas Cotoard, </em>together with all legal costs and charges of administration being first deducted,) amounted on the 23d March, 1831, at, &amp;c. unto the sum of $10,500; the sum of $500, part thereof, payable in negroes ; the sum of $2,000, part thereof, payable in horses, cattle, sheep, &amp;c. furniture, farming utensils, wheat, &amp;c; the sum of $3,000, part thereof, in bills, bonds, and notes, and a few accounts due to the deceased in his life time, from the following persons, &amp;c; and the sum of $5,000, residue of the said sum of $10,500, payable in current money; and the said <em>State </em>avers, that the part or share of the said <em>Thomas Worrel </em>and <em>Nancy </em>his wife, of the aforesaid $10,500, then and there, amounted to the sum of $5,250, the said sum payable as before mentioned ; and the replication then concluded with the usual request, and refusal of payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-5\"><em>Rejoinder </em>\u2014 This plea after setting forth a debt due on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>bill, obligatory from the deceased intestate, to <em>Thomas Coward </em>his administrator, and which the latter averred, he had assigned in writing to one <em>Hamilton Graham, </em>the principal and interest of which remaining due, and unpaid on the 23d March, 1831, amounted to $4,590 88, then proceeded to deny the matter of the replication, and further set forth, that he, the said <em>Thomas Coioard, </em>had fully administered all the goods, &amp;c. except <em>the </em>sum of $4,358 98, not sufficient to pay said bill obligatory of <em>the </em>deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-5\">The plaintiff sur-rejoined, that the bill obligatory, was not the deed of <em>Thomas Coward </em>the deceased; denied the residue of the rejoinder, and tendered an issue to the country, in which the defendants joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-6\">The jury found that the bill obligatory, was not the bond of the deceased intestate, and assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $2,696 69, whereupon the defendant, moved in arrest of judgment, and assigned the following reasons:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-7\">1. Because at the time of the impetration of the writ, the said <em>Thomas Worrel </em>and wife, had no cause of action against the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-8\">2. Because the bond on which this action is founded, is dated on the 23d March, 1830, and the original writ issued forth on the 28th April, 1831.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-9\">3. Because no suit can by law, be instituted or prosecuted on any administration, or testamentary bond, by any legatee, representative, or distributee, until fifteen months after the date of letters testamentary, or of administration; and this suit was instituted before the expiration of fifteen months from the date of the letters of administration, all of which appears from the pleadings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-10\">4. <em>For </em>other manifest errors in the proceedings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b485-11\">But the county court, (Hoppek, and Eccleston, A.

This is announced to be when the debts are paid; and we have seen the debts are to be paid within thirteen months. But it is said, the executor has fifteen months to settle his final account, and therefore it is urged the bond is not forfeited until the lapse of fifteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">It was proper, a time should be limited for rendering a final account, that all interested in the estate might see the particulars of its adjustment; and that the executor should close his trust with the tribunal before whom the law had directed him to account. But this cannot control his prior responsibility to the distributees, more than it could to the creditors. Even if it appear by the first account of the executor, that all the debts are paid, by sub ch. 10, sec. 10, it is made his duty to distribute among the representatives. Such first account might be passed before the lapse of fifteen months, and in such a case the responsibility would be clear, and just as certain as that which would arise in relation to the creditors, if he failed to distribute among them within thirteen months. Can the withholding the passage of such final account exempt him from responsibility until the lapse of fifteen months ? we think not. We think his duty is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>and well defined by a just construction of sub ch. 8, sec. 15, and sub ch. 11, sec, 1, to make distribution among the representatives whenever the debts are paid. This is to be accomplished within thirteen months. And here the suit was after the lapse of that time. Besides the pleadings in this case set up no debt due, except one which the verdict declares has no existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
