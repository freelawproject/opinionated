Hall </em>and others, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>seeking to charge with the vendors lien, certain lands which <em>Lewis, </em>one of the appellants, had before that time sold to <em>Hall. </em>The bill alleged, that <em>Lewis, </em>in the year 1818, was in possession of a tract of land in <em>Washington </em>county, which he had previously purchased of one <em>Stull </em>and wife, and that without receiving from them a conveyance, he sold the same to <em>Hall, </em>taking his negotiable promissory notes for a part of the purchase money, without collateral, or any other security, That <em>Stull </em>and wife, then at his request, conveyed the land to <em>Hall, </em>who subsequently conveyed to a trustee for the payment of certain of his creditors, among whom was the government of the <em>United States, </em>whose claim grew out of monies received by <em>Hall, </em>as collector of the direct tax for the years 1816,1817, and 1818. That the promissory notes, so taken by <em>Lewis </em>from <em>Hall, </em>were afterwards assigned to the other complainant <em>Schn\u00e9bly, </em>by a special endorsement, and without recourse in any event to the assignor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">By a supplemental bill hied inl831, the complainants alleged, that the <em>United States, </em>instead of coming in under the trust deed, issued a treasury warrant against <em>Hall </em>on the 2d of January 1827, under which his lands, (including the land in question) were seized and sold to an agent of the government, by whom the same were afterwards, in 1831, sold to <em>Richard Ragan, </em>and <em>William D. Macgill, </em>two of the appellees, with full knowledge that the complainants were then, by their original bill in chancery, seeking to charge said land with the payment of the aforesaid promissory notes, the amount of which, with interest, the vendees were permitted to retain in their hands, to abide the event of the suit. They further alleged, that at the time the aforesaid treasury warrant issued, and when the land was purchased <em>by </em>the government agent, the officers of the government had notice of complainants claim, and of the facts upon which, it is founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">The answer of the defendants, <em>Ragan </em>and <em>Macgill, </em>(the other answers are immaterial) relies upon their title derived from the <em>United States, </em>and insists, that the notes in question are not liens on the land, nor were intended by the parties so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>to be. They do not admit that they were given on account of the purchase money; but this was fully established by the proof taken under the commission, as was also the allegation of notice of the complainants claim as charged in the bill; and that a portion of the purchase money was retained by the defendants, to meet such claim, if it should be sustained by the courts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">At September term 1833, the cause was argued before <em>Bland </em>Chancellor, who dismissed the bill with costs, upon the ground, that the plaintiffs have no lien whatever which can be sustained, or in any way made available, against the title of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">\u25a0From this decree, the complainants appealed to the Court of Appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b130-7\">The cause was argued before Stephen, Dorsey, and Chambers, Judges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b130-8\">Price and Anderson for the appellants, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-9\">1.

They are therefore only entitled to the benefit of the lien given by the acts of Congress, which is subordinate to prior incumbrances, among whom must be ranked the vendor for his purchase money, and those clothed with his rights. The lien given by the acts is not specific, but general, as in case of a judgment, and is subject to equities.

The notes in this case, were given by <em>Hall to Lewis, to </em>secure the. payment of the purchase money of the land sold by him to <em>Hall. Lewis </em>was closed only with the equitable title, and whether he was entitled to the benefit of the lien for his purchase money (the complete equitable title being in him, he having paid for the said land) is a question not free from difficulty. In <em>1th Wheaton </em>46, it appears that the right to such a lien was considered doubtful by the <em>Supreme Court of the United </em>States; at least, a difference of opinion appears to have prevailed among the members of that court upon the question. But we do not deem it necessary to decide the right to such a lien in this case ; because, whether it exists or not, we do not think the appellant entitled to the benefit of it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>In the case referred to in 7th <em>Wheaton, C. J. Marshall </em>says, e\u00a3 It is contended for the defendants, that as the legal title to the estate was never in <em>Baily, </em>he never had a lien upon it for the purchase money. Upon this point some difference of opinion exists in the court, and we pass it over without positively deciding it.\u201d A vendor parting with the legal title, still retains his lien, as a security for the payment of the purchase money, and the vendee holds the land as trustee of the vendor. <em>Prima facie, </em>the equitable lien exists, and it lies upon the purchaser to shev/ a waiver of it. <em>Carson vs. Green, </em>1 <em>J. C. R. </em>308. So, on the other band, if the purchaser of an estate, prematurely pays the purchase money, before the estate is conveyed to him, the money will be considered as a lien on the estate in the hands of the vendor, for the vendee, or in case of his death for his personal representatives. 2 <em>Mad. Ch. </em>104 \u2014 5. In 1 <em>Ohio Reports </em>318, we find a decision upon the question involved in this case; and the court there decided that the lien does not exist in favor of the assignee. They say, it is an equity between the vendor and vendee, which the notes cannot, effect, but which exists in the same character, whether a note be given or not. This equity arises to the vendor for his own safety, but it cannot be transferred to another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">We are not, however, prepared to go to the full extent of this decision, i^the court meant to say, that the assignee could not obtain the benefit of this lien by express contract. In 1 <em>Paige Ch. R. </em>502, the chancellor seems to hold a different doctrine, and intimates his opinion to be, that although the lien does not pass by implication, or construction, still that it may pass by express agreement. But we do not intend, nor do we deem it necessary to go further, than to decide, that under the particular circumstances of this case, the assignee of the notes, is not entitled to the benefit of the vendor\u2019s lien, if such lien exists. We think, that when the notes were assigned by <em>Lewis </em>to <em>Schnebly, </em>with an express stipulation, that he was in no event to be responsible for the payment of them, the effect and operation of the agreement produced an. extinguishment of the vendor\u2019s lien, because so far as he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>concerned, it amounted to a payment and satisfaction of his claim. The lien was intended to secure the payment of the purchase money to the vendor; and the assignment of the notes without responsibility for their ultimate payment, it is to be presumed, was equally as beneficial to him, as if he had received the amount of them in money. In the case from <em>New York </em>before referred to, the chancellor, in speaking of the rights of the assignee of a <em>chose in action, </em>given for the payment of the purchase money of land sold, holds the following language. \u201c The claim of the complainant for a specific lien on the premises, upon the ground that his judgment was obtained on a note given for a part of the purchase money, cannot be sustained. At the time he bought the note of <em>Kingsbury, </em>(who was the vendor) the latter unquestionably had such a lien; but it. is not pretended, there was any agreement that such a lien should be transferred to the complainant. If <em>Kingsbury </em>could be considered as still retaining any such claim, after the transfer of the note, it must be on account of his liability as endorser thereof. But there is no evidence, or even allegation, that any steps were taken to charge him as endorser. In a recent case, where the vendor had negotiated the note, but was obliged to take it up himself when it fell due, <em>Ld. Eldon, </em>sustained the claim of the original vendor to a lien on the land, <em>Ex parte Loaring, 2d Roses cases </em>791. But I am not aware of any case, where the assignee of the note, or other security has been permitted to sustain such a claim, on an implied agreement to assign the lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We therefore think, that, as by the terms of the assignment, the vendor was released from all responsibility for the payment of the notes, his specific lien on the land for the purchase money was extinguished, and cannot be available for his assignee. It is true, the benefit of the vendor\u2019s lien, has been extended to a legatee, where, upon the death of the purchaser, without payment of the purchase money, the vendor has resorted to the personal assets for the satisfaction of his claim, and has thereby exhausted the fund out of which the legacy was to be paid. But this has been done upon the principle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>of substitution, and is also founded upon the common, and familiar doctrine of the court, that where one party has a right of resorting to two funds, and another only a right of resorting to one, for the payment of his claim, the exercise of the right of election, by him who has it in his power to resort to another fund, shall not operate to the disappointment, or prejudice of him, who has only a right of resorting to one. And moreover, the authorities are conflicting even as to such a right of a legatee, though the weight of authority seems to be in favor of <em>the </em>right. 1 <em>Rop. on Leg. </em>634, 635. We are therefore of opinion, that the decree of the Chancellor is correct, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
