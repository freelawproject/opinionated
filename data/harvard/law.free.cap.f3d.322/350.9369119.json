Rivera concedes that this claim is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and he seeks only to preserve the issue for Supreme Court review in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1202, 121 S.Ct. 1214, 149 L.Ed.2d 126 (2001). This argument provides no basis for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">Rivera contends that his sentence must be vacated because his prior conviction did not warrant a 16-level increase in the offense level. The offense level for illegal reentry after deportation is increased by 16 levels \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States after'\u2014a conviction for a felony that is ... a crime of violence!)]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (Nov.2001). Rivera\u2019s conviction for attempted indecency with a minor by exposure constitutes a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Zavala-Sustaita, </em>214 F.3d 601, 607 (5th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Rayo-Valdez, </em>302 F.3d 314, 316 (5th Cir.2002). Rivera argues, however, that the attempted-indecency conviction was not a \u201cfelony\u201d crime of violence because, according to his plea agreement and Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.44, he was subject to no more than one year in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-17\">The applicable guideline comment defines \u201cfelony\u201d as \u201cany federal, state, or local offense punishable by imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>for a term exceeding one year.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.l(B)(iv)). Attempted indecency with a minor by exposure is a Texas state jail felony punishable by a maximum sentence of two years. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 21.11, 15.01(d), 12.04(4) &amp; (5), 12.35(a). However, Rivera\u2019s plea bargain provided that his case would be handled in accordance with Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.44, which allows punishment as if the crime were a Class A misdemeanor with a one-year maximum sentence, and Rivera was sentenced to 90 days. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 12.44(a), 12.21(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">We may look to Texas law to provide guidance as to the proper characterization of the prior crime. <em>See United States v. Vasquez-Balandran, </em>76 F.3d 648, 650 (5th Cir.1996). Texas case law indicates that a crime remains a felony even if punished as a misdemeanor under \u00a7 12.44. <em>See Fite v. State, </em>60 S.W.3d 314, 320 (Tex.Ct.App.2001) (conviction, not actual punishment under \u00a7 12.44, determines nature of offense; enhancement barred on other grounds); <em>Arriola v. State, </em>49 S.W.3d 374, 375-76 (Tex.Ct.App.2000) (prior felony conviction treated as felony for enhancement purposes even though punished as misdemeanor under \u00a7 12.44(a)); <em>Hadnot v. State, </em>851 S.W.2d 378, 379 (Tex.Ct.App.1993) (same). The plain language of \u00a7 12.44 indicates that the crime remains \u201cthe felony committed\u201d even though the defendant may be punished as if for a misdemeanor. Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.44(a). In addition, Rivera\u2019s plea-bargain states, with emphasis, that, although Rivera was being punished as for a misdemeanor, the judgment \u201cshall constitute <em>A FINAL FELONY CONVICTION FOR DEFENDANTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In our recent case, <em>United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697 (5th Cir.2002), the defendant\u2019s offense level was increased where he had previously pleaded guilty to Texas state-jail felony of marijuana possession. <em>Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d at 699. At the time of the prior offense, Texas law provided a maximum sentence of two years but mandated that first-offenders should get suspended sentences and probation. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). We rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the mandatory suspension and probation removed his prior crime from a definition of \u201cfelony\u201d punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. <em>Id. </em>at 703-OS. We concluded that the prior conviction was a \u201cfelony\u201d because Texas law characterized it as such and because the statute \u201cprovided for a maximum term of imprisonment of two years,\u201d regardless of the fact that the defendant was not sentenced to more than one year. <em>Id. </em>at 705-06; <em>see also United States v. Arellano-Torres, </em>303 F.3d 1173, 1178-79 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cited in Caicedo-Cuero. </em>The mandatory suspension of sentence in <em>Caicedo-Cuero </em>did not change the fact that, absent circumstances peculiar to the particular defendant, the crime was \u201cpunishable\u201d by more than a year\u2019s imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">We apply the essential reasoning of <em>Caicedo-Cuero </em>to the present case and hold that a crime is a \u201cfelony\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l) and commentary note l(B)(iv) if, by the terms of the criminal statute, a conviction exposes a defendant to a sentence of imprisonment of more than one year, regardless whether the defendant is sentenced under Texas Penal Code \u00a7 12.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
