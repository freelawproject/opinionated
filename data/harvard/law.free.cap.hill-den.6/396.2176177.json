These papers are prepared <em>for the trial, </em>and may be used on that occasion whenever it shall occur. They are as well adapted to a subsequent circuit as to the one for which the cause is first noticed. The costs to be paid on putting off a trial are for services which must be repeated, and for which the plaintiff might not be paid at all if they were left to abide the event.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> The charges for brief and copy pleadings are not of this description, and must be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Motion granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"><em> </em>See <em>Morrell </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>(5 <em>Hill, </em>553.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
