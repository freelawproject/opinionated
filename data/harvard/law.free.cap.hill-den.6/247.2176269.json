The plea was not guilty. The defendant succeeded in the suit, and recovered costs against the plaintiffs, which were taxed at $256,51. Judgment was perfected on the 20th of October, 1841. In February following, the plaintiff Graham became a petitioner under the bankrupt law, and in June, 1842, he obtained a certificate of discharge from all his debts provable under the act and owing by him at the time of presenting the petition. The defendant afterwards issued a <em>ca. sa. </em>on the judgment to the sheriff of New-York, where Graham resides.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-11\"><em>S.

But so far as relates to the execution now in the sheriff\u2019s hands, or any other execution to be issued on the judgment, Graham has no means of availing himself of the discharge except by motion.
