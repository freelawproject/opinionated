Lester sued Redmond in the marine court of the city of New-York, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>in April, 1842, and declared on a judgment which he had recovered against the defendant in that court for $66,72 damages and costs bn the 25th of January, 1832. The defence was the statute of limitations, (2 <em>M. S. </em>295, \u00a7 18;) hut the court overruled the defence and gave judgment for the plaintiff, on the ground that the marine court was a court of record, and that therefore the statute did not apply to the case. On certiorari by the defendant, the superior court reversed the judgment, and the plaintiff brought error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-5\"><em>Brady &amp; </em>Maurice, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE-\">cited 2 <em>R.

The case of <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>(13 <em>Wend. </em>51,) might very well have been decided the other way. Neither the able argument contained in the return, nor the authorities cited at the bar, have satisfied us that in giving the original judgment the court acted as -a court of record. The statute of limitations was consequently a good answer to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
