Suits against natural persons are now commenced either by <em>capias </em>or by declaration; (2 <em>R. S. </em>347, \u00a7 1;) and they are not well begun for the purpose of saving the statute until the process or declaration has been actually served, or the <em>capias </em>has been issued to the sheriff of the proper county, in good faith, and with the intent to have it served. <em>(Id. </em>299, \u00a7 38.) The pleas do not tender an issue upon a material point. It may well be that the defendant did not promise at any time within six years next before <em>the exhibiting of the bill, </em>although the suit was <em>commenced </em>within five years after the promise. There has been no bill, and never will be. I think the pleas are bad. They certainly are so, unless we construe the words \u201c exhibiting of the bill,\u201d as equivalent to <em>\u201c </em>commencement of the suit.\u201d And then the defendant should not have complained of the replications for using the language which he should have used. In either view of the question, the demurrers are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">\u25a0When the process was not served within the six years, and the plaintiff relies on prior process and continuances to save the statute, there, if he makes an issue' on the <em>exhibiting of the </em>bill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>he must reply specially, or he will fail on the trial.\" <em>(Richmond </em>v. <em>Little, 2 Hill, </em>134.) But where the issue is, as it should be, on the <em>commencement of the suit </em>within six years after the promise, the replication may be as general as the plea, and the whole matter may be given in evidence on the trial. <em>(Bank of Orange County </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>14 <em>Wend. </em>83.) The plaintiff is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
