The bill was in these words :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-11\">Detroit, Nov. 15th, 1838.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-12\">Sixty days after date, pay to the order of Daniel Green, Esq. fifteen hundred dollars, at the Phoenix Bank in the city of New-York, value reed., which place to ac.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-13\">Your Ob.

On both trials it appeared, among other things, that after the bill was accepted by Griswold and endorsed by the payee to Woodruff, he sent it to the defendants below for collection; and that their notary did not present it for payment on the <em>seventeenth </em>of January, 1839, the third day of grace, but did so on the fourteenth, im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>mediately forwarding notice of non-payment. The first trial resulted in a verdict for the defendants below, which was afterwards set aside, and a new trial ordered. For the opinion of the supreme court delivered on that occasion, see 25 <em>Wend. </em>674, 5. On the second trial, which took place before Dayton, C. Judge, at the Niagara circuit in March, 1842, the defendants below offered to prove, among other things, that, by the usage and custom of banks, bankers and merchants, in the city of New-York, the instrument in question was a mere bank check, payable without days of grace, and that consequently there had been no negligence on the part of the notary. The. circuit judge excluded the evidence, and a verdict was rendered in favor of Woodruff. The defendants below afterwards moved for a new trial on a bill.of exceptions, but the supreme court denied the motion, for the reasons given in their former opinion, and Woodruff obtained judgment; whereupon error was brought to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-5\"><em>B. W. </em>Bonney, for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7q\">said the evidence offered at the trial was improperly excluded. The object of it was to enable the jury to ascertain whether the parties to this instrument contracted in reference to the general law, or intended that the local usage should be the rule for determining the nature and extent of their obligation. If they contracted in reference to the usage, the instrument ought to be treated precisely as though it contained an express stipulation that days of grace should not be allowed; and this being a matter which the parties had a right to regulate by stipulation, the supreme court \u00e9rred in holding that the usage was invalid. <em>(Chitty On Bills, </em>407, <em>Am. ed. of </em>1839; <em>Byles On Bills, </em>121; <em>Story On Bills, </em>385, \u00a7 333; <em>Cowen &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes to Phill.

A local usage <em>in the city </em>of New-Yorlc ought not to be allowed to control the settled and acknowledged law of the state in respect to commercial paper; for the rule defining the rights and obligations of the parties to such paper, should be known, uniform and stable. <em>(Edic </em>v. <em>The East India Company, 2 Burr. 1216, 1222, 1224; Frith </em>v. <em>Barker, 2 Johns.
