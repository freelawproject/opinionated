On the trial in the court below the jury found a special verdict, which, after setting forth Payn\u2019s title derived from Woodworth, stated the following facts, among others, viz: That hi October, 1806, Payn executed a perpetual lease to John Burhans of three acres, parcel of the farm in question, reserving an annual rent, and a right of distress and re-entry in case of non-payment. That in April, 1812, and in April, 1815, Payn executed two other and similar leases, the one to William Bissell, and the other to Braddum Yale, each conveying one acre and a half, parcel of the said farm. That Burhans, Bissell and Yale took immediate possession under their respective leases, and have continued to occupy the lands thereby conveyed ever since. That on the 28th day of February, 1823, a judgment was recovered in the supreme court by Joshua Bloore against Payn, which was subsequently revived by <em>scire facias. </em>That on the 14th of December, 1824, Payn sold and conveyed the whole of the farm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>in question to William Hull, excepting the lots which he had <em>before </em>leased to Burhans, Bissel and Yale. That on the 26th of April, 1826, Philip Barringer obtained a judgment in the supreme court against Payn, which was subsequently assigned to one Rosekrans. That on the 9th day of August, 1828, another judgment was recovered against Payn, by Huntington, one of the plaintiffs below. That writs <em>of fieri facias </em>were afterwards issued upon the judgments in favor of Bloore and Huntington, on which the sheriff advertised and sold all Payn\u2019s right and title to the one hundred and twenty-five acres in dispute. That the sale took place on the 24th of October, 1829, several \u25a0 miles from the premises, and Huntington became the purchaser. That within the time allowed for creditors to redeem, Rosekrans, the assignee of the judgment in favor of Barringer, paid to the sheriff the amount bid by Huntington, with the interest, claiming to be entitled to a deed. And that the sheriff executed a deed to Huiitington, and afterwards executed a deed to Rosekrans. The special verdict further stated that, \u201cin and by the said deed from Payn to Hull, the said lands and tenements set forth and described in the said advertisement of sale, in the certificate thereof, and in the deeds executed by the said sheriff to Huntington and Rosekrans, and every part and parcel thereof, were sold and conveyed to the said Hull, his heirs and assigns forever, excepting so much thereof as was conveyed as aforesaid by the said Payn to the said Burhans, Bissell and Yale.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">Huntington contended in the court below that he was entitled to judgment upon the facts found by the special verdict, on the ground that he was the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and that Rosekrans had no right to redeem. The court below, however, rendered judgment in favor of the defendant, for the reasons stated in their opinion given upon a motion made by Rosekrans to compel the sheriff to execute a deed. <em>(See The Peo</em>ple, <em>ex rel. </em>Rosekrans, v. Haskins, <em>Sheriff fyc., 7 Wend. </em>463 <em>et seq.) </em>Huntington and Payn thereupon brought error to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>N. Hill Jun. &amp; D. </em>Cady, for the plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHo\">relied mainly upon the following points : 1. The judgment in favor of Barringer was not a lien on any portion of the premises sold by the sheriff, and therefore Rosekrans had no right to redeem. It will be said, however, that the judgment was a lien on Payn\u2019s interest in the lands leased in fee to Burhans, Bissell and Yale. This we deny. The creation of these leases passed the <em>whole estate </em>immediately to the tenants, who took subject to the condition that they would pay the stipulated rent; and so long as they performed this condition, and no actual entry was made, their estate remained precisely the same as,if no qualification had been annexed to it. <em>(Shep. Touch. </em>153; 4 <em>Kent's Comm,. </em>122 <em>to </em>125; <em>Springstein </em>v. <em>Schermerhorn, </em>12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>357, 361, 2.) The clause of distress and re-entry provides for a mere <em>possible right </em>in the lessor; but the possibility is too remote to be deemed a present, subsisting estate or interest in the land. <em>(See </em>1 <em>Hill. Abr. </em>322, 409, 410; <em>Springstein </em>v. <em>Schermerhorn, </em>12 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>361, 2.) The provision for distress, moreover, is a mere license to enter for the purpose of seizing <em>goods </em>by way of satisfying the rent, and reserves no right in the <em>land. </em>(2 <em>Leigh's N. P. </em>785; 1 <em>Hill. Abr. </em>156, \u00a7 54; <em>Gilb. On Dist. </em>1, 2; 2 <em>Chitty's Bl. Com. </em>6, <em>note </em>(8).)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-5\">2. Even if a rent-charge reserved upon a lease in fee may he sold on execution, still it is not the subject of redemption. The supreme court concede that Rosekrans\u2019 claim to occupy the place of a redeeming creditor depends upon 2 <em>R. S. </em>372, \u00a7 53; and in order to bring him within that provision, it must appear that his judgment was a lien \u00f3n a <em>specific portion of a lot, tract or parcel sold. </em>These terms are to be construed strictly as against a creditor claiming to redeem, <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>20 <em>Wend. </em>555,) and are properly applicable only to <em>land. </em>They do not embrace a mere rent-char'ge, reserved upon a lease in fee. <em>(Shep. Touch. </em>80, 91.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b151-6\">3. Again, the special verdict does not show that Payn\u2019s interest in these rents was in fact <em>sold </em>by the sheriff; and this is conclusive against Rosekrans\u2019 claim to redeem. The sheriff\u2019s proceedings should be presumed regular, until the contrary ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>pears. But if he sold in one mass, and without any other discrimination than appears by the special verdict, not only all the lands which belonged to Payn when the Bloore judgment was docketed, but also the rents in question, the sale was palpably irregular, if not absolutely void. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Striker, </em>1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>284; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Rosevelt, </em>13 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>97, 102, 3; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Delancy, id. </em>537, 551, 2; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>18 <em>id. </em>355, 362; <em>Lindendoll </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>14 <em>id. </em>222 ; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Soper, id. </em>352; <em>Rowley </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>1 <em>Binn. Rep. </em>61.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-5\">4. But the sale took place under the act of <em>April 12th, </em>1820; <em>(Sess. Laws of </em>1820, <em>p. </em>167;) and Rosekrans acquired no right to redeem unless his judgment was a lien on the <em>whole </em>of the premises sold, which is not pretended. At all events, his right to redeem, if allowed, could only be co-extensive with his lien, and this would restrict him to the rents. <em>(Matter of Erwin </em>v. <em>Schriven, </em>19 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>379, 380; 3 <em>R. S. </em>728, <em>2d </em>ed.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-6\">\u2022 5. The revised statutes do indeed give the right to redeem, even where the creditor\u2019s lien extends only to a <em>portion </em>of the thing sold; (2 <em>R. S. </em>372, \u00a7 53;) but they are inapplicable to this case. By the sale to Huntington he acquired an <em>absolute right to </em>a deed as against all persons not entitled to redeem under the act then in force, of whom Rosekrans was one; and as the revised statutes were passed subsequently, they ought not to be allowed to operate retrospectively, so as to take away or impair this right. (2 <em>R. S. </em>779, \u00a7 5 ; <em>Dash </em>v. <em>Van Kleeck, </em>7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>477; <em>Terrington </em>v. <em>Hargreaves, </em>3 <em>Moore &amp; Payne, </em>137,143; 1 <em>Kent's Comm. </em>454, 5; <em>The Thames Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Lathrop, </em>7 <em>Conn. Rep. </em>550, 556, 7; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, id. </em>558, 563; <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Blackledge, 2 Cranch, </em>272; <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>4 <em>Burr. </em>2460, 2462; <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Meyer, 2 Ld. Ray. </em>1350, 1352; <em>Helmore </em>v. <em>Shuter, 2 Show. </em>17; <em>S. C. 2 Mod. </em>310, 1 <em>Vent. </em>330.) If the opposite construction, however, is to prevail, then we insist that the provision under which Rosekrans has been allowed to redeem is a law impairing the obligation of Huntington\u2019s contract, and is therefore void. <em>(Const, of U. S., Art. </em>1, \u00a7 10; 1 <em>Kent's Comm. </em>413 <em>to </em>423; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Biddle, </em>8 <em>Wheat. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>1 ; <em>Rowlett </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>4 <em>Miller\u2019s Lou. Rep. </em>94; <em>Bronson </em>v. <em>Kinzie, </em>1 <em>Howard, </em>311.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-5\">S. <em>Stevens, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZM\">reviewed the several positions taken by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, and stated and argued the following points: 1. That the revised statutes controlled the right of redeeming in this case, and not the act of 1820. <em>(The People, ex rel. Fleming, </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>6 <em>Wend. </em>526.) 2. That the Barringer judgment was a lien on the rent-charge reserved by Payn in the leases to B\u00fcrhans, Bis-sell and Yale. <em>(Liltingston\u2019s case, 7 Coke\u2019s Rep. </em>129; <em>The People </em>v. <em>Haskins, 7 Wend. </em>466, <em>7, and the cases there cited.) </em>3. That the rent-charge was a part of the real estate sold by the sheriff, and therefore Rosekrans was entitled to redeem the <em>whole. </em>(2 <em>R. S. </em>372, \u00a7 53.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b153-6\">Porter, Senator.</author>\n<p id=\"ARQ\">On the 24th of October, 1829, Hunting-ion became the purchaser, at sheriff\u2019s sale, of all the right and title of Payn to the lands in dispute, and the question arising in the case is, Avhether Rosekrans was entitled to redeem them. It Avas conceded on the argument by the counsel for the defendant, that Rosekrans was not a redeeming creditor in respect to the lands in controversy, Avithin the act of April 12th, 1820, inasmuch as his judgment was not a lien on the <em>whole </em>of the property sold, but only upon the rent-charge mentioned in the special verdict; and unless he Avas entitled to redeem in virtue of some subsequent enactment, the present defence must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The statute under which Rosekrans claimed to redeem, went into operation on the 1st of January, 1830, and the act of 1820 was then repealed. (2 <em>R. S. </em>372, \u00a7 53: <em>id. </em>779.) But by the 5th section of the repealing act it was provided as follows: \u201c The repeal of any statutory provision by this act, shall not affect any act done, or <em>right accrued 6cc., </em>previous <em>to the </em>time when such repeal shall take effect; but every such act, <em>right &amp;c., </em>shall remain as valid and effectual as if the provision so repealed had remained in force.\u201d (2 <em>R. S. </em>779.) An important inquiry then arises, viz. whether any <em>right </em>accrued to Hunting<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ton by his purchase in October, 1829, which was in conflict with the claim set up by Rosekrans <em>to </em>redeem under the subsequent act of January, 1830.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Before the law of 1820, a purchaser of lands at a sheriff\u2019s sale acquired an absolute right to a deed. The object of that law was to modify this right; and the first section accordingly directed that, instead of giving a deed, the sheriff should give the purchaser a certificate that he <em>would be entitled to a </em>deed, unless the land was redeemed as thereinafter provided. The second section gave the judgment debtor a right to redeem within one year from the sale, by paying the purchase money, and ten per cent, interest. By the third section it was provided that, in case the judgment debtor did not redeem, any creditor of his, having a judgment which was a lien on the land, might redeem within fifteen months from the sale, by paying the purchase money and ten per cent.- interest. It was then declared that, whenever a creditor did so redeem, he should <em>\u201c </em>be entitled to and acquire <em>all the rights </em>of the original purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">It is contended that, under the provisions of this law, the purchaser acquired no such right as was protected by the saving clause in the repealing act of 1830 ; and that the latter was designed to protect absolute rights only. I cannot assent to this position. The first section of the act of 1820, and the sheriff\u2019s certificate given in accordance with it, assured the purchaser that <em>he would be entitled to a </em>deed, <em>unless the land was redeemed as thei'einafter provided. </em>Instead of a deed to be given on the sale, as was formerly required, the law authorized the sheriff to give a written promise of a deed, subject only to a privilege of redeeming accorded to the judgment debtor and certain of his creditors. This right, though not entirely absolute, was still valuable, and worth the attention of the legislature; and I think they designed to protect it by the saving clause before alluded to.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">To show that the law of 1830, if allowed to <em>control </em>the present question, would interfere with the substantial and even absolute rights of Huntington under his purchase, I might advert to the provision in the previous law which required a redeeming creditor to pay <em>ten </em>per cent, interest on the amount for which the premises were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>sold, before he was entitled to .a deed. Rosekrans claims to have redeemed under an act which allows the creditor to demand a deed by paying the purchase money with <em>seven </em>per cent, interest. (2 <em>It. iS. </em>371, 2, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">At the time the sale in question took place, Rosekrans was not a redeeming creditor; and as and against him, therefore, Huntington\u2019s right to a deed was absolute and unqualified. The repealing act of 1830 provided, that such right should remain as valid and effectual as if the law under which it accrued had continued in force. I am therefore of opinion that Rosekrans had not a right to redeem, and that he acquired no title under the sheriff\u2019s deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The supreme court seem to have supposed, when this case was before them, that it came within the decision made in <em>The People, ex rel. Fleming, </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>(6 <em>Wend. </em>526;) but I apprehend they were mistaken. The only point decided there was, that the formal proceedings to redeem must be conducted according to the act of 1830, if instituted after that time, though the sale took place under the act of 1820\u2014a very different question, it is believed, from the one now presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">There is a further objection to Rosekrans\u2019 claim to redeem, which seems to me to be fatal. The special verdict finds that, by the deed from Payn to Hull, Payn conveyed all the lands and tenements that were subsequently sold to Huntington by the sheriff, \u201c excepting so much thereof as was conveyed &amp;c. to Burhans, Bissell and Yale,\u201d under their respective leases. If the fact be so, there was nothing on which the Barringer judgment could be a lien. The counsel for the defendant said, on the argument, that this was the result of a mistake in drawing up the special verdict, and rather seemed to concede that the finding took away the claim of Rosekrans. But we can have no other guide than the error book.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The questions whether the Barringer judgment was a lien upon the interest which Payn had in the lands leased to Burhans, Bissell and Yale, or the rents arising therefrom, supposing these not to have been conveyed to Hull, and whether the rents constitute a <em>specific portion ofi the lot, tract, or parcel </em>sold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>within the meaning of the law under which Rosekrans claimed to redeem, are interesting, and if I could command the time, I would examine them; but as the opinion I have already expressed goes to the whole case, it becomes unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">I think the judgment of the supreme court is erroneous, and shall therefore vote to reverse it.</p>\n<author id=\"b156-6\">Root, Senator.</author>\n<p id=\"AC4\">The supreme court decided in this case that the Barringer judgment was a lien upon the rent-charge on the small lots leased by Payn to Burhans, Bissell and Yale; that this rent-charge was a part of the real estate sold to Huntington by the sheriff; and that Rosekrans, the assignee of the Barringer judgment, had a right to redeem the <em>whole, </em>by the revised statutes, in virtue of his lien upon a <em>portion. </em>It might be an important question whether the contingent interest of Payn arising upon these leases, can be regarded as an estate in lands, capable of being <em>described, </em>advertised and sold on execution, in the manner pointed out by the statute; (1 <em>JR. L. 505, </em>\u00a7 13; 1 <em>JR. </em>/S'. 369, 370, \u00a7\u00a7 35, 42;) and also whether it can be said to constitute a \u201c specific portion of a <em>lot, tract or </em>parcel\u201d &amp;c., within the meaning of the act under which Rosekrans claims to have redeemed. (1 <em>R. S. </em>372, \u00a7 53.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The rent-charge, however, was not specifically described by the sheriff in his advertisement, nor does it appear that he designated it at the time of the sale, or professed to sell it. Of course it did not pass to Huntington, the purchaser.' The general description given, viz. all the <em>right and title Sec., </em>would not notify the purchaser that the <em>rent-charge </em>was to be sold, unless the land <em>on </em>which it was charged was also defined and described. It is fit that a person\u2019s estate should be made to go as far as may be to the extinguishment of his debts; but it is also fit that the purchaser should be well assured at the time of the sale; how far the right of redemption may be extended. He is advised of its extent only by the description given of the thing sold, and the liens thereupon which may appear of record. If liens unknown and undescribed can be made to fasten upon the property sold, purchasers could hardly be found who would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>bid any thing like an equivalent for it. Besides, the law assures the purchaser that he shall have a deed for the property sold, unless, within the time limited, he shall be refunded the purchase money, with a specified amount of interest, by a class of persons who are mentioned. His certificate of sale gives him a vested right to an inchoate interest in the land, subject to be defeated upon certain conditions. Those conditions should be known, or susceptible of being known, at the time of the sale. The interposition of new ones is an invasion of the purchaser\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">There is another, and I think a fatal objection to the decision of the supreme court. Huntington was entitled to a deed, unless redemption was made pursuant to the act of 1820. There is no pretence that it was so made.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">I am of opinion that the supreme court erred in giving judgment for the defendant, and shall therefore vote for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">On the question being put, <em>\u201c </em>Shall this judgment be reversed ?\u201d all the members of the court present who heard the argument, except Senators Bockee and Deyo, voted for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
