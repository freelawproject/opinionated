Judge, at the Columbia circuit, in March, 1843. On the trial, the district attorney produced the minutes of the court of general sessions of Columbia county for September term, 1841, in which was an entry as follows: \u201c The People <em>v. </em>Ambrose F. Woolsey. Milton Niles, <em>Solomon </em>Rundle, &amp;c. [naming seventeen others,] are recognized in the sum of $100 each, conditioned for their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>appearance at the next court of general sessions of the peace to testify on the part of the people in the above cause.\u201d There were four indictments pending against Woolsey in the general sessions at the time this entry was made. The judge decided that the entry was not a sufficient recognizance, and ordered a nonsuit. A motion was now made for a new trial on a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-5\"><em>T.
