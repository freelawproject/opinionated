He read an affidavit that Jackson expected on a second trial to present other questions than the one on which the judgment was reversed; and insisted that, as a <em>venire de novo </em>was awarded, there was no final judgment on which a writ of error would lie.

But I learn from the chancellor that this question was recently before the court of errors, where we had reversed the judgment of an inferior court and awarded a <em>venire de novo ; </em>and it was held that a writ of error would lie upon our judgment before the cause had been re-tried.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> If a writ of error will lie, it is matter of right; and it is of no consequence that Jackson thinks he can make a better case than the one on which he rested before, and on which he obtained the reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">Motion granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\"><em> </em>The case referred to is <em>Van Santvoord </em>v. <em>St. John, (ante </em>p. 157.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
