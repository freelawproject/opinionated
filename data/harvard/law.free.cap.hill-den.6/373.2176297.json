The annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>rent reserved by the lease was 18| bushels of wheat, four fat hens, and one day\u2019s service with carriage and horses. The defence did not go to the items of the plaintiff^ claim, but denied the defendant\u2019s liability altogether. A motion was made at the circuit, in behalf of the plaintiffs, for a reference, on an affidavit that the trial of the cause would \u201c require the examination of a long account, to wit,\u201d &amp;c., stating the ground of action as above. The circuit judge ordered a reference; and he made a like order in three similar cases between the same parties, two of which were for four years\u2019 rent, and the other for one year\u2019s rent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-5\"><em>R. W. </em>Peckham, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABX\">moved to vacate the orders of reference made by the circuit judge in the four suits. He cited <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Reab, </em>(6 <em>Wend. </em>503;) and <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Ins. Co. (25 Wend. </em>687.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-6\"><em>D.

If there had been payments in money or other things, and the question was whether any part or how much of the rent was in arrear, there might, perhaps, be a reference. But here the defendants claim nothing in the way of payment; but rest their defence on the ground that they were never liable for the rent which the plaintiffs claim. The cases do not come within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Although the circuit judge may order a reference with the like effect as if the order was made by this court, it is settled that we may review his decision, and revoke the order. (6 <em>Wend. </em>503; 25 <em>id. </em>687.) We could review the' decision if it had been made by ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Motions granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
