The facts were as follows: Calvin Hall, being on unfriendly terms with the defendant Leland, purchased a promissory note made by him and Clark, and immediately commenced this suit upon it, serving the declaration upon Leland only. When Hall went to the attorney\u2019s office to commence the suit, the attorneys were out, and he handed the note to John R. Timan, a clerk in the office, telling him to bring the suit in the name of some other person. The clerk commenced the suit in the name of his father, James Timan, who knew nothing about the matter. Leland went to the plaintiff, Timan, who said he had not authorized the suit, and did not desire to continue it; and within a day or two afterwards he gave Leland an absolute release from the demand. The plaintiff swore that he was in a state of alarm when he gave the release, fearing that some one had forged his name, or that his son, who was then out of town, had done something wrong; and that he was now willing the suit should proceed in his name. \u25a0 No consideration was paid by Leland for the release.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b237-9\">From the opposing papers it appeared that Leland had done nothing which could affect the validity of the release as between himself and the plaintiff; and that the latter well understood the release was intended to be a frill discharge of the demand and the suit upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>It was not directly stated in any of the papers used upon the motion that Leland knew who owned the note at the time he obtained the release; though enough appeared to authorize the inference that he did know.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-5\"><em>O. B. Matteson, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aui\">moved for an order that the release be delivered up to be cancelled, as being a fraud upon the rights of Hall. The court has power to make such an order. <em>(Chit. On Cont. </em>779, 780, <em>ed. of </em>1842.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-6\"><em>M. T. Reynolds, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax7\">There is no doubt that the court can make such an order in a case where the action is necessarily brought in the name of one man for the benefit of another; as in the case of a chose in action not negotiable. But here, Hall might have sued in his own name; and purchasing the note and bringing the action for vexation in the plaintiff\u2019s name, without his knowledge or consent, is a misdemeanor. (2 <em>R. S. </em>450, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-7\"><em>Matteson </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApY\">A suit may <em>be brought on </em>a promissory note in the name of one who has no interest, and it is not a defence that the suit was commenced without the knowledge or consent of the nominal plaintiff. <em>(Gage </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>15 <em>Wend. </em>640.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b238-8\"><em>By the Court, </em>Bronson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APH\">It is now well settled that courts of law will take notice of and protect the rights of all persons beneficially interested in the demand, who necessarily sue in the name of another. Their rights cannot be defeated by any transactions between the defendant and the nominal plaintiff, after <em>the former </em>has notice <em>of the true state of </em>the case. Whether the rule applies where the owner might have sued in his own name, and yet sues in the name of another without his consent, need not be determined on the present occasion. In England, the most common mode of giving relief has been by an order of the court precluding the defendant from setting up a payment to or a release given by the nominal plaintiff; and sometimes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the release has been ordered to be delivered up to be cancelled. And pleas setting up such defences have been struck out on motion. The cases are collected in <em>Chit. On Cont. </em>744, 779, 780, <em>ed. of </em>1842. But with us, the course has been to leave such matters to be tried in the ordinary forms of law, instead of granting relief on motion. If the defendant pleads the release or other matter of defence, the plaintiff replies, setting up the assigmnent and notice, or giving such other answer to the plea as the nature of the case may require. If the defence is given in evidence on the trial without having been pleaded, the plaintiff gives his answering evidence, and the whole matter is passed upon by the jury. The following references will be sufficient to illustrate what has been said: <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, </em>(1 <em>Johns. Cas. </em>51;) <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Beecker, (id. </em>411;) <em>Littlefield </em>v. <em>Storey, </em>(3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>425;) <em>Van Vechten </em>v. <em>Graves, </em>(4 <em>id. </em>403;) <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Van Alen, </em>(12 <em>id. </em>343;) <em>Meghan </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>(9 <em>id. </em>64;) <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Coles, </em>(16 <em>id. </em>51;) <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Dorr, </em>(19 <em>id. </em>95;) <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Blodget, </em>(5 <em>Cowen, 202;) Wheeler </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>(9 <em>id. </em>34.) I think this much the better course than to decide such questions upon affidavits, where the testimony is often conflicting. If, from the nature of the case, the matter cannot be tried in the usual manner, then relief will be granted on motion. (Wardell v. <em>Eden, 2 Johns. Cas. </em>121; <em>id. </em>258; <em>Col. Cas. </em>137; 1 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>531 <em>note, S. C.) </em>Here, there is nothing in the way of trying the validity of the release at the circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
