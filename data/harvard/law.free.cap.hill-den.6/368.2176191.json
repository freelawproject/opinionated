Oh the second day of the circuit, the court was to open at half past ten o\u2019clock in the morning. About 20 minutes before that time, the attorneys for the plaintiffs left their office in the city for the purpose of attending the circuit; and, on the opening of the court at the appointed time, they proceeded and took the inquest, not having then heard of an affidavit of merits. On leaving their office they ptit up a written notice in a conspicuous place on' the outside of the door, stating that they had gone to the City Hall. Very soon afterwards, and before the inquest was taken, the agent of the defendants\u2019 attorneys entered the office, the door being unlocked, and finding no person there, served a copy of an affidavit of merits, the original having been properly filed, by leaving the same in a conspicuous place on the table in the office. The defendants\u2019 attorneys resided at Kingston, and sent the affidavit to their agent in the city to be filed and served.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b369-5\"><em>A.

The case cited at the bar went upon that principle. I see no reason why a more liberal rule should be adopted, where, as in this case, the motion to set aside the default is made on the sole ground of irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">There is a further reason why this motion should not be granted. Although as to most papers the mode of service was well enough, it was not sufficient under the circumstances of this case. I do not go upon the ground of any want of good faith on the part of the defendants\u2019 attorneys, or their. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>agent; for there is no reason to believe that any wrong was intended. But an affidavit to prevent an inquest sometimes may and at other times should be served in a different manner from what'is required in relation to other papers. At the circuit, if the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney is not present, it may be delivered to the counsel having the cause in charge. If not delivered at the circuit, it should be served in such a way that it will probably come to the knowledge of the attorney in season to enable him to communicate with the counsel before the inquest is taken. Any other rule might lead to great abuse. In this case, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had left their office for the purpose of attending the court, before the paper was served, and the inquest was taken without any knowledge of an affidavit of merits. The agent made a mistake in leaving the paper in the vacant office. Or, if he left it there, he should have sought the attorneys and informed them of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
