In June, 1842, the action against Halsey was tried, and the plaintiff' nonsuited. He took a bill of exceptions, and a stipulation was entered into in all the causes that if a new trial should be denied in the case of Halsey, then the defendants in each of the other suits might enter a rule for judgment as in case of nonsuit, and might perfect judgment, unless the plaintiff\" should bring a writ of error in the Halsey case within thirty days after judgment perfected therein; and if error was thus brought, then the other causes to \u201cstand as they now do\u201d until the decision of the Halsey case in error. The stipulation further provided that, if the judgment of this court in the Halsey case should be affirmed, then judgments as in case of nonsuit might be perfected in each of the other causes; but if this court should order a new trial in the Halsey case, or if a new trial should be denied, and the judgment should afterwards be reversed in error, then the other causes to \u201c stand for trial as they now do.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">At the May term, 1843, a new trial was denied in the Halsey case, and judgment for the defendant having been perfected, the plaintiff, within thirty days, brought a writ of error, which is . still pending.
