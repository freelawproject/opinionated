S. </em>312, \u00a7 57) was applicable to this case, though the conveyance in question was executed long before those statutes took effect.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">On error from the supreme court, where Stewart brought an action of ejectment against Hutchins, and was nonsuited at the trial. Afterwards, Stewart moved for a new trial on a bill of exceptions, but the motion was denied, and judgment rendered against him for costs. He then sued out the present error. For the facts of the case, together with the opinion of the supreme court, see 13 <em>Wend. </em>485, <em>et seq.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-8\"><em>J. Crary &amp; M. </em>Fairchild, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKO\">insisted, in addition to the points raised in the court below, (13 <em>Wend. </em>486,) that even if the conveyance under which the plaintiff claimed should be deemed a mortgage, yet as it was executed in 1818, the rights of the parties were to be ascertained by the laws then in force; and the statute subsequently passed\u2022 forbidding mortgagees to bring ejectment ,(2 <em>R. S. </em>312, \u00a7 57) had no application to the case. <em>(Dash </em>v. <em>Van Kleeck, </em>7 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>477.) In support of the point raised below that the conveyance was not a mortgage, they cited and commented on <em>Conway's ex'rs </em>v. Alexander, (7 <em>Cranch, </em>219,) and <em>The Lincoln and Kennebeck Bank </em>v. Drummond, (5 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>323.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-9\"><em>N.

To this point he</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>cited 1 <em>R. L. </em>373, \u00a7 3 ; 1 <em>R. iS. </em>756, \u00a7'3; <em>4 Kent\u2019s Comm. </em>141, 2, 145, <em>6, 4th ed.; Nugent </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>(1 <em>Metc. Rep. </em>117;) <em>Lanfair </em>v. <em>Lanfair, </em>(18 <em>Pick. </em>299, 304;) <em>Hogins </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>(15 <em>id. </em>259.) He further contended that the statute depriving mortgagees of the remedy by ejectment (2 <em>R. S. </em>312, \u00a7 57) was applicable as well to mortgages executed before as after its passage; for the mischief intended to be suppressed was the same ha both instances. (4 <em>Kent\u2019s Comm. </em>156, <em>note </em>(c), <em>4th ed.; </em>13 <em>Wend. </em>486, 7.) The nonsuit granted at the trial was therefore proper, and the judgment of the supreme court should be affirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b144-5\">Scott, senator,</author>\n<p id=\"A2S\">delivered an opinion concurring substantially with the view taken of the case by the supreme court.
