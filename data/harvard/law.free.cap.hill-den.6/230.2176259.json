The terms were complied with, and the defendant interposed a plea of tender, to which the plaintiff demurred. Eighteen days afterwards, the defendant served an amended plea by mail, which the plaintiff\u2019s attorney refused to receive, and returned it, assigning his reasons; and he subsequently entered the defendant\u2019s default. The amended plea was <em>non-assumpsit </em>as to all the promises in the declaration except the sum of $104,50, <em>concluding to the </em>country, and, as to that sum, tender before suit brought, <em>concluding with a verification. </em>Accompanying the plea was an affidavit by the defendant that \u201c he verily believes the plea to be true in substance and matter of fact.\u201d There was also an affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-9\"><em>S.

Hunt, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWU\">As one part of the plea concluded to the country, and another part with a verification, there should have been an affidavit of merits, as well as an affidavit of the truth of the plea. (22 <em>Wend. </em>644, <em>note.) </em>And besides, this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>was not a case where the defendant could amend of course, under the 23d rule.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b231-5\"><em>By the </em>Court, Bronson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">There was but one plea, though, for the purpose of covering the whole declaration, it consisted of two branches. I think it was sufficient to verify the truth of the plea without adding an affidavit of merits. The first rule of May, 1840, requires a more pointed affidavit where the plea calls for an answer, and so tends to delay, than where it concludes to the country. Here the main branch of the plea concludes with a verification, and the defendant has therefore sworn to its truth. The affidavit goes to the whole plea, and was a sufficient compliance with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">But I think the defendant had no right to amend as of course under the twenty-third rule. The case may come within the letter, but it is not within the spirit of the rule. That only applies to cases in the ordinary course of pleading. Here the defendant was allowed, as a special favor, to withdraw his plea after the cause was at issue and ready for trial, and to put in a new plea. And he was restricted to ten days for the purpose of avoiding any more delay than was absolutely necessary. By first pleading a defective plea, and then amending as a matter of course at any time within twenty days, the terms which the court imposed are in effect defeated. When the defendant gets leave to plead as a matter of favor, he must take care to plead right. If he finds it necessary to amend, he must ask leave of the court. But on the facts disclosed in the papers the defendant may be relieved on terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
