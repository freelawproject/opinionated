The plaintiffs obtained a verdict on the trial, and the defendants took a bill of exceptions, which has not yet been argued.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-8\"><em>E. A. Doolittle, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai5\">said this was not a suit against the St. Lawrence Bank, hut against Henry Van Rensselaer, by the description of president &amp;c. He produced the declaration\u2019, which was as follows : \u201c The Ogdensburgh Bank, plaintiffs in. this suit, by &amp;c., complain of Henry Van Rensselaer, president of the St. Lawrence Bank, a banking association organized under the act <em>foe.., defendants </em>in this suit, of a plea <em>foe., </em>for that whereas the said <em>defendants, </em>heretofore, to wit, on <em>foe., </em>at <em>foe., </em>were indebted to the said plaintiffs in the sum of $1000, for so much money lent and advanced, &amp;c.\u201d\u2014going on with the money counts, and alleging that the <em>defendants, </em>being indebted, promised to pay &amp;c. Breach, that the - <em>defendants </em>have not paid. Copies of several bills of the St. Lawrence Bank were given with the declaration by way of bill of particulars. It further appeared that at the trial exceptions were taken on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the ground that the action was against Yan Rensselaer as an individual, and that he was not personally liable for the notes on which the plaintiffs sought to recover.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b241-5\"><em>By the Court, </em>Bronson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcH\">This is an action against Henry Yan Rensselaer, and the words which follow his name\u2014president of the St. Lawrence Bank\u2014can only be regarded as a <em>descriptio persones. </em>The question was decided in <em>Delafield </em>v. v. <em>Kinney, </em>(24 <em>Wend. </em>345.) It was also decided at the last term on the argument of a cause where the declaration was framed in the same way against an executor. And it is decided by all the precedents in the books where one is sued in <em>autre droit. </em>If the plaintiffs wished to recover a debt due from the St. Lawrence Bank, the declaration begins well enough by naming Yan Rensselaer, and describing him as president. But the pleader should then have proceeded to allege, that <em>the St. Lawrence Bank </em>was indebted, and, being indebted, promised to pay. And the breach should be, that the <em>bank </em>had not paid. And when one of these corporations sues in the name of its president, the pleader should allege that the defendant was indebted to the bank\u2014not to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">It is said that the plaintiffs evidently intended to sue the St. Lawrence Bank. I do not doubt that the fact is so. But we are not interpreting a contract, and searching out the meaning of the parties from doubtful and equivocal words. This is a question of pleading, and'if we had an. affidavit that the pleader meant the bank, and not Yan Rensselaer, it would still be a declaration against the individual, and not against the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">As there is no pretence that Yan Rensselaer is insolvent, there is no foundation for the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
