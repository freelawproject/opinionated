The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) granted the defendant\u2019s motion to reargue its original motion for summary judgment and (2) determined that \u00a7 1 (f) of Public Acts 1993, No. 93-297 (P.A. 93-297), codified at General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 38a-336 (f), did not permit her to claim underinsured motorist benefits under her employer\u2019s insurance policy with the defendant. The second issue, which is dispositive, was decided by our Supreme Court in <em>Reliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American Casualty Co. of Reading, Pennsylvania, </em>238 Conn. 285, 679 A.2d 925 (1996), after oral argument in this case. In accordance with this decision, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The following allegations made by the plaintiff in her May 20, 1994 complaint are relevant to our resolution of this appeal. On October 16, 1992, the plaintiff was operating a motor vehicle owned by her employer, Willow Brook Shopper, Inc., when a vehicle operated by Donna Dumont collided with her car. The plaintiff suffered injuries and brought a claim for damages against Dumont. The plaintiff received compensation that exhausted the automobile liability coverage of Dumont\u2019s insurance, but did not fully compensate the plaintiff for her injuries. The defendant, Hartford Casualty Insurance Company, refused to pay the plaintiff underinsured motorist benefits pursuant to her employer\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>On March 20, 1994, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-284 (a) precluded the plaintiffs claim for underinsured motorist benefits. The plaintiff objected on the ground that by enacting P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (1), the legislature intended to allow persons injured in the course of their employment to seek underinsured motorist benefits under their employer\u2019s insurance policies. On April 19,1995, the trial court denied the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">On June 8, 1995, the defendant filed a motion to reargue its motion for summary judgment. The defendant argued that \u201cit appears that the trial court\u2019s attention was not directed to the fact that P.A. 93-297 brought about a substantive change in the law that could not be applied retroactively. Moreover, P.A. 93-297 affirmatively provided that the amendment to the statute was to apply to acts or omissions occurring on or after January 1, 1994.\u201d The plaintiff objected, arguing that pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 204B, a motion to reargue must be filed within twenty days of the issuance of the notice of a decision. The plaintiff further asserted that the court had not improperly denied the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">On June 26,1995, the trial court reversed itself, vacating its original order and granting the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court determined that P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (f), applied only to acts or omissions occurring on or after January 1, 1994.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The plaintiff claims that pursuant to P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (f), she may recover underinsured motorist benefits under her employer\u2019s insurance policy. She argues that the legislative history of the statute demonstrates that the act was intended to abrogate the harsh results of the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 31-284 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cAn employer shall not be hable to any action for damages on account of personal injury sustained by an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment . . . .\u201d In <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. Colman, 222 Conn. 769, 773, 610 A.2d 1257 (1992), our Supreme Court held that under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an \u201cemployer is insulated from bearing <em>any </em>costs arising out of workplace injuries in excess of those provided by worker\u2019s compensation.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) An employee \u201cwho can receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits is therefore barred from collecting under his employer\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d Id., 774; see also <em>Bouley </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>222 Conn. 744, 610 A.2d 1245 (1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Public Act 93-297, \u00a7 1 (f), enacted after <em>CNA Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Colman, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 769, provides: \u201cNotwithstanding subsection (a) of section 31-284, an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>of a named insured injured while occupying a covered motor vehicle in the course of employment shall be covered by such insured\u2019s otherwise applicable uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage.\u201d While P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 1 (f), clearly overrules <em>CNA Ins. Co., </em>the issue is whether the statutory amendment applies to the plaintiffs particular circumstances. P.A. 93-297, \u00a7 29, provides that \u201c[\u00a7] 1 . . . shall be applicable to acts or omissions occurring on or after January 1, 1994.\u201d Notwithstanding the specific language of \u00a7 29,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>however, our Supreme Court held in <em>Reliance Ins. Co J </em>that an examination of legislative history revealed that \u201cP.A. 93-297 was intended to be clarifying legislation and, as such, must be accepted as a declaration of the legislature\u2019s original intent pertaining to the interplay between the uninsured motorist provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 and the workers\u2019 compensation exclusivity provision of General Statutes \u00a7 31-284. . . . Consequently, we conclude that an employee is not barred from recovering uninsured motorist coverage benefits against his or her employer\u2019s insurer in regard to a motor vehicle accident that occurred prior to the effective date of P.A. 93-297.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Reliance Ins.
