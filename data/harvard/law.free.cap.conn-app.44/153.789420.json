The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) found the defendant in contempt of court, (2) exercised jurisdiction over the defendant\u2019s 401k plan, (3) excluded documentary evidence and refused to allow the defendant to call plaintiff\u2019s counsel as a witness, and (4) awarded counsel fees to the plaintiff. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">The defendant has failed to present either a written memorandum of decision or a transcribed copy of an oral decision, signed by the court, stating its decision on the issues in the case and, if there were factual findings, the factual basis for its decision. See Practice Book \u00a7 4059. The defendant, as appellant, has the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>responsibility to provide this court with an adequate record for review.

We have consistently stated that it is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review and we see no reason to depart from that rule. We, therefore, decline to review this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
