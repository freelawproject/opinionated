The plaintiffs are the owners of a parcel of land located in a subdivision known as Lakeview Acres in Fairfield. The entire subdivision consists of seventy-four lots subject to certain restrictions recorded in the land records in 1943 that prohibit the use of any lot for anything other than a single-family dwelling. The plaintiffs instituted this action seeking (1) a judgment settling title to their land, and (2) a declaratory judgment determining whether the restrictions on the subdivision apply to their land. The defendants are property owners in the subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">The plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly upheld the validity of the restrictions, in that, as a matter of law, it incorrectly interpreted the effect of the restrictive covenant with regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>We are persuaded by our examination of the record, briefs and arguments of the parties that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. In a thoughtful, detailed and comprehensive memorandum of decision, the trial court, <em>Thim, J., </em>analyzed the law in a manner consistent with our statutes and case precedents. <em>Cappello </em>v. <em>Ciresi, </em>44 Conn. Sup. 451, 691 A.2d 42 (1996). Because that memorandum addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt the trial court\u2019s well reasoned decision as a statement of the applicable law on the issues. It would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion contained therein. See <em>Daw\u2019s Critical Care Registry, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Labor, </em>225 Conn. 99, 101-102, 622 A.2d 518 (1993); <em>Bank of Boston Connecticut </em>v. <em>Brewster, </em>32 Conn. App. 215, 217, 628 A.2d 990 (1993); <em>Fromer </em>v. <em>Boyer-Napert Partnership, </em>26 Conn. App. 185, 186-87, 599 A.2d 398 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
