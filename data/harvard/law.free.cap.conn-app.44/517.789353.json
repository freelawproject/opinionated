On appeal, the defendants claim that the trial court improperly (1) ordered a reduction in the assessed fair market value of the condominium units, (2) admitted into evidence the plaintiffs expert witness\u2019 appraisal, and (3) found the subject parcel overvalued. On cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) found that the tax on the subject parcel was not manifestly excessive, (2) failed to find that the assessor failed to apportion the value of the land among the respective condominium units, and (3) found that the board and the assessor did not predetermine the assessed land value. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in part and reverse the judgment in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The trial court found the following facts. The plaintiff, Tyler\u2019s Cove Association, Inc., consists of thirty-eight owners of individual cottages situated on approximately 16.5 acres of land located in the town of Middlebury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to 1987, the individual unit owners did not own the land on which each unit was situated, but leased it on a year to year basis from the owner. In 1987, the unit owners formed a corporation, Tyler\u2019s Cove, Inc., and purchased the 16.5 acre parcel of land for $1,926 million. In 1989, Tyler\u2019s Cove, Inc., conveyed the 16.5 acres to Tyler\u2019s Cove Association, Inc., the plaintiff in this matter. Each unit owner now owns one thirty-eighth of the common elements, which includes the land. Following the recording of the condominium declaration in 1989, the town, through the board of tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>review, assessed each unit with a land assessment of approximately $18,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Sometime prior to October 1, 1992, the defendant Edmund Corapinski, the tax assessor of the town of Middlebury, undertook the process of revaluation of all real property in the town. The defendant town of Middlebury hired a revaluation company, Lesher-Glendinning Municipal Services, Inc., whose president is John J. Valente, to assist with the revaluation. Corapinski and Valente used the comparable sales method approach to establish the fair market value of all real estate in Middlebury, including the thirty-eight condominium units at Tyler\u2019s Cove. In valuing the land, they used the residual value approach method, which involved subtracting the cost of the building from the fair market value; the residual value was the \u201ccondominium interest value,\u201d which included the land value. During the Tyler\u2019s Cove revaluation, Corapinski and Valente used field cards to gather information and to determine the fair market value. The field cards included a section for the building value and also a section for the land value, which Corapinski claimed was used solely for informational purposes. The resulting tax assessment figures were placed on the grand list as the final step in the revaluation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The total fair market value on the October 1, 1992 grand list, of the thirty-eight Tyler\u2019s Cove units and the 16.5 acres on which they are located, was $4,545,600. The plaintiff appealed the October 1, 1992 grand list to the board of tax review and the board reduced the value of each unit at Tyler\u2019s Cove by $5000. For the subsequent grand lists of October 1, 1993 and 1994, the town assessed taxes on Tyler\u2019s Cove units in accordance with the board\u2019s modified value. The plaintiff appealed from both grand lists, but the board refused to make any further reductions. The October 1, 1993 and October 1, 1994 grand lists are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The plaintiff filed an appeal in the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-117a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 12-119<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>decision of the board refusing to reduce the assessment of its property in 1993. The plaintiff amended its complaint to include the October 1, 1994 grand list. In its complaint, the plaintiff alleged in counts two and four, for 1993 and 1994 respectively, brought pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a, that it was aggrieved by the decision of the board and in counts one and three, for 1993 and 1994 respectively, brought pursuant to \u00a7 12-119, that the assessment was manifestly excessive. In the demand for relief, the plaintiff sought a reduction of the assessed values.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">The trial court found for the plaintiff on counts two and four, the \u00a7 12-117a counts, and for the defendants on counts one and three, the \u00a7 12-119 counts. This appeal and cross appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The defendants first claim that the trial court improperly ordered a reduction in the fair market value of the Tyler\u2019s Cove units. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">In an appeal from a board of tax review pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a, \u201c[t]he function of the trial court is to determine the true and actual value of the plaintiffs property. <em>Dickau </em>v. <em>Glastonbury, </em>156 Conn. 437, 441, 444, 242 A.2d 777 [1968]; <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>146 Conn. 669, 673, 154 A.2d 608 [1959], . . . <em>Executive Square Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>11 Conn. App. 566, 570, 528 A.2d 409 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Heather Lyn Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Griswold, </em>38 Conn. App. 158, 164, 659 A.2d 740 (1995). The law contemplates, however, \u201cthat a wide discretion is to be accorded to assessors, and unless their action is discriminatory or so unreasonable that property is substantially overvalued and thus injustice and illegality result, their opinion and judgment should control in the determination of value for taxation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>purposes.\u201d <em>Stamford Apartments Co. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>203 Conn. 586, 589, 525 A.2d 1327 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In a tax appeal, the trial court hears the case de novo and makes an independent valuation of the subject property. Id., 588. \u201c \u2018The conclusions reached by the trial court must stand unless they are legally or logically inconsistent with the facts found or unless they involve the application of some erroneous rule of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reynaud </em>v. <em>Winchester, </em>35 Conn. App. 269, 274, 644 A.2d 976 (1994), quoting <em>Newbury Commons Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>226 Conn. 92, 100, 626 A.2d 1292 (1993) .</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">\u201cIn an appeal . . . from a board of tax review, the court performs a double function. The court must first determine whether the plaintiff has met his burden of establishing that he is, in fact, aggrieved by the action of the board. Only when the court finds that the action of the board will result in the payment of an unjust and, therefore, illegal tax, can the court proceed to exercise its broad discretionary power to grant such relief as is appropriate.\u201d <em>Gorin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>178 Conn. 606, 608, 424 A.2d 282 (1979); <em>Grossomanides </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>33 Conn. App. 511, 515, 636 A.2d 867 (1994) .</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Some additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this issue on appeal. As a result of the revaluation conducted during 1991-1992, the total value of the assessment for all thirty-eight condominiums and amenities relative thereto as valued by the town on October 1, 1993, was $4,545,600.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Corapinski and Valente used regular residential field cards, which allow for 200 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>entries or items, as opposed to standard condominium field cards, which provide for only thirty entries or items, because the Tyler Cove units were more like individual houses or cottages than condominiums. On the field cards there are, inter alia, values entered for fair market value of the unit and the amenities, assessed value (70 percent of fair market value), building value and land value. The plaintiffs main disagreement with the revaluation is that a substantial portion of each condominium\u2019s value is listed under the entry of \u201cland value.\u201d Of the thirty-eight units, the thirty lakefront units had a \u201cland\u201d value of $85,000 for each such unit, and the eight units that did not border the lake had a \u201cland\u201d value of $65,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff' contends that the town has valued the land on which the condominiums are located at a fair market value of $3,070,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The plaintiffs expert witness, Robert Nocera, conducted an appraisal of only the land on which the condominiums are situated. He testified that he could not find land in Middlebury that was approved for condominiums so he used comparable land approved for condominiums in other towns in the state. He further testified that he used land sales other than condominiums in Middlebury. Nocera concluded that the fair market value of the land was $660,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The plaintiff argues that the defendants failed to assess their real property as prescribed by General Statutes \u00a7 47-79 (a) of the Condominium Act of 1976.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 47-79 (a) provides in part that \u201c[n] either the building, the property nor any of the common areas and the facilities shall be deemed to be a parcel, but each unit shall be deemed to have an undivided interest therein and assessments against any such unit shall include such proportionate undivided interest. . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Corapinski and Valente testified that the \u201cland value\u201d entry on the field card represented the \u201camenity\u201d or \u201ccondominium interest value,\u201d which included the value of the land. They both contend, however, that the \u201cland value\u201d figure, calculated by using the residual value method, was solely for informational purposes. Valente further testified that he was never told to put a value on any of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court reviewed the testimony of Corapinski, Valente, and Nocera. The trial court noted that, as a result of the town\u2019s revaluation, the assessment of the plaintiffs units increased \u201ctremendously.\u201d The trial court also noted, however, that, a review of eight recent sales, five between 1989 and 1992 and three after 1992, confirmed that the fair market value estimated by the town on each property was less than the sales price. The trial court found that the plaintiff had sustained its burden of proof as to counts two and four of the amended complaint, which sought reduced assessments pursuant to \u00a7 12-117a. Accordingly, the trial court ordered that the fair market value of each condominium unit be reduced by $10,000 on the October 1,1993 and October 1, 1994 grand lists.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Although the trial court concluded that the plaintiff had met its burden of proof in establishing that it was aggrieved by the action of the board, the trial court stated no basis for that conclusion. Corapinski and Valente testified that they calculated the fair market value of the units and amenities by using the comparable sales method and that they did not separately calculate the value of the land. Nocera\u2019s appraisal was the only evidence before the trial court of the value of the land. Without making any findings with regard to the value of the land, the trial court ordered that the fair market value of each unit be reduced by $10,000. This conclusion is logically inconsistent with the facts found. The trial court did not find that the assessor had overval<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ued the property. The trial court did find, however, after reviewing eight contemporaneous sales, that the fair market value estimated by the town on each property was less than the sales price. The plaintiff failed to overcome this persuasive evidence. As a result, the trial court improperly exercised its broad discretionary power in granting the reduction in the units\u2019 fair market value. See <em>Gorin\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>supra, 178 Conn. 608. Therefore, the judgment must be reversed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In its cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly found that the tax on the subject parcel was not manifestly excessive under General Statutes \u00a7 12-119.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u201cThe principles that govern a complaint filed pursuant to \u00a7 12-119 are not in dispute. In contrast to \u00a7 12-117a [see footnote 2], which allows a taxpayer to challenge the assessor\u2019s valuation of his property, \u00a7 12-119 allows a taxpayer to bring a claim that the tax was imposed by a town that had no authority to tax the subject property, or that the assessment was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of [the real] property .... Our case law makes clear that a claim that an assessment is \u2018excessive\u2019 is not enough to support an action under this statute. Instead, \u00a7 12-119 requires an allegation that something more than mere valuation is at issue. <em>Second Stone Ridge Cooperative Corp. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>220 Conn. 335, 339-40, 597 A.2d 326 (1991); accord <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Oxford, </em>101 Conn. 383, 392, 126 A. 1 (1924).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pauker </em>v. <em>Roig, </em>232 Conn. 335, 339, 654 A.2d 1233 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The first category in \u00a7 12-119 \u201cembraces situations where a tax has been laid on a property not taxable in the municipality where it is situated.\u201d <em>E. Ingraham Co. </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>146 Conn. 403, 408, 151 A.2d 700, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 929, 80 S. Ct. 367, 4 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1959). This category is not applicable to the facts of this case and, thus, will not be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\u201cThe second category consists of claims that assessments are (a) manifestly excessive and (b) . . . could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of the property. <em>. . . E. Ingraham Co. </em>v. <em>Bristol, </em>[supra, 146 Conn. 409]. Cases in this category must contain allegations beyond the mere claim that the assessor overvalued the property. [The] plaintiff . . . must satisfy the trier that [a] far more exacting test has been met: either there was misfeasance or nonfeasance by the taxing authorities, or the assessment was arbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>trary or so excessive or discriminatoiy as in itself to show a disregard of duty on their part. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>131 Conn. 273, 275, 38 A.2d 795 (1944). Only if the plaintiff is able to meet this exacting test by establishing that the action of the assessors would result in illegality can the plaintiff prevail in an action under \u00a7 12-119. The focus of \u00a7 12-119 is whether the assessment is illegal. <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>130 Conn. 699, 703, 37 A.2d 237 (1944) .... The statute applies only to an assessment that establishes a disregard of duty by the assessors. <em>L. G. DeFelice &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wethersfield, </em>167 Conn. 509, 513, 356 A.2d 144 (1975).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Second Stone Ridge Cooperative Corp. </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>supra, 220 Conn. 341-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The plaintiff filed an amended complaint, pursuant to \u00a7 12-119, alleging that the defendants had grossly overvalued the taxpayers\u2019 property. The record fails to reveal any claim by the plaintiff beyond the mere allegation that the assessor overvalued the land on which the Tyler\u2019s Cove condominiums are situated. Further, the plaintiff\u2019s claims of misfeasance by the assessor; see part III; are unpersuasive, and no claims of nonfeasance exist. Finally, the plaintiffs claim that the assessment was arbitrary is unsupported by the record. The trial court properly concluded that the plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof under \u00a7 12-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The plaintiffs final claims on cross appeal are that the trial court improperly failed to find that the assessor failed to apportion the value of the land among the condominium units and found that the board and the assessor did not predetermine the assessed land value. We address these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">We apply the following standard of review to both claims. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 156, 609 A.2d 654 (1992); see also <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 220, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Components, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wdowiak, </em>239 Conn. 259, 263, 684 A.2d 693 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly failed to find that the assessor failed to apportion the value of the land among the condominium units. The plaintiff argues that the defendants were required to apportion the value of the real property and common areas as an undivided interest among the individual condominium owners. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-79. As proof, the plaintiff notes the different values on the field cards for lakefront and nonlakefront units, as indicated under \u201cland value\u201d on the assessor\u2019s field cards. The defendants argue that the \u201cland value\u201d calculation was solely for informational purposes and, thus, they did not violate \u00a7 47-79. Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The plaintiff finally claims that the trial court improperly found that the board and the assessor did not predetermine the assessed land value. The plaintiff argues that the board assigned values to all property in Mid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>dlebury prior to the revaluation and that such action was outside the scope of its statutory powers. See General Statutes \u00a7 12-111. The defendants contend that the plaintiff failed to establish any collusion between the assessor and the board. Our review of the record does not leave us with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. See <em>United Components, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wdowiak, </em>supra, 239 Conn. 263. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings were supported by the evidence and the pleadings and, thus, were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">On the defendants\u2019 appeal, the judgment ordering the reduction of the fair market value of the Tyler\u2019s Cove property is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\"> As athreshold matter, we note that the plaintiff, Tyler\u2019s Cove Association, Inc., has standing to bring an appeal on behalf of its unit owners.

Such application may be made within one year from the date as of which the property was last evaluated for purposes of taxation and shall be served and returned in the same manner as is required in the case of a summons in a civil action, and the pendency of such application shall not suspend action upon the tax against the applicant. In all such actions, the Superior Court shall have power to grant such relief upon such terms and in such manner and form as to justice and equity appertains, and costs may be taxed at the discretion of the court. If such assessment is reduced by said court, the applicant shall be reimbursed by the town or city for any overpayment of taxes in accordance with the judgment of said court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> The plaintiff alleged in counts one and three of its complaint, for the October 1, 1993 and October 1, 1994 grand lists respectively, violations of General Statutes \u00a7 12-119.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
