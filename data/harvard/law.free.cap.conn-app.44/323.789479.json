The defendants claim that the trial court improperly (1) found the defendant Gustaf T. Appelberg personally liable, and (2) failed to grant a motion for mistrial and revocation of the reference to the attorney referee. We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">The genesis of this case is the alleged breach of an agreement by which the plaintiffs sold a sign business to the defendants. A promissory note represented a portion of the purchase price and was a significant part of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The case was referred to an attorney referee who heard evidence and filed his report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>with the court recommending judgment against the defendants. Both sides filed motions to correct the report. The attorney referee\u2019s rulings on these motions could materially change the outcome of the case. While the motions to correct were pending, the attorney referee contacted the defendants\u2019 counsel and asked permission to call a plaintiffs\u2019 witness to obtain a copy of a promissory note. The defendants\u2019 counsel denied permission, but the attorney referee nevertheless contacted the plaintiffs\u2019 witness ex parte and obtained a copy of the promissory note from him. It is not known what happened to the original of this note.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The attorney referee thereafter ruled on the motions to correct, and made findings relying on the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">As a result of the attorney referee\u2019s ex parte communications with the plaintiffs\u2019 witness, the defendants moved for a mistrial and revocation of the reference to the attorney referee. The motion was heard by <em>Vertefeuille, J., </em>who made the following findings: \u201cWhile the motions to correct were pending, the attorney trial referee placed two phone calls to Attorney Martin O\u2019Neill. O\u2019Neill was the plaintiffs\u2019 former attorney who testified for the plaintiffs during the trial. The [attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>referee] made the phone calls in order to procure a copy of a promissory note which he believed was an exhibit at trial. The [attorney referee] made these calls without obtaining consent from the defendants. O\u2019Neill did not return the first call because of concern about the ex parte nature of the call. However, when the [attorney referee] called O\u2019Neill a second time, O\u2019Neill took the call. The [attorney referee] asked O\u2019Neill to telecopy to him a copy of the promissory note which gave rise to one of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims during the trial and O\u2019Neill did so. The [attorney referee] shortly thereafter issued his ruling on the motion to correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Judge Vertefeuille concluded that \u201cthere is little question that the [attorney referee\u2019s] action in speaking with a trial witness and obtaining a copy of the promissory note from the witness created the appearance of impropriety in violation of Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, which is also applicable to [attorney referees]. . . . The court finds no prejudice to the defendants from the incident in question. . . . Although the [attorney referee] acted improperly with the resulting appearance of impropriety, a mistrial under these circumstances is not warranted.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The case then proceeded before the trial court, <em>Levin, J.,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>who, in a memorandum of decision, concluded that \u201cthis court concurs with Judge Vertefeuille\u2019s decision. The ex parte communication was improper and violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Cannon 3 A (4) of the Code of Judicial Conduct to which the attorney trial referee was bound. The transgression here was especially serious: The trier contacted a witness (and former party). However, receiving a copy of the promissory note, which was a product of the ex parte communication was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The Code of Judicial Conduct applies to attorney referees. <em>Rowan Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Hassane, </em>17 Conn. App. 71, 75-76, 549 A.2d 1085 (1988), aff'd, 213 Conn. 337, 567 A.2d 1210 (1990). Both trial court judges found that the attorney referee had committed a serious breach of the Code of Judicial Conduct resulting in an appearance of impropriety. They concluded, however, that because the defendants had failed to show harm or prejudice from this misconduct, they were not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The issue, however, is not whether the misconduct proved harmful or caused prejudice to one of the parties. The issue is whether the misconduct would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>caused an outside observer to question the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>Dubaldo </em>v. <em>Dubaldo, </em>14 Conn. App. 645, 649, 542 A.2d 750 (1988). We have in the past taken a strict stand on ex parte communications between a judge and a witness. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">In the present case, an outside observer would see an attorney referee, acting as a judge, with matters, i.e., the motions to correct the report, pending before him that could affect the outcome of the case. The outside observer also would learn that the attorney referee contacted the defendants\u2019 attorney to seek permission to communicate with a plaintiffs\u2019 witness and that permission was denied. The observer then would learn that the attorney referee nevertheless contacted the witness, who was also the plaintiffs\u2019 former attorney, and obtained a copy of a promissory note, which had not been admitted into evidence. The attorney referee thereafter ruled on the motions to correct relying on the note and recommending judgment for the plaintiffs. Confronted with this scenario, the outside observer would have reason to question the impartiality of the attorney referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Cases concerning whether a judge should disqualify himself are relevant and instructive. \u201cThe code sets forth an objective standard for disqualifications; Canon 3 (C) (1) provides: A judge should disqualify [himself] in a proceeding in which [his] impartiality might <em>reasonably </em>be questioned .... Any conduct that would lead a reasonable [person] knowing all the circumstances to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is a basis for the judge\u2019s disqualification. Thus, an impropriety or the appearance of impropriety . . . that would reasonably lead one to question the judge\u2019s impartiality in a given proceeding clearly falls within the scope of the general standard . . . . The question is not whether the judge is impartial in fact. It is simply whether another, not knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>whether or not the judge is actually impartial, might reasonably question his . . . impartiality, on the basis of all of the circumstances. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dubaldo </em>v. <em>Dubaldo, </em>supra, 14 Conn. App. 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u201cThe question presented here is not whether the judge could render an impartial decision, but whether [the judge\u2019s] ex parte discussion with the witness . . . created in the minds of observers, particularly the defendant, an appearance of impropriety. We believe that, regardless of the judge\u2019s intent, [the judge\u2019s] action created the appearance of impropriety.\u201d Id., 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u201cProof of actual bias is not required for disqualification. <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>184 Conn. 21, 441 A.2d 49 (1981); <em>Krattenstein </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>[155 Conn. 609, 615, 236 A.2d 466 (1967)]. The appearance as well as the actuality of impartiality on the part of the trier is an essential ingredient of a fair trial. \u201d <em>Cameron </em>v. <em>Cameron, </em>187 Conn. 163, 170, 444 A.2d 915 (1982). \u201cWe have embraced the rule that \u2018justice must satisfy the appearance of justice\u2019; <em>Offutt v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 14, 75 S. Ct. 11, 99 L. Ed. 2d 11 (1954); even though this \u2018stringent rule may sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice equally between contending parties.\u2019 <em>In re Murchison, </em>349 U.S. 133, 136, 75 S. Ct. 623, 99 L. Ed. 942 (1955).\u201d <em>Dubaldo </em>v. <em>Dubaldo, </em>supra, 14 Conn. App. 650-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In the situation described in <em>Dubaldo, </em>although there had been no showing of actual bias on the part of the trial judge, the facts and circumstances reasonably implicated the appearance of impropriety so that this court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment for failure to grant a mistrial. \u201cImpartiality on the part of a judge is a fundamental tenet of our system of jurisprudence. . . . The trial judge must be ever vigilant to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>his conduct from the viewpoint not only of an unbiased observer, but also of the biased litigant who is desperately searching to find a flaw in the judge\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>In re Shana M., </em>26 Conn. App. 414, 417, 600 A.2d 1385 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In support of their contention that prejudice must be demonstrated to support a motion for mistrial, the plaintiffs rely on <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>211 Conn. 398, 559 A.2d 1094, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 981, 110 S. Ct. 512, 108 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1989); <em>Shelnitz </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>200 Conn. 58, 79-81, 509 A.2d 1023 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>181 Conn. 254, 265, 435 A.2d 38 (1980); <em>Aillon </em>v. <em>State, </em>168 Conn. 541, 547, 363 A.2d 49 (1975); <em>Izzo </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>157 Conn. 561, 565, 254 A.2d 904 (1969); and <em>Tukstas </em>v. <em>Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center, </em>23 Conn. App. 680, 583 A.2d 941 (1990). All of these cases are inapposite. None of those cases involves a motion for a mistrial based on conduct violating the Code of Judicial Conduct and thereby creating the appearance of impropriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that the ex parte communication was permitted by canon 3 A (4) (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which allows ex parte contacts for \u201cscheduling, administrative purposes or emergencies that do not deal with substantive matters . . . .\u201d We are not persuaded that the attorney referee\u2019s conduct came within any of these exceptions allowed by this canon.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We conclude that the attorney referee\u2019s ex parte communication with a witness for the purpose of obtaining a document that was not in evidence, even if the substance of its contents may have been before the attorney referee, violated the principles of impartiality underlying the Code of Judicial Conduct and irreparably tainted the judicial process. The trial court should have granted the defendants\u2019 motion for mistrial. In view of our disposition of the mistrial issue, we do not reach the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ants\u2019 claim concerning the merits of the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> The parties filed a written stipulation with the trial court, the relevant paragraphs of which are as follows: \u201c2. The Asset Purchase Agreement between the parlies was submitted as Exhibit A-4 during the trial of this action. The Asset Purchase Agreement contained a copy of the Note as a schedule. Counsel for the parties cannot confirm whether this schedule reflects an executed copy of the Note. ... 4. <em>The Note was not separately marked as an exhibit and introduced into evidence during the trial of this actioti, </em>which trial occurred before Attorney Trial Referee John Fracassini in July, 1992. The foregoing does not a constitute a stipulation by counsel for DeSalle that the Note was not properly before the Court during the trial of this action.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Because Exhibit A-4 has been lost, this court could not examine the copy of the note contained therein to determine if it was an executed copy. Whether or not the substance of the note was before the court, it is clear from the stipulation that the original promissory note was not introduced as a separate exhibit before the attorney referee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides in pertinent part: \u201cA Judge Should Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety in All the Judge\u2019s Activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u201cA. A judge should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b354-9\"> Judge Vertefeuille, the presiding judge of the civil court in the judicial district of Fairfield, entertained the motion for mistrial and revocation of reference to the attorney referee.
