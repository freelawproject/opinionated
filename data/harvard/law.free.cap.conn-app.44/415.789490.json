The defendant, Middlesex Mutual Assurance Company, had issued a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy to the plaintiffs, Helmut Steiner and Michelle Steiner, insuring their Westport residence against loss or damage by fire. On August 18, 1992, their residence was extensively damaged by fire. The parties were unable to agree on the value of the damages, and they, therefore, agreed to have the matter of the loss determined through an appraisal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> process provided under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the policy. The parties thereafter, on January 26, 1993, executed, inter alia, on a printed form the following memorandum of appraisal:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u201cThis memorandum by and between Helmut Steiner <em>&amp; </em>Michelle Brown Steiner of the first part and the Middlesex Mutual Insurance Company of the second part:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u201cWitnesseth: that whereas the party of the first part claims to have sustained a loss by Fire occurring on the 18th day of August 1992 to and upon the following described property to wit: Building &amp; Code up Grades &amp; establish length of repair period. 249 Greens Farms Road Westport CT and</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u201cWhereas policy # 1277049 issued by the party of the second part to the party of the first part provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\u201c2. Appraisal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">\u201cIf the insured and the company fail to agree as to the amount of loss, each shall, on the written demand of either, made within sixty days after receipt of proof of loss by the company, select a competent and disinterested appraiser, and the appraisal shall be made at a reasonable time and place. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire, and failing for fifteen days to agree upon such umpire, then, on the request of the insured or the company, such umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the county and state in which such appraisal is pending. The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately the actual cash value at the time of loss and the amount of loss, and failing to agree shall submit their differences to the umpire. An award in writing of any two shall determine the amount of loss. The insured and the company shall pay his or its chosen appraiser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>and shall bear equally the other\u2019s expenses of the appraisal and the umpire.\u2019 and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201cWhereas, a disagreement has arisen between the parties hereto as to the amount of such loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">\u201cTherefore<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Memorandum Witnesseth: that in conformity to the terms and conditions of the policy of the party of the second part, Dallas Dodge Sr. . . . and Alan Tancreti . . . have been selected and are hereby appointed appraisers, to appraise, in accordance with the terms and conditions of said policy, the replacement value of said property and the amount of loss directly caused by said fire to and upon the same. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">The two appraisers and the umpire, chosen in accordance with the insurance contract, met and, on May 3, 1993, rendered an \u201cinitial appraisal award.\u201d That appraisal was itemized as follows: building\u2014replacement cost value-$l,440,000; building\u2014actual cash value-$864,000; loss\u2014replacement cost value-$858,559.62; loss\u2014actual cash value-$600,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the trial court correctly noted, this May 3, 1993 appraisal was \u201climited\u201d in that it did not take into account any necessary code upgrades in the undamaged areas of the insureds\u2019 premises. It expressly stated<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that \u201ccode upgrades not considered in undamaged areas.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After the completion of the May 3,1993 appraisal, authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>from the town of Westport determined that the undamaged portion would have to be upgraded to meet the Westport code requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Thereafter, the parties apparently tried to negotiate a settlement of the values for the code upgrades in the undamaged areas. They were unable to agree. As a result of that impasse, the plaintiff commenced this declaratory judgment action on August 13, 1993. After the Westport authorities determined that upgrades would be required in the undamaged portion, the parties continued with the appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">On September 14,1995, the appraisers and the umpire issued a memorandum of appraisal, which stated, inter alia, that the award of May 3, 1993, \u201cleft code upgrades in undamaged areas open.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That memorandum also said that a meeting that took place sometime after May 30,1995, \u201cduring which meeting it was determined that as a result of the fire, the building had to be brought up to current code before a Certificate of Occupancy could be issued for reoccupancy.\u201d It was further determined that it was physically and economically impractical to repair the structure to comply with all applicable building codes. It was then determined that the most logical way to comply with all appropriate codes would be the complete demolition of the building and the construction of a new structure in its place. The September 14, 1995 appraisal developed a total replacement value, inclusive of demolition, of $1,652,017.78. This award noted that \u201cthe prior award for the fire loss . . . did include necessary code upgrades in the damaged areas equaling a replacement cost value loss of $858,559.62.\u201d This appraisal then deducted \u201cthe previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>ous award from the values developed\u201d and went on to say that \u201cthe award [now] equals $793,458.10 which represents the replacement cost value <em>for this portion of the </em>appraisal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This appraisal also pointed out that \u201cit was further agreed that establishment of the actual cash value of the building <em>as previously developed </em>[had been] $864,000.00\u201d (Emphasis added.) It then reset the actual cash value, stating that \u201cthe actual cash value of the building inclusive of code upgrades is [now] $991,210.62.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The plaintiffs then filed a motion to confirm the appraisal award. The defendant filed a \u201climited\u201d objection to the confirmation of the appraisal award, alleging that \u201cthe submission to the appraisers for the second portion of the appraisal award, which is the subject of the plaintiffs Motion to Confirm, was to determine the increased costs and for the total cost to repair and replace the damaged property taking into account the necessary code upgrades. ... In making said determination it was not necessary to determine the actual cash value of the building subsequent to its replacement and restoration and in accordance with code upgrades . . . .\u2019\u2019In addition, the defendant filed an application to vacate the arbitration award, which sought \u201can order vacating a portion of [the] arbitration award [of September 14, 1995] ... to the extent that the award . . . exceeded the submission. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In its decision, the trial court pointed out that, after the issuance of the initial appraisal award, dated May 3,1993, and the plaintiffs\u2019 institution of their declaratory judgment action, the parties \u201cagreed to submit the issue of the total value of code upgrades, including that in undamaged areas, for appraisal.\u201d It further noted that, as a result, on September 14, 1995, a second appraisal was rendered, which listed the actual cash value of the building, inclusive of all code upgrades, at $991,210.62.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The trial court stated that the defendant filed an objection to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to confirm and that, thereafter, it filed its motion to vacate that award \u201con the ground that it exceeded the scope of submission in that it determined what the actual cash value of the building would be subsequent to its replacement in accordance with code upgrades. Thus, the defendant requests that an order be issued vacating that portion of the September 14,1995 award.\u201d The court then determined that although the defendant had filed a motion to vacate<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the award \u201cin light of the language in [its] request, the court believes that the defendant intended to file a motion to modify the award.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">After stating that \u201c[b]oth parties have essentially acknowledged that the purpose of the appraisal was <em>only </em>to establish figures regarding the amount of loss\u201d (emphasis added), it concluded that \u201c[h]aving reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the record, this court is not of the opinion that the appraisers acted upon a matter outside the charge submitted to them. Accordingly, the September 14, 1995 Memorandum of Appraisal is confirmed <em>to the extent </em>that it provides a determination of respective [actual] cash and replacement cost values.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear on the record before this court that the trial court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to confirm the September 14, 1995 award and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The defendant maintains that the trial court acted improperly in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to confirm the appraisal award of September 14,1995, and in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate that award. It argues that the second appraisal award should have been vacated because it exceeded the scope of the submission by redetermining the actual cash value of the property at the time of the second appraisal. The defendant claims that the matter of actual cash value of the loss, both under the policy and the submission, had been fully determined at the time of the first appraisal of May 3, 1993. It is the defendant\u2019s position that, in determining the actual cash value, the only relevant time and the only time contemplated by the policy, is the time of the loss, i. e., the fire of August 18, 1992. That element should not have been revisited or reevaluated, argues the defendant, at the time of the second appraisal. The defendant claims that the only matter left open by the first appraisal was \u201cthe amount to be allowed of a replacement cost basis for code upgrades to the undamaged portion of the property.\u201d Therefore, it contends there was a \u201climited submission\u201d for the \u201csupplemental award\u201d of September 14, 1995. That award was limited not only by its submission, but also by the contract of insurance between the parties. To allow the redetermination of actual cash value in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the award of September 14, 1995, to stand would, the defendant claims, contravene applicable law, the objective of which is to provide personal indemnity to the property owner commensurate with the loss actually sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On the other hand, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court acted properly in granting their motion to confirm and in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate the September 14,1995 appraisal award because that award conforms to the contract between the parties as well as to the submission. The submission, they claim, did not restrict the conduct, procedure and method of the appraisal that they say allowed the parties to alter the procedure and method by mutual agreement. The plaintiffs also argue that there was only one submission, that of January 26, 1993. The submission was not in any way limited, according to the plaintiffs. That is so, they argue, because the appraisal award of September 14, 1995, completes what the appraisers expressly left open in their May 3, 1993 award when they stated \u201ccode upgrade not considered in undamaged areas.\u201d They contend that later, when authorities determined that the undamaged portion of the residence would have to be upgraded to meet the Westport building code, the appraisers reconvened by the mutual consent of both parties and issued a complete award on September 14, 1995. This award, they argue, \u201cwas not a second appraisal but a continuation of the original one.\u201d This was necessary, the plaintiffs claim, because \u201cthe appraisers were charged with appraising the plaintiffs\u2019 entire loss within the terms of their contract.\u201d Further, the plaintiffs indicate that, even if this court decides to vacate the replacement cost value of $1,652,107.78 as set out in the second appraisal award, they are still entitled to an immediate payment of $391,210.62, which represents the difference between the actual cash val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>ues of $600,000 and $991,210.62, as set out in the first and second awards respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Our Supreme Court has held that an appraisal clause in the standard form fire insurance policy as set out in General Statutes \u00a7 38a-307, such as the appraisal clause in the policy in this case, \u201cconstitutes an agreement to arbitrate and falls within the ambit of our arbitration statutes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-408 through 52-424. <em>Covenant Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>177 Conn. 273, 279, 413 A.2d 862 (1979).\u201d <em>Giulietti </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ins. Placement Facility, </em>205 Conn. 424, 432, 534 A.2d 213 (1987); <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Clinton, </em>38 Conn. App. 555, 564, 662 A.2d 1319, cert. denied, 235 Conn. 922, 666 A.2d 1186 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1104 , 116 S. Ct. 1320,134 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1996). \u201cThe parties themselves, by the agreement of submission, define the powers of the arbitrator. . . . The submission constitutes the charter of the entire arbitration proceedings and defines and limits the issues to be decided. . . . When the parties have agreed to a procedure and have delineated the authority of the arbitrator, they must be bound by those limits. . . . An application to vacate or correct an award should be granted where an arbitrator has exceeded his power. In deciding whether an arbitrator has exceeded his power, [the court] need only examine the submission and the award to determine whether the award conforms to the submission.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Bic Pen Corp. </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, </em>183 Conn. 579, 583-84, 440 A.2d 774 (1981). As noted, \u201c[i]n determining whether a submission is unrestricted, we look to the authority of the arbitrator.\u201d <em>Fraulo </em>v. <em>Gabelli, </em>37 Conn. App. 708, 715, 657 A.2d 704 (1995). \u201cThe authority of an arbitrator to adjudicate the controversy is limited only if the agreement contains express language restricting the breadth of issues, reserving explicit rights, or conditioning the award on court review. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>the absence of any such qualifications, an agreement is unrestricted.\u201d <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>223 Conn. 1, 5, 612 A.2d 742 (1992); <em>International Assn. of Firefighters, Local 1339, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>35 Conn. App. 775, 778, 647 A.2d 361 (1994). When parties mutually agree to submit their dispute to arbitration, judicial review is limited in scope and the resulting award is not reviewable for errors of law or fact. See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>211 Conn. 7, 14, 557 A.2d 1236 (1989); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 15, Local 530, </em>208 Conn. 411, 415-16, 544 A.2d 186 (1988); <em>Greater Bridgeport Transit District </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1336, </em>28 Conn. App. 337, 343, 610 A.2d 1324 (1992). \u201cEven in the case of an unrestricted submission [however, our Supreme Court has] recognized three grounds for vacating an award: (1) the award rules on the constitutionality of a statute ... (2) the award violates clear public policy ... or (3) the award contravenes one or more of the statutory proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 6; <em>Fraulo </em>v. <em>Gabelli, </em>supra, 716. \u201cSince the parties consent to arbitration, and have full control over the issues to be arbitrated, a court will make every reasonable presumption in favor of the arbitration award .... The party challenging the award bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient to invalidate or avoid it, and only upon a showing that it \u2018falls within the proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 . . . or procedurally violates the parties\u2019 agreement\u2019 will the determination of an arbitrator be subject to judicial inquiry.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 145-46, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987); <em>Malecki </em>v. <em>Burnham, </em>181 Conn. 211, 214,435 A.2d 13 (1980). While it is required that the arbitrator render an award that conforms to the submission, the award need not contain an explanation of the means by which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>reached that award. See <em>Bic Pen Corp. </em>v. <em>Local No. 134, </em>supra, 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Prior to deciding what was submitted to the appraisers, we must determine how many submissions were made. We agree with the plaintiffs that there was only one submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The \u201cRevised Memorandum of Appraisal,\u201d dated January 23,1993, is the <em>only </em>document in the record before us signed by the plaintiffs and the defendants submitting this dispute to the appraisal process under their insurance contract. After setting out that the plaintiffs claim that they have sustained a loss by fire on August 18, 1992, on their property, to wit \u201cBuilding Code Upgrade,\u201d the memorandum sets out the appraisal provision of their policy and that there is \u201ca disagreement . . . between the parties ... as to the amount of such loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The award of May 3, 1993, comported with the submission and made the necessary determinations as to value and loss including actual cash value. That award on its face, however, left open only the matter of code upgrades in the undamaged areas, as demonstrated by the statement placed directly under the values they had found, \u201ccode upgrade not considered in undamaged areas.\u201d This is underscored by the \u201cMemorandum of Appraisal\u201d dated September 14, 1995,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which was not a result of a new submission, as the defendant appears to argue, but was the undertaking to continue and complete what had expressly been left undone by this May 3, 1993 award. The September 1995 award specifically indicates that the earlier award \u201cleft code upgrades in undamaged areas open\u201d and that \u201cthe initial appraisal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>award [of May 3, 1993] . . . addressed fire damages only, leaving necessary code upgrades on undamaged areas as an open entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">This clause, after setting out that \u201cin conformity to the terms and conditions of the policy,\u201d the two named appraisers stated that they \u201chave been selected and are hereby appointed appraisers, to appraise, in accordance with the terms and conditions of said policy <em>the replacement value of said property and the amount of loss directly caused by said fire to and upon the same.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cThe terms and conditions of said policy\u201d include, of course, the appraisal clause. The authority thus conferred on the appraisers was intended to empower them to resolve the <em>entire </em>matter referred to them\u2014the matter of value and loss. This was, therefore, an unrestricted submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Having decided that there was only one submission and that the submission was unrestricted, we now consider whether the award conformed to the submission. In doing so, we keep in mind the defendant\u2019s claim that the appraisers exceeded the scope of the submission by their award in their September 14,1995 memorandum in which they arrived at new figures for both actual cash value and replacement cost value rather than determining only the cost of the now required code upgrades as to the undamaged areas. The focal point of the defendant\u2019s contention is the improper reevaluation or revisiting of the computation of actual cash value in the September 1995 award, which the defendant maintains had already been set at $864,000 in the May award.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Before deciding whether the award conformed to the submission, we should turn to the trial court\u2019s interpretation of that award. This is necessary because the trial court\u2019s decision stated that \u201cthe September 14, 1995 Memorandum of Decision is confirmed <em>to the extent </em>that it provides a determination of respective cash and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>replacement cost values.\u201d (Emphasis added.) During oral argument, counsel were heard as to what the trial court meant by the \u201cto the extent\u201d language as well as to the apparent omission of a word after \u201crespective\u201d in the same sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Our Supreme Court has said that \u201c[t]he construction of a judgment is a question of law for the court. . . . As a general rule, judgments are to be construed in the same fashion as other written instruments. . . . The determinative factor is the intention of the court as gathered from all parts of the judgment. . . . The interpretation of a judgment may involve the circumstances surrounding the making of the judgment. . . . Effect must be given to that which is clearly implied as well as that which is expressed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lashgari </em>v. <em>Lashgari, </em>197 Conn. 189, 196-97, 496 A.2d 491 (1985); <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Emerick, </em>28 Conn. App. 794, 806, 613 A.2d 1351, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 915, 617 A.2d 171 (1992). In doing so, it assists a reviewing court to keep in mind the theory on which the case was tried and on which the trial court decided it. See <em>Builders Service Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 299 n.19, 545 A.2d 530 (1988); <em>Fuessenich </em>v. <em>DiNardo, </em>195 Conn. 144, 151, 487 A.2d 514 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">It is a fair synthesis from what counsel said orally and in their briefs that \u201cto the extent\u201d was analytically not language of limitation but was regarded by them as the trial court\u2019s granting of the plaintiffs motion to confirm and denying the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate. We agree. With reference to the apparent omission of a word after \u201crespective,\u201d it was suggested at oral argument that the trial court meant \u201cactual\u201d and that this was borne out by the use of the plural \u201cvalues\u201d at the end of the sentence. We agree. Actually, therefore, the only <em>new </em>dollar values set out in the September 14, 1995 memorandum were the \u201ctotal replacement value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>inclusive of demolition\u201d of $1,652,017.78 and the \u201cactual cash value of the building including code upgrades\u201d of $991,210.62.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Now, we take up the issue of whether the award as confirmed by the trial court, exceeded the submission. In doing so we keep in mind that we have already decided that the submission to the appraisers of January 26,1993, was unrestricted. The fact that the May 3,1993 report did not fully complete their charge does not make the January 26, 1993 charge any more restricted. Their May 3, 1993 report completed their original charge except by their own express reservation that \u201ccode [upgrades were] not considered in undamaged areas.\u201d Once the Westport building authorities required code upgrades in the undamaged areas, that decision triggered the appraisers\u2019 duty to complete what had been originally submitted to them. To do so, however, did not require anything but their determination of the \u201cincreased cost\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> brought by doing so. They expressly stated<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that in their September 14, 1995 memorandum of appraisal. This is underscored by their statement in the same document that the \u201cinitial appraisal award . . . completed on May 3, 1993 . . . <em>addressed the fire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>damages only, leaving necessary code upgrades in undamaged areas as an open </em>entity.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In returning to do what remained to be done, the appraisers, however, did not have to revisit their earlier computation of the actual cash value of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss as insured by the defendant under the insurance contract.

It has been said that \u201c[ajctual cash value in a policy of insurance means what it would cost to replace a building or a chattel as of the date of the fire.\u201d <em>Fedas </em>v. <em>Ins.

In the policy before us, under \u201cPerils Insured Against,\u201d the defendant contracted, under the applicable coverages, to insure \u201cagainst risks of <em>direct loss </em>to the type of property described in Coverage A and B only if that loss is a physical loss to property. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) The submission, in charging the appraisers to determine the \u201camount of loss,\u201d required that they determine \u201cthe amount of loss directly caused by said fire. ...\u201d \u201cIt is well settled that the words \u2018direct cause\u2019 ordinarily are synonymous in legal intendment with \u2018proximate cause,\u2019 a rule applicable to causes involving the construction of an insurance policy.\u201d <em>Dixie Pine Products Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., </em>133 F.2d 583, 585 (5th Cir. 1943), cert. denied, 319 U.S. 743, 63 S. Ct. 1033, 87 L. Ed. 1700, aff'd on remand, 145 F.2d 977 (5th Cir. 1944); see <em>Dubuque Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Caylor, </em>249 F.2d 162, 164 (10th Cir. 1957). In an insurance policy that stated that it insured against \u201c[ljoss . . . directly caused by,\u201d the court held that directly caused was fairly synonymous with proximately caused.\u2019 \u201d <em>O'Doan </em>v. <em>Ins. Co. of North America, </em>243 Cal. App. 2d 71, 78, 52 Cal. Rptr. 184 (1966). The actual cash value of the plaintiffs\u2019 residence at the time of the loss, i.e., the fire of August 18, 1992, and the amount of the loss directly caused by that fire were fully determined by the appraisers on May 3,1993. There was, therefore, no need for them to reevaluate or recalculate the actual cash value after that date. This is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>for any one of three cogent reasons. First, their own report of May 3,1993, expressly states, \u201ccode [upgrades] not considered in undamaged areas.\u201d That this was all that was admittedly left to be done is further emphasized by the appraisal memorandum of September 14, 1995, which states that \u201c[the] award [of May 3,1993] left code upgrades in undamaged areas open . . . Nothing else in that memorandum was stated, or even implied, to be \u201cleft open.\u201d Second, there can be no question that calculating the cost of the required code upgrades addresses a matter that was not directly caused by the fire itself, not only because the upgrades were in an area undamaged by the fire but also because such upgrades cannot be considered a \u201closs\u201d under the policy as they did not exist at the time of the fire and hence were incapable of constituting a \u201closs directly caused by [the August 1992] fire.\u201d The payment of $864,000 to the plaintiffs as the actual cash value indemnified them for their loss. To require the defendants to pay any further sums to the plaintiffs goes beyond indemnity. Third, the potential for an insured to qualify for being paid by the defendant for the cost of code upgrades in the undamaged portion comes from \u201cAdditional Coverages,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> another type of coverage in this policy apart from that by which an insured can recover the actual cash value.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Paragraph 10 (c)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> of \u201cAdditional Coverages\u201d provides for the recovery of the cost of governmentally ordered code upgrades as the insured <em>\u201cmay </em>incur\u201d by virtue of such an order. (Emphasis added.) \u201cIncur\u201d means to \u201cbecome liable or subject to.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; see Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary; see also <em>Czarnecki </em>v. <em>American Indemnity Co., </em>259 N.C. 718, 720, 131 S.E.2d 347 (1963). Only this cost was left for the appraisers to determine after their May 3, 1993 appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Moreover, although the appraisers in their September 19, 1995 memorandum developed a new total replacement cost value inclusive of demolition of $1,662,017.78, as opposed to their May 3,1993 replacement cost figure of $858,559.66, the policy does provide for payment to an insured of the actual cost of the repair or replacement of a building when the actual repair or replacement is completed within a specified time.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This figure of $1,662,017.78 is based on the actual replacement of the plaintiffs\u2019 building. That point of reference does not exist as the building has not been rebuilt. They have not incurred any expense in that regard. Because, as we have shown the law and the facts to demonstrate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the only actual cash value figure that is focal is the figure that applies at the time of the loss, i.e., the fire of August 18, 1992, the appraisers could not properly determine a second actual cash value based on a building as replaced where that building has not been replaced. The defendant was required, under the policy, only to pay the plaintiffs if the building was, in fact, replaced. It was not. The policy provides that \u201cwhere the cost to repair or replace the damage to the building is more than $2500, [the defendant] will pay no more than the actual value of the damage until actual repair or replacement <em>is completed. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) By recalculating actual cash value in the September 19, 1995 memorandum, the appraisers exceeded their powers under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> because that award exceeded the original submission of January 26, 1993. They had completed their job by their award of May 3, 1993, in which they themselves admittedly left open only the determination of the cost of code upgrades in the undamaged portion. The actual cash value was determined as of the date of the loss, as the statute, the policy and the submission required.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In revisiting that item, the appraisers violated \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). This award did not conform to the submission. We come to this conclusion recognizing that arbitration awards are generally upheld and are extended great deference because the arbitration process is favored as a means of settling disputes. <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 4-5; <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Connecticut Police Dept. Employees Local </em>1159, 32 Conn. App. 289, 292, 628 A.2d 1336 (1993); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Hartford Federal of School Secretaries, </em>26 Conn. App. 351, 352, 600 A.2d 1053 (1992). We, nevertheless, believe that this case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>one of those rare cases where an arbitration award is to be vacated. We stress in this case that the appraisers\u2019 new replacement cost figure, coming about as it does from the unnecessary and improper determination of actual cash value, also underscores the fact that the appraisers exceeded their power.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Finally, there remains the matter of a proper order as to the appraisers\u2019 awards in this case. We have already decided that there was one submission to the appraisers, that of January 26, 1993. The appraisers, however, approached their tasks in two steps or two \u201cawards.\u201d The appraisers made an award on May 3, 1993. That award has not been appealed. Their second award on September 14,1995, has been the subject of this appeal. While technically we are not presented with the issue of the severability of an award, the claims of the parties have raised the issue of whether the actions of the appraisers throughout are pursuant to one submission, as the plaintiffs claim, or two submissions, as the defendant claims. We have resolved that issue in favor of the plaintiffs. The resolution of that issue affects our remand. Where parties arbitrate pursuant to a statute, the statute itself defines the powers of the arbitrators. <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. Thornton, 191 Conn. 336, 341, 464 A.2d 785 (1983), aff'd, 472 U.S. 703, 105 S. Ct. 2914, 86 L. Ed. 2d 557 (1985). In such a case, \u201c[a]ny deviation by the arbitrators from the statutory bounds under which they operate would indicate that they had \u2018exceeded their powers,\u2019 <em>a basis for vacating any offending part of the award, under General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 627, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Maiocco, </em>209 Conn. 579, 591, 552 A.2d 1207 (1989); <em>see Local 63, Textile Workers Union </em>v. <em>Cheney Bros., </em>141 Conn. 606, 109 A.2d 240 (1954), cert. denied, 348 U. S. 959, 75 S. Ct. 449, 99 L. Ed. 748 (1955). In certain instances, \u201ccourts have affirmed one portion of an arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>award while setting aside the rest.\u201d <em>Mellon </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>267 Pa. Super. 197, 198, 224, 406 A.2d 759 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">As this case was presented, we do not have a problem of severability. Only the award of September 14, 1995, was appealed and is before us for determination, although it was necessary for us to address the May 3, 1993 award. While they may be interrelated for that reason, the two awards are substantively independent and differently structured. The second was intended to complete what was left open by the first. The conduct of the appraisers on the second, however, exceeded their powers under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4). Only the cost of the code upgrades in the undamaged area of the residence was to be determined. Neither the parties nor the record before us disclose a dollar figure for such code upgrades. At oral argument it was suggested that the appraisers took that into account in arriving at the new actual cash value figure reported in the September 14, 1995 memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment vacating the appraisers\u2019 award of September 14, 1995, and for further proceedings to determine the cost of the code upgrades in the undamaged areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\"> Section 1\u2014Conditions, 6. provides: \u201cAppraisal.

One court has said that \u201cfire policy provisions precluding recovery of replacement cost until replacement is complete are reasonable as protection against \u2018the moral hazard,\u2019 and enforceable.\u201d <em>Bourne v.
