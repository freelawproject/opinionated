The plaintiff asserts that her action is pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>served by \u00a7 3 of Public Acts 1993, No. 93-77 (P.A. 93-77),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which saves certain underinsured motorist claims that were pending on December 8, 1992, or brought after that date and before May 20, 1993, from failure because of late submissions. This is so, she claims, because the <em>mere possibility </em>of an underinsured motorist claim arising out of an accident satisfies the pending claim requirement of the statute as effectively as an actual submission of the claim to the insurer. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. On January 12,1989, the plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident. She obtained a judgment against the tortfeasor that exceeded the tortfeasor\u2019s insurance policy limit of $20,000. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff had an automobile insurance contract with the defendant that provided underinsured motorist benefits. A pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>vision of the policy, authorized by General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 38a-290 (d), required the plaintiff to submit any underinsured motorist claim to arbitration within two years from the date of the accident. Our Supreme Court held that such a time limitation was valid and enforceable in <em>McGlinchey </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>224 Conn. 133, 617 A.2d 445 (1992), and <em>Hotkowski </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>224 Conn. 145, 617 A.2d 451 (1992). Our Supreme Court had previously held that \u00a7 38-175c (b) \u201cobligates insurance companies to pay on a policy\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage only <em>after </em>the limits of liability under all bodily injury liability bonds or insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Continental Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cebe-Habersky, </em>214 Conn. 209, 212, 571 A.2d 104 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In response to the holdings in <em>McGlinchey </em>and <em>Hotkowski, </em>the General Assembly enacted P.A. 93-77, effective May 20, 1993. Public Act 93-77 was designed to aid insureds who were in the position of having to exhaust the tortfeasor\u2019s policy, a process that could take several years, before being entitled to underinsured motorist benefits under their own policies. At the same time, the insureds were required, pursuant to <em>McGlinchey </em>and <em>Hotkowski, </em>to submit such claims to their insurers within the time period specified in the policy, typically two years. Section 3 of the act applied retroactively to \u201cclaimfs] or action[s] pending on December 8, 1992, or brought after said date and prior to [May 20, 1993].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">On June 29, 1993, four and one-half years after the accident, the plaintiff sent the defendant written notice of her intent to claim underinsured motorist benefits pursuant to her policy. The defendant denied liability, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>and in March, 1994, the plaintiff filed this action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and rendered judgment for the defendant, and this appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The plaintiff argues that her case falls within the retroactive provisions of P.A. 93-77 and is thus subject to only a six year- contract statute of limitations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the phrase \u201ca claim or action pending\u201d means the \u201coccurrence of an accident which <em>could give rise </em>to a cause of action.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">It is axiomatic that \u201c[i]n interpreting the language of a statute, the words must be given their plain and ordinary meaning .... When the language [of a statute] is plain and unambiguous, we need look no further than the words themselves because we assume that the language expresses the legislature\u2019s intent. . . . Indeed, [a] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>basic tenet of statutory construction is that when a statute ... is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Oller </em>v. <em>Oller-Chiang, </em>230 Conn. 828, 848, 646 A.2d 822 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The plain and ordinary meaning of the phrase \u201cclaim or action pending\u201d militates against the plaintiffs interpretation. \u201cClaim\u201d is defined as \u201ca demand for compensation, benefits or payment\u201d; \u201caction\u201d is defined as \u201ca legal proceeding by which one demands enforcement of one\u2019s right in a court of justice\u201d; and \u201cpending\u201d is defined as \u201cnot yet decided. \u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary. Accordingly, we conclude that in order for a claimant to benefit from the retroactive provisions of P.A. 93-77, an underinsured motorist action or claim must have been initiated by December 8.1992, and remain pending on that date, or such claim must have been initiated after December 8, 1992, and prior to May 20, 1993. Because the plaintiff neither had an underinsured motorist claim pending on December 8, 1992, nor initiated such a claim until June 29, 1993, P.A. 93-77 does not apply to her claim. The act, though clearly remedial, was designed to benefit a limited class of insureds who had taken some action to protect their rights. The beneficiaries were those who had filed underinsured motorist claims with their carrier, even if untimely, that had not been resolved as of December 8.1992, the date that <em>McGlinchey </em>was released, or those who initiated such a claim or action within the approximately five and one-half months after the release of <em>McGlinchey, </em>as provided in the act. The plaintiff does not fall into either category.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\"> The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered following the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff challenges the denial of her motion to open and set aside the judgment and claims that she alleged sufficient facts to sustain a cause of action pursuant to the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 42-110a et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b77-7\"> Public Acts 1993, No. 93-77, provides in pertinent part: \u201cSec. 2. . . . (e) No insurance company doing business in this state may limit the time within which any suit may be brought against it or any demand for arbitration on a claim be made on the uninsured or underinsured motorist provisions of a motor vehicle policy to a period of less than three years from the date of accident, provided, in the case of an underinsured motorist claim the insured may toll any applicable limitation period (1) by notifying such insurer prior to the expiration of the applicable limitation period, in writing, of any claim which the insured may have for underinsured motorist benefits and (2) by commencing suit or demanding arbitration under the terms of the policy not more than one hundred eighty days from the date of exhaustion of the limits of liability under all automobile bodily injury liability bonds or automobile insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident by settlements or final judgments after any appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u201cSec. <em>3. ...

Co., </em>233 Conn. 437, 664 A.2d 279 (1995) (holding that retroactive provisions of P.A. 93-77 do not violate United States or Connecticut constitutions); <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>233 Conn. 460, 659 A.2d 707 (1995) (holding that judgment not final under \u00a7 3 of P.A. 93-77 until action reaches final resolution on timely appeal); and <em>Bayusik </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 474, 659 A.2d 1188 (1995) (holding that claim filed pursuant to P.A. 93-77 subject only to six year statute of limitations). The trial court denied the plaintiffs motion, and the plaintiff amended her appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b79-13\"> The plaintiff relies on <em>Bayusik </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co., </em>233 Conn. 474, 659 A.2d 1188 (1995), to argue that her claim is subject only to a six year statute of limitations. The plaintiffs reliance on this case, however, is misplaced. In <em>Bayusik, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201cpolicies governed by \u00a7 3 of P.A. 93-77 are subject ... to the six year statute of limitations applicable to contract actions generally.\u201d Id., 484. The plaintiff in this case cannot receive the benefit of the six year contract statute of limitations because her claim is not within the purview of \u00a7 3 of P.A. 93-77, as discussed previously.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
