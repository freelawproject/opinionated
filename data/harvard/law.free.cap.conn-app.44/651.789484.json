The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) rendered summary judgment by incorrectly interpreting applicable statutes and (2) refused the plaintiff permission to amend her complaint. The plaintiff also alleges that the doctrine of sovereign or governmental immunity should be abolished for negligence claims against the state. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The plaintiff commenced this action against the defendant commissioner of transportation seeking to recover for personal injuries claimed to have been suffered as a result of a fall on October 8, 1992, on a sidewalk adjacent to the building occupied by the department of motor vehicles (DMV) on State Street in Hamden.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that (1) the department of transportation (DOT) had no statutory duty to maintain or repair the area of the alleged fall and (2) the plaintiff had failed to allege in her complaint that a state agency requested the DOT to maintain the subject sidewalk so as to invoke the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 lSb-30.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>trial court first addressed the second ground the defendant relied on in support of the motion for summary judgment and concluded that an issue of fact existed as to whether the DMV requested the DOT to maintain the area in question, thus, precluding the granting of summary judgment on that basis.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court concluded, however, that the defendant was entitled to summary judgment on the first ground because, as a matter of law, the defendant had no statutory duty to maintain the area where the plaintiff fell. The trial court ruled that, because the action was brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-144,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiffs burden was to establish that the defendant had a statutory duty to maintain the area where she fell. The court also determined, from the documents submitted, that the sidewalk where the injury allegedly occurred was not part of the state highway as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 13a-14,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and concluded that, therefore, any duty on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the part of the defendant must arise, if at all, by virtue of \u00a7 13b-30.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court further determined, as a matter of law, that the term \u201croads and drives\u201d as used in \u00a7 13b-30 does not impose responsibility on the defendant, pursuant to \u00a7 13a-144, to maintain sidewalks.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The plaintiff claims that \u00a7 13b-30 should be read to include sidewalks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She argues that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s reading of \u00a7 13b-30 confuses the [defendant\u2019s] general duty of maintenance and repair as established by statutes like [General Statutes] \u00a7 13a-91, with a failure to comply with a specific request, pursuant to \u00a7 13b-30, from another agency to maintain or improve state owned property under the control of that state agency.\u201d She claims further that \u201c[t]he responsibility of the [defendant] under \u00a7 13b-30 is based upon the request of another state agency with regard to a specific location on state owned property, not the label which is put on that location.\u201d We conclude that in construing \u00a7 13b-30, sidewalk is not included within the term \u201croads and drives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">\u201c[W]hen it is shown that the commissioner has a legal duty to repair or maintain such roads and drives pursuant to \u00a7 13b-30, \u00a7 13a-144 imposes liability on the commissioner for injuries sustained on those roads and drives as a result of the commissioner\u2019s negligence in performing his or her duty.\u201d <em>Amore </em>v. <em>Frankel, </em>228 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Conn. 358, 365, 636 A.2d 786 (1994). Section 13b-30 does not impose a duty on the defendant regarding sidewalks. We must strictly construe any statute in derogation of the doctrine of sovereign immunity. See <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Horrigan, </em>34 Conn. App. 816, 822, 644 A.2d 360 (1994). \u201cIn the specific context of statutes in derogation of sovereign immunity, [w]here there is any doubt about [the] meaning or intent [of the statute, it is] given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in sovereign immunity. . . . [T]he state\u2019s sovereign right not to be sued without its consent is not to be diminished by statute, unless a clear intention to that effect on the part of the legislature is disclosed, by the use of express terms . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hunte </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>238 Conn. 146, 168, 680 A.2d 1231 (1996) <em>(Callahan, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">The duty under \u00a7 13b-30 is to maintain roads and drives. The legislature saw fit not to include sidewalks, although it did include sidewalks in other sections of the statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly rendered summaiy judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The plaintiff next argues that the trial court improperly denied her request for permission to amend her complaint to add a count of negligence against the state. The plaintiff claims that she falls within the scope of the \u201cforeseeable class\u201d exception to the doctrine of governmental immunity as set forth by our Supreme Court in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>228 Conn. 640, 644, 638 A.2d 1 (1994). We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Additional facts are needed for analysis of this claim. The only defendant in this action is the commissioner of transportation. The plaintiff sought to amend her complaint to add a claim against the state for negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>gence, but the trial court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to this request because \u201c[t]he state of Connecticut is not a party.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record does not disclose that the plaintiff sought and obtained permission from the claims commissioner to file a claim against the state as required by General Statutes \u00a7 4-160.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly denied the plaintiffs request for permission to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The plaintiff argues that sovereign immunity should be abolished in Connecticut. She cites other states that have abolished governmental immunity for certain claims through legislative and judicial exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Our Supreme Court has refused to abrogate the doctrine of governmental immunity by judicial fiat. <em>Fidelity Bank </em>v. <em>State, </em>166 Conn. 251, 255, 348 A.2d 633 (1974). \u201cThe source of sovereign power in the state of Connecticut is the constitution, and it is recognized that a sovereign is immune from suit \u2018on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.\u2019 <em>[Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 623, 376 A.2d 359 (1977)] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Horrigan, </em>supra, 34 Conn. App. 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">\u201cThe question whether the principles of governmental immunity from suit and liability can best serve this and succeeding generations has become, by force of the long and firm establishment of these principles as precedent, a matter for legislative, not judicial, determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>nation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Fidelity Bank v. State, </em>supra, 166 Conn. 255. The state legislature possesses the authority to abrogate any governmental immunity by statute that the common law gives to the state and municipalities. <em>White </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 307, 312, 567 A.2d 1195 (1990). We, therefore, will not intrude upon the role of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 13b-30 provides in pertinent part: \u201cMaintenance of roads on state property.
