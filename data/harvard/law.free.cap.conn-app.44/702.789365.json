We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">A review of the record reveals the following. On September 10, 1994, at approximately 2:18 a.m., Officer Joseph Jones of the Norwich police department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>observed the plaintiff driving a motor vehicle in an erratic manner. The plaintiff was driving his pickup truck at a high rate of speed and, while swerving back and forth across the entire width of the road, almost collided with several parked vehicles. Jones pulled over the plaintiff and, on the basis of plaintiffs \u201cglossy eyes,\u201d the strong odor of alcohol on his breath, slurred speech, and his failure to perform certain sobriety tests satisfactorily, Jones placed the plaintiff under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Jones transported the plaintiff to police headquarters and made three attempts, using an intoximeter, to administer a breath test to the plaintiff. Jones stated in the narrative supplement that the plaintiff \u201cwas explained all necessary procedures but failed to give a sufficient breath sample on three separate occasions . . . [t]herefore resulting in a refusal of the test.\u201d He filled out an A-44 police report form as well as a narrative supplement to that form and stated in the supplement that the plaintiff \u201cwas very uncooperative and would not sign any necessary papers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 14-227b (c), a written report of the plaintiffs arrest and alleged test refusal was forwarded to the department of motor vehicles (department). Thereafter, the plaintiff was notified by the commissioner that his operator\u2019s license was to be suspended for a period of six months because he refused to be tested. He was also notified that he was entitled to a hearing to contest the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The plaintiff requested and was given an administrative hearing. The hearing officer admitted into evidence, over the objection of the plaintiff, the police report, the narrative supplement to the police report, and a breath test result tape from the intoximeter. Jones did not testify. The plaintiff testified that he did not refuse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>take a breath test. He testified that he did refuse to sign the temporary operator\u2019s license<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because he was \u201cupset.\u201d He said that he had taken three tests and that Jones had changed the intoximeter nozzle between the first and second tests. The plaintiff testified that, after the first test attempt, Jones had said that they would attempt another test. After the second attempt, according to the plaintiff, Jones said, \u201cTry again.\u201d The plaintiff testified that, after the third attempt, Jones had said, \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d The plaintiff also testified that he had not been told that he was not blowing hard enough or that his actions were being treated as a test refusal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The hearing officer found that the mandates of \u00a7 14-227b were satisfied and ordered that the plaintiffs license to operate a motor vehicle be suspended for six months. In making her decision, the hearing officer made subordinate findings that the plaintiffs \u201cconduct was properly deemed a refusal by the police officer, as his failure to sign the temporary license and other documents supports a lack of cooperation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183, the plaintiff appealed the administrative decision to the Superior Court, claiming that the decision should be reversed because (1) procedural errors were committed by the arresting officer, (2) the plaintiff did not refuse to be tested for his blood alcohol count and (3) the suspension subjected the plaintiff to double jeopardy. The trial court on November 16,1995, heard the plaintiffs appeal. After summarizing the evidence and arguments,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the trial court stated that, \u201c[i]n the court\u2019s view, the plaintiffs evidence was clearly more persuasive . . . .\u201d The court nonetheless found that there was substantial evidence on which the hearing officer could reasonably have based her finding and upheld the administrative hearing officer\u2019s decision. The trial court also rejected the plaintiffs other legal arguments and dismissed his appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In an administrative appeal, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the commissioner\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>suspend a motor vehicle operating privilege was clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>229 Conn. 31, 39, 639 A.2d 1018 (1994); see <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>171 Conn. 705, 713-14, 372 A.2d 110 (1976), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 969, 97 S. Ct. 2930, 53 L. Ed. 2d 1066 (1977). \u201cJudicial review of an administrative agency decision requires a court to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the agency\u2019s findings of basic fact and whether the conclusions drawn from those facts are reasonable. . . . Substantial evidence exists if the administrative record affords a substantial basis of fact from which the fact in issue can be reasonably inferred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 40. \u201cThe evidence must be substantial enough to justify, if the trial were to a jury, a refusal to direct a verdict when the conclusion sought to be drawn from it is one of fact for the jury.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>27 Conn. App. 346, 352, 606 A.2d 716 (1992). \u201c[I]f the administrative record provides substantial evidence upon which the hearing officer could reasonably have based his finding . . . the decision must be upheld.\u201d <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 601, 590 A.2d 447 (1991). The obvious corollary to the substantial evidence rule is that a court may not affirm a decision if the evidence in the record does not support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The plaintiffs first claim is that the trial court improperly upheld the administrative hearing officer\u2019s decision even though the procedures of \u00a7 14-227b were not followed. Specifically, the plaintiff claims procedural errors in that (1) he was not advised of his constitutional rights, a requirement of \u00a7 14-227b (b); (2) he was not informed that he would lose his license if he refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>to submit to testing or that the test results or a refusal to take the tests could be used against him in a criminal prosecution, a further requirement of \u00a7 14-227b (b); (3) he never received the results of the second and third breath tests, as per \u00a7 14-227b-8 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (4) there is no indication that all the test results were mailed to the department as required by \u00a7 14-227b (c); (5) there is no indication that the police report and accompanying documents were mailed to the department within three business days,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as further required by \u00a7 14-227b (c); and (6) the narrative supplement to the police report was not marked as having been made under oath. The plaintiff argues that, because a police report must conform to the requirements of \u00a7 14-227b to be admissible, this nonconforming report was inadmissible. Thus, the plaintiff argues, he has met his burden of demonstrating that no evidence exists because, without the police report and the accompanying documents, no admissible evidence was offered at the administrative hearing to support the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">This claim fails for three reasons. First, \u00a7 14-227b (f) does not provide for an adjudication of claimed procedural errors but expressly provides that \u201c[t]he hearing shall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle was impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>person refuse to submit to such test . . . and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle. ...\u201d The language of \u00a7 14-227b (f) is plain and unambiguous. The hearing is expressly limited to the four issues enumerated above. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 6, 509 A.2d 489 (1986). The hearing officer made the findings mandated by law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and was not required to do more.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Second, our Supreme Court has held that \u201ceven multiple failures on the part of an arresting officer to comply with the statutoxy dictates of \u00a7 14-227b [are] not sufficient grounds for overturning the commissioner\u2019s determination, after a hearing, that the essential elements of the statute had been proven and that the plaintiffs operator\u2019s license should be suspended.\u201d <em>Schallenkamp </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 41-42; see <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>204 Conn. 507, 518, 529 A.2d 177 (1987). That license suspensions hearings are limited to the four issues specified in subsection (f) of \u00a7 14-227b indicates that the legislature did not intend compliance with either subsection (b) or subsection (c) to be an essential condition for suspension. See <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>supra, 514, 517.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>Third, though there is merit, in theory, to a claim of procedural error that bears on the police report\u2019s reliability, the failure to check a box indicating that the narrative supplement to the report was made under oath does not nullify other indications on the police report signifying that such additional materials were made under penalty of false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">The issue of whether a police report was made under oath goes to the question of reliability of the report. Administrative tribunals are not \u201cstrictly bound by the rules of evidence ... so long as the evidence is reliable and probative.\u201d <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, </em>supra, 171 Conn. 710. Compliance with \u00a7 14-227b (c) is designed to provide \u201csufficient indicia of reliability so that the report can be introduced in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule, especially in license suspension proceedings, without the necessity of producing the arresting officer.\u201d <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 518. If the report did not include such indicia of reliability, the report would not be admissible even before an administrative tribunal of this type.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The plaintiff is correct in stating that, on the police report, there is no check in the box next to the line that states \u201c[i]n addition to this completed A-44 form, this report includes supplemental, explanatory material, attached hereto and subject to the oath requirement.\u201d This alone, however, fails to demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the supplemental material was not made under oath. In fact, the document bears sufficient indicia of reliability to justify its admission as evidence in this type of administrative hearing. The police report was signed and sworn to under oath. The arresting officer, by signing and swearing to the report under oath, indicated the narrative supplement was also signed under oath and sworn to. This is clear from two prepared statements on the report. The first is in the instructional portion of the form that directs the reporting officer to \u201c[ajttach additional sheets or materials necessary to explain portions of this Report. Such attachments are considered part of this Report and are approved by the Commissioner. The statements and information contained therein are subscribed and sworn to under penalty of false statement.\u201d The second is in \u00a7 1, oath, which states that \u201c[t]his report of chemical alcohol test or refusal and the above noted attachments hereto are subscribed and sworn to by me, the arresting officer, under penalty of false statement . . . .\u201d The fact that the arresting officer failed to check the box indicating that the report includes attachments does not negate these statements or the arresting officer\u2019s signature, which, together, indicate the report in full, i.e., the A-44 report as well as the attachments, is made under penalty of false statement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">The plaintiff next claims that there was not substantial evidence presented at the administrative hearing to support a finding of refusal to submit to the intoximeter test. We agree that, on the basis of the facts and circumstances of this case as presented before the administrative hearing officer, there was not substantial evidence to support a finding of refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The plaintiff supports this claim by stating that there was no evidence that the plaintiff either refused to take the test or that the plaintiff intentionally failed to perform the test. In contrast, the plaintiff points out, there was evidence that he took the test. He claims that there was no indication that the testing device was properly checked for accuracy nor was there any indication that the officer who attempted to administer the tests was certified to operate the machine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The plaintiff states that it is unclear what the results of the second and third tests were.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He also makes the argument based on <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>41 Conn. Sup. 437, 440, 582 A.2d 473 (1990), that lack of cooperation alone does not constitute refusal to take the test. Finally, the plaintiff claims that, in the absence of a statutory definition of \u201crefuse,\u201d the hearing officer failed to apply the commonly approved usage of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">We hold that where it is undisputed that the motorist submitted to the chemical alcohol test, the fact that he failed to provide an adequate breath sample does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>automatically constitute refusal within the meaning of \u00a7 14-227b. Such refusal must be supported by substantial evidence. A conelusory statement by the arresting officer that the driver has failed to provide an adequate breath sample and has, therefore, refused, does not constitute such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">It is not in dispute that the plaintiff orally consented to take the breath alcohol test. It is also not disputed that the plaintiff attempted three times to take the test. The arresting officer inferred that the plaintiff refused to be tested by not furnishing sufficient breath samples to enable a measurement of his breath alcohol levels. The arresting officer provided no information to support this inference adequately. There are grounds for this conclusion from only four other evidentiary sources: (1) the portion of the police report that states that the plaintiffs \u201crefusal\u201d was witnessed by a second officer; (2) the portion of the police report that lists \u201caborted\u201d as a result of the first intoximeter test; (3) the intoximeter test result tape, attached to the police report, that reads \u201cinsuff. breath\u201d; and (4) the narrative supplement, where the officer noted that the plaintiff \u201cwas very uncooperative and would not sign any necessary papers.\u201d Together, these sources do not amount to substantial evidence for a finding of refusal. With respect to the notation that the plaintiff was very uncooperative, an overall failure to cooperate, without additional details, cannot be generalized to show a lack of cooperation in a specific respect and, in fact, appears to relate to his refusal to sign the temporary license. As in <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 41 Conn. Sup. 442-43, \u201c[e]ven if intentional refusal of the driver to cooperate is a refusal to take the test within the meaning of the statute, the hearing officer never made a finding that the plaintiff intentionally failed properly to perform the test. The record does not support the finding even if the hearing officer entirely disregarded the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>testimony. . . . [T]he police officer\u2019s <em>opinion </em>that the plaintiff did not blow forcefully enough into the machine ... is only a conclusion without any underlying, stated <em>factual </em>basis in the record.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, it is unclear whether the remark that the plaintiff was \u201cvery uncooperative\u201d referred only to the plaintiffs refusal to sign the documents or also to the plaintiffs conduct during the test attempts. The other sources of information do not necessarily show that the plaintiffs failure to provide sufficient breath was a result of a lack of cooperation by the plaintiff. There is no indication whether the plaintiff was, in fact, trying to provide a sufficient breath sample and was unable to do so, whether the machine was working improperly or whether the plaintiff was deliberately withholding his breath. Also, as the trial court correctly noted, the plaintiff pointed out that the arresting officer provided a single intoximeter test result tape \u201cwhich indicated some inconsistency with their statements that the plaintiff failed to provide enough breath to record on the machine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The police officer did not include in the police report or the narrative supplement adequate information about his observations to support his conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>plaintiffs failure to provide sufficient breath was, in fact, a refusal to take the test. Such information, if it existed, could have been provided through testimony or other evidence such as the narrative supplement and might have described the officer\u2019s observations of the effort the plaintiff made in providing breath samples and in following the officer\u2019s instructions, or other conduct of the plaintiff that would bear on whether his actions were intentional.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Without adequate information to form a basis for the police officer\u2019s inference, therefore, there was not substantial evidence for the hearing officer to determine whether the plaintiffs actions constituted a refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">The hearing would appear to be only the barest of formalities if it were sufficient for the arresting officer to check a box and provide no substantiating data. The informed consent statute \u201cdoes not give the police or the hearing officer the authority to determine that a refusal to take the test . . . occurs when the driver consents to take the test and fails to perform it properly\u201d; <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 41 Conn. Sup. 443; and there is insufficient evidence here to support the decision of the police or hearing officer that there was a refusal to take the test. The statute does not authorize the administrative hearing officer to credit a conclusory determination by the police officer that the driver\u2019s failure to provide an adequate breath sample, without more, constituted a refusal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See id.; see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>30 Conn. App. 36, 44, 618 A.2d 579 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>This court is aware of the \u201ccarnage associated with drunken drivers.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>224 Conn. 730, 739, 620 A.2d 789 (1993). \u201cNevertheless, in our endeavor to rid our roads of these drivers ... we cannot trample on the constitutional rights of other citizens.

Ed. 2d 951 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In the present case, we conclude that the evidence in the record does not support the hearing officer\u2019s determination that the plaintiff \u201crefused\u201d to submit to the required test within the meaning of \u00a7 14-227b.

No.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b736-7\"> Regarding the evidence and arguments, the trial court stated the following: \u201cThe essential basis [of] the plaintiffs appeal is his contention that there was insufficient evidence that supported the hearing officer\u2019s finding that the plaintiff refused to submit to the required test. The evidence on this issue consisted of the A-44 police report, a narrative supplement, and ... the plaintiffs testimony. In the police report the arresting officer states that the plaintiff was uncooperative. He further states that the plaintiff \u2018failed to give a sufficient breath on three separate occasions, therefore resulting in a refusal of the test.\u2019 The police officer also stated the plaintiff refused to be tested and that statement is endorsed by another police officer who signed the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">\u201cIn opposition to the evidence summarized above, the plaintiff testified that he tried to blow into the intoximeter machine on several occasions. He testified that he did not refuse to take [the] test. He indicated that there was some evidence that the machine was not working properly, and that the mouthpiece had to be replaced. In his argument to the [trial] court the plaintiff points out that the officer failed to check the block on the A-44 report form indicating that he was certified to operate the intoximeter machine. The plaintiff also pointed out that the police attached only one machine tape to their report which indicated some inconsistency with their statements that the plaintiff failed to provide enough breath to record on the machine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b738-7\"> Section 14-227b-8 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies pro\u25a0vides: \u201cThe person who has submitted to a chemical analysis, or the person\u2019s attorney, will be afforded access to the test results by tire department prior to a scheduled hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\">The plaintiff offered evidence that the mailing date stamped on the records sent to the department was September 14, 1994, at 3:14 p.m. The plaintiff was arrested on September 10, 1994, at 2:14 a.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b739-7\"> In this action the hearing officer made the express written findings as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">\u201c1. The police officer had probable cause to arrest the above-named operator [the plaintiff] for a violation specified in [General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (b)].</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">\u201c2. The operator was placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">\u201c3. The operator refused to submit to such test or analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">\u201c4. Said person was operating the motor vehicle.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b739-12\">In addition, claims of statutory noncompliance involving two of these specific types of allegations\u2014failure to warn of the consequences of refusal and failure 1 o mail the arresting documentation t o the department within the three day period\u2014have previously been reject ed on appeal. The Connecticut Supreme Court has rejected the idea that a license suspension should be overturned for failure to warn of the consequences of test refusal. \u201c[I]n a license suspension appeal it is not necessary to determine whether a driver had been adequately warned of the consequences of his refusal to submit to the prescribed tests \u201d <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>204 Conn. 521, 523, 528 A.2d 828 (1987); <em>Volck </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 520. In both <em>Volck </em>and <em>Weber, </em>the alleged procedural defects included the officers\u2019 failure to warn the motorists of the consequences of their refusal to submit to testing. This court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>affirmed a trial court\u2019s ruling upholding an administrative hearing officer\u2019s decision to suspend a motorist\u2019s license despite a claim that the police report was not mailed to the commissioner within three business days. <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>26 Conn. App. 937, 601 A.2d 1 (1992), affirming <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford, Docket No. 701413 (July 11, 1991) (4 Conn. L. Rptr. 391); cf. <em>Yanni </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>31 Conn. App. 350, 354, 624 A.2d 1175 (1993) (holding that commissioner\u2019s mailing of notice of suspension by bulk certified mail, rather than certified mail as required by General Statutes [Rev. to 1993] \u00a7 14-227b [g], was not grounds for invalidating suspension).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b741-8\"> Each page of the narrative supplement also bears the signature of the arresting officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\"> The plaintiff correctly points out that the arresting officer did not check the box on the A-44 police report form stating that the \u201c[a]nalytical device was certified, analytical device was operated by a certified operator, and analytical device was checked for accuracy in accordance with applicable state regulations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\"> The A-44 police report form has two sections where arresting officers may fill in intoximeter test results. In the section marked \u201cFirst intoximeter test,\u201d the arresting officer in this case listed the time as 2:45 a.m., the date as September 10, 1994, and the result as \u201caborted.\u201d In the section marked \u201cSecond intoximeter test,\u201d the arresting officer left the time and result sections blank and filled in the date but then crossed it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">The intoximeter test result tape, which bears the signature of the arresting officer and was attached to the A-44 police report, shows tire following:</p>\n<p id=\"ASi\">\u201cTest Value Time</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">BLK .000 02:47</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">EXTSTD .096 02:48</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">BLK .000 02:49</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">STD .098 02:49</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">BLK .000 02:50</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">INSUFF. BREATH\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\"> In <em>Dorman </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>supra, 41 Conn. Sup. 440, the trial court stated: \u201cThe limited evidence before the hearing officer establishes the uncontested fact that the plaintiff was offered the breath test six times and that each time, the intoximeter failed to register an adequate reading. Nothing in the record indicates that the intoximeter was working properly at the time. Even if the plaintiffs testimony at the hearing is disregarded, other evidence in the record shows that he did consent to take the test, and did so six times. The police officer preparing the narrative report was of the opinion that the plaintiff did not blow hard enough to cause the machine to register, but the report fails to indicate the degree of effort made by the plaintiff, whether he was intentionally holding back, or whether another person could have caused the machine to register a reading given the condition it was in at the time. The officer reached iris own conclusion that the plaintiff was uncooperative and the officer construed this to be a refusal to take the test. This is not a factual conclusion that either the hearing officer or the court must accept. The police officer\u2019s opinion is speculation . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b745-7\"> Wo note, however, that a finding of intent may be unnecessary to reach a decision that a motorist\u2019s conduct in failing to provide adequate breath samples const ituted a refusal under \u00a7 14-227b. This is because such a requirement could render \u00a7 14-227b \u201cfunctionally unworkable.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 7. The Connecticut Supreme Court stated in <em>Buckley </em>that \u201c[a] refusal to submit to chemical testing for purposes of an administrative sanction need not be knowing and intelligent, for it is not analogous to the waiver of constitutional rights by a person accused of a crime.\u201d Id., 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\"> The plaintiff argues that failure to give a sufficient breath sample is, as a matter of law, not evidence of a failure to cooperate and, thus, in effect, cannot support, a conclusion that the plaintiff refused to take the test. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>certain circumstances, it may be possible that evidence of failure to give a sufficient breath sample may be evidence of refusal, if supported by an adequate basis in facts supplied to the administrative hearing officer. Such evidence, however, is not per se refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The plaintiff also argues that, in the absence of a statutory definition of \u201crefuse,\u201d the hearing officer failed to apply the commonly approved usage of the word. Recently, this court ruled on the definition of \u201crefuse\u201d in the context of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a. <em>State </em>v. <em>Corbeil, </em>41 Conn. App. 7, 18-19, 674 A.2d 454, cert. granted on other grounds and appeal dismissed, 237 Conn. 919, 676 A.2d 1374 (1996). There we stated: \u201cIt is not necessary to define a word that carries an ordinary, commonly understood meaning, is commonly used and is defined in standard dictionaries. . . . The word \u2018refuse\u2019 is defined as \u2018to show or express unwillingness to do or comply with. . . .\u2019Consequently, the dictionary definition makes it clear that\u2018refusing\u2019 to take a breath test <em>may be accomplished by a failure to cooperate </em>as well as by express refusal.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.)
