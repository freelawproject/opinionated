The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly (1) found that an arbitration clause in the employment agreement between the parties provides for the arbitrators to decide the issue of arbitrability, (2) concluded that the plaintiffs claims that the defendant breached his fiduciary duties as an officer and director were matters that arose out of the employment agreement and were thus arbitrable, and (3) con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>eluded that the defendant\u2019s claims were arbitrable despite the plaintiffs claim that a termination for cause is excepted from the arbitration clause. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The record discloses the following facts and procedural history. The defendant was the plaintiff\u2019s vice president of finance and chief financial officer. On January 1,1992, the parties entered into an amended employment contract. The contract contained an arbitration clause,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny contro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>versy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any breach thereof, shall, except as provided in Section 10, be settled by arbitration . . .\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">On April 29,1994, the plaintiff terminated the defendant\u2019s employment. On May 5, 1994, pursuant to his employment contract, the defendant filed a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. On May 23, 1994, the plaintiff filed an action in the trial court seeking to enjoin the arbitration. In addition, the plaintiff sought damages for the defendant\u2019s alleged breaches of fiduciary duties as an officer and director. The trial court stayed the action to allow the panel of arbitrators to determine the question of arbitrability. The panel then granted the plaintiffs request for a preliminary hearing concerning jurisdiction. After reviewing the briefs and arguments, the panel determined that the issues before it were arbitrable. After a lengthy arbitration, the panel awarded the defendant his full severance pay, attorney\u2019s fees and arbitration fees. The arbitrators dismissed all of the plaintiffs claims against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>On May 24, 1995, the defendant moved to confirm the arbitration award and the plaintiff filed a motion to vacate the award. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to confirm and denied the plaintiffs motion to vacate. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly referred the issue of arbitrability to the arbitrators because the arbitration clause was not broad enough to encompass that issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Whether a particular dispute is arbitrable is typically a question for the court. <em>Welch Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Creative Drywall, Inc., </em>215 Conn. 464, 467, 576 A.2d 153 (1990). \u201c \u2018It is well established [however] that arbitration is a matter of contract and that parties may agree to have questions concerning the arbitrability of their disputes decided by a separate arbitrator.\u2019 \u201d <em>Combustion Engineering, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, </em>15 Conn. App. 332, 333, 544 A.2d 256 (1988). \u201cIn apportioning, between the court and the arbitrators, the responsibility for determining which disputes are arbitrable, the language of the contract controls and determines whether the arbitrability of a dispute is for the court or the arbitrators.\u201d <em>Emcon Corp. </em>v. <em>Pegnataro, </em>212 Conn. 587, 592, 562 A.2d 521 (1989). \u201cThe intention to have arbitrability determined by an arbitrator can be manifested by an express provision or through the use of broad terms to describe the scope of arbitration, such as all questions in dispute and all claims arising out of the contract or any dispute that cannot be adjudicated.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Welch Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Creative Drywall, Inc., </em>supra, 467; see also <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Frey, </em>174 Conn. 578, 581, 392 A.2d 466 (1978). The arbitration clause at issue here is a broad one: <em>\u201cAny </em>controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any breach thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>shall, </em>except as provided in Section 10, be settled by arbitration . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Despite the broad language of the arbitration clause, the plaintiff asserts that the exclusionary language of the arbitration clause \u201cmakes it clear that not all claims arising under the Employment Agreement were to be arbitrated.\u201d In <em>Combustion Engineering, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, </em>supra, 15 Conn. App. 335, this court rejected a similar claim. The parties\u2019 agreement provided a broad arbitration clause<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that contained limited exclusionary language. This court held that in light of the entire arbitration clause, \u201cthe question of arbitrability [did not fall] within the ambit of that exclusionary language so as to preclude the arbitrator from deciding questions of arbitrability.\u201d Id. In this case, neither party claims that this dispute falls within \u00a7 10 of the agreement. The plaintiff concedes that the exclusionary language does not explicitly exclude arbitrability from the scope of the arbitrators\u2019 authority. Furthermore, the exclusionary language included in the arbitration clause refers only to the plaintiffs ability to seek equitable relief for breaches of the agreement concerning confidential information, intellectual property or interfering with the company. We conclude that the arbitration clause was broadly drafted to include the issue of arbitrability and the exclusionary language does not preclude the arbitrators from deciding questions of arbitrability.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The plaintiff also asserts that this dispute was not arbitrable because in its complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant breached his fiduciary duties as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>officer and director. The plaintiff maintains that because the employment agreement relates only to the defendant\u2019s role as an employee, the parties did not agree to arbitrate a dispute involving the defendant\u2019s role as a director, and, as such, the dispute is not governed by the arbitration clause contained in the employment agreement. This claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">In paragraphs one through fifteen of its complaint, the plaintiff recited various factual allegations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>paragraphs, the plaintiff makes no reference to the defendant\u2019s position as a director. In the third count, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>the plaintiff incorporated paragraphs one through fifteen, and alleged the conclusion that \u201c[a]s an officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>and <em>director </em>of [the plaintiff, the defendant] owed a duty of loyalty and faithfulness to [the plaintiff]. The foregoing acts [paragraphs one through fifteen] on [the defendant\u2019s] part constitute a breach of his fiduciary duties to [the plaintiff] . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The plaintiff has failed to differentiate its allegations and evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s role as an employee from his roles as an officer and director. To accept the plaintiff\u2019s contention would be to eviscerate the arbitration clause. By alleging that all of the acts were done by the defendant in his multiple capacity as an employee, officer and director, the plaintiff would effectively insulate all of the claims from arbitration. All of the plaintiffs factual allegations, even if true, could have been performed by the defendant in his capacity as an employee. After a careful review of the pleadings, transcripts and motions, we conclude that the allegations comprising the plaintiffs claim arise out of or relate to the employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The plaintiff finally claims that this dispute was not arbitrable because of the express terms of the employment agreement contained in \u00a7 6.3.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>Section 6.3 of the employment agreement provides specific rights, obligations and procedures to be followed in the event of a termination for cause. The plaintiff asserts that the defendant was terminated for cause, and that, pursuant to the employment agreement, the right to arbitrate did not survive a termination for cause. The plaintiff bases its claim on the following language contained in \u00a7 6.3: \u201cNeither the executive nor the company shall have any further rights or obligations under this Agreement except as provided in Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 17.\u201d The plaintiff asserts that the only rights and obligations that survive a termination for cause are the plaintiffs ability to obtain equitable relief for breaches of the contract provisions concerning confidential information (\u00a7 7), intellectual property (\u00a7 8), interfering with the company (\u00a7 9), and the defendant\u2019s rights to an advance of defense expenses (\u00a7 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">First, we note the broad nature of the arbitration clause as discussed in part I of this opinion. The arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>tion clause does not expressly exclude \u00a7 6.3 from arbitration, leading us to conclude that the parties intended that disputes arising out of that section are arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Furthermore, \u00a7 6.3 does not address the question of <em>remedies </em>for the defendant in the event of a breach of \u00a7 6.3 by the plaintiff, except for the \u00a7 17 provision for an advance of counsel fees in certain situations. Even if the defendant were entitled to counsel fees pursuant to \u00a7 17, such a limited remedy would be meaningless if we accept the plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 6.3. The defendant, after retaining counsel, could not force an arbitration of his challenge to his dismissal for cause and, a fortiori, could not pursue an action in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The construction of \u00a7 6.3 advocated by the plaintiff would mean that the plaintiff could preclude the defendant from any effective remedy by labelling a termination as one \u201cfor cause.\u201d The defendant could neither challenge the alleged causes for termination nor any claimed failure of the plaintiff to hold the required meeting within fifteen days of the receipt of notice of termination or grant the fifteen day cure period. This would be a bizarre result considering that, although the plaintiff may terminate the defendant\u2019s employment at any time without cause, a termination without cause obligates the plaintiff to pay the defendant three times his base annual salary, plus other benefits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>is terminated for cause, he is entitled to be paid only to the date of termination. Thus, the plaintiffs interpretation would leave the defendant virtually without a remedy in the circumstances where he most needed one. \u201cParties to a contract may agree on the remedies available in the event of a breach of contract. If the language of the agreement discloses that the parties intended to limit the remedies to those stated, the agreement will be enforced and the party will be limited to the exclusive remedies outlined in the agreement. ... A contract will not be construed to limit remedial rights unless there is a clear intention that the enumerated remedies are exclusive. ...\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Shawmut Bank Connecticut, N.A. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Limousine Service, Inc., </em>40 Conn. App. 268, 277, 670 A.2d 880, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 915, 673 A.2d 1143 (1996). Considering the broad nature of the arbitration clause and the bizarre result required by the plaintiffs interpretation of \u00a7 6.3, we conclude that there was no such intention to limit the defendant to the remedy of an advance of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b693-10\"> The plaint iff named Michael Stauff and the American Arbitration Association as defendants in its original complaint.

IMH is a privately held company whose principal shareholder (holding in excess of 90% of the shares) at all times referred to was IFEM, S.p.A. (\u2018IFEM\u2019), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Italy whose principal place of business is in Milano, Italy. IFEM is a wholly owned a subsidiary of ISVIM, S.p.A. which, in turn, is a subsidiary of Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. (\u2018Ferruzzi\u2019). The remaining shares if IMH were owned by a number of individuals including Defendant Stauff.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">\u201c5. Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement dated as of the first day of January, 1992 (hereinafter the \u2018Employment Agreement\u2019), Stauff was employed by IMH as its Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Under that Employment Agreement, Stauff was to perform faithfully and diligently such duties and responsibilities appropriate to his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">\u201c6. In willful gross neglect of Ms obligations under the Employment Agreement, and in willful gross misconduct Stauff repeatedly and consistently failed to fulfill Ms duties and responsibilities in numerous respects including but not limited to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">\u201ca. Stauff failed to maintain IMH\u2019s financial statements and records in a manner consistent with generally accepted accounting practices but, to the contrary, authorized and approved substantial deviations from those practices;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>\u201cb. Stauff authorized or permitted the commingling of Company funds with officers\u2019 funds;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\u201cc. Stauff authorized or permitted the expenditure of Company funds for legal and other services rendered to officers of IMH in their individual capacities, and Stauff permitted the use of corporate assets to defray the cost of a Searav boat titled in the name of John E. D. Grunow, Jr. (\u2018Grunow\u2019), IMH\u2019s then Chief Executive Officer;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\u201cd. Stauff authorized numerous foreign currency exchanges for no apparent business purpose but at increased cost and losses to IMH;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\u201ce. Stauff authorized international payments and transfers of funds overseas, including fund transfers to Swiss bank accounts, without necessary documentation of the business purpose for such payments and transfers or the ultimate disposition of such funds;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">\u201cf. Stauff failed to implement and maintain reasonable accounting controls with respect to the submission and approval of expenses charged to and paid by IMH. As a consequence, IMH: reimbursed officers and employees of the Company for travel and entertainment expenses without presentation of proper accounts; paid excessive legal fees which were tendered without substantiation and which, in whole or in part, were charged to incorrect Company accounts; and, paid credit card and other bills submitted to the Company without proper documentation of their business purpose;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">\u201cg. Stauff authorized or permitted the hiring of and payments to various consultants including investment and accounting counselors without justification and at substantial expense to IMH;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">\u201ch. Stauff authorized or permitted payments of compensation to individuals for which no services were provided to IMH;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">\u201ci. Stauff authorized or permitted IMH to malee prepayments for services contrary to IMH\u2019s business interests;</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">\u201cj. Stauff failed and refused to provide financial and other information to IMH\u2019s Board of Directors and majority shareholder despite reasonable requests therefor; and</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">\u201ck. Stauff refused to provide IMH\u2019s auditor, Arthur Anderson &amp; Co., information essential to its auditing function upon request and otherwise attempted to interfere with the proper performance of Arthur Anderson\u2019s audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">\u201c7. Further, since the summer of 1992, Stauff, individually and in cooperation with others including Grunow, pursued a scheme to reduce the value of IMII and facilitate an attempt to seize ownership and control of IMH and its subsidiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">'\u20188. In furtherance of this scheme, Stauff, individually and in cooperation with Grunow and others, engaged in the following acts:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">\u201ca. In 1993, without the knowledge or consent of IMH\u2019s majority shareholder or its Board of Directors, established Eumenes Corporation as a wholly-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>owned subsidiary of IMH. Organizing Eumenes Corporation was contrary to the express direction of IMH\u2019s Board and majority shareholder and further was in violation of its Certificate of Incorporation and IMH\u2019s Bylaws;</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">\u201cb. Having so established Eumenes without the knowledge of IMH\u2019s Board or its majority shareholder, transferred real and intangible assets of IMH or its subsidiaries to Eumenes;</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\u201cc. Reduced the value of such assets for financial statement purposes, in order to, on information and belief, sell such assets to other entities or otherwise convert such assets;</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">\u201cd. Sought to take control of IMH\u2019s successful subsidiary Lewmar, through a scheme of reducing the book value of Lewmar\u2019s assets, discharging Lewmar executives Huggett and Blackwood, and investigating the transfer of Lew-mar\u2019s trademark rights to another party, contrary to IMH\u2019s By-Laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">\u201c9. This scheme to take control of IMH and Lewmar culminated in a proposed \u2018management buy-out\u2019 of IMH using financing from the New York investment group Three Cities Research, Inc. (\u2018Three Cities\u2019). Stauff, having authorized and permitted the devaluation of certain assets of IMH and having deliberately misrepresented IMH\u2019s financial condition and fair market value to its majority shareholder, in cooperation with Grunow and others proposed to buy all of the interest of Ferruzzi and its subsidiaries in IMH for substantially less than its true market value, which amount was also substantially less than the sums Ferruzzi and its subsidiaries had invested in and loaned to IMH.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">\u201c10. On January 24, 1994 an Agreement in Principle was signed by IMH Holdings, Inc. (a company formed and to be owned by Stauff, Grunow, and others), Three Cities, and Ferruzzi; Ferruzzi entered into the Agreement in Principle in reliance upon Defendant\u2019s representations concerning the market value and financial condition of IMH. Under the Agreement, IMH Holdings and Three Cities were to purchase IMH by March 31, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">\u201c11. Defendants\u2019 efforts to purchase IMH and capitalize on the scheme to devalue and taire control of the company was thwarted when Three Cities determined in their review of IMH that Stauff, Grunow and others had deliberately misrepresented the financial status of IMH and had mismanaged business operations of the company. Accordingly, Three Cities announced that it would not go forward with the Agreement in Principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">\u201c12. The foregoing acts and omissions of Stauff constitute willful, gross neglect, willful, gross misconduct and other grounds for IMH to terminate Stauffs employment for cause. On April 29, 1994 IMH\u2019s Board, through its Chairman Allesandro Bonetti, gave Stauff notice of the termination of his employment with IMH for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">\u201c13. Subsequently, on or about May 5, 1994, Stauff filed a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association requesting the arbitration of Stauffs termination of employment with IMH.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>\u201c14. The Employment Agreement between IMH and Stauff does not provide for arbitration regarding a termination for cause as that term is defined under the Employment Agreement, and thus, the parties to the Employment Agreement did not agree to arbitrate a claim or dispute concerning IMII\u2019s termination of Stauff under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">\u201c15.
