The plaintiff now appeals from postjudgment orders issued by the trial court. We affirm the judgment of the trial court in all respects except the continuation of life insurance naming the children as beneficiaries beyond the statutory age of majority, i.e., eighteen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant agrees that the trial court exceeded its authority in ordering that life insurance be maintained beyond the eighteenth birthday of each child.
