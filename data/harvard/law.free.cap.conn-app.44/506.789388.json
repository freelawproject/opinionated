(Clairol), to vacate an arbitration award in favor of the defendant, Enertrac Corporation (Enertrac), pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The application was granted on the basis of a finding that Clairol had been denied a full and fair hearing before the arbitration panel. Enertrac claims (1) that the trial court did not correctly apply the presumption that arbitration awards should be sustained and that arbitration proceedings were properly conducted, and (2) that the trial court improperly failed to seek an articulation or explanation from the arbitration panel. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The facts relevant to the disposition of the issues are as follows. On December 7, 1988, Clairol entered into a written construction contract with Enertrac for Enertrac to design and construct a cogeneration facility for use by Clairol in its manufacturing business in Stamford. Disputes ensued concerning performance by both parties under the agreement. Pursuant to article 10.1 of the contract, \u201c[c]laims, disputes and other matters <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>in question between the parties . . . shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association . . . .\u201d Article 10.3 of the agreement provides that \u201c[t]he award rendered by arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">On November 19,1990, Clairol submitted the disputes between the parties to arbitration. Enertrac filed a counterclaim. The arbitration hearings commenced on May 4, 1992. Thereafter, more than twenty hearings were held or scheduled over a period in excess of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">During the arbitration hearings, Enertrac introduced the testimony of two witnesses. Enertrac\u2019s first witness was Robert Reilly, Enertrac\u2019s president who was involved with the business aspects of the project. A second witness for Enertrac was George Thompson, an engineer and Enertrac\u2019s designated expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Thompson\u2019s direct examination was concluded, but cross-examination was deferred to a later date. In a letter to the American Arbitration Association, counsel for Enertrac stated, inter alia: \u201cShould Enertrac not be able to make Mr. Thompson available in order to conclude these hearings, then Mr. Thompson\u2019s direct testimony should be stricken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Clairol requested that the arbitration panel strike the direct testimony of Thompson and dismiss the counterclaim of Enertrac, both of which requests the arbitration panel formally denied on January 10,1994. Additionally, on March 24, 1994, the panel decided that it would disallow Enertrac\u2019s request to withdraw Thompson\u2019s testimony voluntarily. The spokesperson for the panel stated: \u201cWith respect to the voluntary withdrawal of Mr. Thompson\u2019s testimony, as you know in our arbitration proceedings here, we are the ultimate final decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>makers with respect to relevancy and materiality, and just how much [weight], if any, is given to any exhibits or oral documentary or oral testimony that comes before the panel. We are going to approach the testimony of Mr. Thompson in the same fashion. Whatever relevancy or whatever [weight] the direct examination may have; it may be zero, it may be negative. That is the way we are going to approach it. So we are going to deny your voluntary request to strike that testimony. And we will assign it our own [weight] or relevancy or materiality in our ultimate deliberations on a decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">At the hearing on May 16, 1994, Clairol renewed its requests to strike the direct testimony of Thompson and to dismiss Enertrac\u2019s counterclaim. These requests were considered and the spokesperson for the panel stated that the panel would \u201ctake a very hard look at assigning the appropriate weight\u201d to Thompson\u2019s testimony, \u201cranging from no weight whatsoever to possibly negative weight.\u201d The panel also indicated again that it was not going to dismiss Enertrac\u2019s counterclaim. Clairol then decided to introduce testimony and exhibits to rebut Thompson\u2019s testimony. Subsequently, the hearings closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">On March 27, 1995, the arbitration panel issued a unanimous written award. The panel awarded each party a small portion of its claim and assigned nearly all of the administrative costs of the arbitration to Clairol. The award also provided that Clairol would be liable to Enertrac for all costs that Enertrac owed to the manufacturer of the cogeneration equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">On March 31, 1995, counsel for Clairol sent a letter to the arbitration association requesting a clarification by the arbitrators as to the basis for their decision, including an explanation of the underlying award and how the arbitrators reached their decision on Clairol\u2019s claim and Enertrac\u2019s counterclaim. The arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>association responded by letter dated April 4, 1995, in which it refused Clairors request to provide clarification without first obtaining the consent of both parties to reinstate the authority of the arbitrators. The letter also indicated that \u201c[a]n arbitration award is considered final when rendered and the arbitrator\u2019s authority ceases thereafter.\u201d In a letter to the arbitration association dated April 10, 1995, Reilly, Enertrac\u2019s president, refused to consent to the reinstatement of the authority of the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">On April 24, 1995, Clairol filed an application in the trial court to vacate the award based on the claims that the arbitrators had denied Clairol\u2019s right to cross-examine Thompson, had refused to vacate or deny Enertrac\u2019s counterclaim because of Enertrac\u2019s failure to produce Thompson for cross-examination, and had issued an award not supported by the complete testimony of Thompson, which testimony was pertinent and material to the resolution of the parties\u2019 controversy. On October 25,1995, the trial court granted the application to vacate the award. The trial court found that Enertrac \u201cdoes not contest that Thompson was not made available for cross-examination. Furthermore, [Clairol] has provided a ruling of the arbitrators denying [Clairol\u2019s] motion to strike Thompson\u2019s direct testimony. [Clairol] was deprived of its absolute right of cross-examination and a full and fair hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Enertrac filed a motion for articulation on January 18, 1996. This motion was denied. A motion for review was filed with the Appellate Court on February 23,1996. This court granted the motion for review, but denied the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Enertrac first claims that the trial court did not correctly apply the presumption that arbitration awards should be sustained and that the arbitration proceedings were properly conducted. We have been loath to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>intervene judicially and to interfere with the parties\u2019 voluntary agreement to settle their disputes by arbitration. <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>203 Conn. 133, 145, 523 A.2d 1271 (1987). Because arbitration is such a valuable and commendable tool in alternative dispute resolution, judicial intervention is the exception rather than the rule. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u201cWe have stated repeatedly that judicial review of arbitration awards is limited in scope .... <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, </em>35 Conn. App. 804, 807-808, 647 A.2d 755 (1994). Our courts have wholeheartedly endorsed arbitration as an effective alternative method of settling disputes intended to avoid the formalities, delay, expense and vexation of ordinary litigation. . . . When arbitration is created by contract, we recognize that its autonomy can only be preserved by minimal judicial intervention. . . <em>.O &amp;G/O\u2019Connell Join Venture v. Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>[supra, 203 Conn. 145]; see also <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Board of Mediation &amp; Arbitration, </em>211 Conn. 7, 14, 557 A.2d 1236 (1989). Judicial review of arbitration awards is, therefore, limited in scope by \u00a7 52-418 and our courts will not disturb an arbitration award unless it clearly falls within the proscriptions of [that statute], . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>AFSCME, </em>13 Conn. App. 461, 463, 537 A.2d 517 (1988); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Connecticut Employees Union Independent, Inc., </em>33 Conn. App. 737, 740, 638 A.2d 619 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u201cIn addition, [t]he party challenging the award bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient to invalidate or avoid it, and only upon a showing that it falls within the proscriptions of \u00a7 52-418 of the General Statutes . . . will the determination of an arbitrator be subject to judicial inquiry. . . . <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venturer.

[A] court will make every reasonable presumption in favor of the arbitration award and the arbitrator\u2019s acts and proceedings. <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>supra, 145; see also <em>Diamond Fertiliser &amp; Chemical Corp. </em>v. <em>Commodities Trading International Corp., </em>211 Conn. 541, 547, 560 A.2d 419 (1989); <em>Norwich Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp. </em>v. <em>Southern New England Contracting Co., </em>supra, 476. Absent a showing of perverse misconstruction [of the law] or positive misconduct . . . the arbitrator\u2019s determination is not subject to judicial inquiry. <em>Twin Towers Associates </em>v. <em>Gilbert Switzer &amp; Associates, 4 </em>Conn. App. 538, 540, 495 A.2d 735, cert. dismissed, 197 Conn. App. 811, 499 A.2d 61 (1985), citing <em>Schwarzschild </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>191 Conn. 316, 327, 464 A.2d 774 (1983).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>37 Conn. App. 1, 5-6, 654 A.2d 384 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Article 10.3 of the parties\u2019 agreement provides that \u201cthe award rendered by arbitrators shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The trial court found that the \u201carbitration award may only be vacated if the arbitrators\u2019 refusal to afford [Clairol] the opportunity to cross-examine Thompson deprived [Clairol] of a full and fair hearing.\u201d We conclude that Clairol was not deprived of a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">We first note that the alleged lack of opportunity to cross-examine a witness occurred in a proceeding before an arbitration panel in a private, unrestricted and consensual arbitration, not in a jury or court trial and, therefore, cases such as <em>Commercial Union Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>Co. </em>v. <em>Frank Perrotti &amp; Sons, </em>20 Conn. App. 253, 262, 566 A.2d 431 (1989), are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u201c[A] court or hearing officer has the discretion to choose among three options when a witness has testified on direct examination and subsequently becomes unavailable for cross-examination: declare a mistrial; strike the direct testimony; or allow the direct testimony to stand.\u201d <em>Ann Howard\u2019s Apricots Restaurant, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>237 Conn. 209, 222, 676 A.2d 844 (1996), citing C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 3.4.3, p. 47. In the present case, the arbitration panel chose to allow the direct testimony to stand. Clairol\u2019s application to vacate the arbitration award alleged that the arbitrators had both committed misconduct; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3); and exceeded their powers; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4); in permitting the testimony that was not subject to cross-examination to be admitted. On appeal, however, Clairol, while citing both subsections of the statute, limits its argument to the former. We, therefore, consider whether the panel\u2019s decision constituted misconduct under \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Section 52-418 (a) (3) provides that the court shall vacate an arbitration award \u201cif the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in . . . refusing to hear\u2019 evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced <em>. . . .\u201d </em>Our Supreme Court has held that \u201cwe decline to interpret \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3) as mandating that every failure or refusal to receive evidence, even relevant evidence, constitutes misconduct.\u201d <em>O &amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 149. \u201c[Arbitrators are accorded substantial discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence, particularly in the case of an unrestricted submission, which reheve [s] the arbitrators of the obligation to follow strict rules of law and evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>reaching their decision. . . . Indeed, it is within the broad discretion of arbitrators to decide whether additional evidence is required or would merely prolong the proceedings unnecessarily. . . . This relaxation of strict evidentiary rules is both necessary and desirable because arbitration is an informal proceeding designed, in part, to avoid the complexities of litigation. Moreover, arbitrators generally are laypersons who bring to these proceedings their technical expertise and professional skills, but who are not expected to have extensive knowledge of substantive law or the subtleties of evidentiary rules. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u201cTo establish that an evidentiary ruling, or lack thereof, rises to the level of misconduct prohibited by \u00a7 52-418 (a) (3) requires <em>more than a showing that an arbitrator committed an error of law. . . . </em>Rather, a party challenging an arbitration award . . . must prove that, by virtue of an evidentiary ruling, he was <em>in fact </em>deprived of a full and fair hearing before the arbitration panel.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) O <em>&amp; G/O\u2019Connell Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Chase Family Ltd. Partnership No. 3, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 148-49. In addition, it must prove that as a result of the improper ruling, it suffered substantial prejudice. <em>Ann Howard\u2019s Apricots </em>Restaurant, <em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 209. A trial court reviewing an arbitration award, therefore, must consider all of the evidence placed before it concerning the alleged error in order to determine whether the challenging party has proved that the alleged error, <em>in fact, </em>denied it a full and fair hearing. Id. In reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision, an appellate court must determine whether, on the basis of the record before it, the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the challenging party was, <em>in fact, </em>denied such a full and fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>In the present case, we conclude that no misconduct by the arbitration panel occurred. The record before us contains certain portions of the transcript of the arbitration proceedings that were before the trial court indicating that Clairol was denied the opportunity to cross-examine Thompson, and Enertrac has not disputed this fact. On the basis of that fact, the trial court concluded as a matter of law that Clairol, as a party to an arbitration hearing, was denied a full and fair hearing and, therefore, vacated the award. The court, however, failed to consider whether, <em>in fact, </em>a full and fair hearing was denied because Clairol suffered substantial prejudice by the lack of cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">To determine whether that Clairol was, in fact, denied a full and fair hearing, the court would have had to review a complete transcript of the arbitration proceeding, and, in particular, the transcript of Thompson\u2019s testimony. We note that Clairol put before the trial court a minimal record that failed to include the transcript of Thompson\u2019s testimony. Absent that transcript, it was impossible for the trial court to determine whether any of his testimony was detrimental to Clairol. Moreover, the transcript of all other witnesses would have been necessary to determine whether Thompson\u2019s testimony was merely duplicative, or whether the other testimony impeached or explained his testimony, rendering it harmless to Clairol. Our review of the record indicates that no such transcript was provided to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Although we do not have transcripts of testimony, we do know that Clairol produced an additional witness to refute the testimony of Thompson. Also, the panel, during the colloquy on the motion to strike, stated: \u201cWhatever relevancy or whatever [weight] the direct examination may have; it may be zero, it may be negative. That is the way we are going to approach it.\u201d The panel also stated that it would \u201ctake a very hard look at assigning the appropriate weight\u201d to Thompson\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>testimony, \u201cranging from no weight whatsoever to possibly negative weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We conclude that the trial court did not have before it an adequate record on which to determine that the lack of opportunity to cross-examine Thompson constituted a denial of a full and fair hearing. It is difficult to substantiate a deprivation of Clairol\u2019s right to a full and fair hearing when the panel itself has stated that the testimony of Thompson would have either no effect or a negative effect on Enertrac\u2019s position. Thus, in fact, the lack of the cross-examination appears to have benefited Clairol. The trial court, therefore, could not reasonably have found that the arbitration panel committed misconduct that deprived Clairol of a full and fair hearing. We, therefore, conclude that Clairol failed to meet its burden of proving that the decision of the arbitration panel violated \u00a7 52-418 or procedurally violated the parties\u2019 agreement. The decision of the arbitration panel is, therefore, not subject to further judicial review, and the presumption in favor of upholding the arbitration award must be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The record does not support the conclusion of the trial court that Clairol \u201cwas deprived of its absolute right of cross-examination, and a full and fair hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Our disposition of Enertrac\u2019s first issue concerning cross-examination makes it unnecessary to consider Enertrac\u2019s second issue concerning the trial court\u2019s failure to seek an articulation or explanation from the arbitration panel of its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying the plaintiffs application to vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-418 (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cUpon the applicalion of any party to an arbitration, the superior court for tire judicial district in which one of the parlies resides or, in a controversy concerning land, for the judicial district in which the land is situated, or when the court is not in session, any judge thereof, shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects . . . (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear- evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
