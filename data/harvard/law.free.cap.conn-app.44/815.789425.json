See <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 189, 640 A.2d 601 (1994); <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>38 Conn. App. 99, 659 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>195, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 920, 661 A.2d 100 (1995); see also <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">The habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s writ was predicated on a factual review of the petitioner\u2019s claim and a determination that the petitioner had failed to rebut the \u201c \u2018strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance . . . <em>Safford v. Warden, </em>223 Conn. 180, 193, 612 A.2d 1161 (1992). The habeas court found as a fact that the petitioner had asked trial counsel to abort the trial and to seek a plea agreement after the petitioner\u2019s alibi had been exposed as a fabrication. The habeas court also found that the petitioner was not credible in his assertion that had he pleaded guilty in the belief that the plea agreement precluded incarceration and the court properly found that the petitioner had suffered no prejudice from trial counsel's representation as to the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">We conclude that the habeas court had before it sufficient evidence to find as it did and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
