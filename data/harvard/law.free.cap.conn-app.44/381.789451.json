The defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) denied her motion as untimely and (2) abused its discretion in denying the motion on the ground that she had not demonstrated that she was prevented from presenting her defenses because of mistake, accident or other reasonable cause. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The following facts are relevant to this appeal. This matter arose from a dispute involving a security deposit. The plaintiff, Morton F. Reich, filed a two count complaint against the defendants Irma Langhorst and her son Axel Langhorst, seeking the return of a $1000 security deposit and accrued interest, plus punitive damages pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Thereafter, the defendant\u2019s son, who is not a licensed attorney in the state of Connecticut, attempted to file a pro se appearance on behalf of himself and his mother, as well as a joint pro se answer, special defenses and a counterclaim. The trial court granted the plaintiffs motion for default for failure to appear against the defendant Irma Langhorst.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The defendant concedes that she received notice of this default and, thereafter, filed a pro se appearance with the court listing the following as her address: \u201cc/o Eurotest Laboratories Ltd., Mathews Drive, P.O. Box 262, East Haddam, CT., 06423.\u201d The defendant did not, however, file any pleadings. On August 17, 1992, the plaintiff filed a motion for default against the defendant for failure to plead. This motion was improperly denied on August 18, 1992, on the basis of the mistaken belief that the defendant had a proper answer on file in the matter. On November 24,1992, the court, realizing that an error had been made, sent notice to the parties informing them: \u201cThe track having expired in this case, the following orders are entered: Defendant Irma Langhorst is defaulted for failure to plead. The case is ordered placed on the non-jury trial list for assignment at a later date. Per order of the court, <em>Arena, J., </em>11/24/92.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Notice was then sent to the parties informing them that trial was scheduled to be held before an attorney trial referee. The trial was in fact held. Although the defendant\u2019s son appeared at trial, the defendant did not attend.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">On September 29, 1994, the attorney referee\u2019s report was filed with the court. The report recommended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant on both the first and second counts of the plaintiffs complaint. It recommended that judgment be rendered, however, in favor of the defendant\u2019s son on the plaintiffs complaint. It also recommended that judgment be rendered for the plaintiff on the defendant\u2019s son\u2019s counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">By letter also filed on September 20, 1994, the attorney referee informed the trial court that copies of her report had been provided \u201cby way of U.S. mail to the plaintiff through his attorney and to the defendants at the address listed on their Appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">On October 11, 1994, the plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the attorney referee\u2019s report that appeared on the short calendar of October 24,1994. On that date, after reviewing the attorney referee\u2019s report on file, the trial court, <em>Stanley, J., </em>granted the motion (record entry number 121). On October 27, 1994, notice was sent to the parties advising that the plaintiffs motion for judgment on the attorney referee\u2019s report had been granted on October 24, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On November 8, 1994, the plaintiffs motion for judgment on the attorney referee\u2019s report again appeared on the short calendar. Judge Stanley noted on the report itself the following: \u201cApproved: Judgment per ATR Report. <em>Stanley, J., </em>11-8-94. See order at #121.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">On or about January 26, 1995, Attorney John A. Stichter filed an appearance in lieu of the pro se defendant and, on March 2, 1995, filed a motion to open the default judgment against her. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to open the judgment, finding that it lacked jurisdiction because the defendant filed her motion beyond the four month period permitted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 (a)1 **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 377.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court also determined that, even if the defendant had filed a timely motion to open, it would have been denied because she failed to show that she was prevented from making her defense to the plaintiffs action because of mistake, accident or other reasonable cause. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">We first address the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court incorrectly determined that it was without jurisdiction to act on her motion to open.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>A motion to open must be filed within four months of the date on which judgment was rendered. General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 (a); Practice Book \u00a7 377. We conclude on the record before us that judgment was rendered on October 24, 1994, the date on which the motion for judgment was granted. Notice of the judgment was sent on October 27,1994. Therefore, the defendant\u2019s motion to open, filed March 2, 1995, was not filed within four months of the judgment. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction in denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Practice Book \u00a7 442 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAfter the expiration of two weeks from the filing of the report . . . either party may . . . claim the case for the short calendar for judgment on the report . . . .\u201d \u201cThe court shall render such judgment as the law requires upon the facts in the report as it may be corrected. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The trial court may render judgment, as a matter of law, from the facts found by the attorney referee. <em>Burt\u2019s Spirit Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ridgway, </em>215 Conn. 355, 367, 576 A.2d 1267 (1990). Where the factual predicate is clearly set forth by proper factual findings and conclusions from those findings, the trial court should fulfill its function in rendering judgment. See <em>Dills </em>v. <em>Enfield, </em>210 Conn. 705, 712, 557 A.2d 517 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The record is clear that the trial court, on October 24,1994, granted the plaintiffs motion for judgment on the attorney referee\u2019s report that was docketed as entry number 121. No further action was required by the trial court. This same motion then came up on the short calendar on November 7. The trial court gratuitously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>noted, \u201cApproved: Judgment per ATR Report, <em>Stanley, J., </em>11/8/94. See order at #121.\u201d Because the defendant\u2019s motion to open, filed March 2, 1994, was filed more than four months after the date that judgment was rendered, the trial court was without jurisdiction to hear it and, therefore, properly denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-9\"> Axel Langhorst, who is not a parly to this appeal, was also a defendant. For purposes of this opinion, we will refer to Irma Langhorst as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b410-10\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 47a-21 (d) (2) provides: \u201cUpon termination of a tenancy, any tenant may notify his landlord in writing of such tenant\u2019s forwarding address.
