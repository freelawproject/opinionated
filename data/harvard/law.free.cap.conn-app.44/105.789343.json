The plaintiff, Joan M. Chavez, was initially found eligible for unemployment benefits by the administrator. An appeals referee affirmed the administrator\u2019s finding after conducting a trial de novo. The employer subsequently appealed the decision to the board. The board reversed the referee\u2019s decision and, in doing so, eliminated some of the referee\u2019s findings of fact and made its own additional factual findings. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court from the board\u2019s decision. After hearing, the trial court reversed the decision of the board and remanded the matter for further proceedings. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found that the board improperly substituted its judgment for that of the referee on credibility issues without taking additional evidence or testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">This case is controlled by <em>Calnan </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>43 Conn. App. 779, 686 A.2d 134 (1996).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Calnan, </em>we reversed the trial court and held that in order for a plaintiff to challenge the findings of the board of review properly on appeal, the plaintiff must file a motion to correct those findings.
