J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkV\">This is a sexual harassment case arising out of the plaintiffs employment with the defendants, Metal Products Corporation (Metal) and Birken Manufacturing Company (Birken). The third defendant, Sidney Greenberg, owns and operates both companies. The two corporations have common ownership, management and staff.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Deborah Malasky, the plaintiff, began working for Metal in November, 1987, as a certification and quality control clerk. She later worked for Birken. She alleges that, beginning in February, 1992, she was repeatedly subjected to sexual harassment by other employees and supervisors until she was compelled to leave her position on March 5, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">On May 7, 1993, the plaintiff, without the assistance of an attorney, filed a complaint, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the commission on human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>rights and opportunities (CHRO) against Metal and Birken, alleging that she had been sexually harassed, retaliated against and constructively discharged in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-58 (a),* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 46a-60 (a) (1), (4), and (8),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. On June 8, 1994, the plaintiff received a release of jurisdiction from the CHRO pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-101,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> permitting her to bring a civil action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>against Metal and Birken in Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-100.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">On October 28, 1994, the plaintiff filed an amended three count complaint against Metal, Birken and Greenberg individually, as owner and president of Metal and Birken. The first count alleges violations of the Connecticut Fair Employment Practices Act (CFEPA), General Statutes \u00a7 46a~51 et seq., by Metal and Birken only. The second and third counts allege intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent supervision by all three defendants. As relief, the plaintiff claimed back pay, future earnings, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">On January 16,1995, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint against Greenberg because the plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>against Greenberg, thereby ousting the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court granted this motion over the plaintiffs objection on June 7,1995. The plaintiff appealed to this court from the granting of the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly dismissed the action because (1) she did not fail to exhaust her administrative remedies as to Greenberg because he was expressly identified in her administrative complaint, (2) common law causes of action are not preempted by the administrative procedure, and (3) the administrative remedies available to her were inadequate.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The trial court, following the reasoning of <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Board of Police </em>Commissioners, 196 Conn. 208, 491 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>A.2d 1096 (1985), dismissed the action against Greenberg because the plaintiff had not exhausted her administrative remedies as to him. The <em>Sullivan </em>court had reasoned that, \u201c[r]ead in its entirety, the CFEPA not only defines important rights designed to rid the workplace of discrimination, but also vests first-order administrative oversight and enforcement of these rights in the CHRO. It is the CHRO that is charged by the act with initial responsibility for the investigation and adjudication of claims of employment discrimination. That the act does not provide an unconditional private right of action for claimants like the plaintiff is underscored by the terms of General Statutes \u00a7 46a-99, which expressly provides such a direct right of action when the allegedly discriminatory employer is a state agency. The plaintiff, having failed to follow the administrative route that the legislature has prescribed for his claim of discrimination, lacks the statutory authority to pursue that claim in the Superior Court.\u201d Id., 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">The trial court in the present case stated that \u201c[t]here is no unconditional private right of action under the CFEPA. ... A party must follow the administrative route established by the legislature and failure to do so results in a lack of statutory authority to pursue such a claim in Superior Court. . . . The plaintiff never obtained a release to sue from the CHRO pertaining to Greenberg. The plaintiffs failure to follow the prescribed administrative route enunciated in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46a-100 through 46a-104 as to Greenberg results in this court\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint as to Greenberg is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 143 governs motions to dismiss.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cA motion to dismiss admits all facts well pleaded and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>invokes any record that accompanies the motion, including supporting affidavits that contain undisputed facts.\u201d <em>Herzog Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>41 Conn. App. 790, 793, 677 A.2d 1378, cert. granted on other grounds, 239 Conn. 907, 682 A.2d 998 (1996). \u201cA ruling on a motion to dismiss is neither a ruling on the merits of the action . . . nor a test of whether the complaint states a cause of action. . . . Motions to dismiss are granted solely on jurisdictional grounds.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Discover Leasing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>33 Conn. App. 303, 306-307, 635 A.2d 843 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The Superior Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction in a matter if an adequate administrative remedy exists, and it has not been exhausted. <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Ervin, </em>234 Conn. 498, 503, 661 A.2d 1018 (1995); <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 358-59,377 A.2d 1099 (1977). The defendants argue that an adequate administrative remedy does exist against Greenberg and that the plaintiff did not exhaust that remedy because Greenberg was not named as a defendant in her complaint to the CHRO. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">It is not necessary for the purposes of this appeal to determine whether the plaintiffs complaint has stated a common law cause of action against Greenberg or whether, because her administrative remedy against Greenberg was inadequate, she can pursue other remedies in the trial court. Those determinations are not necessary because we conclude that the plaintiff did exhaust her administrative remedies against Greenberg, and, therefore, the court had subject matter jurisdiction. Our conclusion is based on the reasoning of <em>Maturo </em>v. <em>National Graphics, Inc., </em>722 F. Sup. 916 (D. Conn. 1989), which has a similar factual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The <em>Maturo </em>plaintiff had filed a complaint with the CHRO and the federal Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) alleging sexual harassment. At the time she made the complaint, the plaintiff was not represented by counsel, but a CHRO staff member helped her to draw up the CHRO complaint. The complaint listed only the employer company and the company\u2019s president as respondents. After the plaintiff obtained a notice of the right to sue from the EEOC, she filed suit in District Court, adding as defendants the employee supervisor who had allegedly harassed her and another supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u201cGenerally, an action under Title VII can proceed only against those individuals named as respondents in the complaint filed with the EEOC. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (f) (1). The purpose of this exhaustion requirement is to provide notice to those alleged to have committed the violations and to provide an opportunity for the parties to comply voluntarily with the requirements of Title VII. ... A limited exception to the exhaustion requirement permits an action against a party not named as a respondent in the EEOC complaint if the underlying dual purposes of the exhaustion requirement are otherwise satisfied. . . . Specifically, the factors to be considered under this exception are \u20181) whether the role of the unnamed party could through reasonable effort by the complainant be ascertained at the time of the filing of the EEOC complaint; 2) whether, under the circumstances, the interests of a named [party] are so similar as the unnamed party\u2019s that for the purpose of obtaining voluntary conciliation and compliance it would be unnecessary to include the unnamed party in the EEOC proceedings; 3) whether its absence from the EEOC proceedings resulted in actual prejudice to the interests of the unnamed party; 4) whether the unnamed party has in some way represented to the complainant that its relationship with the complainant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>is to be through the named party.\u2019 <em>[Garcia </em>v. <em>Gardner\u2019s Nurseries, Inc., </em>585 F. Sup. 369, 372 (D. Conn. 1984)].\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Maturo </em>v. <em>National Graphics, Inc., </em>supra, 722 F. Sup. 924-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The <em>Maturo </em>court found that the plaintiffs complaint filed with the CHRO and the EEOC satisfied those requirements. Each of the individual defendants had actual notice of the complaint, and the CHRO complaint had identified by name the employee who had allegedly harassed the plaintiff. Thus, neither previously omitted defendant had suffered any prejudice from the lack of formal notice. In addition, for purposes of voluntary conciliation, the interests of the supervisors were substantially identical to those of the company and its president. Further, the allegedly harassing supervisor had represented to the plaintiff that he had the authority to affect her relationship with the company. Finally, the court considered the fact that the plaintiff had not been represented by counsel at the time she filed the administrative complaints and, instead, relied on the advice of a CHRO employee. Considering all of these factors, the court concluded that \u201cthe underlying purposes of providing notice and encouraging conciliation were satisfied and [the] plaintiff should not be barred from proceeding because of a technical failure in the filing of her CHRO and EEOC complaints.\u201d Id., 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Although the court in <em>Maturo </em>was concerned primarily with EEOC filing requirements, the same rationale applies to the requirements of the CHRO. We conclude that the defendant Greenberg had sufficient notice of the plaintiffs complaint filed with the CHRO. Paragraphs eight and nine of her complaint state: \u201c8. On February 24, 1993,1 spoke to Mr. Greenberg about the sexual harassment I was being subjected to by Mr. O\u2019Dell and Mr. Burke. Mr. Greenberg did not discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Mr. O\u2019Dell or Mr. Burke in any way, and the harassment did not stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u201c9. On or about March 5, 1993, I told Mimi that I could no longer work under those conditions. I again spoke to Mr. Greenberg, he apologized for the treatment I was getting from Mr. O\u2019Dell and Mr. Burke. Mr. Greenberg offered to give me a pink slip stating that I was being laid off due to lack of work, and I accepted the offer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Reading the allegations of the CHRO filing in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, we identify the \u201cMr. Greenberg\u201d named by the plaintiff in her CHRO complaint as being the Sidney Greenberg named as a defendant in her court complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">In his position as \u201cowner\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and president of the companies involved, Greenberg certainly had notice of the CHRO complaint. Because the plaintiffs CHRO complaint specifically stated which acts performed or not performed by Greenberg that the plaintiff considered to have harmed her, there can be no prejudice as to him. In addition, Greenberg\u2019s interests as president and owner of the companies and the interests of the two companies themselves are nearly identical for purposes of voluntary conciliation and compliance. See <em>Busconi </em>v. <em>Dighello, </em>39 Conn. App. 753, 766, 668 A.2d 716 (1995), cert. denied, 236 Conn. 903, 670 A.2d 321 (1996) (\u201ccorporation and those who control it are one entity and the acts of one are the acts of all\u201d). Further, Greenberg\u2019s action of offering the plaintiff a pink slip represented to the plaintiff that he could control her relationship with the company. Finally, as did the <em>Maturo </em>court, we consider the fact that the plaintiff was not represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>by counsel at the time she filed the complaint with the CHRO.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Considering the entire situation, we conclude that the underlying purposes of providing notice to Greenberg were satisfied in the plaintiffs filing with the CHRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Greenberg claims that he was prejudiced because the CHRO complaint did not name him as a respondent, which, he argues, deprived him of an opportunity to resolve informally the plaintiffs claims against him. We do not agree. Any investigation performed by the CHRO would, of necessity, have included him. The complaint against the corporate entities could not have been resolved without involving Greenberg. When the CHRO lost jurisdiction of the business entities, it, in effect, lost jurisdiction over Greenberg individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Greenberg also argues that the plaintiff cannot satisfy the first criteria of the <em>Maturo </em>test because she could easily have determined his role as an unnamed party, and, in fact, she had determined his role. Although Greenberg was not named in the title of the CHRO complaint, he was named in its text. Thus, the plaintiff had ascertained the part he played in her allegations and did name him.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The plaintiff exhausted her administrative remedies as to Greenberg, and her complaint as to him should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82 (a) provides: \u201cAny person claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged discriminatory practice, except for an alleged violation of section 46a-68, may, by himself or his attorney, make, sign and file with the commission a complaint in writing under oath, which shall state the name and address of the person alleged to have committed the discriminatory pract ice. and which shall set forth the particulars thereof and contain such other information as may be required by the commission.
