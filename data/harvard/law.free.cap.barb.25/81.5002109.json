In case the daughters should marry, he declared that payment to them, on their receipt, without the signature or consent of their husbands, should be sufficient. In case of any sale of his real estate, the testator directed his executors to put out and invest the daughters\u2019 shares of the proceeds either on bond and mortgage, or in the purchase of other real estate.

Gerardus Post, late of the city of New York, died October 22, 1833, leaving him surviving his only children and heirs at law, Gerardus Post, William Post, Jehiel J. Post, Susan Post, and Mary Jaggar Post. Susan, on the 25th of November, 1841, intermarried with Edward W. Leggett, and has issue of such marriage; and Mary J., on the 3d of November, 1847, intermarried with William T. Barber and has issue. The decedent left a last will and testament, dated October 12, 1833, and admitted to probate as a will of real and personal estate, on the 18th of November, 1833. By the third clause of said will the testator gave and devised to each of his three sons, as they should severally arrive at the age of twenty-five years, the one equal fifth part of all the rest and residue of his estate, and to his two daughters, Susan and Mary J., the remaining two-fifths of his estate, so that each might have and enjoy the interest or income of the one equal fifth part thereof, during their several natural lives; and at their death, respectively, he willed the share of each to their respective lawful issue, their heirs and assigns forever. The will also contained the following provisions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">\u201c <em>Item. </em>I hereby appoint my executors, hereinafter named, trustees to the estate of my two daughters, hereby authorizing and desiring my executors as such trustees, to take charge of all such portion of my estate as is herein given to them respectively, and to take care of, manage and improve the same to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>best advantage, and to pay over to them respectively, from time to time, the rents, interest or net income thereof. And in case of the marriage of both, or either of them, it shall be sufficient in making such payments, from time to time, to take the receipt of my said daughters respectively, without the signature or consent of their respective husbands, and in the same manner and with like effect as if they were sole and unmarried. And in case of any sale or sales of my real estate, or any part thereof, I direct my executors to put out and invest their share respectively of the proceeds, and to secure the same by a bond and mortgage on such real estate as they shall judge ample and sufficient for its permanent safety and security; or they may, in the exercise of their discretion, and in the execution of the trust aforesaid, invest the said proceeds, or some part thereof, in the purchase of real estate for the use and benefit of my said daughters, or either of them. And afterwards, in the execution of the trust aforesaid, may, at any time, if they think best, sell the same or any real estate so purchased, with the allowance of the court of chancery first had and obtained for that purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-5\"><em>Item. </em>I hereby authorize and fully empower my executors to sell and dispose of all and any part of my estate, both real and personal, either at public or private sale, and at such times and in such manner, and for such sum or sums as to them, in the exercise of their best judgment, may seem most expedient, excepting only my wearing apparel and household furniture hereinbefore mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-6\">The testator appointed Jehiel Jaggar, Caleb S. Woodhull and Edward Taylor, executors of his will and guardians of his children during their minority respectively, thereby fully authorizing, and earnestly entreating and desiring them to execute and fulfill the same in all things, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b83-7\">On December 23d, 1833, letters testamentary were issued by the surrogate of New York to Caleb S. Woodhull, who a.cted as sole executor and trustee under said will until the time hereinafter set forth ; the other persons named in said will having in due form of law renounced their appointment as executors, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>declined to act as such, a,nd they are since deceased. Said Gerardus Post died seised and possessed, as tenant in common with his brother, William Post, of an estate in fee simple in and to a large real estate, situated in the city and county of New York and in the county of Kings. The real estate situated in New York was partitioned and set apart among the children of said Gerardus Post by the supreme court, in an action brought therein for that purpose, in the year 1839. The real estate owned by the said Gerardus Post in the county of Kings, at the time of his decease, consisted of an undivided moiety of a farm of land situated in the city of Brooklyn, and known as the \u201c Post farm.\u201d The said Caleb S. Woodhull, as executor of said Gerardus Post, by deed dated March 1st, 1837, and executed by him as executor as aforesaid, sold and conveyed the undivided moiety of said farm to one Robert F. Manly, in consideration of $150,000. Manly executed and delivered to said Woodhull, as executor, a bond conditioned to pay the sum of $150,000, being the full consideration for said purchase, and for the purpose of securing the same, executed to said Woodhull, as executor, a mortgage upon the premises conveyed by said Woodhull. The bond of Manly not being paid when it became due, Woodhull, as executor, on March 28th, 1844, filed a bill against said Manly and others in the late court of chancery, before the vice chancellor of the first circuit, for the foreclosure of said mortgage, and on May 28th, 1844, a decree of foreclosure and sale was made and entered, in pursuance of which the mortgaged premises, with the exception of certain portions thereof which had been released from said mortgage, were sold by P. T. Buggies, master in chancery, and the same were purchased by said Woodhull, as executor as aforesaid. The master\u2019s deed from Buggies to Woodhull is dated October 16 th, 1844. Woodhull, as such executor, after-wards, by deed dated July 27th, 1847, conveyed the one undivided tenth part of the said premises conveyed to him by P. T. Buggies, to William Post, who was a son of the said Gerardus Post, deceased; the said one-tenth part being the share of said William Post under the will of his said father, Gerardus, and the said William then having arrived at the age of twenty-five years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>as required by said will. On July 31st, 1847, the said William Post commenced an action in the supreme court in equity against the other children and heirs at law of the said Gerardus Post, and the children and heirs at law of William Post the elder, for the partition of the entire farm, excepting the portions released and conveyed as aforesaid; and a decree for the actual partition of said premises by commissioners appointed for that purpose Was made and entered in said action on July 6th, 1848. The commissioners caused the said premises to be surveyed, and a map thereof to be made and certified by them, on July 17th, 1848, and filed the same in the register\u2019s office of Kings county; and in pursuance of said decretal order, made partition of the premises among the parties interested, and the report of said commissioners was, by a decretal order, made and entered in said action on July 17th, 1848, in all things confirmed. It appears that, in and by the report of the commissioners, and by the decretal order above mentioned, and by a decretal order entered in said action on September 3d, 1851, there was allotted and set apart unto the said Susan, wife of Edward W. Leggett, and to her children, Edward W. Leggett, jun., Catherine Maria Leggett, Frederic Augustus Leggett, Julia Briant Leggett, and George Leggett, as their part and share of said premises, the lots, pieces and parcels of land therein described and designated by certain numbers; \u201c to have and to hold unto them and to such child or children of the said Susan P. Leggett as might thereafter be born, such estate therein as they then had, or might be entitled to, under the will of the said Gerardus Post, and subject to the estate and interest therein of William H. Leggett, trustee under said will,\u201d who had been substituted as such trustee as hereafter stated. There was also by said report and decretal orders above mentioned, allotted and set apart to the said Mary Jaggar, wife of William T. Barber, and her children William T. Barber, jun. and Josephine King Barber, as their part and share of said premises, certain other lots, pieces or parcels of land, known and designated by certain numbers, \u201c to have and to hold the same unto them, and to such child or children of the said Mary Jaggar Barber, as might thereafter be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>born, such estate therein as they then had or might be- entitled to under the said will of Gerardus Post, and subject to the trusts created thereby, and to the estate and interest therein of William H. Leggett, trustee under said will,\u201d who had been substituted as such trustee, as hereafter stated. During the pend-ency of said partition suit, an action was commenced in the supreme court by said Caleb S. Woodhull, plaintiff, against said Susan P. Leggett, and her husband Edward W. Leggett, and the said Mary Jaggar Barber, and her husband William T. Barber, together with all the children of said Susan Post Leggett, and Mary J. Barber, defendants, in which a judgment order was made and entered on March 30th, 1850, substituting William H. Leggett as trustee, under the will of said Gerardus Post, in the place and stead of said Caleb S. Woodhull. William H. Leggett accepted the trust, and since his substitution has acted as such trustee; and in pursuance of said judgment the said Caleb S. Woodhull, on April 30th, 1850, executed an instrument under seal, transferring all the trust property to said William H. Leggett.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">On the 16th day of December, 1851, the said Caleb S. Woodhull rendered his accounts as executor of said Gerardus Post, to the surrogate of the city and county of New York, and his accounts, as such executor, were -settled, and his executorship closed by decree of the surrogate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">On June 21,1853, the legislature of the state of New York passed an act entitled \u201c An act relative to lands held in trust by William H.

It was also declared that the court should, in respect to such sale or sales, authorize and direct the same to be by auction, on such terms as the court might prescribe, or should ascertain by the report of a referee or otherwise, upon what terms the premises could be sold at any private sale, and might direct the premises to be so sold. Such sale was to be reported to the court, and on confirmation thereof, the court should direct a conveyance or conveyances of the same to be executed accordingly by the said Edward W. Leggett and Susan P. his wife, and by the guardian or guardians acting in behalf of the descendants of said Susan, in the premises. The proceeds of such sale or sales might, under the direction of the court, be applied by the said trustee to the payment of any debts incurred by him as such trustee for the benefit of the aforesaid trust property, and in fulfilling the trusts declared or created in and by said will, and to the payment of all incumbrances, taxes and assessments due or to become due on said trust property ; or the same might be invested in bonds and mortgages, or in repairing and improving the other real estate of the said Susan Post Leggett, and her descendants, also derived by and under said will forth e benefit of such persons as might become interested therein under the provisions of said will. And it was declared and provided that all such conveyances made as aforesaid, in pursuance of such authority and direction, if executed by the said William H.

The object of the legislature was to authorize a change of the property from real into personal estate, for purposes beneficial to the parties interested therein. The title of those parties is in no manner impaired, nor are they deprived of any rights. The proceeds of the sales are to be applied, so much thereof as is necessary, to the discharge of charges and incumbrances, and the residue in the same manner as was directed by the will of the testator in relation to the real estate. <em>(See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1 <em>and </em>3 <em>of those acts.) </em>The power of the legislature to convert real into personal estate is unquestionable. It is analogous to the power exercised by the British parliament, on similar subjects, time out-of mind. <em>(See </em>2 <em>Black. Com. ch. </em>21, <em>p. </em>354, <em>and note </em>2, <em>by Chitty, at p. </em>255 <em>of his edition.) </em>And it has been constantly exercised in this state. The acts authorizing the sale of the real estate of infants, drunkards, lunatics, and persons of unsound mind, and all acts of a similar nature, derive their force from the exercise of that power. So also does the act in relation to the partition of real estate, so far as it authorizes a <em>sale </em>instead of an actual <em>partition </em>against the will of the parties, by virtue of which, rights <em>contingent </em>as well as vested are conveyed and pass to the purchaser. (1.) The validity of acts similar to those under consideration, but much less free from exception, has been sanctioned by our courts. <em>(See Clarke </em>v. <em>Van Surlay, </em>15 <em>Wend. </em>442; <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Van Surlay, </em>20 <em>id. </em>365; <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Barry, </em>8 <em>How. </em>494, <em>&amp;c.) </em>It is true that the sales under the acts referred to in the last case were held void, contrary to the decision in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Van Surlay, </em>and <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Van Surlay, </em>above cited; but the decision was placed on the ground that they were not made in compliance with the requirements of those acts. The constitutionality of the acts themselves was not questioned ; on the contrary, the circuit court of the southern district of Hew York, from whom the cause was carried to the supreme court, on a certificate of division of opinion</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>between the judges on certain points, expressly adjudged as the 4th point decided by them, that \u201c the acts of the legislature of the state of New York, of April 1, 1814 ; March 24.1815; and March 29, 1816, referred to in the case, are constitutional and valid.\u201d See judgment of the circuit court, at pages 509 and 510, of the case. See also in support of the principle, <em>Wilkinson v. Leland, </em>(2 Peters, 660, <em>&amp;c. ;) Watkins </em>v. <em>Hol</em>man, (16 <em>Peters, </em>59, <em>&amp;c. </em>;) <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Parkman, </em>(16 <em>Mass. R. </em>326 ;) <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lorillard, </em>(4 <em>Comst. </em>267.) In the last case the power of the legislature to change real into personal estate, is ably discussed, and particular attention is called to it. (3.) The case of <em>Powers and Wyckoff </em>v. <em>Bergen, </em>(2 <em>Selden, </em>358,) is not in conflict with the preceding positions. It is distinguishable from the present case in several points, deemed material by the court, and especially in the following particulars. 1st. The statutes under which the sale in that case was made, authorized the trustees to sell without any adjudication by any court, as to the necessity or propriety of a sale ; and according to the construction of the court, nothing appeared on the face of those statutes, or by the case, showing what facts existed to induce the legislature to enact them. 2d. It did not appear from the facts as stated in the opinion of the court, that any incapacity existed, by reason of infancy or otherwise, disqualifying the remaindermen from disposing of the estate in the lands themselves; and that evidently had a controlling influence in their decision. They say, \u201c Conceding that it is within the power of the legislature, in acting as the guardian and protector of those who are disabled to act for themselves by reason of infancy, lunacy, or other like causes, constitutionally to pass general or private laws, under which an effectual disposition of their lands, and other property may be made, <em>in order to promote their interests, </em>it does not follow that it has such power of disposition over the property and effects of others not thus incapacitated.\u201d These objections are obviated in the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">III. All the requirements of the acts under which the sales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>in question were made, have been fully complied with, and no objection is made to the title on the ground of irregularity in the proceedings, or for want of conformity to those requirements. It is established by the proofs in those proceedings, and adjudged by the court, that a sale of the premises in question was expedient, and calculated to promote the interests of all parties to be affected by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-5\">IV. William H. Leggett as the substituted trustee, under the will of Grerardus Post, deceased, had power under the provisions of that will, with the consent of the court, to sell and convey the property in question, irrespective of the acts of the legislature above referred to. Caleb S. Woodhull, the only executor who qualified, made a sale of the testator\u2019s interest in the farm of which the premises in question are part, and received back a bond and mortgage for the purchase money. That mortgage was foreclosed, and the mortgaged premises were purchased at the sale thereof, by the said Caleb S. Woodhull as executor as aforesaid. He subsequently conveyed one tenth part thereof to William Post, a son of the testator, who afterwards commenced proceedings in partition, and the lots in question were allotted to Mrs. Leggett and Mrs. Barber, and their respective descendants, subject to the estate'and interest therein of William H. Leggett, trustee under said will, who had been substituted as such during the progress of the partition suit, and to whom the said Caleb S. Woodhull had conveyed all the trust property in his possession, subject to his control, or in which he had an interest in trust, for the purposes mentioned in said will. (2 <em>Kernan, </em>294. 2 <em>Gomst. </em>297.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-6\">V. The deed tendered to the defendants was, therefore, sufficient to vest a good and perfect title in them. It was not only executed in compliance with the provisions of those acts, but also with the will of Grerardus Post.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b96-7\">VI. Judgment should, therefore, be given that the defendants pay the moneys which were required by the terms of sale to be paid, with interest from the time of the tender of the deed, and that they, in other respects, specifically perform the said agreement.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number><em>J. M. Greenwood, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeL\">I. The plaintiff as trustee, could derive no power of sale under the will of the testator. The powers and trusts were conferred on three executors and trustees, naming them. The supreme court had no power to clothe Leggett with the powers conferred by the will on the executors, as sought to be done in their orders; for the trusts could only be executed by those on whom they were conferred, and they must all join. <em>(Sinclair </em>v. Jackson, 8 Cowen, 583. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>6 <em>John. </em>39.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-5\">II. There was a contingent remainder created by the will, and existing during the lives of Susan and Mary Jaggar. (2 <em>R. S. </em>132, <em>4th ed.) </em>It was not a vested remainder, unless subject to be varied and defeated, and to let in after-born children. And children not in being at the time of the sale, were not, and could not be, affected by it, <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Lorillard, 4 Comst. </em>257. <em>See Bronson\u2019s opinion. Powers &amp; Wyckoff v. Bergen, </em>2 <em>Seld. </em>358.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-6\">III. To authorize the court of chancery to make a sale, the infants must be seised of the property. Its only jurisdiction is derived from the statute. <em>(Laws </em>c/1814, <em>p. </em>128, \u00a7 1. 2 <em>R. S. </em>359. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lorillard, 4 Comst. </em>257.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-7\">IV. The recited acts of the legislature were unconstitutional and void. The will was valid under the general laws of the state, when made and <em>proved; </em>and no after legislation can alter or destroy its intent. The legislature could not divest the title, or the contingent interests of persons not then in being. <em>(Cochran </em>v. <em>Van Surlay, </em>20 <em>Wend. </em>375. <em>See opinion of Chancellor. Powers </em>v. <em>Bergen, </em>2 <em>Selden, </em>358.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-8\">V. It could not be sold under the statute authorizing a sale of infants\u2019 estate for taxes and assessments, for they are alleged to be paid, in one suit,</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-9\">VI. The premises should have been sold in the county of Kings, where the premises are all situate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b97-10\">VII. The title tendered to the defendants is defective, and they were not obliged to accept the same.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b97-11\"><em>By the Court, </em>S. B. Strong, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYx\">The deeds in these cases were executed by the acting (and alleged to be the legitimate) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>trustee; the person entitled to receive and use, the income, or rents 'and profits, of the land intended to be conveyed during her life, and her husband; and the special guardian of their present children who were at the time seised of, or entitled to, the remainder. No objection has been raised to the form of the deeds, or to the mode of the antecedent proceedings, so that the grantees would confessedly take whatever estate it was in the power of the grantees, any or either of them, to convey. If that was a fee simple absolute, then the defendants must take their deeds and complete their several purchases ; otherwise not.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">It was decided by the court of appeals, in <em>Leggett </em>v. <em>Per</em>kins,, (2 <em>Comst. </em>297,) that the devises in the will of Gerardus Post to, or in favor of, his daughters, Mrs. Leggett and Mrs. Barber, during their respective lives, were valid, and vested the legal estate in the trustees. The objection to the devises was that the trustees were directed to pay over to (and not, in the words of the revised statutes, apply to the use of,) the daughters the rents, interest or net income of the lands devised, or subsequently to be purchased ; and it ivas also supposed that as there was no direct, devise of the real estate to the trustees they did not take the legal fee. The court decided that there was no substantial difference between the direction to pay over the income, and the statutory requisition to apply it, and that the authority to the trustees to receive and pay over the rents or net income gave to them, by implication, the legal estate, within the principle established in the case of <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Striker, </em>(2 <em>Comst. </em>19.) I was a member of that court when <em>Leggett </em>v. <em>Perkins </em>was decided, and concurred with Judges Bronson and \u2022Jewett, against the opinion of the majority. And I have entertained serious doubts as to the accuracy of the decision in <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Striker. </em>There are no very cogent reasons, however, (such as were alluded to by Judge Harris in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lorillard, </em>4 <em>Comst. </em>261,) for overruling those decisions in the court where they were rendered, and they must be considered\u2014 especially by inferior tribunals\u2014as the settled law.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">It was contended by the counsel for the defendants that the power to sell the testator\u2019s lands was given to the executors, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>that capacity, and not as general trustees, and that therefore it could not be transferred to another by an order of a court of equity. It is true that when executors take a power to sell real estate, in order that the proceeds may be appropriated by them in the discharge of the duties ordinarily devolved upon them, such as to pay debts, or to make any appropriation in such a manner that the proceeds might be considered as assets, there might be an incongruity in the substitution of others by a tribunal not intrusted with jurisdiction over the settlement of the estates of deceased persons. But in this instance, the testator, in another clause of his will, appoints the persons whom he makes executors, \u201c trustees to the estates\u201d of his two daughters, and authorizes them to take care of, manage and improve the same, and to pay over to the daughters the net residue thereof; and he directs the executors, after the primary sale of his real estate, to put out and invest the shares of the proceeds belonging to his daughters, with authority in the execution of their trust, to invest such proceeds, or some part thereof, in the purchase of real estate for the use and benefit of his daughters ; and in further execution of their trust, to sell the same, or any such estate so purchased, with the allowance of the court of chancery first had and obtained for that purpose. These powers are conferred, and the implied estate devolved, upon the donees, not as executors but as ordinary trustees, such as are designated in our statutes relative to uses and trusts. The allusion to them as executors is merely a convenient way of designating the persons, and is not designed to mark the capacity in which they are to take. Besides, the provision that the sales of the real estate of the daughters must be allowed by a court of equity, is a clear indication that they are not to act in a capacity which might subject them to the jurisdiction of a different tribunal. I have admitted, in effect, that a court of equity cannot substitute new executors, as such, for those named by the testator. But when their duties as executors have terminated, and they have become simply trustees, it seems to me that the power conferred by the revised statutes, (1 <em>R. S. </em>730, \u00a7\u00a7 69, 71,) upon courts of equity, to compel the resignation of a trustee, and to appoint another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>in his place, is applicable and may be exercised. The statute (\u00a7 69) uses the terms K any trustee,\u201d and the expressions are broad enough to include all who are intrusted with the management \u25a0 of real estate in 'that capacity. The provisions of the sections which I have quoted are also made applicable to the grantees of powers in trust. (I 102.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In the case under consideration the sole acting, and so far as is indicated by the papers, the then sole surviving, trustee (Mayor Woodhull) resigned his office, and his resignation was accepted by this court, and the plaintiff, William H. Leggett, was appointed in his place, and of course with the same powers. The proceedings, it is true, were not very formal, but they were substantially effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The lands in question had been confessedly legally sold by Woodhull, under the general power given in the ninth clause of the will, \u201c to sell the testator\u2019s estate.\u201d He had secured the purchase money by a mortgage on the real estate sold, pursuant to a direction in the fifth clause, and had, Under the same clause, subsequently purchased such real estate, in part for the benefit of the testator\u2019s daughters, There had not been any division of the proceeds when the real estate was originally sold, nor was the subsequent purchase solely for the daughters,\"but there was afterwards a partition between the testator\u2019s children, to which the acting trustee was a party. And after that, and until his resignation, he held the lands in question as their shares, and as I consider, under the fifth clause of the will. If so, he, before such resignation, and the plaintiff William H. Leggett afterwards, had the power to sell such lands, with the approbation of this court. The sales were made by such substituted trustee with the required approbation j and it seems to me that a deed from him alone would have conveyed a good title to the land. If so, the facts that it had been sanctioned by an act of the legislature, and that others had joined with him in the conveyance, would not, surely, vitiate or impair the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">If the conveyances by the ladies entitled to the income of the lands in question, and their husbands, would be simply or at all conveyances of their income, and without express legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>sanction, they would have been void under the 63d section of the revised statutes relative to uses and trusts. But it was competent for the legislature to relieve them from such restriction, at any rate where there was no invasion of the vested rights of others; and that was done by the act entitled \u201c An act relative to the lands held in trust by William H. Leggett for the benefit of Susan Post Legett and her descendants,\u201d and a similar act relative to the lands held for Mrs. Barber, and her descendants, passed June 21, 1853. In the 4th section it was provided, expressly, that conveyances under it, executed by-the trustee, by the ladies and their husbands, and by the special guardian of their infant children, should vest in the purchasers a fee simple absolute against all persons having any claim to, or interest in, the premises, under the will of Gerardus Post. That of course sanctioned the proposed conveyances by Mrs. Post and Mrs. Barber and their husbands, if any such conveyances were necessary to complete the title of the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Then as to the children of Mrs. Post and Mrs. Barber. As those in esse were minors, the legislature had confessedly the power to authorize the conversion of their real estate into personal property, if satisfied, (as it no doubt was,) that such change would be for their benefit. Those children were, at the time when the act was passed, seised of the entire remainder. That remainder, it is true, was subject to open in favor of after-born children of their mothers, but as to those children there was not, of course, any vested interest. All that could be claimed in their behalf was that they should receive their portion of the proceeds, and of that they would not be deprived by the act, or the procedure under it. I am inclined to agree with Judge Harris, who gave the leading opinion in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Lorillard, </em>(4 <em>Comst. </em>266, 267,) that children in being who have a vested remainder in fee subject to open to let in after born children of the same parent, may be regarded as holding the legal estate not only for their own benefit but as trustees of such after-born children; and that a sale may carry the interest of the after-born children as well as of those in being at the time. Especially is this true if the sale is expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>sanctioned by an act of the legislature providing in effect that it must be made manifest to the court ordering and confirming the sale, that it would be expedient, and calculated to promote the interests of the children, whether then in being or not, and that a conveyance under the act would carry the fee against the after-born, as well as the existing, children. \u201e Under this legislation, no injustice can be done to the after-born children, if any there should be; and I cannot see why the proceedings under it will not pass their contingent estate. Uo question was made in this case but that the special guardian of the existing children was duly appointed; and there can be no doubt but that a conveyance to which he is a party will effectually pass their estate, if indeed that would not pass by a deed from the trustee.</p>\n<court id=\"b102-7\">[Orange General Term,</court>\n<decisiondate id=\"AYp\">July 14, 1857.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">As the defendants would, in my opinion, acquire a valid title to the premises purchased by them, under the proposed conveyances, they should be required to complete their respective purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">ifo costs should be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"Al\"><em>S.
