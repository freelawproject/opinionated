Keelan argues the district court erred in ordering restitution because (1) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b); (2) the victim did not suffer a bodily injury; (3) a victim cannot recover mental health treatment expenses for a physical injury; and (4) Keelan\u2019s criminal offense did not proximately cause the victim\u2019s treatment expenses. Upon review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">In the fall of 2009, J.S. started his sophomore year in high school at the Hebrew Academy in Miami Beach, Florida. Kee-lan was J.S.\u2019s English teacher at the academy. J.S. was 15 years old, and Keelan was 51..</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>During adolescence, J.S. struggled to cope with several identity issues. As an Hispanic child born in Paraguay but adopted by Caucasian parents, J.S. worried about his place in America\u2019s racial fabric. Though his family devoutly practiced Orthodox Judaism, J.S. questioned his own religious convictions. J.S. also carried the extra burden of negotiating his sexual attraction toward men. To blunt his emotional pain, J.S. began cutting himself \u2014 first at home and eventually during school hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Acting on a rumor circulating through the school, Keelan confronted J.S. after class about his cutting. Keelan offered words of comfort and encouraged J.S. to call or text him whenever he felt the urge to cut. At Keelan\u2019s suggestion, they began meeting each other during the school lunch hour to play chess in Keelan\u2019s classroom and discuss J.S.\u2019s emerging identity issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">One night Keelan texted J.S.' and revealed he was at a gay bar on South Beach. J.S. told Keelan he believed he was gay. After this exchange, Keelan and J.S. began texting and talking each day for several hours, and Keelan began inserting sexual innuendo into their conversations. Keelan eventually asked J.S. if he wanted to have sex with him, and J.S. said yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">At trial, Dr. Terri Patterson, an expert in child exploitation offenses, testified Kee-lan\u2019s interactions with J.S. were part of the \u201cgrooming process\u201d typically employed by child predators. The six phases of grooming \u2014 identification, connection, information gathering, need fulfillment, sexual inhibition reduction, and preservation \u2014 were intended to establish Keelan\u2019s psychological control over J.S. Based on her review of the evidence, Dr. Patterson opined Keelan groomed J.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">On February 14, 2010, Keelan picked up J.S. near the academy and drove J.S. to Keelan\u2019s apartment where they performed oral sex. They continued to regularly have oral and anal sex at Keelan\u2019s apartment after J.S. transferred to another high school. Upon Keelan\u2019s suggestion, they integrated sex toys, bondage, pornography, and sadomasochism into the relationship. Keelan blindfolded, tied, spanked, and whipped J.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Fearing others would discover this illicit sexual relationship, Keelan gave J.S. a burner cellphone. Keelan also taught J.S. to begin and end their written conversations with code words and expressions. Using this code, Keelan sought to ensure he was actually texting and emailing J.S., not a parent or law enforcement official.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">During J.S.\u2019s junior year of high school, Keelan moved to Virginia to take a new teaching job. Despite the long distance, Keelan selected, reserved, and paid for a room in a Hollywood, Florida hotel where he and J.S. had sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">For reasons unknown to J.S., his parents began to suspect he was in an inappropriate relationship with Keelan. During his senior year of high school, J.S.\u2019s parents enrolled him at a wilderness camp in Georgia and a residential treatment center in Texas. J.S. could not communicate with Keelan during this time. When Kee-lan returned to Florida, J.S. decided he want\u00e9d to cooperate with law enforcement officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">A few months before his 18th birthday, J.S. made wiretapped phone calls to Kee-lan. Keelan revealed he kept one of J.S.\u2019s old vocabulary tests in which J.S. scored a perfect 20 out of 20. Keelan kissed it-\u201cevery day\u201d and kept it as a talisman of J.S. During one call, Keelan admitted he was masturbating to the sound of J.S.\u2019s voice and said he loved the way J.S. performed oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>On June 1, 2012, Keelan and J.S. agreed to meet at the Hollywood Gateway Inn at Hollywood, Florida. Keelan reserved a room for seven nights with two adults and one king-sized bed. On June 15, 2012, Keelan began driving from Virginia to South Florida. On June 16, 2012, law enforcement officers surveilled Keelan stopping at the Lion\u2019s Den in Fort Pierce, Florida. While there, Keelan. bought several sex toys before resuming his journey toward J.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Later that day, Keelan arrived at the hotel where officers arrested him and searched his car. The search uncovered a wide array of sex toys, bondage devices, lubricant, and pornographic DVDs featuring young adult males. Following his arrest, Keelan admitted to his sexual relationship with J.S.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">After a three-day trial, a jury convicted Keelan of knowingly using means of interstate commerce to persuade, induce, or entice J.S. (a minor) to engage in sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Keelan was convicted on one count of enticing a minor to engage in sexual activity from fall 2009 through summer 2011, and one count of attempting to commit the same offense from May 9 to June 16, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The district court sentenced Keelan to two concurrent prison terms of 200 months and a 25-year term of supervised release. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5), the district court found J.S.\u2019s losses were not yet ascertainable and deferred a restitution ruling because the family of J.S. had not yet produced an accounting of his mental health treatment costs. The district court later referred the restitution issue to a magistrate judge because the paper record alone was insufficient to determine the appropriate amount of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">The magistrate judge conducted a restitution hearing on August 7, 2013. The magistrate judge admitted into evidence several invoices from family therapists and psychologic\u00e1l counselors. The invoices included fees for mental h\u00e9alth treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">The magistrate judge entered a Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R) recommending Keelan pay $104,886.05 pursuant to the MVRA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A. The R &amp; R concluded Keelan committed a crime of violence that resulted in bodily injury to the minor victim, and restitution was necessary for mental healthcare to treat harm directly and proximately caused by Kee-lan\u2019s criminal offense. The R <em>&amp; </em>R calculated the cost of treatment administered after February 14, 2010, the date on which Keelan first sexually abused J.S. Keelan filed a timely objection to the R &amp; R.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">The district court adopted the R &amp; R, ordered Keelan to pay the amount specified therein, and incorporated that order into an amended judgment. Keelan timely filed a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">We review de novo \u201cthe legality of an order of restitution.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>434 F.3d 1265, 1267 (11th Cir.2006). We review for clear error \u201cfactual findings underlying a restitution order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">Keelan argues the district erroneously ordered restitution under the MVRA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>MVRA provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that a district court must order a defendant to pay restitution to the \u201cvictim\u201d of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a), (c). The term \u201cvictim\u201d is defined as \u201ca person directly and proximately^ harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3663A(a)(2). If the offense results in \u201cbodily injury\u201d to the victim, the defendant must \u201cpay an amount equal to the cost of necessary medical and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment rendered in accordance with a method of healing recognized by the law of the place of treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3663A(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Keelan proffers four reasons the district court erred in ordering restitution. We address each argument in turn. *</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">\n<em>A. Crime of Violence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Keelan argues 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b), which prohibits knowingly persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing a minor to engage in sexual activity, is not a crime of violence as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 16(b) defines a crime of violence as any \u201coffense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d Keelan admits his offense is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), but argues this Court has never decided whether \u00a7 2422(b) is also a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b). He contends \u00a7 16(b) is narrower than \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) because a substantial risk that physical force may be \u201cused,\u201d as provided by \u00a7 16(b), is more limited than conduct that \u201cpresents\u201d a serious potential risk of injury, \u2022 as provided by \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">The ultimate issue is one of first impression in this Court: whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2442(b) is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To determine whether a conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b), we apply a \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d <em>Dixon v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>768 F.3d 1339, 1342-43 (11th Cir.2014) (quotation omitted); <em>accord United States v. De la Fuente, </em>353 F.3d 766, 770 (9th Cir.2003) (applying categorical approach to \u00a7 16 in MVRA context). Under the categorical approach, a court must \u201clook to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction, rather than to the particular facts\u201d of the defendant\u2019s record of conviction. <em>Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>1, 7, 125 S.Ct. 377, 381, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWPy\">In looking at the elements and nature of the offense, we must decide if only the ordinary violation of the statute at issue must present such a risk, or if all violations of the statute must present such a risk. The parties did not brief whether the \u201cordinary case\u201d standard established in <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1597, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), also applies to \u00a7 16(b). This gloss on the categorical approach requires a court to ask if the \u201cordinary,\u201d rather than the hypothetical and \u201cunusual,\u201d violation of the statute at issue qualifies as a crime of violence. <em>Id.; see United States v. Chitwood, </em>676 F.3d 971, 977 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201c[I]t is the \u2018ordinary\u2019 or \u2018generic\u2019 case that counts.\u201d). Despite the parties\u2019 failure to brief this question, we answer it because, in light of binding Supreme Court precedent, doing so is a necessary, logical step to determine if \u00a7 2422(b) is categorically a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b). <em>See James, </em>550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. at 1597 (using \u201cordinary case\u201d standard when applying categorical approach).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">All other circuits to examine the issue have held the proper inquiry under \u00a7 16(b) is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense raises a substantial risk the defendant may use physical force in the \u201cordinary case\u201d, even though, at the margin, some violations of the statute may not raise such a risk. <em>United States v. Avila, </em>770 F.3d 1100, 1107 (4th Cir.2014) (quoting <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. at 1597) (applying \u201cordinary case\u201d standard to \u00a7 16(b) analysis); <em>United States v. Fish, </em>758 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2014) (same); <em>Rodriguez-Castellon v. Holder, </em>733 F.3d 847, 853-55 (9th Cir.2013) (same); <em>United States v. Echeverria-Gomez, </em>627 F.3d 971, 978 (5th Cir.2010) (same); <em>Van Don Nguyen v. Holder, </em>571 F.3d 524, 530 (6th Cir.2009) (same); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Garcia, </em>501 F.3d 1208, 1213 (10th Cir.2007) (same). We follow this uniform rule and adopt the \u201cordinary case\u201d standard for analyzing \u00a7 16(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Applying the categorical approach looking only to the ordinary case, we hold 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). Our precedent suggests this result. Section 2422(b) criminalizes using or attempting<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to use means of interstate commerce to knowingly \u201cpersuade[ ], induce! ], entiee[ ], or coercef]\u201d a minor to engage in \u201cany sexual activity.\u201d In <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1197, 1198 (11th Cir.2005), we held 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2422(b) is a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), which applies to \u201cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d We found that \u201c[i]n cases involving sex crimes against minors, ... there is always a substantial risk that physical force will be used to ensure a child\u2019s compliance with an adult\u2019s sexual demands.\u201d <em>Searcy, </em>418 F.3d at 1197 (quoting <em>United States v. Munro, </em>394 F.3d 865, 870 (10th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>For the same reason, \u00a7 2422(b) is a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b). Since the conduct encompassed by the elements of \u00a7 2422(b) involves a sex crime against a minor, the ordinary or generic violation of \u00a7 2422(b) involves a substantial risk the defendant may use physical force in the course of committing the offense. Keelan therefore committed a crime of violence for which the district court could order restitution under the MVRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">\n<em>B. Bodily Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Keelan argues the evidence before the district court was insufficient to conclude J.S. suffered a \u201cbodily injury\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(2). Keelan forfeited his right to seek review on this issue, however, because he failed to raise a specific objection to this factual finding in the R &amp; R, and the district court adopted the R &amp; R\u2019s factual finding in a short opinion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(a) (\u201cFailure to object in accordance with this rule waives a party\u2019s right to review.\u201d); <em>Resolution Trust Corp. v. Hallmark Builders, Inc., </em>996 F.2d 1144, 1149 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201cWhen the magistrate provides such notice and a party still fails to object to the findings of fact and those findings are adopted by the district court the party may not challenge them on appeal in the absence of plain error or manifest injustice.\u201d). Keelan has failed to show plain error or manifest injustice, and has thus forfeited review of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">\n<em>C. Mental Health Treatment Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Keelan argues the district court erred in ordering restitution because there is no nexus between J.S.\u2019s bodily injuries and his mental health treatment. Keelan asserts the MVRA limits restitution to medical services that treat only the bodily injury itself, not the psychological consequences flowing from that injury. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">Keelan\u2019s argument runs afoul of the MVRA\u2019s plain language. Under the MVRA, the defendant must \u201cpay an amount equal to the cost of necessary medical and related professional services ... relating to <em>physical, psychiatric, and psychological care, including nonmedical care and treatment.\u201d </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The statutory language does not limit restitution only to care necessary to narrowly treat the physical manifestation of the victim\u2019s injury. The statute explicitly encompasses mental health treatment necessary to treat the psychological trauma of the victim. The plain language of the MVRA is buttressed by Congress\u2019s choice to define \u201cbodily injury\u201d in Title 18 as, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cimpairment of ... [a] mental faculty,\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1365(h)(4); \u00a7 1515(a)(5). Surely Congress did not intend to define the impairment of a mental faculty as a bodily injury but then leave victims without the ability to recover the treatment costs for such ah injury. The district court accordingly did not err in ordering restitution for J.S.\u2019s mental health treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">\n<em>D.Proximate Cause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">Finally, Keelan argues J.S.\u2019s bodily injury did not proximately cause his mental health treatment because J.S. suffered from several psychological problems prior to Keelan\u2019s sexual abuse. Keelan contends the evidence showing J.S. cut himself before the sexual relationship demonstrates the absence of proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"A3Q1\">The district court did not clearly err in finding Keelan\u2019s offense \u201cdirectly and proximately\u201d caused J.S. to incur $104,886.05 in mental health expenses, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(2). Contrary to Keelan\u2019s argument, we have held a \u201c[d]e-fendant\u2019s conduct need not be the sole cause of the loss.\u201d <em>United States v. Rob </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number><em>ertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1334 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation omitted). Although other factors may have contributed to J.S.\u2019s need for mental health treatment, the district court could still find proximate causation if the \u201ccausal connection between the conduct and the loss [was] not too attenuated (either factually or temporally).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The R &amp; R adopted by the district court carefully analyzed the factual and temporal basis of J.S.\u2019s mental health treatment. Although Dr. Patterson had testified Kee-lan began grooming J.S. in the fall of 2009, the magistrate judge excluded all costs prior to February 14, 2010 \u2014 the day Kee-lan first sexually abused J.S. \u2014 finding there was \u201cno doubt\u201d Keelan proximately caused J.S.\u2019s psychiatric problems after that date.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The chronology of the trial evidence firmly supported the conclusion that J.S.\u2019s prior mental health problems were secondary to Keelan\u2019s manipulation and abuse. J.S.\u2019s mental well-being, according to his own trial testimony, deteriorated precipitously after Keelan sexually exploited him. Moreover, numerous letters and affidavits submitted from J.S.\u2019s medical providers stated Keelan\u2019s criminal conduct was the driving force necessitating J.S.\u2019s treatment. We cannot conclude the district court clearly erred in finding Kee-lan proximately caused J.S.\u2019s mental health treatment expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">In light of the foregoing reasons, we affirm Keelan\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\">. Keelan also raised the following three issues on appeal: (1) the district court erred in admitting J.S.\u2019s testimony about the sex acts performed with Keelan, pornographic videos found at Keelan's home, and sex toys and pornographic videos found in Keelan\u2019s vehicle; (2) the district court erred in admitting the expert testimony of Dr. Terri Patterson; (3) and the district court erred in denying his sealed Federal Rule of Evidence 412(b) motion. We affirm these three issues without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">. Though \u00a7 2422(b) also criminalizes knowingly coercing a minor to engage in sexual activity, the parties agreed to strike the word \"coerced\u201d from the indictment and jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-17\">The Government proceeded solely on the theory Keelan persuaded, induced, or enticed J.S. to engage in sexual activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">. The Governments concedes \u00a7 16(a) is not applicable here because physical force is not an element of \u00a7 2422(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b870-8\">. The Government argues our precedent mandates every crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 is necessarily a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). In <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d 899, 905 (11th Cir.1999), we held a conviction for lewd assault under Florida Statute 800.04 qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. We reasoned there is no \"substantial difference that requires a different decision between the definition of a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. section 16 ... and the definition of a crime of violence for career offender purposes under [U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, in <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1197 (11th Cir.2005), we held \u00a7 2422(b) is a crime of violence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. In doing so, we interpreted <em>Rutherford </em>as holding \u201ca crime of violence determination for the purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 is indistinguishable from a determination made pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">We do not decide whether our precedent mandates the rule sought by the Government, but simply note our \u00a1reasoning in <em>Rutherford </em>and <em>Searcy </em>is consistent with our holding in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b870-14\">.The parties have not cited, and we have not found, case law from other circuits that have answered this precise issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b871-7\">. The parties did not brief whether \u00a7 2422(b) is a divisible statute susceptible to the \"modified categorical approach\u201d articulated in <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281-82, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013). We do not answer this question because we can resolve this case without addressing the modified categorical approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b871-11\">. Although one of Keelan\u2019s counts of conviction is an attempt offense, that fact does not preclude finding he committed a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(b). The Supreme Court has held the analogous ACCA residual clause \"does not by its terms exclude attempt offenses.\u201d <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 201, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1593, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b873-10\">. The Government has not cross-appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s exclusion of the treatment costs incurred prior to February 14, 2010 when Keelan groomed J.S. We therefore do not address whether the magistrate judge could have found Keelan proximately caused the treatment costs during that time period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
