Woodward </em>(2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 821 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 779], we affirmed defendant Daniel Woodward\u2019s convictions for possessing child pornography (Pen. Code, \u00a7 311.11, subd. (a))<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and committing a lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of 14 (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)) against B., his daughter. (116 Cal.App.4th at pp. 825-826.) While defendant was serving the resulting prison sentence, the Sacramento County District Attorney charged defendant with committing two counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of 14 against T.C. and A.G. (\u00a7 288, subd. (a).) Defendant was also alleged to have committed the offenses against multiple victims within the meaning of the \u201cOne Strike\u201d law. (Former \u00a7 667.61, subd. (e)(5); One Strike Law.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>A jury convicted defendant as charged and found true the multiple victim allegation. The trial court sentenced defendant to an aggregate term of 30 years to life in prison, composed of consecutive 15-year-to-life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">On appeal, defendant contends (1) the prosecution commenced this case after the applicable six-year statute of limitations had run, (2) the failure to plead that he was not eligible for probation precluded the application of the One Strike Law, (3) the trial court erred in hearing defense counsel\u2019s motion for a hearing pursuant to Evidence Code section 782 even though defendant was not personally present, and (4) the trial court abused its discretion by sentencing him to consecutive terms while unaware of its discretion to impose concurrent terms and without stating its reason for imposing consecutive terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">We vacate the sentence and remand the case so that the trial court may exercise its discretion in determining whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences. In all other respects, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">\n<em>Prosecution Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">In July 1999, defendant \u201cmet\u201d T.A. online and they developed a relationship over the ensuing months. In December 1999, T.A. and her two daughters, T.C. and A.G., moved from Florida to live with defendant in Sacramento, California. T.C. was nine years old and A.G. was seven years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">One day in spring 2000, defendant was sitting on the couch watching a movie with T.C. and A.G. T.A. was not home at the time. Defendant told A.G. to come to his bedroom with him. Defendant sat in his computer chair and instructed A.G. to sit on his lap. Defendant began touching A.G.\u2019s leg before putting his hand into her pants. He rubbed her vagina and inserted his finger. Defendant stopped when T.C. called for her sister from the living room. Defendant told A.G. not to tell anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">T.A. and her daughters moved out of defendant\u2019s apartment after living with him for approximately three months. After moving out, T.C. and A.G. visited defendant twice a month. On two or three occasions, the girls spent the night at defendant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">During a sleepover in the spring of 2000, defendant and T.C. were sitting on a couch in the living room and watching a movie. T.C. was wearing a knee-length nightgown. Defendant was lying with his back against the end of the couch, and T.C. was \u201claying against him\u201d in a \u201csort of spooning\u201d position. Defendant put his hand on her vaginal area on the outside of her clothes. T.C. felt uncomfortable with the touching, which lasted about five seconds. She got up and left the room. After the incident, T.C. asked her mother to not spend the night at .defendant\u2019s apartment anymore.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">In May 2006, T.C. and A.G. reported to law enforcement that defendant had molested them.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">In 2009, as part of its case-in-chief, the prosecution introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s prior child molestation offense in November 2000 pursuant to Evidence Code section 1108. The evidence concerned defendant\u2019s molestation of his daughter, B. On November 25, 2000, B. and her brother spent the night at defendant\u2019s house. B. was six years old and her brother was seven. On November 26,- 2000, B. sat on defendant\u2019s lap while they watched a movie from his couch. She was wearing one of defendant\u2019s T-shirts but did not have any underwear on. Her brother was sitting in front of the couch with his back toward B. and defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>Defendant touched her vagina with his finger. He then announced that it was \u201cbath time.\u201d B.\u2019s brother continued to watch the movie while defendant and B. headed to the bathroom. After B. got into the bath, defendant \u201cwashed [her] as if [she] were a little girl.\u201d At the time, B. typically took baths by herself when at home with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Defendant took off his clothes and got into the bath with B. He made her \u201cwash the lower part of his body all over, including his penis.\u201d Defendant\u2019s penis was erect. Defendant turned on the shower and rinsed both of them off. After the shower, defendant dried B. off with a towel and told her not to tell anyone.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Later that day, B. told her grandmother, who immediately reported the incident to the police. That night, the police went to defendant\u2019s apartment to question him about B.\u2019s report of being molested. Defendant invited the police officers into the apartment where the officers observed a desktop computer with a picture of a girl with a dildo in her vagina. The desktop of the computer showed files related to incest and bestiality. Defendant told the police \u201cthat he was not a child molester, that he was doing research\u201d on incest and bestiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The prosecution introduced a certified copy of the abstract of judgment showing defendant\u2019s conviction for committing a lewd and lascivious act against B. (\u00a7 288, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">\n<em>Defense Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Defendant testified on his own behalf. He acknowledged having child pornography on his computer when the police came to question him in November 2000. Defendant stated that he had been \u201cresearching incest and bestiality, rape, and molestation\u201d to educate himself on the subjects so that he could persuade a girlfriend who lived in Indiana to seek counseling for her childhood sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">Defendant acknowledged that B. and her brother visited him on November 25, 2000. After arriving at his apartment around 7:00 p.m., B. and her brother quickly changed into defendant\u2019s T-shirts in lieu of their own pajamas. B. sat on defendant\u2019s lap while they all watched a movie. During the movie, B. began to tickle defendant, who tickled her back. Defendant admitted that he took a shower with B. but denied that she touched his penis or that he had an erection. Defendant acknowledged that he had been convicted for molesting B.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">Defendant denied ever touching T.C. or A.G. inappropriately. He explained that A.G. could not have sat on his lap in his home office because of the shape of his ergonomic chair. Defendant denied that he ever fondled T.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">\n<em>Claimed Expiration of the Statute of Limitations</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">\n<em>Claimed Defective Pleading of the One Strike Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b987-9\">Defendant next argues that the trial court was precluded from sentencing him under the One Strike Law because the prosecution failed to plead that he was not eligible for probation. Defendant does not argue-that he was actually eligible for probation, but only that the failure to expressly plead his ineligibility for probation in the charging document precluded his sentencing under the One Strike Law. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">As we have noted, defendant was charged with two counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under the age of 14, against T.C. and A.G. And, he was alleged to have \u201ccommitted the . . . described offense(s) against two or more victims, within the meaning of . . . Section 667.61(e)(5).\u201d The jury convicted defendant as charged and found true the allegation that he committed the offenses against multiple victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">Defendant argues that the application of the One Strike Law set forth in former subdivision (i) of section 667.61 requires the pleading to allege that defendant is ineligible for probation as set forth in former section 1203.066.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">Former subdivision (i) of section 667.61 set forth the pleading and proof requirement for the One Strike Law as follows: \u201cFor the penalties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>provided in this section to apply, the existence of any fact required under subdivision (d) or (e) shall be alleged in the accusatory pleading and either admitted by the defendant in open court or found to be true by the trier of fact.\u201d Allegations that the charged offenses violated former subdivision (d) or (e) of section 667.61 require the trial court to impose either a 15-year-to-life or a 25-year-to-life sentence depending on the number of applicable factors listed in those subdivisions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">The only exception to the mandatory life prison term set forth in the One Strike Law is for defendants who violated only section 288, subdivision (a), and are eligible for probation. As our Supreme Court has noted, \u201cconviction of nonforcible lewd or lascivious acts on a child under the age of 14 years (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)) will qualify for One Strike sentencing\u2019treatment \u2018unless the defendant qualifies for probation under subdivision (c) of section 1203.066.\u2019 (\u00a7 667.61, subd. (c)(7).)\u201d <em>(People v. Mancebo </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 735, 741, fn. 3 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 550, 41 P.3d 556] <em>(Mancebo).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">Defendant seizes on the exception set forth in former subdivision (c)(7) of section 667.61 to argue that the district attorney\u2019s failure to plead his ineligibility for probation prevented his sentencing under the One Strike Law. In so arguing, defendant acknowledges that the information filed against him <em>did </em>plead the application of the One Strike Law by alleging multiple victims and referring to former subdivision (e)(5) of section 667.61. Nonetheless, he contends that the information\u2019s pleading of the One Strike Law was insufficient without also alleging that he was ineligible for probation under former section 1203.066.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">In support of his argument, defendant relies on <em>Mancebo, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th 735 and <em>People v. Hammer </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 756 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 590, 69 P.3d 436] <em>(Hammer). </em>Neither case supports his argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">In <em>Mancebo, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at page 738, the validity of the One Strike sentence imposed was uncontested. Instead, <em>Mancebo </em>involved only the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s use of a gun could serve both as a basis for invoking One Strike sentencing and to impose firearm enhancements under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>section 12022.5, subdivision (a). (Mancebo, at p. 738.) The Supreme Court concluded that the gun use, \u201chaving been properly pled and proved as a basis for One Strike sentencing, was unavailable to support section 12022.5(a) enhancements.\u201d (Mancebo, at p. 739.) Although requirements of One Strike pleading were not at issue in <em>Mancebo, </em>the high court did note that \u201c[t]he language of subdivision (i) of section 667.61, requiring that \u2018[flor the penalties provided in this section to apply, the existence of any fact required under subdivision (d) or (e) shall be alleged in the accusatory pleading and either admitted by the defendant in open court or found to be true by the trier of fact,\u2019 is straightforward and plain.\u201d <em>(Mancebo, </em>at p. 749.) Thus, the <em>Mancebo </em>court deemed sufficient the One Strike pleading in a case in which the information \u201cmade specific reference to subdivision (e) of section 667.61 . . . .\u201d <em>(Mancebo, </em>at p. 749.)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Here, the information expressly alleged that defendant molested multiple victims and specifically referred to former subdivision (e)(5) of section 667.61 as the provision rendering the One Strike Law applicable. As in <em>Mancebo, </em>the pleading was sufficient to invoke the application of the One Strike Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">In <em>Hammer, </em>the California Supreme Court considered whether a defendant who had been granted probation for an earlier conviction of section 288, subdivision (a), could later be sentenced under the One Strike Law in reliance on the prior child molestation conviction. <em>(Hammer, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 759.) The <em>Hammer </em>court noted that eligibility for probation under former subdivision (c) of section 1203.066 allows the trial court to avoid imposing a life sentence for a conviction otherwise subject to the One Strike Law. <em>(Hammer </em>at p. 759.) Nonetheless, <em>Hammer </em>affirmed the One Strike sentence despite the defendant\u2019s prior term of probation for the earlier child molestation. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">In affirming the One Strike sentence, the <em>Hammer </em>court noted that \u201csection 1203.066\u2014enacted more than a decade before the Legislature adopted the One Strike [L]aw\u2014generally requires prison sentences and bars probation for those who are convicted of violating section 288 and related offenses. (See \u00a7 1203.066, subd. (a).) As we recounted in <em>People v. Jeffers </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 984, 993-997 [239 Cal.Rptr. 886, 741 P.2d 1127] <em>(Jeffers), </em>however, the Legislature was motivated by various policy considerations to enact a limited exception to the general bar on probation. Accordingly, subdivision (c) of section 1203.066 provides that if the defendant is the victim\u2019s \u2018relative\u2019 or \u2018member of the victim\u2019s household,\u2019 and if other conditions are met, a trial court may exercise discretion to grant probation to a defendant convicted of violating section 288, subdivision (a).\u201d <em>(Hammer, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>pp. 765-766.) <em>Hammer, </em>however, does not hold that the failure to plead ineligibility for probation under section 1203.066 precludes the application of the One Strike Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Defendant asks us to impose a rule of pleading that would require the prosecution plead the absence of a fact that might <em>decrease </em>the penalty sought. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Any fact serving to increase the penalty must be pled. As the California Supreme Court has explained, \u201c ' \u201cbefore a defendant can properly be sentenced to suffer the <em>increased </em>penalties flowing from ... [a] finding . . . [of a prior conviction] the fact of the prior conviction . . . must be charged in the accusatory pleading, and if the defendant pleads not guilty thereto the charge must be proved and the truth of the allegation determined by the jury, or by the court if a jury is waived.\u201d \u2019 <em>([People </em>v.] <em>Lo Cicero[ </em>(1969)] 71 Cal.2d [1186,] 1192-1193 [80 Cal.Rptr. 913, 459 P.2d 241], quoting <em>People v. Ford </em>[(1964)] 60 Cal.2d [772,] 794 [36 Cal.Rptr. 620, 388 P.2d 892].)\u201d <em>(In re Varnell </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1132, 1140 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 619, 70 P.3d 1037], italics added <em>(Varnell).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">The converse is not true. The prosecution need not allege the absence of a factor, such as eligibility for probation, that may lighten the punishment on defendant. (See <em>Varnell, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at pp. 1132, 1141 [rejecting contention that \u201ca defendant is entitled as a matter of due process to notice in the accusatory pleading of his ineligibility for less restrictive alternate punishments\u201d such as probation].) Probation eligibility does not represent the sort of increase in penalty that the Supreme Court has required to be pled. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1140.) As this court has noted, \u201c[f]inding a defendant ineligible for probation is not a form of punishment, because probation itself is an act of clemency on the part of the trial court.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Benitez </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1274, 1278 [26 Cal.Rptr.3d 262].) Rather than being a burden on the prosecution to disprove, any eligibility for probation must be shown <em>by the defendant. </em>\u201c[A] defendant has the burden to present evidence showing that he is entitled to consideration for probation under subdivision (c) of section 1203.066.\u201d <em>(People v. Groomes </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 84, 89 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 469].)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">Here, the prosecution satisfied the One Strike pleading requirement by alleging its applicability due to defendant\u2019s commission of qualifying offenses against multiple victims. (\u00a7 667.61, former subd. (e)(5).) Section 667.61 does not require that the People also allege the inapplicability of a circumstance that might remove defendant from the statutory scheme\u2019s penalty provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>Even if the pleading had been defective as defendant contends, he cannot demonstrate prejudice because the evidence at trial showed that T.C. and A.G. were not relatives or members of his household. Consequently, defendant did not meet the requirement set forth in former subdivision (c)(1) of section 1203.066 that he be a relative of the victims or a member of their household. No outcome more favorable to defendant would have resulted from any change in pleading requirements. <em>(People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 834-836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Ill, IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">The sentence is vacated.
