Appellant Pauline Hunt (Pauline) was Wayne\u2019s long-term romantic partner. Taylor Profita (Taylor) is Pauline\u2019s grandson.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">In 1992, Wayne and his wife established a family trust that named Stephen and Kathleen the sole beneficiaries after their parents\u2019 deaths. Wayne\u2019s wife died in 1993. In 2003, after suffering a stroke, Wayne amended his trust to leave a 60 percent portion of his estate to Pauline, with the remainder going to Stephen, Kathleen, and John. He made subsequent amendments later in 2003 and in 2004, but retained the provision leaving 60 percent of his estate to Pauline.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">After Wayne\u2019s death in 2006, Stephen and Kathleen brought the present action to, among other things, invalidate the 2003 and 2004 trust amendments and recover funds placed in accounts held jointly by Wayne and Pauline. The probate court found that Wayne lacked capacity to execute the trust amendments, transfer funds from the trust to joint tenancy accounts, and change the beneficiary of his life insurance policy, and that Pauline exerted undue influence with respect to the amendments and transfers.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">In the published part of the opinion, we conclude the probate court erred when it evaluated Wayne\u2019s capacity to execute the trust amendments by the general standard of capacity set out in Probate Code sections 810 to 812, instead of the standard of testamentary capacity set out in Probate Code section 6100.5.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the unpublished part, we find there is no substantial evidence that Wayne lacked testamentary capacity to execute the 2003 and 2004 trust amendments or that the amendments were the product of Pauline\u2019s undue influence. We also determine there is substantial evidence that Wayne lacked capacity to open joint tenancy accounts and to change the beneficiary of his life insurance policy. Thus, we reverse the part of the judgment invalidating the trust amendments and affirm in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>STATEMENT OF FACTS AND OF THE CASE*</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">I, II. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">III. <em>The Trial Court Erred in Evaluating Wayne\u2019s Capacity to Execute the Trust Amendments by Standards of Contractual Capacity, Not Testamentary Capacity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The probate court held that Wayne\u2019s capacity to execute the trust amendments should be evaluated pursuant to sections 810 to 812 (contractual capacity), rather than section 6100.5 (testamentary capacity). It also found that Wayne lacked contractual capacity as defined by sections 810 to 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Pauline contends that the trial court erred in evaluating Wayne\u2019s capacity to execute the trust amendments by the standard of contractual capacity, rather than testamentary capacity. She also contends substantial evidence does not support the conclusion that Wayne lacked testamentary capacity to execute the trust amendments. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">A. <em>Testamentary Capacity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Section 6100.5 sets out the standard for testamentary capacity. It provides that a person is not mentally competent to make a will if at the time of making the will, either of the following is true: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>individual\u2019s devising property in a way which, except for the existence of the delusions or hallucinations, the individual would not have done.\u201d (\u00a7 6100.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\u201c(1) The individual does not have sufficient mental capacity to be able to (A) understand the nature of the testamentary act, (B) understand and recollect the nature and situation of the individual\u2019s property, or (C) remember and understand the individual\u2019s relations to living descendants, spouse, and parents, and those whose interests are affected by the will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-13\">\u201c(2) The individual suffers from a mental disorder with symptoms including delusions or hallucinations, which delusions or hallucinations result in the</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\u201c \u2018It is thoroughly established by a series of decisions that: \u201cAbility to transact important business, or even ordinary business, is not the legal standard of testamentary capacity. . . .\u201d <em>(Estate of Arnold </em>[(1940)] 16 Cal.2d 573, 586 [107 P.2d 25][)]____\u2019 <em>(Estate of Powers </em>(1947) 81 Cal.App.2d 480, 483-484 [184 P.2d 319]; <em>Estate of Mann </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 593, 605 [229 Cal.Rptr. 225].) Rather, testamentary capacity involves the question of whether, at the time the will is made, the testator \u2018 \u201chas sufficient mental capacity to understand the nature of the act he is doing, to understand and recollect the nature and situation of his property and to remember, and understand his relations to, the persons who have claims upon his bounty and whose interests are affected by the provisions of the instrument.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Estate of Arnold[, supra,] </em>16 Cal.2d [at p.] 586, quoting <em>Estate of Sexton </em>(1926) 199 Cal. 759, 764 [251 P. 778]; <em>Estate of Mann, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.3d at p. 602.) It is a question, therefore, of the testator\u2019s mental state in relation to a specific event, the mating of a will.\u201d <em>(Conservatorship of Bookasta </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 445, 450 [265 Cal.Rptr. 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">\u201cIt is well established that \u2018old age or forgetfulness, eccentricities or mental feebleness or confusion at various times of a party mating a will are not enough in themselves to warrant a holding that the testator lacked testamentary capacity.\u2019 <em>(Estate of Wynne </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 369, 374 [48 Cal.Rptr. 656], citing <em>Estate of Sanderson </em>(1959) 171 Cal.App.2d 651, 660 [341 P.2d 358] and <em>Estate of Lingenfelter </em>(1952) 38 Cal.2d 571, 581 [241 P.2d 990].) \u2018It has been held over and over in this state that old age, feebleness, forgetfulness, filthy personal habits, personal eccentricities, failure to recognize old friends or relatives, physical disability, absent-mindedness and mental confusion do not furnish grounds for holding that a testator lacked testamentary capacity.\u2019 <em>(Estate of Selb </em>(1948) 84 Cal.App.2d 46, 49 [190 P.2d 277].)  Nor does the mere fact that the testator is under a guardianship support a finding of lack of testamentary capacity without evidence that the incompetence continues at the time of the will\u2019s execution. <em>(Estate of Nelson </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 42 [38 Cal.Rptr. 459]; <em>Estate of Wochos </em>(1972) 23 Cal.App.3d 47 [99 Cal.Rptr. 782].)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">\u201cIt must be remembered, in this connection, that \u2018[w]hen one has a mental disorder in which there are lucid periods, it is presumed that his will has been made during a time of lucidity.\u2019 <em>(Estate of Goetz </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 107, 114 [61 Cal.Rptr. 181].) . . . Thus a finding of lack of testamentary capacity can be supported only if the presumption of execution during a lucid period is overcome.\u201d <em>(Estate of Mann, supra, </em>184 Cal.App.3d at pp. 603-604.)</p>\n<p id=\"b592-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>B. <em>Capacity Generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Sections 810 to 813 set out the standard for capacity to make various kinds of decisions, transact business, and enter contracts. Section 810 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">\u201c(a) For purposes of this part, there shall exist a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that all persons have the capacity to make decisions and to be responsible for their acts or decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-6\">\u201c(b) A person who has a mental or physical disorder may still be capable of contracting, conveying, marrying, making medical decisions, executing wills or trusts, and performing other actions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201c(c) A judicial determination that a person is totally without understanding, or is of unsound mind, or suffers from one or more mental deficits so substantial that, under the circumstances, the person should be deemed to lack the legal capacity to perform a specific act, should be based on evidence of a deficit in one or more of the person\u2019s mental functions rather than on a diagnosis of a person\u2019s mental or physical disorder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">Section 811 sets out the findings necessary to support a conclusion of lack of capacity, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201c(a) A determination that a person is of unsound mind or lacks the capacity to make a decision or do a certain act, including, but not limited to, the incapacity to contract, to make a conveyance, to marry, to make medical decisions, to execute wills, or to execute trusts, shall be supported by evidence of a deficit in at least one of the following mental functions, subject to subdivision (b), and evidence of a correlation between the deficit or deficits and the decision or acts in question:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">\u201c(1) Alertness and attention, including, but not limited to, the following: [f] (A) Level of arousal or consciousness, [f] (B) Orientation to time, place, person, and situation. [f] (C) Ability to attend and concentrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-12\">\u201c(2) Information processing, including, but not limited to, the following: [j[] (A) Short- and long-term memory, including immediate recall, [f] (B) Ability to understand or communicate with others, either verbally or otherwise. [][] (C) Recognition of familiar objects and familiar persons, [jl] (D) Ability to understand and appreciate quantities, [f] (E) Ability to reason using abstract concepts. [][] (F) Ability to plan, organize, and carry out actions in one\u2019s own rational self-interest. [][] (G) Ability to reason logically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>\u201c(3) Thought processes. Deficits in these functions may be demonstrated by the presence of the following: [ft] (A) Severely disorganized thinking, [ft] (B) Hallucinations, [ft] (C) Delusions, [ft] (D) Uncontrollable, repetitive, or intrusive thoughts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">\u201c(4) Ability to modulate mood and affect. Deficits in this ability may be demonstrated by the presence of a pervasive and persistent or recurrent state of euphoria, anger, anxiety, fear, panic, depression, hopelessness or despair, helplessness, apathy or indifference, that is inappropriate in degree to the individual\u2019s circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">\u201c(b) A deficit in the mental functions listed above may be considered only if the deficit, by itself or in combination with one or more other mental function deficits, significantly impairs the person\u2019s ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions <em>with regard to the type of act or decision in question.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u201c(c) In determining whether a person suffers from a deficit in mental function so substantial that the person lacks the capacity to do a certain act, the court may take into consideration the frequency, severity, and duration of periods of impairment. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">Section 812 provides: \u201cExcept where otherwise provided by law, including, but not limited to, Section 813 and the statutory and decisional law of testamentary capacity, a person lacks the capacity to make a decision unless the person has the ability to communicate verbally, or by any other means, the decision, and to understand and appreciate, to the extent relevant, all of the following: [ft] (a) The rights, duties, and responsibilities created by, or affected by the decision, [ft] (b) The probable consequences for the decision-maker and, where appropriate, the persons affected by the decision, [ft] (c) The significant risks, benefits, and reasonable alternatives involved in the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">C. <em>Wayne\u2019s Capacity to Execute the Disputed Trust Amendments Should Have Been Evaluated by the Standard of Testamentary Capacity (Section 6100.5)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">As the cases cited by the parties make clear, California courts have not applied consistent standards in evaluating capacity to make or amend a trust. In <em>Goodman v. Zimmerman </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 1667, 1673-1679 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 419], cited by Pauline, the court applied section 6100.5\u2019s standard for testamentary capacity to evaluate a decedent\u2019s capacity to execute a new will and trust amendment. In contrast, in <em>Walton v. Bank of California </em>(1963) 218 Cal.App.2d 527, 541 [32 Cal.Rptr. 856], cited by Stephen and</p>\n<p id=\"A7f\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Kathleen, the court applied a higher standard to evaluate capacity to enter an irrevocable inter vivos trust, stating that \u201cA person lacking capacity to make an ordinary transfer of property has no capacity to create an <em>inter vivos </em>trust.\u201d (See also <em>Estate of Bodger </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 416, 424 [279 P.2d 61] [\u201cA declaration of trust constitutes a contract between the trustor and the trustee for the benefit of a third party.\u201d].) In these cases, however, the proper standard by which to evaluate capacity does not appear to have been in dispute. The cases therefore offer little assistance in resolving the question we now address\u2014the measure by which a court should evaluate a decedent\u2019s capacity to make an after-death transfer by trust. (See <em>PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1097 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 997 P.2d 511] [\u201clanguage of an opinion must be construed with reference to the facts presented by the case; the positive authority of a decision is coextensive only with such facts\u201d]; <em>Silverbrand </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 106, 127 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 595, 205 P.3d 1047] [\u201c \u2018 \u201c[i]t is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered\u201d \u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">As Stephen and Kathleen correctly note, section 6100.5 defines mental competency to make a \u201cwill,\u201d not a testamentary transfer more generally. Thus, they appear to be correct that Wayne\u2019s capacity must be evaluated under sections 810 to 812, not section 6100.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Stephen and Kathleen err, however, in suggesting that sections 810 to 812 set out a single standard of \u201ccontractual capacity.\u201d They do not. To the contrary, section 811, subdivision (a) provides that a determination that a person lacks capacity to make a decision or do a certain act, including without limitation \u201cto contract, ... to execute wills, or to execute trusts,\u201d must be supported by evidence of a deficit in one of the statutorily identified mental functions <em>and evidence of a correlation between the deficit and the decision or act in question. </em>Section 811, subdivision (b) contains similar language, stating that a deficit in one of the statutorily defined mental functions may be considered <em>only </em>if it significantly impairs the person\u2019s ability to appreciate the consequences of his or her actions <em>with regard to the type or act or decision in question. </em>And section 812 provides that a person lacks capacity to make a decision only if he or she cannot appreciate the rights, duties, consequences, risks and benefits <em>\u201cinvolved in the decision.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Accordingly, sections 810 to 812 do not set out a single standard for contractual capacity, but rather provide that capacity to do a variety of acts, including to contract, make a will, or execute a trust, must be evaluated by a person\u2019s ability to appreciate the consequences <em>of the particular act he or she wishes to take. </em>More complicated decisions and transactions thus would appear to require greater mental function; less complicated decisions and transactions would appear to require less mental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>When determining whether a trustor had capacity to execute a trust amendment that, in its content and complexity, closely resembles a will or codicil, we believe it is appropriate to look to section 6100.5 to determine when a person\u2019s mental deficits are sufficient to allow a court to conclude that the person lacks the ability \u201cto understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions with regard to the type of act or decision in question.\u201d (\u00a7 811, subd. (b).) In other words, while section 6100.5 is not directly applicable to determine competency to make or amend a trust, it is made applicable through section 811 to trusts or trust amendments that are analogous to wills or codicils.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In the present case, while the original trust document is complex, the amendments are not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, none of the contested amendments does more than provide the percentages of the trust estate Wayne wished each beneficiary to receive. The May 28, 2003 amendment provided that Pauline was to receive 60 percent of the trust residue, and Stephen, Kathleen, and John were to receive the remaining 40 percent in equal shares; the November 18, 2003 amendment specified the same 60 percent/40 percent allocation if Wayne predeceased Pauline, but provided that if Pauline died first, Taylor should receive a portion of the trust assets; and the July 6, 2004 amendment eliminated John as a beneficiary, providing that \u201cSteve will have the portion that had been set aside for his son.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In view of the amendments\u2019 simplicity and testamentary nature, we conclude that they are indistinguishable from a will or codicil and, thus, Wayne\u2019s capacity to execute the amendments should have been evaluated pursuant to the standard of testamentary capacity articulated in section 6100.5. The trial court erred in evaluating Wayne\u2019s capacity under a different, higher standard of mental functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">D. <em>There Is No Substantial Evidence That Wayne Lacked Testamentary Capacity When He Executed the Trust </em>Amendments*</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">IV., V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The part of the judgment invalidating the trust amendments is reversed, and the probate court is directed to enter a new and different judgment affirming the validity of the trust amendments.

J., and Manella, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied July 6, 2011, and respondents\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 24, 2011, S195035.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b589-13\"> Throughout this opinion, we sometimes refer to Stephen and Kathleen collectively as \u201cpetitioners.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-14\"> All further undesignated statutory references are to the Probate Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b590-14\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 722.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b595-10\"> Stephen and Kathleen do not seriously contend otherwise.
