Resources Code, \u00a7 21000 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the project\u2019s specific plan failed to meet the consistency requirement of California\u2019s Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65000 et seq.). The trial court denied the petition. School District appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">In the published portion of this opinion, we address (1) the meaning of a statutory provision that states capped development fees and certain other provisions \u201cshall be the exclusive methods of considering and mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>impacts on school facilities that occur or might occur as a result\u201d of approval of the development of land (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65996, subd. (a)) and (2) the effect of this provision on the contents of an EIR. Because these issues of statutory construction are pure questions of law, however, the facts and proceedings in this case are not published.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude the CEQA claim has merit. The EIR inadequately analyzes the project\u2019s potential environmental impacts during the period when students from the new development would attend existing offsite schools (i.e., before schools are built within the project area to accommodate those students), which impacts include (1) increases in traffic near and on the way to existing schools and (2) environmental impacts from the construction of additional facilities at existing schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">We also conclude that School District failed to demonstrate that the project\u2019s specific plan violated the Planning and Zoning Law by being inconsistent with County\u2019s general plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The judgment will be reversed and the matter remanded for issuance of a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">FACTS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">PROCEEDINGS<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">I.-III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">IV. <em>Senate Bill No. 50</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">One of the parties\u2019 disputes over the adequacy of the EIR\u2019s analysis of environmental impacts arises from a disagreement over the meaning of certain provisions contained in the Leroy F. Greene School Facilities Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>of 1998 (Stats. 1998, ch. 407, p. 2989; Ed. Code, \u00a7 17070.10 et seq.), Senate Bill No. 50 (1997-1998 Reg. Sess.), which sometimes is referred to as Senate Bill 50. Among these provisions is a restriction on the \u201cmethods of considering and mitigating impacts on school facilities\u201d caused by a development project. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65996, subd. (a).) The parties dispute how this restriction affects the EIR, particularly its discussion of environmental impacts involving students who will live in the project\u2019s residential development.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">During the first decade after CEQA\u2019s enactment, questions arose concerning CEQA\u2019s application to development projects that caused an increase in student enrollment and overcrowding in schools. For example, in <em>El Dorado Union High School Dist. </em>v. <em>City of Placerville </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 123 [192 Cal.Rptr. 480], the appellate court addressed an issue of first impression concerning \u201cwhether the impact of increased student enrollment is cognizable under [CEQA].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 126.) The court determined that, in the circumstances of that case, such an impact was within the purview of CEQA. (144 Cal.App.3d at p. 126.) The circumstances mentioned by the court included \u201cample evidence of present overcrowding, projections of gradually increasing high school enrollment, and the necessity for construction of at least one new high school . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 131.) The court also determined that the EIR for the 552-unit residential development was inadequate because it contained no discussion of the project\u2019s impacts on schools and merely stated no mitigation measures were required. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">After California\u2019s judiciary established the principle that CEQA\u2019s mitigation measures applied to the impacts on schools caused when a residential development project leads to increased student enrollment, the Legislature addressed the topic of impacts on schools. In 1986, it enacted a complex statutory scheme to govern the imposition of school facilities fees on those seeking the governmental approvals needed to develop real estate. <em>(Corona-Norco Unified Sch. Dist. v. City of Corona </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 1577, 1582 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 236] (Corona-Norco).) The school facilities legislation (1) allowed school districts to levy a charge against new developments to fund construction of school facilities but capped the amount that could be charged and (2) limited the types of mitigation requirements local government could impose against a development project to alleviate the project\u2019s impacts on school facilities. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1582-1583.) Stated generally, the capped school facilities fees became the sole measure for mitigating the impacts of increased enrollment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>The school facilities legislation and its relationship to CEQA were discussed by the court in <em>Corona-Norco, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 1577. In that case, the school district filed petitions for writ of mandate to compel the city to rescind approvals of tentative tract maps for two residential developments. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1580.) The school district\u2019s legal theories included claims that the EIR failed to describe the adverse environmental impact of the proposed projects on local school facilities and services, failed to describe feasible mitigation measures, and failed to incorporate mitigation measures into the conditions for project approvals. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1581.) The petitions supported these claims by alleging the school district\u2019s facilities were seriously overcrowded, the proposed developments would exacerbate the overcrowding, and the statutorily authorized fee was insufficient to fund the construction of facilities needed to relieve the overcrowding. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The trial court sustained a demurrer to the school district\u2019s petitions and the school district appealed. <em>(Corona-Norco, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1580.) The Court of Appeal affirmed, stating: \u201cThe gravamen of the District\u2019s CEQA claims is that the City had a duty, in conducting CEQA review, to impose conditions in addition to the [statutorily authorized] fee to lessen the alleged impacts of the developihent projects on local school facilities. This position must fail [because] the District\u2019s position does not acknowledge the strict limitations on local agencies\u2019 powers in [Government Code] sections 65995 and 65996.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1587.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The Court of Appeal refused to return the case for further CEQA analysis because, under the school facilities legislation, \u201cthe trial court could not require the City to impose additional mitigation conditions, nor could it require the City to set aside the project on the basis of inadequate mitigation, even if CEQA violations were found.\u201d <em>(Corona-Norco, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 1587.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The next historical development leading to the enactment of Senate Bill 50 occurred when the Courts of Appeal issued decisions that narrowed the application of the limits on mitigation contained in the school facilities legislation and thereby expanded the reach of CEQA. Those decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>concluded the legislation applied only to adjudicative decisions of local government, such as the issuance of building permits. (1 Kostka &amp; Zischke, Practice Under the Cal. Environmental Quality Act (Cont.Ed.Bar 2011) \u00a7 14.28, p. 716.) Under this narrow view, developers that were requesting legislative actions, such as approvals of general plan amendments, specific plans or rezoning, were not protected by the provision that limited mitigation measures to the capped school facilities fee. (E.g., <em>Mira Development Corp. v. City of San Diego </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1201, 1218 [252 Cal.Rptr. 825] <em>(Mira) </em>[restrictions in Gov. Code, \u00a7 65996 did not apply to zoning decision].)</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\">For example, in <em>Murrieta Valley Unified School Dist. v. County of Riverside </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1212 [279 Cal.Rptr. 421], the court considered a county\u2019s argument that (1) the capped school facilities fee was the only measure it could impose to mitigate the impact of future development on the school facilities, (2) the school facilities legislation preempted the field of school facilities financing which precluded it from imposing fees in excess of the capped school facilities fee, and (3) it could not impose other nonfee mitigation measures to ameliorate the adverse effects of development on school facilities. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1229.) The court disagreed with the third part of this argument and concluded that the county had the authority to consider and provide for mitigation measures to address the general plan amendment\u2019s contribution to student overcrowding and adverse impacts on inadequate school facilities within the plan area. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1234.) The mitigation measures that the court regarded as permissible included reducing the density of residential development and imposing controlled phasing of residential development in areas of the school district with inadequate school facilities. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The Legislature reacted to the judicial decisions that narrowed application of the limits on fees and mitigation (i.e., expanded the application of CEQA) by enacting Senate Bill 50. The following provides an overview of the school facilities legislation after the enactment of Senate Bill 50: \u201cSB 50 employs three primary means to preempt the field of development fees and mitigation measures related to school facilities and to overturn <em>[Mira </em>and its progeny]. First, it provides for a <em>cap on the amount of fees, charges, dedications or other requirements </em>which can be levied against new construction to fund construction or reconstruction of school facilities. Second, SB 50 <em>removes denial authority </em>from local agencies by prohibiting refusals to approve legislative or adjudicative acts based on a developer\u2019s refusal to provide school facilities mitigation exceeding the capped fee amounts, or based on the inadequacy of school facilities. Third, it <em>limits mitigation measures </em>which can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>be required, under the California Environmental Quality Act or otherwise, to payment of the statutorily capped fee amounts and deems payment of these amounts to provide full and complete school facilities mitigation[.]\u2019 \u201d (9 Miller &amp; Starr, Cal.

For this reason, the Legislature hereby occupies the subject matter of requirements related to school facilities levied or imposed in connection with, or made a condition of, any land use approval, . . . and the mitigation of the impacts of land use approvals ... on the need for school facilities, to the exclusion of all other measures, financial or nonfinancial, on the subjects.

(Gov. Code, \u00a7 65995, subd. (i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">C. <em>Contentions of the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">School District contends that \u201cSB 50 does not eliminate the requirement under CEQA for full disclosure of significant environmental effects of development on school services.\u201d School District argues that Government Code section 65996 \u201ccontemplates that the decision-maker on land use approvals has the advantage of a full analysis and disclosure of school-related environmental effects of a project, in order to consider alternative mitigation measures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">In contrast, County and real parties in interest contend that Senate Bill 50 strictly limits consideration, as well as mitigation, of school-related impacts. They argue that the addition of the words \u201cconsidering and\u201d in Government Code section 65996, subdivision (a) expands the statute beyond mitigation to include identification, analysis and evaluation. They also argue the change from \u201cenvironmental effects related to the adequacy of school facilities\u201d to \u201cimpacts on school facilities\u201d expanded the scope of the prohibition to include any impacts on a school district\u2019s ability to accommodate enrollment (i.e., overcrowding, interim facilities, permanent facilities and all other physical and financial aspects).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">D. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">A reviewing court\u2019s \u201cfundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Day v. City of Fontana </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 268, 272 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 457, 19 P.3d 1196].) This task begins by scrutinizing the actual words of the statute, giving them their usual, ordinary meaning. <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>McCutchen </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 476 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 319, 940 P.2d 906].) Courts sometimes obtain the ordinary meaning of words by referring to a dictionary. <em>(Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. City of Turlock </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 273, 294 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 420] [dictionary definitions used by this court in interpreting CEQA guidelines]; <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>County of Madera </em>(2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1502, 1514 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 101] [dictionary definitions used to interpret CEQA provisions].)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">The language in Government Code section 65996, subdivision (a) at issue in this case includes four changes enacted by Senate Bill 50. First, the former provision\u2019s phrase \u201cexclusive methods of mitigating\u201d was expanded to \u201cexclusive methods of considering and mitigating.\u201d Second, the term \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d was replaced with \u201cimpacts.\u201d Third, the term \u201crelated to\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>changed to \u201con.\u201d Fourth, the phrase \u201cthe adequacy of school facilities\u201d was shortened to \u201cschool facilities.\u201d As a result of these changes, Government Code section 65996, subdivision (a) now refers to \u201cthe exclusive methods of considering and mitigating impacts on school facilities . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The parties dispute the meaning of Senate Bill 50\u2019s addition of the word \u201cconsidering\u201d to the statute. No published case has addressed the meaning of this change, but one practice guide has stated: \u201cIn the authors\u2019 view, because the statute states that the statutory fees are the exclusive means of considering as well as mitigating school impacts, it limits not only the mitigation that may be required, but also the scope of impact review in the EIR and the findings for school impacts.\u201d (1 Kostka &amp; Zischke, Practice Under the Cal. Environmental Quality Act,, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 14.28, p. 717.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">The authors appear to believe the word \u201cconsidering\u201d encompasses (1) setting forth information in the EIR, (2) evaluating the information, and (3) using it to reach a decision about certifying the EIR and approving the project. (CEQA guidelines (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, \u00a7 15000 et seq.; CEQA Guidelines), \u00a7 15090, subd. (a)(2) [lead agency shall certify \u201cthat the decisionmaking body reviewed and <em>considered </em>the information contained in the final EIR prior to approving the project\u201d (italics added)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">The dictionary definition of the word \u201cconsider\u201d has been set forth in a published decision of the Court of Appeal: <em>\u201cConsider </em>is \u2018to view attentively ... to fix the mind on, with a view to careful examination; to think on with care; to ponder; to study; to meditate on . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Gonzales v. Interinsurance Exchange </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 58, 63 [148 Cal.Rptr. 282].) Under this definition, evidence is \u201cconsidered\u201d if it is weighed by the court. (Ibid.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">When this dictionary definition is plugged into the statute in place of the word \u201cconsidering,\u201d Government Code section 65996, subdivision (a) provides that the capped statutory fee and certain interim urgency measures \u201cshall be the exclusive methods of [viewing attentively, examining carefully, studying] and mitigating impacts on school facilities . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">Setting forth a description and analysis of impacts on school facilities in the EIR would be another method of examining and studying those impacts. Because the methods set forth in Government Code section 65996, subdivision (a) are exclusive, that provision obviates the need for an EIR to contain a description and analysis of a development\u2019s impacts on school facilities. Based on this interpretation, we reject School District\u2019s claim that the EIR violates CEQA because it lacks any analysis of the environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>consequences for the existing school facilities that will be forced to accommodate hundreds of students beyond current overcrowded conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Senate Bill 50\u2019s substitution of \u201cimpacts\u201d for \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d is not a change that is critical in this case. The terms \u201cimpacts\u201d and \u201ceffects\u201d are synonymous. (CEQA Guidelines, \u00a7 15358.)</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">Senate Bill 50\u2019s substitution of \u201con\u201d for \u201crelated to\u201d indicates a narrowing of the statute. The term \u201con\u201d has numerous definitions, including being \u201cused as a function word to indicate position over and in contact with that which supports from beneath\u201d and being \u201cused as a function word to indicate the object of action or motion . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1986) pp. 1574, 1575.) In contrast, the term \u201crelated to\u201d generally is interpreted broadly by courts. (E.g., <em>Bay Cities Paving &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Lawyers\u2019 Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 854, 873 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 691, 855 P.2d 1263] [term \u201crelated\u201d is broad and commonly understood to encompass both logical and causal connections]; <em>CPF Agency Corp. v. Sevel\u2019s 24 Hour Towing Service, supra, </em>132 Cal.App.4th at p. 1044 [\u201crelated to\u201d in federal preemption provision is interpreted quite broadly].) Use of the term \u201crelated to\u201d with \u201cenvironmental effect\u201d appears to include both direct effects on the school facilities and indirect effects on parts of the environment other than the school facilities. The CEQA Guidelines\u2019 definition of \u201ceffect\u201d uses the term \u201crelated to\u201d in its expansive description of indirect or secondary effects. (CEQA Guidelines, \u00a7 15358, subd. (a)(2).) In contrast to the breadth of \u201crelated to,\u201d the use of the term \u201con\u201d indicates a direct relationship between the object (i.e., school facilities) and the impact and excludes impacts to other parts of the physical environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">Consequently, the phrase \u201cimpacts on school facilities\u201d used in Senate Bill 50 does not cover all possible environmental impacts that have any type of connection or relationship to schools. As a matter of statutory interpretation, we conclude that the prepositional phrase \u201con school facilities\u201d limits the type of impacts that are excused from discussion or mitigation to the adverse physical changes to the school grounds and school buildings, and \u201cany school-related consideration relating to a school district\u2019s ability to accommodate enrollment.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65996, subd. (c).) Therefore, the project\u2019s indirect impacts on parts of the physical environment that are not school facilities are not excused from being considered and mitigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-7\">Applying this statutory construction leads us to conclude that an impact on traffic, even if that traffic is near a school facility and related to getting students to and from the facility, is not an impact \u201con school facilities\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>for purposes of Government Code section 65996, subdivision (a). From both a chronological and a molecular view of adverse physical change, the additional students traveling to existing schools will impact the roadways and traffic before they set foot on the school grounds. From a funding perspective, the capped school facilities fee will not be used by a school district to improve intersections affected by the traffic. Thus, it makes little sense to say that the impact on traffic is fully mitigated by the payment of the fee.  In summary, we conclude the impact on traffic is not an impact on school facilities and, as a result, the impact on traffic must be considered in the EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">The question about the construction of additional school facilities (either temporary or permanent) at an existing site is not as clear cut as the traffic issue because of the causal connection between the overcrowding created by the project\u2019s students and the construction to alleviate the overcrowding. We conclude, however, the reasonably foreseeable impacts of that construction on the nonschool physical environment are not \u201cimpacts on school facilities\u201d and are not excluded from consideration in the EIR. For illustrative purposes only, the impacts on the nonschool physical environment that might result from the construction include dust that degrades air quality and noise caused by the construction activity. These types of impacts to the nonschool physical environment are caused <em>indirectly </em>by the project and should be considered in the EIR. (See CEQA Guidelines, \u00a7 15358, subd. (a)(2) [indirect effects caused by the project].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">V.-VIII.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The judgment is reversed.
