J.</author>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Petitioner and plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate seeking to vacate respondent trial court\u2019s order abating plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death and survival causes of action because plaintiff, decedent\u2019s representative, did not join all known heirs under Code of Civil Procedure sections 377.60 and 382.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that the trial court erred in abating plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death cause of action and survival causes of action. Accordingly, we grant the petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Plaintiff Nancilee Adams (plaintiff) filed her complaint as the administrator of the estate of James C. Adams, deceased (decedent), alleging negligence, willful misconduct, and elder abuse in support of both her survival claim for decedent\u2019s injuries prior to his death, and also in support of her claim for decedent\u2019s wrongful death. Plaintiff named as defendants real parties in interest Centinella Freeman Regional Medical Center, Daniel Freeman Hospital (CFHS Holdings, Inc.), Country Villa Health Services, Inc., Country Villa East, L.P. (as the operator of a skilled nursing facility), and Dr. Ashwani Bhardwaj (collectively defendants).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiff admitted she did not represent decedent\u2019s heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Defendant Country Villa Health Services, Inc., moved under sections 377.60<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 382<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to abate the action for failure to join all necessary parties\u2014i.e., all of decedent\u2019s heirs\u2014which motion was joined by other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>defendants. Respondent trial court granted the motion to abate the action based on plaintiff\u2019s failure to join all the heirs as plaintiffs or as nominal defendants. Plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate against respondent trial court challenging the abatement of the causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Defendants contend that the heirs must either be joined in the action as plaintiffs or be named as nominal defendants and served with the summons and complaint because they are necessary parties. (See \u00a7\u00a7 377.60, 382, 389.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>) Defendants rely upon section 377.60, subdivision (a), which provides that a cause of action for wrongful death may be asserted by the persons \u201cwho would be entitled to the property of the decedent by intestate succession,\u201d including decedent\u2019s \u201csurviving spouse, domestic partner, children, and issue of deceased children\u201d \u201cor by the decedent\u2019s personal representative on their behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> California courts interpret the wrongful death statutes to \u201cauthorize only a single action, in which all the decedent\u2019s heirs must join.\u201d <em>(Romero v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 211, 216 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 236]; see <em>Gonzales </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Edison Co. </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 485, 489 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 530]; <em>Ruttenberg </em>v. <em>Ruttenberg </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 801, 807 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 78] <em>(Ruttenberg); Valdez v. Smith </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 723, 726 [212 Cal.Rptr. 638] <em>(Valdez).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In addition to contending that the wrongful death claim should be abated because plaintiff failed to join the decedent\u2019s heirs as parties, defendants cite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>section 377.62, subdivision (b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in arguing that the survival causes of action should also be abated because those causes of action\u2014negligence, willful misconduct, and elder abuse\u2014are so intertwined with, and based on the same underlying facts as, the wrongful death claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Plaintiff argues that an \u201cexception\u201d to the general rule requiring joinder of heirs applies in this case because section 377.60 purportedly allows for the decedent\u2019s personal representative to bring the action instead of an heir, who must join \u00bf11 wrongful death heirs. Accordingly, plaintiff concludes that the personal representative may act as the sole wrongful death plaintiff as, in effect, trustee for the wrongful death heirs, who are beneficiaries of the \u201ctrust,\u201d without joining the other heirs. Plaintiff also contends that the survival causes of action are not subject to abatement. Whether a plea of abatement is appropriate in this case is a question of law we review de novo. (See <em>People ex rel. Garamendi v. American Autoplan, Inc. </em>(1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 760, 770-771 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 192].) \u201c[A] pleading in abatement which, being dilatory in its nature, is to be strictly construed.\u201d <em>(Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1939) 36 Cal.App.2d 189, 192 [97 P.2d 845].)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">A. <em>Wrongful Death Cause of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">A wrongful death cause of action is a statutory claim providing compensation for specified heirs of the decedent for the loss they suffered as a result of the decedent\u2019s death. (\u00a7\u00a7 377.60-377.62; <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Superior Court </em>(2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1545, 1550-1551 [53 Cal.Rptr.3d 722] (SDGE).) The right to recover under a wrongful death theory is entirely statutory, and the wrongful death statutes create a new cause of action that did not exist in the common law. <em>(Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 564, 572-575 [139 Cal.Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122], disapproved on another point in <em>Ochoa </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 159, 168 [216 Cal.Rptr. 661, 703 P.2d 1].)  As specified in section 377.60, wrongful death actions may be brought by the heirs of the decedent or a personal representative on behalf of the heirs of the decedent. \u201c \u2018In stating that an action for wrongful death is joint, it is meant that all heirs should join or be joined in the action and that a single verdict should be rendered for all recoverable damages; when it is said that the action is single, it is meant that only one action for wrongful death may be brought whether, in fact, it is instituted by all or only one of the heirs, or by the personal representative of the decedent as statutory trustee for the heirs; and when it is said that action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>is indivisible, it is meant that there cannot be a series of suits by heirs against the tortfeasor for their individual damages.\u2019 [Citations.] [][] Because there is only a single action for wrongful death, an heir bringing the action should join all known heirs. If an heir refuses to join as a plaintiff, he or she may be named as a defendant, so all heirs are before the court in the same action.\u201d <em>(Smith v. Premier Alliance Ins. Co. </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 691, 696-697 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 461]; see <em>Cross v. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(1964) 60 Cal.2d 690, 694 [36 Cal.Rptr. 321, 388 P.2d 353]; <em>Ruttenberg, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th 801.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Defendants facing a wrongful death action in which all the heirs should have, but have not, been joined are entitled to move to abate the action. The California Supreme Court in holding that a wrongful death action by only a portion of the heirs is not the action authorized by statute said, \u201cAll the heirs should, therefore, join as plaintiffs in an action by heirs, and if the consent of any one who should be so joined cannot be obtained, he may be made a defendant [(\u00a7 382)]; . . . <em>where all the heirs are not joined, and timely objection is made on that ground by a defendant, the action should be abated, or, at least, the other heirs should be made </em>parties.\u201d <em>(Salmon </em>v. <em>Rathjens </em>(1907) 152 Cal. 290, 294-295 [92 P. 733], italics added; see <em>Valdez, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 730 [quoting <em>Salmon v. Rathjens].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">As a \u201cpersonal representative\u201d of the deceased, plaintiff may maintain the action on behalf of the heirs\u2014i.e., as \u201ca statutory trustee to recover damages for the benefit of the heirs.\u201d <em>(Ruiz v. Santa Barbara Gas etc. Co. </em>(1912) 164 Cal. 188, 192 [128 P. 330]; see <em>Estate of Riccomi </em>(1921) 185 Cal. 458, 460-464 [197 P. 97]; <em>California State Auto Assn., Inter-Ins. Bureau v. Jacobson </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 850, 852-853 [101 Cal.Rptr. 366] [\u201cit has long been established that [the personal representative] acts as a statutory trustee for the heirs, and that if there be no heir, there is no right of action in the personal representative\u201d].) Either the decedent\u2019s personal representative on behalf of the heirs or the specified heirs (either as plaintiffs or joined defendants) may assert the wrongful death claim\u2014but not both. (See <em>Scott v. Thompson </em>(2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1506, 1511 [109 Cal.Rptr.3d 846]; <em>Gordon v. Reynolds </em>(1960) 187 Cal.App.2d 472, 474 [10 Cal.Rptr. 73] [under former \u00a7 377, \u201c[e]ither the administratrix or the heirs, but not both, may sue, and if the administratrix sues, the heirs may not\u201d].) As the plaintiff is suing as the decedent\u2019s personal representative on behalf of the heirs, she cannot join the heirs as a party. (See also \u00a7 369, subd. (a) [personal representative in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>civil action \u201cmay sue without joining as parties the persons for whose benefit the action is prosecuted\u201d].)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s interrogatory response that she \u201cdoes not represent the heirs of the decedent in her capacity as personal representative of the estate\u201d is not inconsistent with her position. Plaintiff is a fiduciary of the heirs (14 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (10th ed. 2005) Wills and Probate, \u00a7 464, pp. 540-541 (Witkin)). In essence, she acts as a trustee <em>for </em>them <em>(Estate of Bryan </em>(1929) 99 Cal.App. 113, 116 [277 P. 1068]) and remains neutral when the heirs have conflicting claims. <em>(Estate of Bartsch </em>(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 885, 895-896; <em>Estate of Miller </em>(1968) 259 Cal.App.2d 536, 545 [66 Cal.Rptr. 756].) Technically, she does not necessarily \u201crepresent\u201d any or all of them in the proceeding. <em>(Johnston </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 54, 63 [181 P.2d 645] [executor not \u201cagent\u201d of heirs; \u201chis authority is derived from the will, and the control that is exercised over him is the control exercised by the probate court\u201d]; see also <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 201, 212 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 716, 990 P.2d 591] [\u201c \u2018The attorney for the trustee of a trust is not, by virtue of this relationship, also the attorney for the beneficiaries of the trust. The attorney represents only the trustee.\u2019 \u201d]; see also <em>Oasis West Realty, LLC </em>v. <em>Goldman </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 811 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 256, 250 P.3d 1115] [fiduciary relationship can exist apart from a representation].) Moreover, plaintiff\u2019s duties and obligations as decedent\u2019s personal representative are governed by law. (See Witkin, supra, \u00a7 464, p. 540.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Accordingly, the trial court should not have abated the wrongful death cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">B. <em>Survival Causes of Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Survival causes of action are governed by section 377.30, which provides: \u201cA cause of action that survives the death of the person entitled to commence an action or proceeding passes to the decedent\u2019s successor in interest, . . . and an action may be commenced by the decedent\u2019s personal representative or, if none, by the decedent\u2019s successor in interest.\u201d Thus, unlike a wrongful death action, a survival action is a cause of action that</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>existed while the decedent is alive and survives the decedent. The decedent\u2019s personal representative or successor in interest may commence that action. (\u00a7\u00a7 377.10, 377.30; <em>Grant v. McAuliffe </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 859, 864 [264 P.2d 944]; <em>Quiroz </em>v. <em>Seventh Ave. Center </em>(2006) 140 Cal.App.4th 1256, 1264 [45 Cal.Rptr.3d 222] [\u201cUnlike a cause of action for wrongful death, a survivor cause of action is not a new cause of action that vests in the heirs on the death of the decedent. It is instead a separate and distinct cause of action which belonged to the decedent before death but, by statute, survives that event. [Citation.]\u201d].) As the court in <em>SDGE, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at page 1553 stated, \u201cA survivor claim is also a statutory cause of action; however, unlike a wrongful death claim, the survival statutes do not <em>create </em>a cause of action but merely prevent the abatement of the decedent\u2019s cause of action and provide for its enforcement by the decedent\u2019s personal representative or successor in interest. [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">It appears that the trial court \u201cabated\u201d the survival causes of action because it abated the wrongful death cause of action. Having erred in abating the wrongful death cause of action, there was no basis for abating the survival causes of action. Moreover, because the survival statutes prevent the abatement of the cause of action of the injured person and provide for the enforcement of the cause of action by the personal representative of the deceased <em>(SDGE, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.4th at p. 1553), the respondent trial court had no discretion to abate the survival causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Section 377.31 states: \u201cOn motion after the death of a person who commenced an action or proceeding, the court shall allow a pending action or proceeding that does not abate to be continued by the decedent\u2019s personal representative or, if none, by the decedent\u2019s successor in interest.\u201d This provision recognizes that \u201cthe personal representative or successor in interest has an absolute right to be substituted for the decedent . . . .\u201d (22 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1992) appen. 4, pp. 895, 901, fn. 10, 932.) The reference in section 377.31 to an action that is not abated does not mean that a survival cause of action is subject to abatement because heirs are not named or related claims are abated. The reference to actions that might abate is to those certain causes of action that abate due to the death of a plaintiff, such as in a marital dissolution proceeding when the spouse dies before judgment of marriage dissolution. (See <em>In re Marriage of Drake </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1153 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 466]; <em>In re Marriage of Lisi </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1573 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 623].) Section 377.21 specifies that, \u201ca pending action or proceeding does not abate by the death of a party if the cause of action survives.\u201d Here the causes of action survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">A peremptory writ is hereby issued directing respondent trial court to modify its order of November 8, 2010, to provide that plaintiff\u2019s causes of action are not abated.
