Code, \u00a7 187).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They have filed separate appeals. Jaquez argues that the trial court erred by excluding evidence offered by the defense to impeach the primary prosecution witness, and the prosecutor committed misconduct by commenting upon his failure to testify. Ardoin complains that the trial court violated his due process and confrontation rights by giving a revised felony-murder instruction without reopening the case for argument, and denying a motion for mistrial based on admission of evidence of a statement made by his codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting the defense impeachment of the prosecution witness, and no improper comment on Jaquez\u2019s failure to testify occurred. We also conclude that the trial court erred by declining to reopen the case for defense argument after the felony-murder instruction was modified, but the error did not adversely impact the defense argument. Finally, we find no violation of Ardoin\u2019s confrontation rights by admission of evidence of a statement made by his codefendant Jaquez. Therefore, the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b134-11\">The victim, Rodney Tom, was found dead by San Francisco police officers in an upstairs bedroom of his home at 674 Goettingen Street in San Francisco about 8:00 on the evening of July 10, 2003. He was lying on the floor, with his head near a comer of the room. A long wire ligature was wrapped tightly around his left wrist, and a large pool of blood was visible on the carpet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>under his head and neck. Additional \u201ccast-off blood\u201d was found near the body on the carpet, low along the wall and on the door. The pattern of the \u201cblood spatter\u201d indicated that the blows or other events \u201ccausing the cast off\u201d occurred \u201cvery low near the floor or below two feet.\u201d Credit cards and other papers were strewn on the bed. Prescription pill vials were observed around the nightstands in the bedroom and in a nightstand drawer. A yellow nylon rope and newspaper were collected from the stairs leading from the entryway to the bedroom. Cash in the amount of $600 was discovered in a gold Mercedes parked in the garage. No drugs were found on the premises. Nor did the officers observe any signs of forced entry into the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Tom sustained \u201cmultiple traumatic\u201d sharp force and blunt force injuries, most of them superficial or at least not immediately life threatening, that were inflicted over \u201cmany minutes or hours.\u201d The primary and ultimately fatal slash wound was to the victim\u2019s neck, which severed his carotid artery and produced the \u201crapid exsanguination\u201d that caused his death. The presence of the ligature restraint and infliction of numerous wounds was \u201cconsistent with multiple individuals inflicting these injuries\u201d on the victim, and indicated that he was struggling during the attack. The coroner estimated that Tom had been \u201cdead for a few to several hours, but probably less than a day\u201d before his body was discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Toxicology reports revealed that not long before Tom\u2019s death he had ingested valium, methamphetamine, morphine, and cocaine, in amounts that did not cause his death. Tracks of needle marks on his arms and legs were evidence of \u201cskin popping\u201d that indicated habitual ingestion of drugs with the use of a needle. He also suffered from pulmonary emphysema and \u201cpoor circulation to the lower extremities\u201d that caused him \u201cdifficulty moving around.\u201d He was \u201cchronically ill\u201d and in a \u201cweakened state\u201d that impaired his ability to resist an attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Fingernail clippings were taken from the victim. \u201c[RJeddish material\u201d discovered on the inside and outside of one of the fingernail clippings tested positive for blood. Expert testimony was received that the genetic material might have been deposited under Tom\u2019s fingernail if he scratched the killer with his hands while \u201cresisting the assault.\u201d A DNA test of the blood and other \u201cdebris\u201d taken from one of the fingernail samples identified defendant Ardoin \u201cas a source of the minor profile.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The primary witness for the prosecution was Rebecca Burgos, who was the wife of defendant Jaquez when the murder was committed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Burgos admittedly has been a drug addict essentially all of her life, and continued to be a drug addict both when the murder occurred and when she testified at trial. She suffered prior convictions for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon in 1987, and possession of a controlled substance while in custody in 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Burgos testified that she became acquainted with the victim in 2001, and thereafter regularly purchased heroin from him. Tom, in turn, introduced Burgos to Jaquez in February of 2003, and they were married a month later. They began living in the downstairs \u201cin-law apartment\u201d of Tom\u2019s residence on Goettingen Street in late February of 2003. Burgos and Jaquez did not pay rent for the apartment. Rather, their agreement with Tom called for them to pay the utilities for the entire residence, \u201cbuy food,\u201d and do some cooking. Burgos described their ongoing relationship with Tom as \u201cgood.\u201d She testified that she viewed Tom \u201clike a father\u201d figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Tom was a drug dealer who often had \u201ca whole lot of drugs\u201d in his residence. He also kept a .22-caliber revolver inside a sock in his tackle box. Jaquez sold drugs \u201cfor himself\u2019 and for Tom. Burgos weighed, packaged and sometimes delivered cocaine and heroin. Tom obtained his drugs from a supplier, a Hispanic male, every week or every two weeks. When the supplier was scheduled to appear at Tom\u2019s residence, he directed Burgos and Jaquez to \u201cstay downstairs.\u201d Tom would then knock on the floor to let them know when the supplier had left.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Burgos became acquainted with defendant Ardoin in 2003. By March of 2003 and thereafter, Burgos saw Ardoin quite frequently, when she and Jaquez visited his residence on Charter Oak Avenue to socialize or bring him drugs for his customers. Burgos testified that Ardoin would typically page Jaquez when he \u201chad customers that wanted to purchase drugs.\u201d She and Jaquez would then take the drugs \u201cto his house.\u201d They also often used heroin and crack cocaine with Ardoin and his girlfriend Michelle Reese.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">By July of 2003, Burgos quit her job as an X-ray technician, and Jaquez worked only infrequently. They used \u201ca lot of drugs\u201d daily, and as a consequence were \u201cbroke.\u201d They failed to pay the bills for the residence, so in June of 2003 Tom told them to move out by August 1st. As a result, their relationship with Tom became strained and \u201cedgy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Burgos was aware that on July 9, 2003, Tom received a large delivery of drugs from his supplier. After the supplier left, Burgos observed the drugs in Tom\u2019s tackle box and on the kitchen table. That evening, Jaquez and Burgos visited the home of friends on Palou Avenue to get \u201chigh.\u201d After \u201ca few more stops\u201d they returned home to the \u201cin-law\u201d unit at Tom\u2019s residence. Two to four hours later Jaquez left without telling Burgos where he was going. Later still, Tom called Burgos on the intercom to tell her to \u201ccome upstairs\u201d to his bedroom to receive a call from Jaquez. Around 2:00 a.m., Jaquez called and told Burgos that Tom \u201cwas going to give [her] something,\u201d meaning drugs, \u201cto give to him.\u201d Jaquez also asked her to get Tom \u201csomething to eat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Burgos agreed and left the house, only to return a few minutes later because she \u201cforgot to get the drugs\u201d from Tom. She parked her car in the driveway and walked through the open gate to the front door, which atypically was not locked. Burgos saw Ardoin standing in front of their in-law apartment, looking up the stairs toward Tom\u2019s residence. Suddenly, Burgos was grabbed from behind in the entryway, thrown to the ground on her stomach, and \u201chogtied\u201d with her hands bound to her ankles with a rope. She did not see the person who restrained her. Burgos struggled, and heard a voice which she recognized as that of Jaquez tell her to \u201cget down\u201d and \u201cjust stay still.\u201d After she was restrained, Burgos also saw Ardoin \u201cgo up the stairs\u201d with a \u201cHalloween Jason mask\u201d on his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">From upstairs Burgos heard pounding, banging, scuffling and odd \u201csnapping\u201d noises. She also heard Tom repeatedly say, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything.\u201d Burgos yelled to Tom: \u201cRodney, if you have anything, please give it to him, please give it to him.\u201d She continued to hear banging, and Tom stated, \u201cThere, now go.\u201d After Tom yelled, \u201cHere they come,\u201d and banged his foot, \u201cit got quiet.\u201d Ardoin then came down the stairs with Tom\u2019s \u201ctackle box that he kept his drugs in.\u201d He stepped over Burgos, walked out of the front door, and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Burgos struggled to release her arms from the rope and untie her ankles. She went up the stairs to \u201ccheck on\u201d Tom in his bedroom. Tom was lying on his stomach with a piece of carpet over his head. Burgos approached Tom and noticed \u201ca slash in his throat\u201d and \u201ca lot\u201d of blood under his head. She \u201cpanicked,\u201d grabbed Tom\u2019s cell phone and ran out of the room. She called Ardoin\u2019s number, but his girlfriend Reese said Jaquez \u201cwasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">As Burgos sat on the floor of Tom\u2019s residence, Jaquez called. When Burgos answered he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Burgos, still in a panicked state, screamed that Tom was dead and Ardoin had killed him. She asked Jaquez to get her out of there, and he agreed to do so. When Jaquez arrived at the house he said, \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go,\u201d and they proceeded to the in-law apartment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Burgos was still \u201cfreaked out,\u201d crying, and continued to yell \u201cRodney is dead.\u201d Jaquez implored Burgos to \u201ccalm down.\u201d He told her, \u201cI didn\u2019t know this was going to happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">They drove to Ardoin\u2019s house, where Burgos noticed Tom\u2019s tackle box. Ardoin was \u201cseparating the dope\u201d stolen from Tom and dividing it among the three of them. Burgos testified that Jaquez took her share of the drugs. Ardoin suggested that Burgos call the police with a concocted story that she had been robbed. Burgos \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She was \u201cfreaked out\u201d that her friend Tom had been killed and \u201cafraid of going to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">After an hour Burgos and Jaquez left Ardoin\u2019s house. They decided that they \u201cwere going to go to Florida.\u201d After a few \u201cdrug transactions\u201d they went to a Howard Johnson\u2019s hotel early in the morning. Jaquez left the hotel while Burgos slept until the afternoon. She and Jaquez then left the hotel in an old brown car that belonged to a friend, Preston Ely. They discussed a plan to \u201ccover up Rodney\u2019s murder\u201d whereby Burgos would be restrained and \u201cthrown in McLaren Park.\u201d She would then \u201cget loose\u201d and contact the police with a false report that she had been \u201crobbed\u201d and deposited in the park by the men who \u201ckilled Rodney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Burgos and Jaquez proceeded to a drug store, where Jaquez purchased duct tape. From there, they drove to McLaren Park, where Burgos was placed on her stomach by Jaquez, with her wrists, feet and mouth taped. Jaquez then hid the drugs elsewhere in the park. Burgos fell asleep, and awoke near dark. She loosened the duct tape and hopped to the street. A woman picked her up, the tape was removed from her mouth, and she was taken to a pay phone to call the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The police arrived in response to her call and took Burgos to the Ingleside station. She was interviewed, and photographs were taken of her with tape on her wrists. Burgos fabricated a tale that two Black men and a woman had appeared at Tom\u2019s house, robbed and killed him \u201cfor his drugs,\u201d restrained and kidnapped her, then left her in the park. She added false descriptions of the suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Ardoin was arrested for Tom\u2019s murder at his brother\u2019s residence on May 11, 2004, following the discovery of his DNA in a sample taken from one of the victim\u2019s fingernails. On July 11, 2004, both Jaquez and Burgos were arrested pursuant to a warrant served at a residence occupied by Rolley Hill and Christina Matthews at 1087 Palou Avenue in San Francisco. Various narcotics worth a \u201cconsiderable amount\u201d of money, including heroin, crack cocaine, methamphetamine, and prescription pill bottles that appeared to correspond to those found in Tom\u2019s house, along with crack pipes, a scale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>plastic packaging material, and a \u201cmethadone card\u201d with \u201cBurgos <em>[sic] </em>photo and name on it\u201d were seized from a bedroom in the house. Jaquez and Burgos were subsequently charged with possession of narcotics for sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Even after Burgos was arrested for Tom\u2019s murder and was confronted with considerable doubt cast upon her account of the crime\u2014in the form of a receipt from the Howard Johnson\u2019s hotel when she was supposedly restrained in McLaren Park\u2014she continued to give essentially the same fictitious story during subsequent interviews and in her testimony at a hearing in the present case. Burgos claimed that she repeatedly lied to protect her husband Jaquez and herself, and because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to tell on anybody.\u201d About six months before trial, Burgos decided to \u201ctell the truth about what happened\u201d after Jaquez repeatedly lied to her and refused to come forward and \u201csay what they did\u201d to protect her. She also received a threatening letter from Jaquez while she was incarcerated in county jail. Burgos denied that she assisted in any way with the killing of Tom by Ardoin and Jaquez. She acknowledged that her plea bargain, in which she agreed to plead guilty to being an accessory after the fact, was an appropriate disposition for her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The prosecution presented additional evidence in an effort to indirectly corroborate Burgos\u2019s testimony. Jia Zhang, a Luxor taxicab driver testified that he picked up two Hispanic men in their \u201cmid-40\u2019s\u201d on Charter Oak Avenue, near the 101 Freeway, at 4:31 a.m. Three minutes later he dropped them off at the intersection of Dwight Street and Girard Street, two short blocks from Goettingen Street. In August of 2003, the police exhibited a photo lineup to Zhang. He made a \u201c50/50\u201d identification of Ardoin\u2019s photo as one of the men in his cab that morning. Zhang was not able to make an identification of Jaquez in another photo lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Maritza Santiago, the mother of Jaquez\u2019s two sons, testified that she was \u201cromantically involved\u201d with Jaquez in the early 1990\u2019s. In July of 2003, Jaquez continued to visit her house at 391 Bridgeview Drive in San Francisco regularly to \u201csee his kids.\u201d Jaquez appeared at her house two or three days before Tom was killed. He was \u201cbroke,\u201d hungry, and appeared \u201cstressed out.\u201d Jaquez told Santiago that \u201cit was a big mistake\u201d for him to be involved with Burgos.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Jaquez\u2019s son Eric testified that on July 9, 2003,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Jaquez appeared at the house on Bridgeview Drive about 8:00 p.m. During the course of their conversation, Eric asked if Jaquez had \u201ca couple of dollars,\u201d but Jaquez said \u201che didn\u2019t have it.\u201d In response to Jaquez\u2019s request Eric loaned him a cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Eric\u2019s cousin, Juan Henry Pena, also lived in Santiago\u2019s Bridgeview Drive residence in July of 2003. Pena testified that on the afternoon of July 9, 2003, Jaquez came by the house to borrow his cell phone. Pena met Jaquez in Silver Terrace Park the next afternoon; Jaquez seemed \u201cnervous.\u201d He returned the cell phone to Pena, along with a pager. Jaquez told Pena that \u201che went home . . . looking for his wife and that when he got there, the house was a mess.\u201d He saw Tom \u201con the floor with a bunch of blood around him,\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Later the same afternoon, Pena gave Jaquez a ride. They drove past Tom\u2019s house at 674 Goettingen Street where Jaquez lived with Burgos. Police cars were parked outside the house. Pena drove Jaquez to the Franciscan Motel on Third Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Preston Ely, known to his friends as \u201cStevie,\u201d was acquainted with defendants and saw both of them frequently in July of 2003, usually about \u201cdrugs.\u201d Ely often lived in his half-ton van that he parked \u201coff of Third Street,\u201d near Jamestown Avenue, in the Bayview District. Ely acknowledged that he used and sold drugs. Ely testified that between 10:00 and 11:00 on the morning of July 10, 2003, Jaquez, whom he knew as \u201cBeto,\u201d arrived unexpectedly and asked to \u201ctrade cars.\u201d Ely agreed, and exchanged his brown Ford Granada for Jaquez\u2019s Mitsubishi van. Ely also agreed to loan Jaquez his cell phone in exchange for speed and crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Later that evening Jaquez visited Ely in his room at the Franciscan Motel on Third Street. Jaquez complained that Ely\u2019s Ford Granada \u201cran out of gas\u201d in McLaren Park, and Jaquez left it there. Jaquez told Ely that he had seen his landlord, a \u201cChinese dude\u201d who lived upstairs from him, \u201clying there with his throat cut.\u201d Jaquez stated that he was \u201chaving problems getting drugs\u201d from Tom, and was \u201cbeing put out\u201d of his residence for failing to pay rent. Jaquez received phone calls while he was at Ely\u2019s motel room. He became \u201cvery upset,\u201d and \u201cstarted crying.\u201d In reference to the \u201cChinese dude getting killed,\u201d Jaquez told Ely, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it, it wasn\u2019t me. It wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d Jaquez also mentioned that he had placed duct tape on a woman in McLaren Park and \u201cthat he was going to call the police\u201d to \u201ccome get her and use that as an alibi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">After their conversation in the motel room, Jaquez and Ely drove to McLaren Park in the Mitsubishi to \u201cfind the drugs\u201d Jaquez and Burgos had previously concealed there. Jaquez left the car to search in the park, but did not return with anything. They drove back to the Franciscan Motel. On the way they fortuitously encountered Burgos on the street, and she joined them. Later still, the three of them returned to the same place in the park, where Burgos promptly found the hidden drugs. They went back to the motel room and ingested drugs before Jaquez and Burgos left. Ely testified that in the motel room Burgos was \u201chollering\u201d and \u201cbossing around\u201d people, particularly Jaquez.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Ely further testified that about eight months before trial he received a call from Jaquez, who told him to \u201cstay out of it, he got the case beat, to stay out of it.\u201d Jaquez sounded \u201cserious,\u201d and Ely felt \u201cthreatened.\u201d Ely entered the witness protection program in December of 2006. He was relocated by the prosecution, and received both a \u201cliving place\u201d and expenses from the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The prosecution also presented evidence of records of calls made with the telephones owned, borrowed, or used by defendants on or near the date of the murder. The records revealed numerous calls between them on July 10, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Ardoin testified in his defense at trial that he and Jaquez were \u201cvery close\u201d friends for many years. He met Burgos just after she married Jaquez in 2003. Ardoin considered Burgos to be aggressive, pushy, manipulative, and not entirely honest.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Ardoin acknowledged that he was a drug addict, who not only used cocaine, crack, heroin and methamphetamine regularly, but also sold drugs \u201cevery day.\u201d He and Jaquez often used drugs together. Ardoin was also acquainted with Tom as a supplier of heroin, who dealt larger amounts of drugs than he did. Ardoin bought drugs from Tom occasionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">According to Ardoin, Tom visited Ardoin\u2019s residence on Charter Oak Avenue the afternoon before Tom was killed. Tom brought with him a half-ounce of \u201cnew heroin.\u201d Ardoin sought to explain the DNA evidence by testifying that Tom injected him with heroin, and in the process drops of blood ran down his arm. After testing the heroin and determining that it \u201cwas good,\u201d Ardoin bought a quarter-ounce from Tom.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">About 4:00 a.m. on July 10, 2003, Jaquez called to tell Ardoin that \u201che was coming over\u201d to his house. They intended to \u201cbuy some coke together.\u201d While Ardoin and Tom were in the shed, Burgos called, \u201chollering and screaming\u201d that she \u201cneeded to talk to her husband.\u201d After a brief telephone conversation with Burgos, Jaquez\u2019s expression changed \u201cin a bad way.\u201d He was anxious and angry. Jaquez asked Ardoin to accompany him to his house. Ardoin agreed, although he expressed that he was \u201cwalking with a cane\u201d at the time and could not offer much assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">Jaquez and Ardoin took a cab to a residence near Brussels Street and Dwight Street. Jaquez \u201cwent up the stairs to the house\u201d while Ardoin waited on the street. Within 30 seconds Jaquez returned and told Ardoin to \u201churry up\u201d and follow him up the hill to Tom\u2019s house on Goettingen Street. As Ardoin reached Jaquez\u2019s green Mitsubishi, he noticed Jaquez coming out of a gate into the house, followed by Burgos. Burgos was disheveled, with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>hair \u201cmessed up,\u201d and was carrying a tackle box by the handle. She was \u201chollering and screaming\u201d at Jaquez, who was carrying a plastic garbage bag with something inside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">They all got in the Mitsubishi to drive to Ardoin\u2019s house. Ardoin asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Burgos yelled at him, \u201cRodney\u2019s dead.\u201d Jaquez then \u201cslammed on the brake\u201d and looked at Burgos in \u201cshock.\u201d When they reached Ardoin\u2019s house, Burgos said \u201csomething\u201d to Ardoin with an \u201cangry and wild\u201d look which he took as a threat. Ardoin testified that he did not see Jaquez again until \u201c2004 in court,\u201d although he spoke to him on the telephone a week or so after the murder. They did not \u201ctalk about what happened.\u201d Ardoin helped Burgos move her belongings out of the Goettingen Street residence \u201ca couple of days later,\u201d and continued to take drugs and socialize with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Ardoin denied that he went into Tom\u2019s house the day of the murder or assisted anyone with the robbery and murder of Tom. He conceded that he lied in interviews with the police, to protect Jaquez and Burgos. Ardoin also agreed that the presence of his DNA under the victim\u2019s fingernails was \u201cimportant in this case,\u201d and he had \u201cno idea how that happened.\u201d Ardoin speculated that blood reached the victim\u2019s fingernails during the intravenous injection of heroin the day before the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Ardoin presented evidence that his back was injured and he walked with a cane in July of 2003 as a result of back surgery in December of 2002. In addition, he had severe pain in both shoulders. He was taking methadone, Vicodin, codeine, and \u201ca lot of other medications\u201d for pain at that time. He had trouble walking, bending, twisting or squatting. Ardoin\u2019s medical records and testimony from his physicians and a health worker for the San Francisco Department of Public Health corroborated his testimony that he suffered from shoulder, back and leg maladies, which severely compromised his balance, mobility and strength. Medical records indicated that Ardoin walked with a cane and took medication for his chronic pain. Ardoin\u2019s physicians posited that if he was truthful in reporting his symptoms and injuries to them, he would have been capable only with great \u201cdifficulty\u201d of carrying any heavy items, overcoming a resisting victim, or stabbing a victim multiple times by himself during an attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\n<em>The Appeal of Jaquez</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">I. <em>The Exclusion of Proffered. Defense Evidence to Impeach Burgos. (Joined by Ardoin.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Defendants argue that the trial court erred by excluding evidence offered by the defense to impeach Burgos. Prior to trial Jaquez moved to present as impeachment evidence of prior acts by Burgos that reflected on her \u201cdishonesty and tendencies towards acts of violence and moral turpitude,\u201d which included the circumstances of her 1988 convictions for robbery and assault with a deadly weapon: That Burgos approached the victim, solicited for an act of prostitution, and directed him to drive his vehicle to a \u201cdead end,\u201d where she produced a handgun and ordered him to give her his wallet, money, and keys; as Burgos\u2019s codefendant, Payne, approached the rear of the vehicle, her attention was diverted momentarily, whereupon the victim grabbed the gun, which fired a shot through the driver\u2019s side window; after Payne then stabbed the victim several times in the neck and chest, he and Burgos both \u201cfled the scene.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Burgos entered a guilty plea to charges of robbery and assault with a deadly weapon after a charge of attempted murder was dismissed. She offered a different version of the incident in her statement to the police, in which she denied that Payne had any \u201cinvolvement\u201d in the crimes, although she did not testify on behalf of Payne at his trial, and made \u201cstatements to the judge inculpating\u201d Payne during an in-chambers hearing on a motion for acquittal of the attempted murder charge under section 1118.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">At a hearing on the motion the defense also asked to offer evidence that while Burgos was incarcerated awaiting trial in the present case she attempted through her boyfriend Dennis Torres and her attorney to have drugs delivered to her in county jail. The effort was unsuccessful and did not result in charges, but Burgos was subsequently convicted for possession of heroin in jail based on a separate incident. Jaquez argued that the evidence was admissible under Evidence Code section 788 to demonstrate Burgos\u2019s \u201cmoral depravity,\u201d dishonesty, manipulation of others, and propensity to acts of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">The trial court granted the motion to impeach Burgos with evidence of the fact of her 1988 robbery and assault with a deadly weapon convictions, and with the 2006 conviction for possession of drugs in San Francisco County Jail, but excluded evidence of the particular circumstances of the offenses and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>her statements related to the offenses. The \u201cconduct concerning conspiracy to smuggle drugs in San Francisco County Jail\u201d through Burgos\u2019s boyfriend and attorney was also excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Defendants assert that the excluded impeachment evidence proved Burgos \u201cwas a violent criminal who manipulated the judicial system when it suited her purpose,\u201d and thus \u201cwas material to the defense theory that Burgos was not, as she claimed, an accessory after the fact to the Tom homicide, but an active participant in the crime, if not the sole perpetrator of it.\u201d Defendants maintain that the evidence of \u201cBurgos\u2019s true character\u201d was more relevant to the defense than the mere fact of the prior convictions, and was necessary evidence to show that she \u201cwas not simply a dishonest drug addict,\u201d but rather a person who lied, \u201cmanipulated others to her advantage\u201d and was capable of acts of violence. They claim that \u201cexclusion of evidence this relevant\u201d to the credibility of the prosecution\u2019s main witness violated their \u201crights to confrontation, to present a defense, and to due process\u201d under the California and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">We begin our analysis with recognition of the fundamental constitutional premise that, \u201c \u2018[T]he right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal.

(Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 786, 787, 788; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1222, 1270 [232 Cal.Rptr. 849, 729 P.2d 115].)

(See <em>People v. McClellan </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 793, 809 [80 Cal.Rptr. 31, 457 P.2d 871]; <em>People v.

In the present case the trial court did not categorically exclude evidence of the details and circumstances surrounding Burgos\u2019s prior convictions. Rather, the court properly recognized and engaged in the requisite Evidence Code section 352 analysis before limiting the admission of the impeachment evidence. \u201cAlthough <em>Wheeler, supra, 4 </em>Cal.4th 284, allows for impeaching a witness in a criminal case with evidence of moral turpitude, it cautions that trial courts should consider with \u2018particular care\u2019 whether to allow such evidence.\u201d <em>(People v.

[Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018The statute empowers courts to prevent criminal trials from degenerating into nitpicking wars of attrition over collateral credibility issues . ... [][].. . Moreover, impeachment evidence other than felony convictions entails problems of proof, unfair surprise, and moral turpitude evaluation which felony convictions do not present.

First and foremost, the defense had both the opportunity and the evidentiary substance to thoroughly challenge Burgos\u2019s credibility without the excluded evidence. Not only did the fact of the prior convictions and her admitted use of a firearm during the robbery and assault offenses adequately indicate her violent nature and moral indigence, but her character and testimony were thoroughly challenged with withering and successful attacks on many other levels. She was effectively portrayed as an inveterate drug addict who admittedly sold drugs and \u201cwent to great lengths\u201d to have others bring drugs to her in jail. She admitted and the prosecutor conceded that she lied incessantly to the police and to others to further her perceived interests. Testimony was received from others that</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Burgos was manipulative, controlling, and subject to unruly outbursts. Burgos admitted as much. During closing argument defense counsel stressed her dishonesty, repeated and elaborate fabrications, and palpable moral deficiencies. Further, the extent to which the jury accepted Burgos\u2019s testimony was clearly not attributable to the inability of the defense to attack her character or inherent lack of credibility\u2014which effectively occurred\u2014but rather to the corroboration of her version of the murder, particularly by the DNA evidence and Ely\u2019s consistent testimony. Thus, while the excluded impeachment evidence may have augmented the showing that Burgos lacked credibility, it was cumulative, and, in our view, would not have produced a perceptibly different impression of her credibility. (See <em>People v. Singleton, supra, </em>182 Cal.App.4th 1, 18-19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Cross-examination is subject to restriction under Evidence Code section 352 if it is cumulative or if it constitutes impeachment on collateral issues. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mincey </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 408, 439-440 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 827 P.2d 388]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morse </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 620, 641-642 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 343].) The trial court\u2019s wide discretion under Evidence Code section 352 to limit cross-examination is not abused by the exclusion of impeachment evidence which has only marginal probative value. <em>(Wheeler, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th 284, 295-296; <em>People v. Dyer </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 26, 48 [246 Cal.Rptr. 209, 753 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bento </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 179, 195 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 412].) \u201cMoreover, reliance on Evidence Code section 352 to exclude evidence of marginal impeachment value that would entail the undue consumption of time generally does not contravene a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th 518, 545.)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">We do not suggest that the probative value of the excluded collateral acts evidence was inconsequential, but we agree with the trial court that it was outweighed by the confusion of issues and considerable amount of time required to present it. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tuggles </em>(2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 339, 363 [100 Cal.Rptr.3d 339].) Candidly, the defense had already spent itself on what can be characterized as an assaultive cross-examination of Burgos. Had the evidence been admitted, the trial would have digressed into a lengthy dispute over the collateral matters related to the facts of Burgos\u2019s 1988 convictions, the truthfulness of her statements in that criminal proceeding, and her attempt to use her boyfriend and unwitting attorney to obtain drugs in jail. \u201c \u2018[T]he latitude [Evidence Code] section 352 allows for exclusion of impeachment evidence in individual cases is broad.

Ardoin complains that his \u201cdue process right to a fair trial\u201d and his right to \u201ceffective assistance of counsel\u201d were denied by the felony-murder instructions that essentially introduced a novel and distinct basis for his conviction after closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Ardoin\u2019s contention requires that we engage in a recitation in some detail of the rather convoluted procedural history of the case that culminated in the challenged felony-murder instructions. Ardoin was charged with first degree murder with malice aforethought as the direct perpetrator of the murder of Tom, and the case against him proceeded on that theory at trial. Codefendant Jaquez, in contrast, was charged with and prosecuted under aiding-and-abetting and felony-murder theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Nevertheless the evidence presented at trial was also susceptible to interpretations that both defendants directly and conjointly participated in the robbery and murder of the victim, or that either of them may have perpetrated the robbery and aided and abetted the other to commit the murder. During closing argument, the prosecutor thoroughly discussed the felony-murder and aiding-and-abetting theories, with reference to Jaquez, but also without delineation of which of the two codefendants was guilty'under those theories. Ardoin was characterized by the prosecutor as the \u201cperpetrator\u201d or the \u201clead in this killing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">Defense counsel emphasized during closing argument that Ardoin did not have the \u201cphysical capacity\u201d to restrain and assault the victim. Counsel suggested that in light of Ardoin\u2019s documented physical infirmities the prosecution had been forced to \u201cabandon\u201d the theory that he personally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u201csubdued and killed\u201d Tom in favor of a \u201cspeculative theory\u201d that he \u201cwasn\u2019t necessarily the killer,\u201d but instead \u201csomehow helped\u201d with the murder. Counsel mentioned \u201ctwo scenarios\u201d presented by the prosecution in the case: one that indicated Ardoin was \u201ca killer,\u201d and the other that sought to convict him as an \u201caider or abettor and not actually the killer.\u201d Counsel also argued that the prosecutor \u201cchanged the theory\u201d of murder against Ardoin to \u201caiding and abetting.\u201d Then, defense counsel proceeded to engage in argument, with references to the evidence, that the prosecution failed to prove the \u201cnew aiding-and-abetting theory\u201d that was \u201cbased only on speculation\u201d and was contrary to the testimony of prime prosecution witness Burgos. Therefore, defense counsel presented these alternative theories in his attack on the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case against Ardoin.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">. During rebuttal argument the prosecutor underscored that both codefendants, and perhaps Burgos as well, had a \u201crole\u201d in Tom\u2019s death. The prosecutor advised the jurors to find that if defendants pursued a \u201cconcerted action\u201d to murder Tom, they could both be found guilty under either the felony-murder rule or as direct perpetrators of the offense. Review of the transcripts convinces us that counsel for the prosecution and Ardoin posited the legal theories of murder (premeditation and felony murder) in their arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Following argument, the felony-murder and aiding-and-abetting instructions (CALCRIM Nos. 540B &amp; 401) agreed upon by the parties and given to the jury referred only to Jaquez. However, all counsel were aware of, and had settled on, the jury instructions before final argument began. The court also instructed the jury that each charge against each defendant must be considered separately, and: \u201cUnless I tell you otherwise or unless it\u2019s stated in the instructions, all instructions apply to each defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">During deliberations, the jury asked in a note given to the court: \u201cIf we believe that Eric Ardoin was not the perpetrator of the murder, can we still find him guilty under a theory of felony murder, or otherwise?\u201d The prosecutor suggested that the court either reply in the affirmative, with reference to CALCRIM No. 540B, or further instruct the jury in some form that the principles of CALCRIM No. 540B \u201care applicable to . . . any charged defendant\u201d in the case. Defense counsel objected on several grounds: first, that the prosecution proceeded on the theory that Ardoin was \u201cthe direct perpetrator,\u201d and the evidence did not support a felony-murder theory against him; second, that closing argument on behalf of Ardoin was based on the concept that the felony-murder theory did not include him; and third, that to \u201cessentially change the instructions\u201d to include Ardoin in the felony-murder theory \u201cwould be prejudicial\u201d to him since the defense \u201cdid not argue the issue.\u201d The defense recommended that the court merely refer \u201cthe jury to all the instructions in their entirety as to what legal bases they can use\u201d to find Ardoin \u201ceither guilty or not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The trial court noted that the reference to Jaquez alone in the CALCRIM No. 540B instruction was some form of computer \u201cprogram\u201d error that failed to include both defendants. The court proposed to clarify CALCRIM No. 540B by advising the jury that the instruction \u201cis applicable to any charged defendant.\u201d Defense counsel continued to object to \u201capplying the felony-murder theory now\u201d to Ardoin, based on the lack of substantial evidence to support it, and the \u201clateness of the application of the theory of liability to him after closing argument.\u201d The trial court decided to further instruct the jurors that they \u201cmay only find the defendant guilty under the instructions provided,\u201d and that the \u201cfelony-murder instruction may apply to either defendant if the jury finds that each of the elements has been proven.\u201d Regrettably, the original trial court judge left on vacation before responding to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">At the next court session, Ardoin\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial or to reopen argument, while the jury reaffirmed the need for guidance on the issue of the felony-murder rule as applied to Ardoin. After reviewing the previously given instructions and particularly the closing arguments given by defense counsel, the substitute trial judge observed that defense counsel referred on \u201cnumerous occasions\u201d to aiding and abetting as a \u201cnew theory\u201d in the case. Despite counsel\u2019s protest that his aiding-and-abetting closing argument was \u201cin passing,\u201d and would have been more thorough, particularly as to the \u201cintent element\u201d of aiding and abetting, the \u201cspecifics\u201d of the evidence of encouraging or promoting the crime, and the natural and probable consequences aspect of the felony-murder rule, the defense motion for mistrial or to reopen argument was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">A \u201cnew and revised\u201d CALCRIM No. 540B instruction was given to the jury that, the court explained, \u201creplaces the instruction that was given to you originally.\u201d Instead of referring only to <em>Jaquez, </em>the instruction stated: \u201cThe defendants are charged with murder. <em>All defendants may be guilty of murder under a theory of felony murder, </em>even if another person did the act that resulted in the death.\u201d (Italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court then proceeded to repeat the elements of felony murder previously stated in the CALCRIM No. 540B instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Ardoin argues that the trial court deprived him of the rights to effective assistance of counsel and due process by instructing the jury \u201con a new theory of liability after the start of deliberations\u201d without granting his request to \u201creopen argument to address\u201d the felony-murder theory. Ardoin claims that</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>he \u201cwas not informed of the new theory of non-killer felony murder until <em>after </em>closing argument and during jury deliberations.\u201d Therefore, his argument continues, his right to counsel was abridged \u201cbecause \u2018that right is . . . meaningless unless counsel knows and has a satisfactory opportunity to respond to the charges against which he or she must defend.\u2019 \u201d (See <em>Sheppard v. Rees </em>(9th Cir. 1989) 909 F.2d 1234, 1237 <em>(Sheppard).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We begin our analysis with the observation that despite the failure of the prosecution to specifically charge Ardoin with murder committed in the course of an enumerated felony in violation of section 189, he was not denied his notice or due process rights when the trial court gave felony-murder and aiding-and-abetting instructions to the jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The California Supreme Court has repeatedly and definitively declared that felony murder (\u00a7 189) and premeditated murder (\u00a7 187) are not separate crimes, but rather different varieties of the same crime, so a defendant may be convicted of felony murder even though the information charged only murder with malice. <em>(People v. Letner and Tobin </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 99, 140-141 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 746, 235 P.3d 62]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawthorne </em>(2009) 46 Cal.4th 67, 89 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 330, 205 P.3d 245]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 593, 617 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 753, 170 P.3d 129].) \u201c[Although the two forms of murder have different elements, only a single statutory offense of murder exists. Felony murder and premeditated murder are not distinct crimes, and need not be separately pleaded.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nakahara </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 705, 712 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 223, 68 P.3d 1190].) From the murder charge and the evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing and at trial Ardoin received constitutionally adequate notice of the necessity to defend against a felony-murder theory of liability. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 386, 413 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 280, 247 P.3d 515]; <em>Letner, supra, </em>at p. 141.) Thus, the trial court correctly instructed on felony murder, and the jury, in returning a general verdict for first degree murder, did not improperly convict Ardoin of an uncharged offense. <em>(Hawthorne, supra, </em>at p. 89; <em>Morgan, supra, </em>at p. 617.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Further, the jury was not required to agree unanimously whether defendant was the actual perpetrator of the murder or the other participant in the crime. <em>(People v. Alexander </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 846, 921 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 190, 235 P.3d 873]; <em>People v. Majors </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 385, 408 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 684, 956 P.2d 1137]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 377, 386 [220 Cal.Rptr. 374, 708 P.2d 1252].) \u201cIt is settled that as long as each juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant is guilty of murder as that offense is defined by statute, it need not decide unanimously by which theory he is guilty. [Citations.] More specifically, the jury need not decide unanimously whether defendant was guilty as the aider and abettor or as the</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>direct perpetrator.\u201d <em>(People v. Santamar\u00eda </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 903, 918 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 884 P.2d 81].) The instructions were supported by the evidence, and nothing in the record indicates that the jury was confused by the instructions. <em>{Alexander, supra, </em>at p. 921.) Viewed in the abstract, the felony-murder instructions did not violate Ardoin\u2019s federal constitutional rights to due process, notice, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or a unanimous verdict. <em>(People v. Carey </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 109, 131-132 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 172, 158 P.3d 743].)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The more difficult issue arises from the unfortunate chronology of events in the present case, which resulted in the felony-murder instructions explicitly related to Ardoin being given to the jury after closing argument. The trial court did not lack the authority to give the modified version of the CALCRIM No. 540B instruction during jury deliberations, particularly upon learning of the jury\u2019s expression of confusion about the felony-murder rule as applied to Ardoin. \u201cWith regard to the timing of jury instmctions on the law, . . . trial courts are vested with wide discretion as to when to instruct the jury. (\u00a7\u00a7 1093, subd. (f), 1094; <em>People v. Chung </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 755, 758 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 337] ....)\u201d <em>(People v. Smith </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 7, 14 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 180].) Section 1093.5 provides that in a criminal case the court must decide upon and inform counsel of \u201call instructions to be given\u201d before the \u201ccommencement of argument,\u201d but adds that \u201cif, during the argument, issues are raised which have not been covered by instructions given or refused, the court may, on request of counsel, give additional instructions on the subject matter thereof.\u201d \u201c[Sjection 1093 sets out the general order in which a trial should proceed, specifically providing in subdivision (f) that at the conclusion of the evidence and after the closing arguments of counsel, the court may charge the jury and give them a written copy of the instructions read. Subdivision (f), however, also provides that \u2018At the beginning of the trial or from time to time during the trial, and without any request from either party, the trial judge may give the jury such instructions on the law applicable to the case as the judge may deem necessary for their guidance on hearing the case.\u2019 Under section 1094, the court may depart from the usual order of trial set forth in section 1093 \u2018for good reasons, and in the sound discretion of the Court.\u2019 (\u00a7 1094.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>at p. 15; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 33, 47-48 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 123].) \u201c \u2018No error results from granting a request to reopen in the absence of a showing of abuse.

(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Chung, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th 755, 758-760.) When presented with the jury\u2019s inquiry, the trial court had the statutory obligation \u201cto provide the jury with information the jury desires on points of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>(People v.

[Citation.] This does not mean the court must always elaborate on the standard instructions. Where the original instructions are themselves full and complete, the court has discretion under section 1138 to determine what additional explanations are sufficient to satisfy the jury\u2019s request for information. . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Solis </em>(2001) 90 Cal.App.4th 1002, 1015 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 464]; see also <em>People v.

The trial court had the further duty in the case to instruct the jury on the law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 616, 667 [114 Cal.Rptr.3d 133, 237 P.3d 474]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Saddler </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 671, 681 [156 Cal.Rptr. 871, 597 P.2d 130].)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Although the prosecution pursued what it viewed as the strongest case against Ardoin by arguing that he was the actual killer, the evidence presented at trial also suggested the jury might find him guilty under the felony-murder rule as a perpetrator of the robbery and aider and abettor of the crime committed by another. Despite the focus of the prosecution and defense theories of the case, the court properly modified the felony-murder instruction in accordance with the evidence presented by including a reference to both defendants. (See <em>People v. Alexander, supra, </em>49 Cal.4th 846, 920-921.) \u201c[T]he court is not <em>precluded </em>from giving any instruction for which there is evidentiary support. The fact that a party did not pursue a particular theory does not preclude the trial judge from giving an instruction on that theory where it deems such an instruction to be appropriate.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Horton </em>(4th Cir. 1990) 921 F.2d 540, 544.) The trial \u201c \u2018judge must always be alert to the possibility that counsel in the course of argument may have befuddled the jury as to the law. If this occurs, then either at the time the confusion arises or as part of the final instructive process the judge should rearticulate the correct rule of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Chung, supra, </em>57 Cal.App.4th 755, 758, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Valenzuela </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 218, 221 [142 Cal.Rptr. 655].) The court has \u201ca duty to reinstruct if it becomes apparent that the jury may be confused on the law.\u201d <em>(Chung, supra, </em>at p. 758.) Thus, we find that upon the jury\u2019s inquiry in the present case the trial court acted properly by reading the modified felony-murder instruction to dispel confusion and correctly advise the jury on the law governing the case. (See <em>U.S. v. Hayes </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 794 F.2d 1348, 1353-1354; <em>People </em>v. <em>Beardslee </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 68, 97 [279 Cal.Rptr. 276, 806 P.2d 1311].)</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>We cannot dispute the premise, however, that once the trial court decided to clarify the felony-murder instruction to include both defendants, fairness dictated that the court also reopen the case for the limited purpose of granting Ardoin\u2019s counsel the right to offer rebuttal argument. (See <em>People v. Cuccia </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 785, 793-794 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 668].) To prevent unfair prejudice, if a supplemental instruction introduces new matter for consideration by the jury, the parties should be given an opportunity to argue the theory. <em>(U.S. v. Fontenot </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 14 F.3d 1364, 1368; <em>People v.

If supplemental or curative instructions are given by the trial court without granting defense counsel an opportunity to object, and if necessary, offer additional legal argument to respond to the substance of the new instructions, the spirit of section 1093.5 and the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial may be compromised. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 291, 302 [10 Cal.Rptr. 842, 359 P.2d 274]; <em>People v.

(Rule 30(b)),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>version of section 1093.5: <em>Sheppard, supra, </em>909 F.2d 1234; and <em>U.S. v. Gaskins </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 849 F.2d 454 <em>(Gaskins).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In <em>Sheppard, </em>the defendant was charged with murder and prosecuted on the sole theory the killing was premeditated, willful and deliberate. As in the case before us, the defendant was not charged with robbery. Just prior to closing arguments, the prosecutor requested instructions on robbery and felony murder, which were given over the defendant\u2019s objection. <em>(Sheppard, supra, </em>909 F.2d 1234, 1235.) The trial court instructed the jury on a felony-murder theory and the prosecutor argued that theory to the jury during closing arguments. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1236.) The Ninth Circuit court found that the defendant\u2019s rights to due process and the effective assistance of counsel had been denied by the procedure, with the explanation: \u201cA trial cannot be fair unless the nature of the charges against a defendant are adequately made known to him or her in a timely fashion. [Citation.] Here, the prosecutor \u2018ambushed\u2019 the defense with a new theory of culpability after the evidence was already in, after both sides had rested, and after the jury instructions were settled. This new theory then appeared in the form of unexpected jury instructions permitting the jury to convict on a theory that was neither subject to adversarial testing, nor defined in advance of the proceeding. [][] Moreover, the right to counsel is directly implicated. That right is next to meaningless unless counsel knows and has a satisfactory opportunity to respond to the charges against which he or she must defend.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1237.) The court reversed the conviction, concluding it could not \u201cregard as fair a trial in which the defendant\u2019s right to defend was impaired by a lack of notice as to the nature and cause of the accusation.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1238.)</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">And in <em>Gaskins, supra, </em>849 F.2d 454, in the course of discussion of instructions on charges of possession of methamphetamine and manufacturing methamphetamine the prosecutor requested an instruction on aiding and abetting. In response, defense counsel requested a special instruction on unanimity to inform the jurors that their verdict must be unanimous on the theory of the defendant\u2019s guilt\u2014as either a principal or as an aider and abettor\u2014but ultimately counsel agreed with the trial court\u2019s decision not to give either instruction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 456.) During deliberations the jurors sent the court a question which suggested they were considering an aiding-and-abetting theory of culpability on the charge of manufacturing methamphetamine, based on evidence that the manufacturing process occurred on the defendant\u2019s property. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection the trial court instructed on aiding and abetting. The trial court also denied requests by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>defense counsel to instruct on unanimity and to reopen closing arguments to address the aiding-and-abetting theory of culpability. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 456-457.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The court in <em>Gaskins </em>found that the trial court\u2019s procedure violated federal Rule 30(b), which like section 1093.5 requires defense counsel to be informed of proposed instructions prior to closing arguments, so counsel has \u201cthe opportunity to argue the case intelligently to the jury.\u201d <em>(Gaskins, supra, </em>849 F.2d 454, 458.) The court declared that noncompliance is \u201creversible error, however, \u2018only if counsel\u2019s closing argument was prejudicially affected thereby.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Ibid.; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Mason </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 902 F.2d 1434, 1438 &amp; fn. 3.) Under this standard prejudice is found \u201cif the party was unfairly prevented from arguing his or her defense to the jury or was substantially misled in formulating and presenting arguments.\u201d <em>(Gaskins, supra, </em>at p. 458.) The court thus focused upon \u201cwhether the district judge\u2019s decision to give the aiding and abetting instruction during jury deliberations, after initially stating . . . that he would not, unfairly prevented Gaskin\u2019s counsel from arguing against an aiding and abetting theory to the jury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 460, italics omitted.) The court observed that \u201cconvicting a defendant as a principal or convicting a defendant as an aider and abettor are based on two conceptually different theories.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 459.) The convictions were therefore reversed when review of the transcript of closing argument revealed that \u201cGaskin\u2019s counsel did not address the question whether providing a location for the laboratory, without more, would constitute aiding and abetting the manufacture of methamphetamine. Instead, her argument focused on the question whether her client had directly participated in the manufacturing process. Moreover, she did not argue the facts as they would relate to the principle that \u2018mere presence\u2019 at the scene of a crime and knowledge that a crime is being committed is not sufficient to establish that an accused aided and abetted, unless the prosecution proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a participant, and not merely a knowing spectator.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Even if the error identified in <em>Sheppard </em>and <em>Gaskins </em>occurred in the present case, the prejudice did not. First, as we have observed, through the first degree murder charge and evidence presented at trial Ardoin was provided with notice of his potential culpability under the felony-murder rule as an aider and abettor of the murder committed by another during the course of a felony. (See <em>People v. Carey, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th 109, 131-132; <em>People v. Hughes </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 369-370 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 401, 39 P.3d 432]; <em>People v.

Scott </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 707, 716-717 [280 Cal.Rptr. 274].) \u201c \u2018[A] defendant, charged with murder, is on notice that the prosecution may seek to prove that charge by showing that the homicide occurred during the commission of an enumerated felony.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Crawford </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1, 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>[273 Cal.Rptr. 472], quoting <em>People v. Murtishaw </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 733, 751, fn. 11 [175 Cal.Rptr. 738, 631 P.2d 446].) Nor did the trial court affirmatively advise the defense that Ardoin was excluded from the felony-murder instruction, in contrast to the misleading assurance given to defense counsel in <em>Sheppard.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Cf. <em>People v. Scott, supra, </em>at p. 717.) The revision of the instruction in response to the jury\u2019s inquiry alleviated the trial court\u2019s failure to include both defendants in the original felony-murder and aiding-and-abetting instructions, a mistake which may have happened inadvertently.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The record also convincingly illustrates to us defense counsel\u2019s awareness during argument that felony-murder and aiding-and-abetting principles were at issue in the case. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Tham </em>(9th Cir. 1992) 960 F.2d 1391, 1399.) The evidence offered at trial disclosed and repeatedly confirmed that the murder occurred during the course of the robbery of drugs from the victim. <em>(People v. Wilson (2008) 43 </em>Cal.4th 1, 17 [73 Cal.Rptr.3d 620, 178 P.3d 1113]; <em>People v. Scott, supra, 229 </em>Cal.App.3d 707, 717.) In closing argument the prosecutor referred to felony-murder and aiding-and-abetting principles, on some occasions without singling out Jaquez. Again in contrast to both <em>Gaskins </em>and <em>Sheppard, </em>in response the defense did not focus exclusively on contesting the evidence of Ardoin\u2019s direct participation in the murder. (See also <em>U.S. v. Cook </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 155 Fed.Appx. 970, 971.) Ardoin\u2019s primary defense was that he was not present at all when the murder occurred, and therefore was neither the perpetrator nor the aider and abettor of the robbery and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Defense counsel expressly mentioned the prosecutor\u2019s position that Ardoin might be guilty under either of \u201ctwo scenarios\u201d presented by the evidence: as the direct \u201ckiller\u201d of the victim, or as an \u201caider or abettor and not actually the killer.\u201d Defense counsel supported his ensuing argument that the aiding-and-abetting theory was \u201cspeculation\u201d with numerous assertions based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to prove the elements of felony murder and aiding and abetting: the evidence did not prove Ardoin was even at the scene \u201cprior to and at the time of death\u201d of the victim; the chief prosecution witness, Burgos, who placed him at the scene, lacked any credibility; the phone and cab ride records supported the defense claim that Ardoin was not present when Tom was robbed and killed; Ardoin lacked \u201cphysical capability\u201d to kill the victim or assist with the killing; Burgos did not <em>see </em>Ardoin rob the victim or \u201chelp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>somebody\u201d do so; and the DNA evidence was \u201ccircumstantial\u201d and not dispositive of Ardoin\u2019s guilt under any theory. Later in closing argument defense counsel reiterated that the prosecution offered a \u201cnew aiding-and-abetting theory,\u201d and again emphasized the \u201cabsence\u201d of evidence to support it: the mere \u201cspeculation\u201d that Ardoin arrived at Tom\u2019s house before the murder; the lack of evidence that Tom\u2019s drugs were found in Ardoin\u2019s home or that he sold drugs after the murder; that Ardoin did not go to a hotel, attempt to flee, or concoct a fabricated version of the murder, as did Jaquez and Burgos; and that Ardoin did not have a \u201ccompelling motive\u201d to participate in a robbery of Tom.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The belatedly clarified supplemental felony-murder <em>instruction </em>thus did not introduce any new and different theory or factual elements into the case to be contested by the defense. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Fontenot, supra, </em>14 F.3d 1364, 1368; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Pemberton </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 853 F.2d 730, 735.) At oral argument Ardoin stressed the distinction between the theories of aiding and abetting and felony murder. He further pointed out that only aiding and abetting was mentioned as a basis of liability during closing argument. He is of course correct that aiding and abetting and felony murder are different theories upon which criminal liability may be based. (See <em>People v. Davis </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 28, 33 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 381].) For purposes of opportunity to present argument in the present case, however, the robbery and homicide were part of a single, continuous transaction, which brought into operation the felony-murder rule\u2019s imposition of culpability for the homicide as an accomplice to the robbery. (See <em>People v. Pulido </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 713, 723 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 625, 936 P.2d 1235].) Nor was the jury called upon to decide whether Ardoin\u2019s guilt was due to his acts as the direct perpetrator of the robbery and murder, or instead as an aider and abettor of the robbery that resulted in the murder by another. \u201c \u2018It matters not that jurors may disagree over the theory of the crime, for example, whether the situation involves felony murder or premeditated murder. Nor does it matter that they disagree on the theory of participation, for example, whether there was direct participation or aiding and abetting or coconspiracy.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vargas </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 506, 558 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 210], quoting <em>Davis, supra, </em>at p. 34.) In the context of the facts and legal principles presented, argument on felony-murder and aiding-and-abetting theories were not distinctive in the case.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">To the extent that Ardoin\u2019s counsel may not have argued against felony-murder liability in as much detail as he, upon subsequent reflection, would have liked, as the substitute trial judge recognized, defense counsel knew the issue had been presented and took the opportunity to vigorously</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>contest it. The right to due process guarantees an opportunity for effective presentation of a defense, not the presentation of a defense that is as effective as a defendant might prefer. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Owens </em>(1988) 484 U.S. 554, 559 [98 L.Ed.2d 951, 108 S.Ct. 838]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis and Oliver </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 970, 1039 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 467, 140 P.3d 775]; <em>People v. Carter </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1114, 1172 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 759, 117 P.3d 476].)  In short, counsel was not ambushed by the modified instruction. He adequately addressed the alternative felony-murder and aiding-and-abetting theories of liability during his final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">While we cannot express our approval of the trial court\u2019s refusal to reopen the case, the error is one that requires reversal only if, viewing the record in its entirety, a party \u201c \u2018was unfairly prevented from arguing his or her defense to the jury or was substantially misled in formulating and presenting arguments.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Foppe </em>(9th Cir. 1993) 993 F.2d 1444, 1451; see also <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Hermosillo-Nanez </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 545 F.2d 1230, 1233.) \u201cThe question is whether this court can \u2018conclude that the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s argument and hence of appellant\u2019s defense was not impaired by counsel\u2019s inaccurate information regarding the court\u2019s charge.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>supra, 155 Fed.Appx. 970, 971.) We conclude that Ardoin was not substantially misled in formulating or presenting closing argument, nor was he unfairly prevented from imparting his defense to the jury. <em>(U.S. v. Baron </em>(7th Cir. 1979) 602 F.2d 1248, 1253-1254; <em>U.S. v. Williams </em>(5th Cir. 1971) 447 F.2d 894, 901; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bishop, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th 220, 235.) Moreover, from our reading of the record we do not perceive that defense counsel\u2019s argument on the felony-murder issue would have appreciably differed or been any more persuasive if the case had been reopened. \u201cThough one can always argue longer and more fully, these arguments [(principal and aiding and abetting)] were sufficiently developed in the initial closing.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Horton, supra, </em>921 F.2d 540, 548.) Ardoin has not demonstrated prejudicial error or deficient performance by counsel. <em>(People v. Young, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1172.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">II. <em>The Admission of Extrajudicial Statements by Codefendant Jaquez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Ardoin contends the trial court erred by denying his mistrial motion following the testimony of Burgos in which she referred to an extrajudicial statement of codefendant Jaquez. He claims that the admission of evidence of his codefendant\u2019s statements violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights as articulated in <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 88 S.Ct. 1620] <em>(Bruton), </em>and <em>People v. Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265] <em>(Aranda). </em>The challenged testimony by Burgos was elicited in the context of the prosecutor\u2019s effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>obtain an explanation for her decision to ultimately testify against Jaquez and \u201ctell the truth about what happened.\u201d Burgos testified that she \u201cwaited three years for somebody to say something\u201d that exonerated her. Specifically, Burgos objected to the failure of Jaquez to follow through with his assurance to her that he \u201cwould talk to the person\u201d who committed the murder and \u201chave them stand up and say what they did.\u201d Upon defense counsel\u2019s objection the trial court struck the portion of Burgos\u2019s testimony that referred to \u201cany persons\u201d other than her or Jaquez, and admonished the jury \u201cnot to consider that portion of the testimony for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d Defense counsel also asserted that prosecutorial misconduct had been committed and moved for a mistrial. The trial court found that the prosecutor did not adduce the testimony intentionally, and denied the motion for mistrial on the ground that the admonition \u201ccured the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Ardoin maintains that Jaquez\u2019s statement as related by Burgos, although it did not refer to him by name, \u201c \u2018facially\u2019 incriminated him. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Archer </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1380, 1390 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 230].)\u201d He also complains that the trial court\u2019s admonition did \u201cnot cure [the] <em>Aranda-Bruton </em>error,\u201d and the violation of his right to confrontation \u201cwas not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\"><em>\u201cAranda </em>and <em>Bruton </em>stand for the proposition that a \u2018nontestifying codefendant\u2019s extrajudicial self-incriminating statement that inculpates the other defendant is generally unreliable and hence inadmissible as violative of that defendant\u2019s right of confrontation and cross-examination, even if a limiting instruction is given.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jennings, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th 616, 652.) \u201c \u2018In <em>Bruton, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the admission into evidence at a joint trial of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession implicating the defendant violates the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examination guaranteed by the confrontation clause, even if the jury is instructed to disregard the confession in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. [Citation.] The high court reasoned that although juries ordinarily can and will follow a judge\u2019s instructions to disregard inadmissible evidence, \u201cthere are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u201d [Citation.] Such a context is presented when \u201cthe powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burney </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 203, 230 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 348, 212 P.3d 639], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 453 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 181 P.3d 947].)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>\u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession with a proper limiting instruction when . . . the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his or her existence.\u201d <em>(Richardson v. Marsh </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 200, 211 [95 L.Ed.2d 176, 107 S.Ct. 1702] <em>(Richardson).) </em>\u201c ' \u201c[T]he sufficiency of this form of editing must be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the statement as a whole and the other evidence presented at the trial.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201c[Redactions that simply replace a name with an obvious blank space or a word such as \u2018deleted\u2019 or a symbol or other similarly obvious indications of alteration . . . leave statements that, considered as a class, so closely resemble Bruton\u2019s unredacted statements that . . . the law must require the same result.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] When, despite redaction, the statement obviously refers directly to the defendant, and involves inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial, the <em>Bruton </em>rule applies and introduction of the statement at a joint trial violates the defendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause.\u201d <em>(People v. Burney, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th 203, 231.) However, \u201cthe United States Supreme Court has stated that the positive authority of <em>Bruton v. United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 123 (holding that the admission, at a joint trial, of a nontestifying defendant\u2019s confession implicating a codefendant, even with an appropriate limiting instruction, violates the codefendant\u2019s rights under the confrontation clause) extends only to confessions that are not only <em>\u2018powerfully incriminating\u2019 </em>but also <em>\u2018facially incriminating\u2019 </em>of the nondeclarant defendant. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Fletcher </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 451, 455-456 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 917 P.2d 187], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Here, Burgos\u2019s reference to the statement by Jaquez did not mention Ardoin by name. Burgos reported that Jaquez told her he \u201cwould talk to the person\u201d who committed the murder, and \u201chave <em>them,\u201d </em>apparently referring to both Jaquez and the other person, \u201cstand up and say what <em>they </em>did.\u201d (Italics added.) Jaquez\u2019s statement thus made a direct reference to a perpetrator other than the speaker, but the statement was intrinsically redacted. On her own, Burgos replaced Ardoin\u2019s name with the pronouns \u201cperson\u201d and \u201cthey.\u201d \u201c[W]hether this kind of editing\u2014which retains references to a coparticipant in the crime but removes references to the coparticipant\u2019s name\u2014sufficiently, protects a nondeclarant defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation may not be resolved by a \u2018bright line\u2019 rule of either universal admission or universal exclusion. Rather, the efficacy of this form of editing must be determined on a case-by-case basis in light of the other evidence that has been or is likely to be presented at the trial. The editing will be deemed insufficient to avoid a confrontation violation if, despite the editing, reasonable jurors could not avoid drawing the inference that the defendant was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>coparticipant designated in the confession by symbol or neutral pronoun.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fletcher, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 451, 456.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Several factors strike us as limiting both the incriminating nature of the statement and the risk that a jury could not follow the trial court\u2019s instruction to disregard the evidence. First, the extrajudicial statement by Jaquez is neither testimonial in nature under <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36, 68-69 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354],<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> nor a powerfully incriminating confession. Jaquez gave an assurance to Burgos that he and the other person responsible for the murder would come forward and \u201csay something\u201d to exculpate her. Nothing in the evidence constitutes an overtly incriminating confession. Second, the statement is not directly or \u201cfacially\u201d incriminating. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2008) 168 Cal.App.4th 261, 282 [85 Cal.Rptr.3d 393].) The inference is concededly obvious that Jaquez was referring to Ardoin as the coparticipant designated in the statement, but reference to the remainder of Burgos\u2019s testimony is necessary to fully recognize the incriminating nature of the statement. Moreover, the statement was not hearsay evidence, as it was not offered for the truth of the matter, but only to reflect upon the witness\u2019s state of mind and the reasons that convinced her to \u201cchange [her] mind\u201d and testify against defendants.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The trial court\u2019s instruction thus alleviated the harm associated with the obliquely incriminating statement. \u201cA <em>Bruton </em>problem exists only where a co-defendant\u2019s statement on its face implicates the defendant.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Najjar </em>(4th Cir. 2002) 300 F.3d 466, 475.) In <em>Richardson, supra, </em>481 U.S. 200, 208, the United States Supreme Court observed: \u201cThere is an important distinction between this case and <em>Bruton, </em>which causes it to fall outside the narrow exception we have created. In <em>Bruton, </em>the codefendant\u2019s confession \u2018expressly implicated] \u2019 the defendant as his accomplice. [Citation.] Thus, at the time that confession was introduced there was not the slightest doubt that it would prove \u2018powerfully incriminating.\u2019 [Citation.] By contrast, in this case the confession was not incriminating on its face, and became so only when</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>linked with evidence introduced later at trial (the defendant\u2019s own testimony).\u201d (See also <em>U.S. v. Locklear </em>(4th Cir. 1994) 24 F.3d 641, 646; <em>U.S. v. Small </em>(E.D.Va., Apr. 11, 2006, No. 4:06cr6) 2006 U.S.Dist. Lexis 18433, pp. *32-*33.) \u201cExpress incrimination is more vivid than inferential incrimination and more difficult to thrust out of the mind. While the express incrimination of the confession in <em>Bruton </em>justified the belief the jury will likely disobey the instruction not to consider the evidence, there is no overwhelming probability the jury will not obey the limiting instruction to disregard the confession in assessing defendant\u2019s guilt when the confession incriminates only by inference.\u201d <em>(People v. Song (2004) 124 </em>Cal.App.4th 973, 983 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 118].)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u201c[N]o constitutional violation occurs where a co-defendant\u2019s statement is not incriminating on its face, and becomes so only when linked to other admitted evidence, if the trial court gives a proper limiting instruction. <em>Richardson, </em>481 U.S. at 208, 211; <em>Mason v. Yarborough, </em>447 F.3d 693, 695 (9th Cir. 2006) <em>(Richardson </em>\u2018specifically exempts a statement, not incriminating on its face, that implicates the defendant only in connection to other admitted evidence\u2019); <em>United States v. Hoac, </em>990 F.2d 1099, 1105 (9th Cir. 1993) (\u2019a codefendant\u2019s statement that does not incriminate the defendant unless linked with other evidence introduced at trial does not violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights\u2019).\u201d <em>(Gomez-Perez v. McDonald </em>(E.D.Cal. 2011) 2011 U.S.Dist. Lexis 7009, p. *23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">By striking the testimony of Burgos that referred \u201cto any persons other than the witness\u201d and Jaquez, and admonishing the jury \u201cnot to consider that portion of the testimony for any purpose whatsoever,\u201d the trial court effectively prevented a violation of Ardoin\u2019s confrontation rights under the <em>Aranda/Bruton </em>rule. <em>(People v. Garcia, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.4th 261, 281-283.) And, even if we found a constitutional violation, under the circumstances presented we would find the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, even in conjunction with the refusal to reopen the case following the revised felony-murder instructions. <em>(People v.

We have no difficulty in concluding that the same rule applies when a jury expresses confusion and an impasse in its deliberations related to the governing law and instructions, particularly in light of the trial court\u2019s broad discretion to alter the sequence of trial proceedings.

Any party may request in writing that the court instruct the jury on the law as specified in the request. The request must be made at the close of the evidence or at any earlier time that the court reasonably sets. When the request is made, the requesting party must furnish a copy to every other party. [J[] (b) Ruling on a Request. The court must inform the parties before closing arguments how it intends to rule on the requested instructions. [&lt;fl] (c) Time for Giving Instructions. The court may instruct the jury before or after the arguments are completed, or at both times. HQ (d) Objections to Instructions. A party who objects to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>portion of the instructions or to a failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate. An opportunity must be given to object out of the jury\u2019s hearing and, on request, out of the jury\u2019s presence. Failure to object in accordance with this rale precludes appellate review, except as permitted under Rule 52(b).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> The holding in <em>Sheppard </em>has been described by subsequent Ninth Circuit authority as \u201cnarrow.\u201d <em>(Morrison v.

It is limited to the particular instance where the prosecution specifically advises defense counsel of the limited theory of a particular prosecution, and then that prosecutor and the trial court allow an alternative theory in argument.
