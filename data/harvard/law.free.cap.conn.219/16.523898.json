We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The victim, William McDougall, who lived in Fair-field, drove into Bridgeport in an attempt to retrieve money for a friend who had been cheated in a drug transaction. McDougall arrived at Clinton Avenue, where a group of people were standing in the street. McDougall backed his car into the group, knocking down one person who was on a bicycle, and then drove down the street, hitting a telephone pole at the corner of Clinton Avenue and Railroad Avenue. Four of the people in the group, including James Brown and Ilideo Leite, ran after McDougall, who had exited his car and was walking away. The four caught McDougall and beat him with a pipe until he fell to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">As Brown turned and walked away, the defendant ran by him with a gun in his hand. The defendant ran to a point approximately two feet from where McDougall was lying on the ground, and fired two shots at McDougall in rapid succession, one of which hit him in the right leg. The defendant then stopped Leite, who had started to run away, and handed him the gun. Leite went to the defendant\u2019s house, and, when the defendant arrived there, Leite returned the gun to him and left. Although the gun was never recovered, two shell casings were found at the scene. McDougall died later that day in the hospital, after suffering a massive loss of blood. The cause of death was the gunshot wound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to his right leg, which had nearly severed his right femoral artery, the main artery for carrying blood to the lower leg and foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The defendant first claims that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had acted \u201cwith intent to cause the death of\u201d McDougall, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). He argues that Brown and Leite, who were the only witnesses to the shooting, \u201cgave widely divergent and incomplete testimony\u201d regarding the defendant\u2019s conduct, and that neither version \u201cprovidefd] evidence sufficient to support only one reasonable finding\u2014-that the defendant specifically intended to cause McDougall\u2019s death . . . .\u201d This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The principal difference between the testimony of Brown and that of Leite concerns the distance between the defendant and McDougall at the time of the shooting. Brown testified that the distance was two to three feet, while Leite estimated that the distance was approximately thirty feet. Because we conclude that the jury reasonably could have inferred intent to cause death from Brown\u2019s testimony alone, we need not discuss Leite\u2019s testimony as part of this analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The two-part test for appellate analysis of a claim of evidentiary insufficiency is well established. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the jury reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>216 Conn. 367, 380, 579 A.2d 1066 (1990). It is immaterial to the probative force of the evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>it consists, in whole or in part, of circumstantial rather than direct evidence. Id., 381. Furthermore, in determining whether the jury reasonably could have found guilt, we ask whether any rational factfinder could have done so. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chace, </em>199 Conn. 102, 105, 505 A.2d 712 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u201cIn order to be convicted under our murder statute, the defendant must possess the specific \u2018intent to cause the death\u2019 of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a. To act intentionally, the defendant must have had the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11) . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>214 Conn. 77, 82, 570 A.2d 203 (1990). Ordinarily, intent can only be proved by circumstantial evidence; it may be and usually is inferred from the defendant\u2019s conduct. Id. Intent to cause death may be inferred from \u201cthe type of weapon used, the manner in which it was used, the type of wound inflicted and the events leading to and immediately following the death.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 396, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>supra, 82-83. Furthermore, it is a permissible, albeit not a necessary or mandatory, inference that a defendant intended the natural consequences of his voluntary conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>198 Conn. 285, 300-304, 503 A.2d 146 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Brown testified that he saw the defendant in a parked car on Clinton Avenue just before McDougall backed up his car into the group of people. He also testified that he saw the defendant, gun in hand, run toward McDougall and, from two to three feet away, fire two shots in rapid succession at him as he lay motionless on the ground. The medical examiner testified that most people with the type of injury suffered by McDougall do not live long enough to get to a hospital. Based on this evidence, the jury reasonably could have con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>eluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to cause McDougall\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument rests on the assertion that he hit McDougall with only one of his two shots, and that McDougall was hit in the thigh rather than \u201cin a vital area.\u201d The defendant claims that those facts preclude an inference that he \u201cspecifically intended to cause McDougall\u2019s death, rather than injure or frighten him.\u201d We disagree. While it would have been permissible to infer from those facts that the defendant intended only to injure or frighten McDougall,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the evidence did not preclude the equally permissible inference that the defendant intended to kill the victim by shooting at him twice as he lay on the ground two feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly refused his request to charge the jury on the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (l).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">This claim focuses on the third and fourth requirements of the well established <em>Whistnant </em>test for determining whether a defendant is entitled to a lesser included offense instruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980). Those requirements are that \u201c(3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense, but guilty of the lesser.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Manslaughter in the second degree under \u00a7 53a-56 (a) requires that a defendant \u201crecklessly [cause] the death of another person.\u201d A person acts \u201crecklessly\u201d with respect to a particular result \u201cwhen he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). In this case, the differentiating element between murder and manslaughter in the second degree was the defendant\u2019s state of mind, namely, whether he intentionally killed McDougall or recklessly caused his death. \u201cReckless conduct is not intentional conduct because one who acts recklessly does not have a conscious objective to cause a particular result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>199 Conn. 1, 4, 505 A.2d 683 (1986). Under the facts presented, therefore, in order for the defendant to have been entitled to the lesser included charge he requested, the evidence bearing on his state of mind must have been such that the jury reasonably could have found that he acted recklessly, rather than intentionally, with respect to McDougall\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In determining whether the defendant was entitled to a lesser included offense charge, we view the evidence \u201cin a light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>request.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 106, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912, 109 S. Ct. 3230, 106 L. Ed. 2d 579 (1989). Evidence is \u201c \u2018sufficiently in dispute\u2019 where it is of such a factual quality that would permit the finder of fact reasonably to find the defendant guilty on the lesser included offense. This requirement serves to prevent a jury from capriciously convicting on the lesser included offense when the evidence requires either conviction on the greater offense or acquittal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>195 Conn. 567, 579, 489 A.2d 1024 (1985), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra. Nonetheless, jurors \u201c \u2018are supposed to reach their conclusions on the basis of common sense, common understanding and fair beliefs, grounded on evidence . . . from which inferences can fairly be drawn.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, quoting <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co., </em>350 U.S. 523, 526, 76 S. Ct. 608, 100 L. Ed. 668 (1956). They should not be encouraged to engage in speculation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The defendant relies on the following evidence to support his assertion that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant acted recklessly, rather than intentionally, with respect to McDougall\u2019s death. Leite testified that, after beating McDougall, he was walking back toward Clinton Avenue when he heard a shot. He turned around and saw the defendant approximately thirty feet away from McDougall, who was lying on the ground. After Leite had turned around, he heard another shot and saw the defendant holding a gun with two hands in front of his body, pointing it at McDougall.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, Leite had given two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>written statements to the police. In the first statement, contrary to his testimony at trial, he stated that he was not sure who had fired the shots. The defendant also relies on testimony that the two shells from the shots fired by the defendant were found approximately four feet from each other, giving rise to an inference that the defendant \u201cwas not standing in the same place when he fired both shots at McDougall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">We conclude that, taking all this evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, the jury could not reasonably have concluded that the defendant acted recklessly, rather than intentionally, with respect to McDougall\u2019s death. Common sense and common understanding would preclude the conclusion that the defendant acted recklessly when he shot at the victim twice from a distance of thirty feet and when the second shot was fired from the classic firing position of holding his arms out in front of his body. Based on this evidence, an inference of reckless rather than intentional conduct would have been the result of speculation. The only question could have been whether his intent was to kill or to cause serious physical injury, and the trial court adequately protected his rights by appropriately charging on the other lesser included offenses. See footnote 4, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court improperly admitted into evidence a written statement of Leite as a prior consistent statement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>On direct examination, Leite testified that, as he was walking away from McDougall, he had heard a shot, had turned around, and then had seen the defendant fire the second shot at McDougall. On cross-examination, the defendant introduced, as a prior inconsistent statement, a portion of a written statement that Leite had given to the police in which he stated that \u201cI am not sure who fired the shots but [the defendant] had this gun, it was a black 45 automatic.\u201d On redirect examination, the state offered a second written statement of Leite, given right after the first, in which he stated that his first statement was not \u201cthe complete truth,\u201d and that he had seen the defendant fire the gun twice at McDougall.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The defendant objected to the admission of the second statement, claiming that it was not a prior consistent statement. The court overruled the objection and admitted the second statement, and the defendant excepted. Thereafter, the court stated that, since both the first and second statements were in writing and signed by Leite, they were also admissible under <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the second statement was not truly consistent with Leite\u2019s testimony on direct examination and, therefore, was not admissible as a prior consistent statement misses the mark. In <em>Whelan, </em>we \u201cadopt[ed] ... a rule allowing the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>stantive use of prior written inconsistent statements, signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d Id., 753. The rationale for that rule is that its requirements\u2014that the declarant testify and be subject to cross-examination, that he have personal knowledge of the facts stated, and that the statement be in writing and signed by him\u2014justified \u201can exception to the hearsay rule . . . to allow the trial court to admit for substantive purposes prior inconsistent statements given under prescribed circumstances reasonably assuring reliability.\u201d Id., 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Under the circumstances, therefore, the second written statement was admissible whether it was consistent or inconsistent with Leite\u2019s testimony. If it were consistent therewith, as initially determined by the trial court, it was admissible as a prior consistent statement. If, on the other hand, it were inconsistent therewith, as the defendant implicitly argues, it was admissible under <em>Whelan.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The defendant argues, however, that <em>Whelan </em>states a rule of <em>use </em>of testimony, rather than <em>admissibility. </em>Thus, he asserts, <em>Whelan </em>merely permits the use of a written statement of a witness as substantive evidence, but the statement first must be admitted under some other rule of admissibility. This argument misreads <em>Whelan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">It is true that the precise procedural posture of <em>Whelan </em>involved only the use, rather than the admissibil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ity, of a prior inconsistent statement of a witness as substantive evidence. In <em>Whelan, </em>the statement had been admitted into evidence in order to impeach a hostile witness. Id., 746-47. The defendant thereafter requested that the trial court instruct the jury that the statement could \u201cbe considered solely with respect to the credibility of the witness, and not as probative of the facts it contained.\u201d Id., 748. On appeal, we rejected that limitation on its use, and \u201cadopt[ed] . . . a rule allowing the substantive use of prior written inconsistent statements signed by the declarant, who has personal knowledge of the facts stated, when the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination.\u201d Id., 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, however, our rationale for the rule adopted in <em>Whelan </em>went beyond mere use to admissibility. As noted above, that rationale is premised on the notion that the contours of the rule justify an exception to the hearsay rule \u201cto allow the trial court <em>to admit for substantive purposes </em>prior inconsistent statements given under prescribed circumstances reasonably assuring reliability.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 752. It is clear, moreover, that in <em>Whelan </em>we considered the concept of the \u201cuse\u201d of such statements as equivalent to their \u201cadmissibility.\u201d See id., 752-53. Therefore, in <em>Whelan </em>we announced a new exception to the hearsay rule for the admission of prior inconsistent written statements of a witness, not simply a new rule concerning the use of such statements that must be shown to have been admissible on some other, independent basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a) provides: \u201cMURDER, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception; except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1) provides: \u201cmanslaughter in the second degree: CLASS C FELONY, (a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: (1) He recklessly causes the death of another person</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b39-9\"> Leite\u2019s testimony is significant, however, in the analysis of the defendant\u2019s second claim, discussed infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b41-9\"> Because such an inference was permissible, the trial court properly charged the jury on the lesser included offenses of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), both of which require proof of intent to cause serious physical injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b41-11\"> See footnote 2, supra, for the full text of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-56 (a) (1).

We reject this argument, for two reasons. First, as the state points out, there is no such testimony in this record. Second, even if the defendant had acted recklessly with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>respect to others by shooting intentionally at McDougall, that would not justify a finding that he acted recklessly with respect to McDougall. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 (13) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] person acts \u2018recklessly <em>with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense </em>when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The result described by the manslaughter statute is the death of the victim.
