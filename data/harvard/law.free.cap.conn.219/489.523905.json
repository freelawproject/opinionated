We affirm the judgment of conviction on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. At approximately 8 a.m. on October 2,1988, the victim, after purchasing a Sunday newspaper, returned to her apartment in New Haven. As the victim unlocked the outside door to the apartment building, the defendant came up behind her and asked if someone named Mike lived in the building. The victim replied that she did not know and entered the building. Realizing that the defendant had followed her into the building, the victim stepped aside and asked him to pass ahead in the hallway. The defendant refused to pass and ordered the victim to enter her apartment. When the victim threatened to scream, the defendant warned her that she should not because he had a gun. The victim then attempted to enter her apartment and lock the door, but the defendant wedged an arm and leg inside the door and forced his way into the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Once inside, the defendant stood close to the victim in the entryway of the apartment and demanded money. The victim gave him the bills and coins that were in her pocket, and, after the defendant threw the coins on the floor, she told him that she had more money in a desk in her bedroom. While the defendant followed close behind her, the victim walked through the living room, down the hallway and into the bedroom, where she gave the defendant the money located in her desk. The defendant then demanded valuables and took a camera from the victim. Upon the defendant\u2019s insistence for more money, the victim, in an attempt to get him out of her apartment, told him that she could obtain money from an automatic teller machine (ATM) at a nearby bank. The defendant did not respond, but began to search the victim\u2019s desk and closet for valuables.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">At some point during the bedroom search, the defendant commanded the victim to undress and sit on her bed. The defendant thereafter ordered the victim to get up and show him where she kept her jewelry, and followed her as she crossed the room from the bed to her bureau. After taking a gold crucifix from the bureau drawer, the defendant roughly grabbed the victim\u2019s breasts and demanded that she return to the bed and lie down. The defendant then ceased his search for valuables and approached the victim where she lay on her bed. The defendant reminded the victim not to scream because he had a gun and proceeded to engage in non-consensual sexual intercourse with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Afterward, the defendant ordered the victim to dress and told her that they were going to walk together to the bank where she would withdraw money from the ATM. Before they left the apartment, the defendant went into the bathroom and returned with his jacket wrapped around his hand. The defendant explained that his jacket concealed the gun, and told the victim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>she should not scream or otherwise indicate that she was in danger during the walk to the bank because he had killed people before and was willing to kill her. The victim saw \u201csomething metallic\u201d between the folds of the defendant\u2019s jacket.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The victim then walked several blocks to the bank with the defendant following directly behind her. At the bank, the defendant instructed the victim to withdraw approximately $800 from the ATM. The victim withdrew $200, the daily withdrawal limit. The defendant removed that amount of money from the ATM and put it in his pocket. Thereafter, the defendant directed the victim to walk down an alley without looking back, and he left the area. The victim testified at the defendant\u2019s subsequent trial that she had complied with his various demands in order to survive.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The defendant initially claims that the trial court, by convicting him of two counts of first degree kidnapping based on charges alleging his commission of offenses that arose out of the same transaction, punished him twice for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy provisions of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In support of this claim, the defendant points out that his convictions for the offenses of first degree kidnapping under both subdivisions (A) and (B) of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2), respectively based on the third and fifth counts of the state\u2019s substitute information,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> arose from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>a thirty minute transaction within the same city and involving the same victim. The state contends that even if the offenses were assumed to have arisen from the same transaction, the defendant\u2019s double jeopardy claim nevertheless fails because the two kidnapping charges alleged violations of distinct statutory provisions, and therefore, the commission of separate offenses. Assuming that the offenses arose from the same transaction, we agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">As we approach the defendant\u2019s claim, the only disputed question is whether the crimes of kidnapping in the first degree under subdivisions (A) and (B) of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) are the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy. \u201cThe traditional test for determining whether two offenses are the same offense for double jeopardy purposes was set forth in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chicano, </em>216 Conn. 699, 706-707, 584 A.2d 425 (1990). Under the <em>Blockburger </em>test, \u201ca defendant may be convicted of two offenses arising out of the same criminal incident if each crime contains an element not found in the other.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vass, </em>191 Conn. 604, 615, 469 A.2d 767 (1983); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>216 Conn. 282, 291, 579 A.2d 84 (1990). We determine whether each crime contains an element not found in the other by examining only the relevant statute, the information and the bill of particulars, and not the evidence presented at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Our perusal of these materials in the present case discloses that the charged crimes of kidnapping in the first degree under subdivisions (A) and (B) of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) are separate offenses for double jeopardy purposes. To convict the defendant of first degree kidnapping under subdivision (A) of the statute, the state had to prove, as alleged in the third count of the substitute information, that the defendant abducted the victim with a specific intent to violate or abuse her sexually. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>206 Conn. 40, 54, 536 A.2d 936 (1988). On the other hand, to convict the defendant of first degree kidnapping under subdivision (B) of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2), the state was required to establish, as alleged in the fifth count of the substitute information, that he abducted the victim with the specific intent to achieve the felonious objective of robbery. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>197 Conn. 588, 591, 500 A.2d 547 (1985). The substitute information, therefore, alleged that the defendant committed two separate offenses of kidnapping in the first degree, each of which required proof of an element that the other did not. As a consequence, the trial court could properly punish the defendant for both crimes without offending the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The defendant next argues that his two convictions of first degree robbery under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) constituted multiple punishment for the same offense in violation of the double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The convictions were based upon the first and sixth counts of the substitute information, in which the state respectively alleged that the defendant had robbed the victim \u201cat approximately 8:30 a.m. on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>October 2,1988, at [her apartment] in the City of New Haven,\u201d and then had robbed her again \u201cat approximately 9:00 a.m. on October 2, 1988 at 77 Broadway [her bank] in New Haven . . . .\u201d According to the defendant, the events at the victim\u2019s apartment and the bank were part of a continuing transaction during which he committed a single robbery. The separation of this transaction to form the basis of two robbery charges and convictions, the defendant maintains, contravenes the legislature\u2019s intent that the unit of prosecution for the crime of robbery turn upon the number of victims intimidated by a defendant\u2019s use or threatened use of force. Where, as here, a single victim is subjected to continuous intimidation by a defendant\u2019s unceasing forcible conduct, the defendant claims that the legislature intended that such a course of conduct be punished as a single robbery. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Double jeopardy prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense in the context of a single trial. Nonetheless, distinct repetitions of a prohibited act, \u201chowever closely they may follow each other\u201d; <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 302; may be punished as separate crimes without offending the double jeopardy clause. <em>State </em>v. <em>Snook, </em>210 Conn. 244, 262, 555 A.2d 390, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 924, 109 S. Ct. 3258, 106 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1989); <em>see State v. Eason, </em>192 Conn. 37, 46-47, 470 A.2d 688 (1984); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>794 F.2d 589, 590 (11th Cir. 1986). \u201cThe same transaction,\u201d in other words, \u201cmay constitute separate and distinct crimes where it is susceptible of separation into parts, each of which in itself constitutes a completed offense.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>143 F.2d 276, 277 (10th Cir. 1944), approved in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>349 U.S. 81, 75 S. Ct. 620, 99 L. Ed. 905 (1955). \u201c[T]he test is not whether the criminal intent is one and the same and inspiring the whole transaction, but whether separate acts have been com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>mitted with the requisite criminal intent and are such as are made punishable by the [statute].\u201d <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>237 U.S. 632, 640, 35 S. Ct. 712, 59 L. Ed. 1153 (1915); accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Melton, </em>763 F.2d 401, 402 (11th Cir. 1985); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Shaid, </em>730 F.2d 225, 226 (5th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133, which defines robbery, provides that a defendant \u201ccommits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny, he uses or threatens the immediate use of physical force upon another person for the purpose of: (1) Preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\u201d As the defendant points out, we have identified the distinguishing feature of robbery as \u201cthe intimidation of the victim\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hawthorne, </em>175 Conn. 569, 573, 402 A.2d 759 (1978); and further, we have construed the singular term \u201canother person\u201d in \u00a7 53a-133 to evince the legislative purpose that a spatially indistinct robbery of two individuals be punishable as two separate offenses of robbery. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lytell, </em>206 Conn. 657, 666-67, 539 A.2d 133 (1988). We do not share, however, the defendant\u2019s perception that the legislature intended that robbery constitute an offense continuing for the period during which a defendant\u2019s forcible conduct intimidates a single victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The plain terms of \u00a7 53a-133 indicate a contrary intent. Specifically, the statute provides that a criminal defendant \u201ccommits robbery when, in the course of committing a larceny,\u201d the defendant engages in forcible conduct with a proscribed purpose. The legislature thus expressly designated \u201cthe course of committing a larceny,\u201d rather than the course of forcible conduct, as the time frame for completion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>offense of robbery.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>185 Conn. 402, 410-11, 441 A.2d 119 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982). A consistent expression of legislative purpose is found in the commentary to our penal code, in which the drafters of the provision now codified as \u00a7 53a-133 describe the offense of robbery as \u201ca larceny accompanied by force or threat.\u201d Commentary, Commission to Revise the Criminal Statutes (1969) p. 64. Consequently, we conclude that the legislature intended \u00a7 53a-133 to authorize a punishment for robbery each time a criminal defendant with the requisite intent engages in forcible conduct against another person \u201cin the course of committing a larceny,\u201d irrespective of whether such conduct is unceasingly directed toward a single victim. \u201cA different view would allow a person who has committed one [robbery] upon a victim to commit with impunity many other such acts during the same encounter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>185 Conn. 211, 229, 440 A.2d 916 (1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1112, 102 S. Ct. 3496, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1375 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In the present case, the defendant committed two completed and hence separately punishable offenses of robbery as defined by \u00a7 53a-133. The defendant first committed a completed offense of robbery by threatening to shoot the victim with the requisite purpose \u201cin the course of committing a larceny\u201d at 8 a.m. within her apartment. The defendant then committed a sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ond completed offense of robbery by threatening to shoot the victim with the requisite purpose \u201cin the course of committing a larceny\u201d at 9 a.m. at the bank located several blocks from her apartment. The offenses were committed at different times, locations and under different circumstances, and were also separated by an intervening act of sexual assault. Because the defendant committed two separate and distinct robberies, the trial court was authorized by \u00a7 53a-133 to punish him separately for each offense under \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The defendant next claims that the evidence of abduction within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-91 (2) was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict finding him guilty of the crime of first degree kidnapping in violation of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). This kidnapping conviction was based on the third count of the substitute information, in which the state alleged that \u201cat approximately 8:30 a.m. on October 2, 1988, at [the victim\u2019s apartment] in New Haven, [the defendant] abducted [the victim], and restrained her with the intent to violate her or abuse her sexually\u201d in violation of the statute. In the defendant\u2019s view, there is \u201csimply no evidence\u201d from which the jury could have inferred that he had possessed the \u201cintent to prevent [the victim\u2019s] liberation.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (2). We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">Appellate analysis of an insufficiency of the evidence claim necessitates the undertaking of a twofold task. We first review the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the guilty verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>215 Conn. 716, 726, 579 A.2d 9 (1990). We then determine whether any rational trier of fact could have concluded, upon the facts thus established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 600, 583 A.2d 896 (1990). In this analysis, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that any part of it is circumstantial rather than direct evidence. Id., 602; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018Intent is a mental process which ordinarily can be proven only by circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Just, </em>185 Conn. 339, 355, 441 A.2d 98 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Considering the evidence in the present case in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, we conclude that the jury could reasonably have determined that the evidence cumulatively established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended \u201cto prevent [the victim\u2019s] liberation by . . . using or threatening to use physical force or intimidation.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (2) (b). The evidence showed, for example, that the defendant initially thwarted the victim\u2019s attempt to lock him out of her apartment by forcing his way inside. The defendant also told the victim that he had a gun that he would use if she screamed, and the victim saw what she thought was a gun on his person. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>211 Conn. 672, 679, 561 A.2d 111 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>188 Conn. 406, 416, 450 A.2d 356 (1982). When the victim left her bed, where the defendant previously had commanded her to undress and remain, he roughly grabbed her breasts and demanded that she return to the bed and lie down. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paolella, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>177 Conn. 335, 344, 417 A.2d 354 (1979). The victim, in order to survive, complied with the defendant\u2019s demands. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>supra. In view of this evidence, we cannot say that there was an insufficient factual basis for the jury to conclude rationally that the defendant possessed the requisite intent to abduct the victim under \u00a7\u00a7 53a-91 (2) and 53a-92 (a) (2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>IY</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The defendant next claims that \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts supporting his conviction of first degree kidnapping.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As previously noted, the conviction arose from the events that took place at the victim\u2019s apartment. The defendant asserts that the impermissibly vague aspect of \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) is its \u201crestraint\u201d element, particularly, that portion of the statutory definition of \u201crestrain\u201d applicable under the statute where a defendant is alleged, as in the present case, to have moved his victim \u201cfrom one place to another.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (1). According to the defendant, applying the \u201cmovement\u201d requirement to the facts pertaining to the apartment kidnapping, which he characterizes as presenting \u201ca scenario of truly minimal movement, such as from the desk to the bed within a bedroom,\u201d produces an absurd and unconscionable result. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u201cDue process requires that laws \u2018give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited\u2019 and \u2018provide explicit standards for those who apply them\u2019 in order to prevent the risk of arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 591, 590 A.2d 447 (1991). In a case such as this, where first amendment freedoms are not implicated, \u201ca claim that a statute is void for vagueness is determined by its applicability to the particular facts presented.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>210 Conn. 132, 144, 554 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>713 (1989). The fact that \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>statutory provision may be of questionable applicability in speculative situations is usually immaterial if the challenged provision applies to the conduct of the defendant in the case at issue.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">While we recognize that there are conceivable \u201cfactual situations in which charging a defendant with kidnapping based upon the most minuscule movement would result in an \u2018absurd and unconscionable\u2019 result\u201d; <em>State </em>v. Jones, 215 Conn. 173, 180, 575 A.2d 216 (1990); we do not find this case to present such a situation. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s proposed \u201cdesk to bed\u201d scenario, the facts of this case demonstrate that the defendant moved the victim between various locations within her apartment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>supra (defendant moved victim \u201cfrom stairway back to his bedroom\u201d). Prior to the \u201cdesk to bed\u201d movement, the defendant, after forcing his way into the victim\u2019s apartment, moved the victim from the entryway of her apartment through the living room and down the hallway to the desk in her bedroom. The \u201cdesk to bed\u201d movement identified by the defendant then occurred. Thereafter, the defendant moved the victim, by ordering her to move, from the bed to her bureau. The defendant then moved the victim from the bureau back to her bed. The totality of these movements formed the basis of the state\u2019s charge, and the defendant\u2019s conviction, of kidnapping with the intent to \u201cviolate or abuse [the victim] sexually\u201d at her apartment. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Upon these facts, it can hardly be disputed that the defendant moved the victim from one place to another, the conduct proscribed by \u00a7\u00a7 53a-91 (1) and 53a-92 (a) (2) (A). Section 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), therefore, is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the defendant\u2019s conduct. The defendant cannot make it so by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>presenting us with a factual scenario that does not accurately reflect what transpired in connection with the apartment kidnapping.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The defendant next challenges the court\u2019s decision to shackle him at trial. On the second day of trial, the court informed the defendant out of the presence of the jury that he would be restrained in leg irons for the remainder of the trial. The reason for the restraints, the court stated, was that it had \u201cthe right to determine the need for physical restraints based upon reliable information received from law enforcement officers or correctional officers.\u201d The court also explained that the courthouse sheriffs had \u201creceived information to the effect\u201d that, with the court\u2019s approval, shackles should be employed. In response to the defendant\u2019s demand \u201cto know where the sheriff\u2019s department got that information from,\u201d the court stated that it would \u201cnot divulge anything further,\u201d and that it did not know the source of the sheriffs\u2019 information. The court then refused the defendant\u2019s request to know \u201cthe reason for all this,\u201d and his request for removal of the restraints. At the court\u2019s direction, however, both counsel tables were covered with brown paper to prevent the jury from observing the defendant\u2019s restraints and to eliminate any suspicion that might occur if only defense counsel\u2019s table were covered. Thereafter, the court excused the jury while the defendant was brought to and from the courtroom in restraints. The court permitted the defendant to testify unrestrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The defendant asserts that the record does not establish the existence of a reasonable necessity to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the court\u2019s decision to shackle him. This deficiency in the record, the defendant claims, together with the prejudice allegedly resulting from the use of the shackles, deprived him of a fair trial. Although we find the record inadequate to demonstrate a reasonable necessity for shackling the defendant, we agree with the state that the precautionary measures taken by the court so minimized the potential prejudicial effect of the shackles that any impropriety in the court\u2019s decision to employ them was harmless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>201 Conn. 605, 615, 518 A.2d 1377 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201c \u2018As a general proposition, a criminal defendant has the right to appear in court free from physical restraints. . . . Grounded in the common law, this right evolved in order to preserve the presumption favoring a criminal defendant\u2019s innocence, while eliminating any detrimental effects to the defendant that could result if he were physically restrained in the courtroom.\u2019 (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>195 Conn. 1, 5-6, 485 A.2d 570 (1985). \u2018The presumption of innocence, although not articulated in the Constitution, is a basic component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice.\u2019 <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 503, 96 S. Ct. 1691, 48 L. Ed. 2d 126, reh. denied, 426 U.S. 954, 96 S. Ct. 3182, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1194 (1976).\u201d <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>216 Conn. 678, 691, 583 A.2d 1277 (1990). Nonetheless, a defendant\u2019s right to appear before the jury unfettered is not absolute. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 613. A trial court may employ a \u201creasonable means of restraint\u201d upon a defendant if, exercising its broad discretion in such matters, the court finds that restraints are \u201creasonably necessary\u201d under the circumstances. Practice Book \u00a7 892;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>see Sekou v. Warden, </em>supra, 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>In reviewing a shackling claim, our task is to determine whether the court\u2019s decision to employ restraints constituted a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra. While appellate review is greatly aided when a court develops the record by conducting an evidentiary hearing concerning the necessity for restraints, \u201csuch a hearing is not mandatory.\u201d Id. A record in some fashion disclosing the justification for using restraints, however, is essential to meaningful appellate review of a shackling claim. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 614; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 8. \u201cThis is particularly so because of the potential for prejudice in the use of shackles.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra. Accordingly, a trial court must ensure that its reasons for ordering the use of restraints \u201care detailed in the record.\u201d <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In the present case, the record discloses that the court restrained the defendant because it had received from the sheriffs \u201creliable\u201d information \u201cto the effect\u201d that such a course of action should be taken. That information, alone, may well have provided the court with a sound basis for determining that shackles were reasonably necessary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 7. In view of the fact that the law enforcement personnel at our courthouses are responsible for and possess superior experience in matters of courtroom security, it is practicable for a court to \u201c \u2018rely heavily\u2019 \u201d upon the advice of such personnel in determining whether a criminal defendant should be restrained. <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 693; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 9; see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>United States </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>431 F.2d 610, 615 (4th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 401 U.S. 946, 91 S. Ct. 964, 28 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1971). A court may also consider other information not in evidence, including official records, information supplied by correctional officers and attorneys, and \u201cfacts generally known within the limits of its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 616; <em>see State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra. \u201cSuch information or knowledge, however, should be placed on the record outside the presence of the jury and the defendant given the opportunity to respond to that information.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">By falling to divulge the information prompting its decision to restrain the defendant, the court not only denied the defendant a meaningful opportunity to respond to that information, but also rendered the record inadequate for our review of its decision to restrain him. The record, moreover, does not otherwise evince the requisite reasonable necessity for restraints. Compare <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 692. Nonetheless, however improper the court\u2019s failure to specify the information on which it relied, there is no evidence in the record that the jury saw or otherwise knew of the defendant\u2019s restraints.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra. The court took particular pains to conceal the defendant\u2019s shackles and to neutralize possible suspicion by ensuring that both counsel tables were covered with paper, excusing the jury while the defendant was brought to and from the courtroom, and permitting the defendant to testify unrestrained. See <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 693-94; <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 9-10. Furthermore, the defendant did not claim at trial, nor is there any evidence to suggest, that the shackles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>inhibited his ability to communicate with his attorney. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In order for a criminal defendant to enjoy the maximum benefit of the presumption of innocence, our courts should make every reasonable effort to present the defendant before the jury in a manner that does not suggest, expressly or impliedly, that he or she is a dangerous character whose guilt is a foregone conclusion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 612-13; see <em>Harrell </em>v. <em>Israel, </em>672 F.2d 632, 635 (7th Cir. 1982). There is no doubt that \u201c \u2018the sight of shackles and gags might have a significant effect on the jury\u2019s feelings about the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>475 U.S. 560, 568, 106 S. Ct. 1340, 89 L. Ed. 2d 525 (1986). The negative connotations of restraints, nevertheless, are without significance unless the fact of the restraints comes to the attention of the jury. As the present record is devoid of competent evidence that the jury was aware of the defendant\u2019s shackles at any time during his trial, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the presumption of innocence was not abridged by the court\u2019s decision to shackle him. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 615-16; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McMurtrey, </em>136 Ariz. 93, 98, 664 P.2d 637 (1983), and authorities cited therein. Rather than depriving the defendant of a fair trial, therefore, any impropriety in that decision was, under the circumstances, harmless. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Woolcock, </em>supra, 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, while cross-examining him at trial and during the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, violated his federal and state constitutional rights to a fair trial, to an impartial jury and to confront the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Conceding his failure to preserve this claim, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>defendant, relying upon <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 529 A.2d 653 (1987), seeks review of the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). The defendant alternatively asserts that the claim is reviewable as plain error under Practice Book \u00a7 4185.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 204 Conn. 536, we found an unpreserved prosecutorial misconduct claim \u201creviewable under the second exceptional circumstance of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, because the defendant [had] raised a claim, adequately supported by the record, that he clearly [had] been deprived of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial.\u201d We pointed out, however, that \u201c[i]n the cases in which we have denied <em>Evans </em>review, the claimed misconduct consisted of isolated and brief episodes, and did not reveal a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial. Moreover, the misconduct was not blatantly egregious.\u201d Id., 537. Our careful review of the record in this case reveals that the prosecutor\u2019s challenged conduct, while improper in certain instances, was \u201cunrepresentative of a pattern of conduct repeated throughout the trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 507, 590 A.2d 901 (1991). Similarly, we do not find, as is necessary to merit plain error review, that those limited instances of improper conduct so pervaded the defendant\u2019s trial as to have impaired the effectiveness or integrity of the judicial process. <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 547, 572 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>A.2d 1006 (1990). We, therefore, decline to review the defendant\u2019s unpreserved prosecutorial misconduct claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Finally, the defendant challenges three omissions in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. He argues that the court deprived him of due process by failing to give adequate instructions on: (1) the essential element of intent permanently to deprive another of property as required for conviction of the crime of robbery in violation of \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4); (2) the essential element of compulsion required for conviction of the crime of sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a); and (3) the statutory definition of. \u201cintentionally\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11) with respect to the essential element of intent required for conviction of several of the charged crimes.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In light of his failure to preserve any of these claims by submitting requests to charge on the matters now claimed improperly omitted or taking appropriate exceptions at the close of the court\u2019s instructions; see Practice Book \u00a7 852; the defendant seeks review of the claims under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">We agree with the defendant that \u201cthe record is adequate to review\u201d all of his claims; id., 239; and thus he has satisfied the first <em>Golding </em>condition. We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>agree that each of the defendant\u2019s claims, in that they pertain to essential elements of the crimes charged, are \u201cof constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right\u201d in satisfaction of the second <em>Golding </em>condition. Id.; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>216 Conn. 367, 383, 579 A.2d 1066 (1990). Nonetheless, after a painstaking review of the court\u2019s charge as a whole, we conclude that none of the challenged omissions in the court\u2019s instructions could possibly have misled the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>212 Conn. 31, 38, 561 A.2d 897 (1989). The defendant has therefore failed to satisfy the third <em>Golding </em>condition by demonstrating that any of the alleged constitutional violations \u201cclearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 240. Necessarily, then, all of the defendant\u2019s claims fail.
