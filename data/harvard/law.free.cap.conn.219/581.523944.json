We conclude that an employer was required to pay the diagnosis related group or \u201cDRG\u201d charges for hospital services billed during that five-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">The parties stipulated to the pertinent facts. The named plaintiff, Craig Burge (the employee), was employed by the named defendant, the town of Stoning-ton (the employer). On August 21, 1987, he suffered an injury compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., and was hospitalized between September 2 and September 7, 1988. During his hospitalization, Lawrence and Memorial Hospital (the hospital) provided him with rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>sonable and necessary hospital care. The hospital\u2019s bill, dated September 12, 1988, itemized charges totaling $3799.74. At that time, however, the DRG Act required the hospital to bill a fixed charge per case based upon the diagnosis of the patient and the patient\u2019s payer category, without regard to the particular services rendered. General Statutes \u00a7 19a-165f (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the hospital billed the employee $7207.55.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The employer, conceding liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, paid the itemized charges, but refused to pay the balance of $3407.81. In the ensuing proceedings before the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the second district and the compensation review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>division (CRD), the employer argued that the plain language of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-294<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> limited its liability for hospital fees to the actual cost of the services provided to the employee, i.e., the itemized charges, and that this language was neither explicitly nor implicitly repealed by passage of the DRG Act in 1984. The commissioner, and the CRD, disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The CRD rejected the employer\u2019s contentions on the same basis expounded fully in an earlier CRD decision, <em>Tannery. Walgren Tree Experts, </em>No. 748 CRD-8-88-7 (January 17,1990). In <em>Tanner, </em>the CRD concluded that after the legislature in 1973 created the commission on hospitals and health care (hospital commission) with rate-setting and budget review powers, the \u201cactual cost\u201d language in \u00a7 31-294 \u201cceased to be relevant.\u201d It found that since that date, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioners, when determining employer liability for hospital confinement and treatment, had relied on the uniform rates set by the hospital commission, and it concluded that the DRG rates set by the commission after passage of the DRG Act were similarly applicable. Finally, the CRD held that the legislature had resolved any remaining ambiguity when it enacted No. 88-357 of the 1988 Public Acts, which explicitly amended both \u00a7 19a-165f and \u00a7 31-294 by requiring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>employers to pay hospital DRG charges. The CRD held that these amendments were intended to clarify existing law and thus concluded that since October 1,1984, the effective date of the DRG Act, employers would be required to pay for hospital services at the DRG rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, including \u00a7 31-294, has been a part of our law since 1913. In the ensuing seventy-eight years, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioners have made numerous awards, including orders to employers to pay hospital charges. It is appropriate for us to consider this long history of practical application in our analysis of the statute\u2019s meaning and scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In September, 1988, when the employee was injured, General Statutes \u00a7 31-294 provided in pertinent part: \u201cThe pecuniary liability of the employer for the medical and surgical service herein required shall be limited to such charges as prevail in the same community or similar communities for similar treatment of injured persons of a like standard of living when such treatment is paid for by the injured person; <em>but the liability of the employer for hospital service shall be the amount it actually costs the hospital to render the service, such amount to be determined by the commissioner . . . </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The italicized language was added to the statute in 1921; Public Acts 1921, c. 306, \u00a7 3; apparently in response to the deep division between compensation commissioners regarding the appropriate level of hospital fees for which employers would be liable. Early workers\u2019 compensation commission decisions indicate that most members of the industrial working class at the beginning of this century lacked the funds to pay their hospital costs. As a result, hospitals commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>admitted them to the \u201cgeneral wards\u201d or \u201cpublic wards\u201d of the hospital, which provided hospital'care to the general public at below cost. See, e.g., <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>Yale Brewing Co., </em>3 Conn. Comp. Dec. I-181 (1919); <em>Malone </em>v. <em>H. R. Douglas, Inc., </em>1 Conn. Comp. Dec. 297 (1915). For example, a patient in the \u201cgeneral wards\u201d in the period 1916 through 1919 might pay $7 per week to receive bed, board, nursing care and the services, performed on a pro bono basis, of the same doctors and surgeons who cared for the private patients. See <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>Yale Brewing Co., </em>supra; <em>Beinotovitz </em>v. <em>National Iron Works, </em>1 Conn. Comp. Dec. 623 (1916); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Spring Glen Farm, Inc., </em>1 Conn. Comp. Dec. 593 (1916). By contrast, a private room patient could pay $25 per week for bed and board and in addition be required to pay separately for doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 fees. See, e.g., <em>Beinotovitz </em>v. <em>National Iron Works, </em>supra; cf. <em>Christophson </em>v. <em>Turner Construction Co., </em>1 Conn. Comp. Dec. 591 (1916) ($18 and above). It was widely acknowledged that the \u201cgeneral ward\u201d was in essence a \u201ccharity\u201d ward that operated at a loss. See <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>New Haven Rendering Co., </em>4 Conn. Comp. Dec. I-229 (1921); <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>Yale Brewing Co., </em>supra; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>2 Conn. Comp. Dec. 1-363 (1917); <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Maxim Munitions Corporation, </em>2 Conn. Comp. Dec. I-88, I-89 (1916). Some hospitals developed a third alternative, commonly called the \u201cprivate ward,\u201d or semiprivate rooms with eight to ten patients. These \u201cprivate wards\u201d provided a higher nurse to patient ratio, better food, and better conditions. Charges for admission to \u201cprivate wards\u201d were viewed as \u201ccompensatory,\u201d that is, the fee charged was expected to cover the actual costs of the stay. See <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>New Haven Rendering Co., </em>supra, I-232; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Maxim Munitions Corporation, </em>supra, I-89. In such wards the patient also had to pay extra for doctors\u2019 Mis, but not usually for nursing care. Some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>hospitals developed \u201cprivate wards\u201d only as a response to enactment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act; in those hospitals the \u201cprivate wards\u201d were actually referred to as \u201ccompensation wards.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>New Haven, Rendering Co., </em>supra; <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>Yale Brewing Co., </em>supra, I-183.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">In those early days, the compensation commissioners debated whether hospitals could receive more than their below-cost \u201cgeneral ward\u201d fees for hospital care provided to members of the industrial working class who would, without workers\u2019 compensation, undoubtedly have relied on the \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201ccharity\u201d wards for hospital care. <em>Compare Schillinger v. Yale Brewing Co., </em>supra, and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Spring Glen Farm, Inc., </em>supra. Not infrequently, a hospital would admit injured workers to the \u201cprivate ward\u201d and be paid only the fee for \u201cgeneral ward\u201d treatment. See, e.g., <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>Yale Brewing Co., </em>supra; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>supra; <em>Malone </em>v. <em>H. R. Douglas, Inc., </em>supra. This practice would result in a substantial loss to the hospital. Indeed, the Connecticut Medical Society in 1914 submitted to the workers\u2019 compensation commissioners a recommendation that the legislature authorize private ward fees with additional charges for doctors\u2019 fees, which the commissioners included, without comment, in their annual report to the governor and general assembly. 1914 Conn. Public Documents vol. 1, pt. 2, doc. 15, p. 17. Various commissioners in their decisions also invited legislative action on this issue. See <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>New Haven Rendering Co., </em>supra, I-233; <em>Schillinger </em>v. <em>Yale Brewing Co., </em>supra, I-187.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">This history indicates that the 1921 amendment to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, limiting hospital charges to the actual costs of the services provided, was probably added in order to prevent hospitals from being imdercompensated. This is in contrast to the other language in \u00a7 31-294 limiting employer liability for medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>cal services to \u201csuch charges as prevail . . . when such treatment is paid for by the injured person,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which apparently was intended to prevent doctors from increasing their fees when they discovered that the \u201cdeep pocket\u201d of compensation insurance would pay the bill. <em>Covey </em>v. <em>Honiss Oyster House, Inc., </em>117 Conn. 282, 284, 167 A. 807 (1933); cf. <em>Christophson </em>v. <em>Turner Construction Co., </em>supra, I-593.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The CRD\u2019s opinion in <em>Tanner </em>declared that since 1921, the commissioners met yearly to set the actual costs that a hospital might charge for services.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>It explained, however, that after 1973, when the legislature established the hospital commission; Public Acts 1973, No. 73-117; the commissioners simply deferred to the fee schedule established by the hospital commission. Presumably, the commissioners interpreted the language in \u00a7 31-294, \u201csuch amount to be determined by the commissioner,\u201d as sufficiently broad to authorize deference to uniform rates set by the hospital commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">The commissioners\u2019 practical application of the statute over the last seventy years provides a useful indication of its meaning. <em>See Board of Education </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>217 Conn. 110, 120, 584 A.2d 1172 (1991). The compensation commissioners had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>accepted the hospital commission rates after 1973 without objection for eleven years when the DRG Act became effective, raising the stakes by creating in some cases wide disparities between itemized charges and billed charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\u201cWe seek the intent of the legislature \u2018not in what it meant to say, but in what it did say.\u2019 <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 571, 512 A.2d 893 (1986).\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). Whatever led to its enactment, the words of \u00a7 31-294 limit the employer\u2019s liability to the \u201camount it actually costs the hospital to render the service.\u201d The compensation commissioners could not assume that the hospital commission would consider the actual costs to the hospital as the only criterion for setting rates. Indeed, No. 73-117 of the 1973 Public Acts permitted the hospital commission to consider, in addition to \u201cnecessary expenses\u201d of the hospital, the hospital\u2019s effectiveness, the quality of care, and the community\u2019s need for its services, as well as \u201cany other factors [that] the commission deems relevant.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>We conclude, nevertheless, that the commissioners\u2019 deference to hospital commission rates was not only authorized, but required, by the legislature. In enacting No. 73-117 of the 1973 Public Acts, the legislature effectively preempted the entire field of hospital rate setting, including the portion previously occupied by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioners. Having authorized the hospital commission to determine all hospital rates, the legislature cannot have intended to continue requiring the compensation commissioners independently to establish the actual costs of the hospital for services rendered to injured workers as distinct from other persons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The resulting two-tier system would also defeat the implicit purpose of \u00a7 31-294, namely, that fees for medical care of workers\u2019 compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>sation patients should be neither more, nor less, than those paid by the general paying public. We presume that the legislature intended a reasonable and rational result. See <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>supra; <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 507-508, 542 A.2d 700 (1988). Thus, although we commonly disfavor repeal by implication; <em>Metropolitan District </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>199 Conn. 294, 305, 507 A.2d 92 (1986); \u201c \u2018[s]o far as pre-existing provisions, by their repugnancy or inconsistency, stand in the way of the full and effective operation of the final expressed will of the legislature, they stand, in law, as <em>pro tanto </em>repealed. Not only is this true of those provisions which are on their face inconsistent with the Act, but of any others which upon examination and analysis are found to hamper or interfere with its workability.\u2019 <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>[104 Conn. 238, 253, 132 A. 690 (1926)].\u201d <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>159 Conn. 453, 469-70, 271 A.2d 110 (1970). We conclude that No. 73-117 of the 1973 Public Acts effectively repealed the \u201cactual cost\u201d language of \u00a7 31-294 and required compensation commissioners to defer to the hospital commission rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">In September, 1988, when the employee\u2019s hospital costs were incurred, the DRG statute provided, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) For the rate year commencing in 1987, and for subsequent rate years, hospitals shall charge according to a fee schedule based on a standard fixed charge per case for all inpatient cases except cases in exempt units or cases classified as outliers .... <em>Suck fee schedule shall be used for all payers </em>except for Medicare and for medical assistance provided pursuant to chapters 302 and 308.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)

The statutory language, \u201call payers,\u201d which was added in 1987, demonstrates that the legislature intended no exemption from hospital commission rates for workers\u2019 compensation cases.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, according to the plain language of the DRG Act, employers and workers\u2019 compensation insurers were required to pay for hospital services at DRG rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">A review of the legislative history, while not required, confirms our reading of the statute. \u201cLegislative his<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>tory\u201d includes not only those discussions and circumstances that <em>led </em>to the enactment of the statute, but any subsequent legislative history that sheds light on the legislature\u2019s original intent. <em>Perille </em>v. <em>Raybestos-Manhattan-Europe, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 529, 541, 494 A.2d 555 (1985). Thus, \u201c[a] clarifying act, which \u2018in effect construes and clarifies a prior statute must be accepted as the legislative declaration of the meaning of the original act.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Blasko, </em>202 Conn. 541, 557, 522 A.2d 753 (1987), quoting <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>173 Conn. 232, 246, 377 A.2d 305 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The legislative history unquestionably indicates that \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 19 of No. 88-357 of the 1988 Public Acts, which became effective on October 1,1988, after the employee was injured and incurred hospital costs, were intended to clarify the ambiguity created when the legislature enacted General Statutes \u00a7 19a-165f (a) without explicitly repealing the conflicting provisions of \u00a7 31-294.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The statement of purpose contained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>bill that later became No. 88-357 specifically states that it was in part intended \u201cto clarify sections pertaining to . . . the payment of hospital costs by workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d Raised Committee Bill No. 387, p. 15. The office of legislative research analysis, incorporating the favorable report of the public health committee, states that the act would \u201cmake it clear that workers\u2019 compensation [program] payers [and governmental payers] must pay fixed charges\u201d under the Prospective Pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ment System. OLR Amended Bill Analysis, p. 100. Representative Paul Gionfriddo, explaining the purpose of Senate Amendment \u201cA,\u201d which became part of the act, stated: \u201c [TJhis amendment . . . clarifies] that under the terms of the prospective payment system that we have in place that workers\u2019 compensation carriers are third party carriers or payers and are to be treated as such, as was originally intended in the statute, so it is clarifying in nature.\u201d 31 H.R. Proc., Pt. 24,1988 Sess., pp. 8329-30. Statements of purpose, committee reports, and floor debate are all legitimate sources of legislative intent. See, e.g., <em>Nationwide Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gode, </em>187 Conn. 386, 391 n.5, 446 A.2d 1059 (1982) (floor debate); <em>Tax Commissioner </em>v. <em>Estate of Bissell, </em>supra, 244-45 (statement of purpose); <em>Connecticut Rural Roads Improvement Assn. </em>v. <em>Hurley, </em>124 Conn. 20, 26, 197 A. 90 (1938) (committee reports).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">It is rare to find such plentiful evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent to clarify an earlier statute.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have no difficulty, therefore, in concluding that the legislature originally intended no exemption for employers or workers\u2019 compensation insurance carriers from the provisions of the DRG Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Having established the meaning of \u00a7 19a-165f (a), we return to \u00a7 31-294. Section 19a-165f (a) of the DRG Act, as a subsequent enactment, must control over the conflicting terms of \u00a7 31-294, as modified by Public Acts 1973, No. 73-117. See <em>Plourde </em>v. <em>Liburdi, </em>207 Conn. 412, 417, 540 A.2d 1054 (1988); <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>187 Conn. 53, 65, 444 A.2d 225 (1982). We therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>conclude that the DRG Act further modified \u00a7 31-294 to require an employer to pay the DRG rate established by the hospital commission even though that rate is based upon a hospital\u2019s average cost per diagnosis instead of the costs of providing service to a particular patient.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 19a-165f, as amended by Public Acts 1987, No. 87-122, No. 87-443, \u00a7 5, and No. 87-510, \u00a7 3, provided, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) For the rate year commencing in 1987, and for subsequent rate years, hospitals shall charge according to a fee schedule based on a standard fixed charge per case for all inpatient cases except cases in exempt units or cases classified as outliers and the patient shall be liable for payment on the basis of such schedule.
