We conclude that the trial court improperly allowed evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of a subsequent crime in order to prove identification, and that this improper admission constituted harmful error. As to the other issues, we affirm the trial court\u2019s rulings. Accordingly, we reverse the conviction, and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The jury might reasonably have found the following facts. On November 20,1988, the victims, Allyson and James Brownlow, resided in a single family, three story house located at 683 Prospect Street in New Haven. At approximately 6 a.m., they were awakened by two black men with guns who had burst through their bedroom door and turned on the lights. The first man went to Mr. Brownlow\u2019s side of the bed and pointed a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>at him, while the second man, identified as the defendant, went to Mrs. Brownlow\u2019s side of the bed and pointed a gun at her. The Brownlows were ordered to roll over onto their stomachs in bed. As she lay on her stomach, Mrs. Brownlow\u2019s face was turned so that she could observe the defendant. The defendant kept his gun pointed at Mrs. Brownlow while he rifled through the dresser drawers on her side of the bed and removed various pieces of jewelry. During part of this time, the defendant was a foot to a foot and a half away from Mrs. Brownlow. During the entire time spent in the Brownlows\u2019 bedroom, the defendant wore a fiberglass painter\u2019s mask covering his mouth and the lower part of his nose. At one point, when the defendant\u2019s partner became agitated because the Brownlows did not have enough cash in the house, Mrs. Brownlow sat up in bed, took off her engagement ring and handed it to the defendant to try to calm the partner. Mrs. Brown-low got a \u201cvery good look\u201d at the defendant as she handed the ring to him, and then she lay on her side and continued to observe him. After ten to fifteen minutes had elapsed, the defendant and his partner left the victims\u2019 second floor bedroom, went downstairs and left the house through the kitchen door. Mr. Brown-low phoned the police. After the police arrived, it was discovered that a locked kitchen window on the first floor had been forced open.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The jury found the defendant guilty of the crimes charged, and he was thereafter sentenced to a total effective term of twenty-five years imprisonment. The defendant appealed to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly permitted the state, in its case-in-chief, to introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of a subsequent crime in order to prove identity. We agree that the admission of this evidence was both improper and harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The rules governing the admissibility of evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s commission of a subsequent unconnected crime are well established. Such evidence is inadmissible to prove the defendant\u2019s bad character or propensity for criminal behavior. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>196 Conn. 185, 190, 491 A.2d 1092 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carsetti, </em>12 Conn. App. 375, 380, 530 A.2d 1095, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 809, 537 A.2d 77 (1987). \u201c \u2018 \u201cEvidence of other misconduct, however, \u2018may be allowed for the purpose of proving many different things, such as intent, identity, malice, motive or a system of criminal activity\u2019; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>[187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382 (1982)]; or an element of the crime. <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 23, 444 A.2d 213 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 675-76, 469 A.2d 760 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>182 Conn. 335, 337, 438 A.2d 107 (1980).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>200 Conn. 268, 273, 511 A.2d 321 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>213 Conn. 422, 428-29, 568 A.2d 448 (1990). \u201cTo be admitted under one of these exceptions, the evidence must satisfy a two-pronged test: \u2018 \u201cFirst, the evidence must be relevant and material to at least one of the circumstances encompassed by the exceptions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>[supra, 676]. Second, the probative value of the evidence must outweigh its prejudicial effect. Id.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>199 Conn. 146, 151, 506 A.2d 100 (1986).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Outside the presence of the jury, the state offered the testimony of Detective Frederick Hurley of the New Haven police department concerning his December 16, 1988 arrest of the defendant for attempted burglary. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection to Hurley\u2019s testimony and permitted him to testify before the jury. Hurley testified that on December 16, 1988, at approximately 3 a.m., he and his partner were on surveillance in the vicinity of 470 Prospect Street and were dispatched to that address to investigate a report of a burglary in progress. Upon arriving at the scene, Hurley observed two black males huddled together on the front stoop of an apartment, with their backs to the street, directing their attention to the inner front door while the outer screen door was propped open by their bodies. The two men were identified as the defendant and Douglas Antrum. The defendant had in his possession a Playtex dishwashing glove, a white sock and an empty knife case. A knife was found next to the stoop. Antrum had in his possession a screwdriver and the right half of a toy pistol. Hurley found pry marks on the door frame around the lock. The occupants of 470 Prospect Street informed the police that they had been awakened by the sounds of their doorbell ringing and the front door knob being jiggled and shaken and, after looking outside and seeing the two men on the front stoop, they had called the police. Hurley testified that 470 Prospect Street is approximately two blocks from the Brownlow residence. He further testified that 470 Prospect Street is a two story apartment that is part of a \u201crow house\u201d consisting of approximately ten apartments connected in a row.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The trial court found that the proffered testimony of Hurley was \u201cextremely material to the issue of identification.\u201d The state has the burden to prove identity as one element of the crime alleged. <em>State </em>v. Perry, 195 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Conn. 505, 521, 488 A.2d 1256 (1985). \u201c \u2018The first threshold for the use of evidence of other crimes or misconduct on the issue of identity is that the methods used be \u201csufficiently unique to warrant a reasonable inference that the person who performed one misdeed also did the other.\u201d <em>[State </em>v. Ibraimov, supra, 354].\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>[supra, 190]. \u2018 \u201cMuch more is required than the fact that the offenses fall into the same class. \u2018The device used must be so unusual and distinctive as to be like a signature.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>supra, 354.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Mandrell, </em>supra, 151-52. In order to determine if this threshold criterion for admissibility was met, we must examine the proffered evidence and compare it to the charged offenses.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">In making this comparison, the features common to both crimes must be sufficiently distinctive to warrant a belief that the same person committed both. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>supra. There should not be significant differences in the context and modus operandi of the crimes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>187 Conn. 681, 686, 447 A.2d 1167 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Hurley\u2019s testimony reveals the following common features: both crimes involved burglaries, although the second one was an unsuccessful attempt; the Brownlow residence and the site of the second crime were approximately two blocks apart; private residences were involved in each burglary, although one was a single family home and the other was an apartment in a row house; both crimes were committed in the early morning hours, 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. respectively; the crimes occurred twenty-seven days apart; both crimes involved forced entry through a locked opening; and the defendant was described as wearing two layers of outerwear by witnesses to both crimes. Finally, both crimes were committed in such a manner, and at such a time, that confrontation with the home\u2019s occupants would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>likely. It is only this last common feature that can in any reasonable way be characterized as unique or distinctive,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but we are not persuaded that this fact alone raises these two crimes to the level of uniqueness required by law. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Murrell, </em>7 Conn. App. 75, 82, 507 A.2d 1033 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Even if we consider all the common features together, the pattern that emerges is not such a distinctive combination of circumstances and actions that a \u201csignature\u201d or \u201ccriminal logo\u201d can be discerned.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is particularly true when the significant differences between these two crimes are recognized. In the Brownlow burglary, both perpetrators were armed with handguns. In the subsequent burglary, one perpetrator had one half of a toy gun, and the defendant may have had a knife.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the Brownlow burglary, the house was entered through a rear window facing a wooded back yard. In the subsequent burglary, entry was attempted through the front door, which was thirty feet away from and in plain view of Prospect Street. In the Brownlow burglary, the perpetrators adeptly managed to break in and remove numerous items from the downstairs without awakening the occupants. In the subsequent burglary, the perpetrators ineptly awakened the occupants by ringing their door bell and rattling their front door before they gained entry. In the Brownlow burglary, the defendant wore a fiber<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>glass painter\u2019s mask and his partner wore sunglasses. In the subsequent burglary, neither the defendant nor Antrum wore masks or concealed their facial features in any way, or carried any provisions for doing so. Mrs. Brownlow testified that, during the burglary, the defendant was not wearing noticeable gloves, although she could not tell if he was wearing \u201csheer\u201d gloves. During the subsequent burglary, the defendant had in his possession a Playtex dishwashing glove.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The existence of significant differences between the two crimes, in combination with the fact that only one of the features common to both crimes, the confrontational nature of them, can be described as unique or distinctive, negates the inference that the person who committed one also committed the other. Consequently, the evidence of the subsequent burglary was not relevant to proving the defendant\u2019s identity as the person who committed the Brownlow burglary. Such evidence was improperly admitted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Our inquiry does not end, however, with the determination that the evidence was improperly admitted. The state argues that any error in the admission of this evidence of a subsequent crime was harmless. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">The defendant objected at trial to the admission of this evidence, but did not articulate any constitutional basis for his objection. \u201c \u2018Because the defendant did not claim at trial that the error deprived him of a constitutional right, he bears the burden of proving its harmfulness.\u2019 <em>[State </em>v. <em>Conroy, </em>194 Conn. 623, 627, 484 A.2d 448 (1984)].\u201d <em>State v. Murrell, </em>supra, 91. \u201c \u2018 \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>181 Conn. 187,196-97, 435 A.2d 3 (1980)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>171 Conn. 293, 300, 370 A.2d 928 (1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 723, 732, 535 A.2d 808 (1988).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 47, 540 A.2d 42 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 436-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Murrell, </em>supra, the defendant was arrested for breaking into an automobile and removing a radio. At the trial, the state was permitted to present evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct for the limited purpose of proving identity and common scheme. Although the Appellate Court concluded that it was error to have allowed this evidence for either purpose, it nonetheless held that this error was harmless, in light of the \u201cotherwise substantial case upon which the jury could conclude that the defendant was the perpetrator of these offenses.\u201d Id., 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The other evidence considered by the jury in <em>Murrell </em>included the testimony of the police officer who found the defendant holding the car stereo speakers and who chased the defendant for a brief period of time. The officer testified that he was able to see the defendant\u2019s face several times at close range before and during the chase. Id. Furthermore, after the chase, the officer stopped a passing police cruiser and radioed a description of the suspect, including his height and clothing. Id., 77. Finally, the officer positively identified the defendant at trial. Id., 91. The defendant was apprehended only a short time after the incident in question, and the police then found the knobs from the stolen radio in the defendant\u2019s jacket pocket. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In the present case, by contrast, the other evidence upon which the jury could have concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>defendant was the perpetrator of the crimes was less substantial. In the absence of the subsequent crime evidence, the case turned upon the in-court and pretrial identifications of the defendant by Mrs. Brownlow, and the testimony of Mr. Brownlow regarding some gestures allegedly made by the defendant at the arraignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">At trial, Mrs. Brownlow made an in-court identification of the defendant as the second man who had entered her bedroom and pointed a gun at her face. She testified that, during the twelve to fifteen minutes that the defendant was in the bedroom, she was \u201cfixated on him\u201d and that she was \u201cextremely certain\u201d that the defendant was the person in her bedroom, holding a gun to her face and rifling through her dresser. She testified that, during the time he was in her bedroom, she was able to get a very good look at the defendant\u2019s eyes, cheekbones, the shape of his face, hair, ears and the general shape of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Mrs. Brownlow testified that, at the time of the burglary, she noticed two distinctive features of the defendant, namely his pointed \u201cwidow\u2019s peak\u201d hairline and swollen eyelids. Unlike <em>Murrell, </em>however, these specific features were not described to the police in the initial description. On the contrary, Mrs. Brownlow told the police that she did not think she would be able to pick out either of the burglars from photographs and also that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know if [she] wanted to pick him out at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The state further presented the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Brownlow and Detective Leroy Dease of the New Haven police department concerning Mrs. Brownlow\u2019s pretrial identification of the defendant at an arraignment approximately three weeks after the burglary. From that testimony, the jury reasonably could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>found that on December 17,1988, Mrs. Brownlow identified the defendant while he was being arraigned on unrelated charges. On that date, Mr. and Mrs. Brown-low were brought to a courtroom by Dease to \u201csee if they could identify\u201d the person who committed the burglary. Approximately fourteen men, at least nine of whom were black, were brought into the courtroom at one time to be arraigned, and Mrs. Brownlow identified the defendant as soon as she saw him come into the room. She testified that the defendant \u201clooked startled to see me\u201d and that he had pointed at her. In addition, she stated that on that day in the courtroom, she was \u201cextremely certain\u201d that the defendant was the person who had been in her bedroom. Finally, although she did not mention the distinctive facial features of the defendant to Dease at the arraignment, she had mentioned them to her husband at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The only corroborating evidence in support of Mrs. Brownlow\u2019s in-court and pretrial identifications is Mr. Brownlow\u2019s testimony that at the arraignment he saw the defendant point to Mrs. Brownlow, to his eye and then to himself, and that he saw the defendant mouth the words \u201cshe saw me\u201d to a young black woman sitting near the door to the courtroom. Nevertheless, Mr. Brownlow did not actually hear the defendant speak these words. Furthermore, although Dease testified that the defendant gestured and said <em>something </em>to a young lady sitting near the courtroom door, he had no knowledge of what had been said. There is no physical evidence linking the defendant to the burglary at the Brownlow\u2019s residence, such as the radio knobs in <em>Murrell. </em>On the contrary, although the police were able to lift six identifiable fingerprints from several areas in the home touched by the intruders, none of the fingerprints were those of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Based on the lack of other substantial evidence implicating the defendant in the crime, we cannot say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the admission of the subsequent crime evidence in this case amounted to harmless error. Rather, it is more probable than not that it influenced the jury to believe that the defendant was predisposed to commit the crimes charged. \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018Any improper evidence that may have a tendency to excite the passions, awaken the sympathy, or influence the judgment, of the jury, cannot be considered as harmless.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>[179 Conn. 23, 32, 425 A.2d 560 (1979)], quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Loughlin, </em>149 Conn. 21, 26, 175 A.2d 367 (1961).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sierra, </em>supra, 437. The defendant, therefore, is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Because, the remaining claims of the defendant are likely to be repeated at a retrial of the case, we shall consider them. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>supra, 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The defendant next argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the testimony of Allyson Brownlow regarding her pretrial identification of the defendant at his arraignment on unrelated charges. He argues that the procedure used was unnecessarily suggestive and unreliable, and claims a deprivation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u201c \u2018 \u2018 \u201cA defendant who moves to suppress identification evidence bears the initial burden of proving that the identification resulted from an unconstitutional procedure.\u201d \u2019 . . . \u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>[203 Conn. 81, 93, 523 A.2d 495 (1987)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>[196 Conn. 289, 293, 493 A.2d 836 (1985)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 244, 476 A.2d 550 (1984).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>204 Conn. 571, 581, 529 A.2d 673 (1987). \u201c \u2018 \u201cIn determining whether identification procedures violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights, the required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>unnecessarily suggestive, and second, if it is found to be so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on an examination of the \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramsundar, </em>204 Conn. 4, 10, 526 A.2d 1311 (1987), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>182 Conn. 366, 371-72, 438 A.2d 432 (1980); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>[supra]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>199 Conn. 308, 310, 507 A.2d 99 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>[supra, 292-93].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We have considered the suggestiveness of arraignment identifications in <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>185 Conn. 607, 613, 441 A.2d 595 (1981). In both cases, we recognized that an arraignment identification <em>may </em>be suggestive.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 295; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra. \u201cThe mischief involved in the arraignment observation is the real possibility that the victim of one crime, armed with the knowledge that the suspect is being charged with another crime, possibly of the same character, is more likely to leap to the conclusion that the person being arraigned in front of him committed both crimes.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Although we recognize the potential for suggestiveness inherent in an arraignment identification, we do not believe that the procedure involved here was unnecessarily suggestive. Mrs. Brownlow testified that Dease informed her and her husband that the police had caught two burglars breaking into a neighborhood residence and requested that they go to the arraignment to try to identify the persons who had been in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>their bedroom. The defendant entered the arraignment courtroom with approximately thirteen other men, at least eight of whom were black. At no time did Dease describe the two suspects, give their names, or in any way suggest whom should be picked out. He simply brought the Brownlows into the courtroom, had them sit down, told them that if they recognized the persons who burglarized their house to tell him, and then sat away from them on the other side of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Even if we were to assume that the procedure used was unnecessarily suggestive, the defendant has not met his burden of proving that, under the totality of the circumstances, this identification was so unreliable as to be inadmissible into evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramsundar, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018In determining whether an identification is reliable in the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the corruptive influence of the suggestive procedure is weighed against \u201cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.

Immediately after the burglary, Mrs. Brownlow gave a general description of the defendant to the police. The defendant does not challenge the accuracy of the description, only its lack of specificity. We are concerned, for these purposes, only with accuracy. At the suppression hearing, Mrs. Brownlow testified that she was \u201cvery certain\u201d when she made the identification at the arraignment that the defendant was the person who had been in her bedroom.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The length of time between the crime and the identification was less than one month.

In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant\u2019s claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We note, however, that although this issue was presented on appeal under <em>Golding </em>by way of an unpreserved constitutional claim, we review it only because it is likely to arise on retrial, and we assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>that the objection will be properly made and preserved at the retrial. A <em>Golding </em>analysis is therefore inappropriate.

This discretion comes into play, however, only after the defendant has been permitted cross-examination sufficient to satisfy the sixth amendment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>196 Conn. 421, 424, 493 A.2d 223 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 508, 435 A.2d 1022 (1980). The constitutional standard is met when defense counsel is permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which the jurors, as the sole triers of the facts and credibility, can appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vasilios, </em>598 F.2d 387, 389 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 967, 100 S.

In particular, the defendant\u2019s cross-examination revealed that Mrs. Brownlow had not mentioned the defendant\u2019s distinctive facial features to the police and had told the police she did not think she could identify either of the burglars from photographs. The defendant had ample opportunity to impeach the reliability of the witness\u2019 identification of the defendant. We are not convinced that this foreclosure of this avenue of questions attempted by the defendant rises to the level of a sixth amendment violation. Rather, the denial of this line of inquiry was within the trial court\u2019s discretion. \u201c \u2018The trial court has broad discretion to determine both the relevancy and remoteness of evidence. . . .

Rather, a balancing of all the factors involved is required by the trial judge, and the final decision rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly excluded the testimony of Michelle Gary, the defendant\u2019s girlfriend, as to certain incriminating statements made to her by the defendant\u2019s brother, Donald Payne.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">At a lengthy offer of proof outside the presence of the jury, the court heard testimony from Gary, Donald Payne and the defendant. The defendant sought to have Gary testify that: in November and December, 1988, Donald Payne had been committing burglaries on Prospect Street; late one night Donald Payne came to the defendant and Gary\u2019s house and invited the defendant to commit a burglary with him, but the defendant declined; the next morning, Donald Payne came to their house again and bragged about the burglary he had just committed with another person, where they had awakened people in their bedroom and robbed them; on that same morning, Donald Payne tried to get Gary to purchase a diamond ring that he had in his possession; several weeks later, after the defendant had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>arrested, Gary was riding in a car with Donald Payne when he pointed out a house on Prospect Street and said, \u201cthat is the house . . . that Freddie is being blamed in jail for right now,\u201d and then he bragged about how he had committed that burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u201cAt the outset, we note that \u2018[t]he determination [of] whether a third party declaration against penal interest is trustworthy lies in the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>[179 Conn. 431, 452, 426 A.2d 799 (1980)].\u2019 <em>[State </em>v. <em>Bryant, 202 </em>Conn. 676, 693, 513 A.2d 66 (1987)]. Evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>170 Conn. 161, 166, 364 A.2d 104 (1976).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hernandez, </em>204 Conn. 377, 390, 528 A.2d 794 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\u201c \u2018In <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>[supra, 450-51], we adopted a rule, consistent with <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>[410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973)], and in accord with rule 804 (b) (3) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which provides that trustworthy third party statements against penal interest which are exculpatory to the defendant, are admissible if the declarant is unavailable.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, 202 Conn. </em>676, 692, 523 A.2d 451 (1987); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Frye, </em>182 Conn. 476, 479, 438 A.2d 735 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>180 Conn. 619, 630, 430 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 920, 101 S.

Ed. 2d 148 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayette, </em>supra, 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u201cIn determining the trustworthiness of a third party declaration against penal interest, this court has set forth four general considerations: (1) the time the declaration is made and the party to whom it is made; (2) the existence of corroborating evidence; (3) the extent to which the statement is really against the declarant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>penal interest; and (4) the availability of the declarant as a witness. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 693, and cases cited therein; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>supra, 633; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 451.\u201d Id., 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">It is uncontested that Donald Payne was unavailable as a witness because he invoked his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. See id., citing (State v. <em>DeFreitas, </em>supra, 441. Additionally, it is undisputed that Donald Payne\u2019s statements, as reported by Gary, were against his penal interest. Thus, our examination is limited to the time of the declarations and the party to whom they were made, and the evidence corroborating the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">As to the first element, the trial court found that the long-standing relationship between the defendant and Gary would not lead to a conclusion of trustworthiness.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The trial court analogized this case to the situation in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>200 Conn. 721, 726, 513 A.2d 653 (1986), where we found that the witness\u2019 intimate relationship with the defendant was a factor \u201ccoloring\u201d the trustworthiness of the proffered statements. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">As to the second element, the trial court found that there was no evidence corroborating these statements. Since Donald Payne refused to answer any questions directly related to this incident, his testimony provided no corroboration and the defendant\u2019s testimony during the offer of proof in fact contradicted Gary\u2019s testimony as to the content of the conversations between Donald Payne and the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Given the lack of corroborating evidence, the nature of the relationship between Gary and the defendant, and the defendant\u2019s own testimony contradicting that of Gary regarding Donald Payne\u2019s purported statement, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting Gary\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim on appeal is that the trial court improperly prohibited him from: (1) presenting evidence that his brother, Donald Payne, committed this crime; and (2) calling Donald Payne as a witness so that the jury could observe the physical similarities between the defendant and his brother. The gravamen of this third party culpability defense was the testimony of Gary, discussed in part IV, supra, concerning Donald Payne\u2019s declarations against penal interest, and evidence that Donald Payne committed a burglary similar to this one six months after it.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">As discussed in part IV, supra, the testimony of Gary concerning Donald Payne\u2019s declarations against penal interest was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\u201cWe have considered on several occasions the admissibility of evidence offered to inculpate a person other than the accused in the commission of the crime. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Milner, </em>206 Conn. 512, 517, 539 A.2d 80 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Echols, </em>203 Conn. 385, 392-93, 524 A.2d 1143 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Burge, </em>195 Conn. 232, 252, 487 A.2d 532 (1985); <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 555, 440 A.2d 210 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>184 Conn. 400, 405, 439 A.2d 1040 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gold, </em>[supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>645-46]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>173 Conn. 344, 347-48, 377 A.2d 1095 (1977). \u2018 \u201cOrdinarily, evidence concerning a third party\u2019s involvement is not admissible until there is some evidence which <em>directly connects </em>that third party with the crime.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinsey, </em>[supra, 348]. \u201cThe defendant can always show that some other person and not the defendant committed the crime; however, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to refuse to admit such evidence when it simply affords a possible ground of possible suspicion against another person.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Giguere, </em>supra, 405; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 670, 557 A.2d 93 (1989).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258,270, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866,110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989). The trial court\u2019s ruling on the relevancy of third party inculpatory evidence will be reversed on appeal only if the court has abused its discretion or an injustice appears to have been done. Id., 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The trial court found that there was no reliable evidence directly linking Donald Payne to this crime and, therefore, the proffered evidence of Donald Payne\u2019s commission of a similar crime was inadmissible. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Further, because of this lack of a direct link to this crime, the trial court ruled that the defendant could not call Donald Payne as a witness to answer non-privileged questions in order to permit the jury to observe the physical similarities between him and the defendant. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>supra, 687, we reiterated that the defendant may not call a third party who the defendant maintains committed the crime simply to have him invoke his fifth amendment privilege in front of the jury. The defendant may, however, call the third party to testify as to those questions that he had willingly answered at the voir dire, so long as that testimony is relevant. Id. At the voir dire, Donald Payne testified that in November and December, 1988, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>lived one street over from his brother, the defendant; that he saw a lot of his brother during that time; that he lived with Claudia Payne at this time; that he knew of his brother\u2019s arrests and incarceration at the Whalley Avenue jail; that he did not visit his brother at that jail; that his brother was living with Gary during this time; and that he knew Russell Brantley, the person whom Gary claimed to have committed this crime with Donald Payne. None of Donald Payne\u2019s testimony directly linked him to this crime. As such, the trial court\u2019s decision to prohibit Donald Payne\u2019s testimony as irrelevant was not an abuse of discretion. Without a direct link to the crime charged, the parading of lookalikes in front of the jury would \u201csimply afford a possible ground of possible suspicion against another person\u201d and would be improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>supra, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In this opinion Peters, C.

A further indication of the level of her attention is that, in giving her initial description to the police, she used her two children and their differences in size and build as a reference, and noted that the two men in her bedroom were similar to her two children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\"> Mrs. Brownlow\u2019s professed certainty is supported by the facts that she identified the defendant immediately, as soon as she saw him enter the courtroom, and that the defendant had distinctive features (eyes, hairline and cheekbones) that she recognized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b130-8\"> Outside the presence of the jury, it was disclosed that the defendant sent to Mrs. Brownlow a letter dated February 21,1990, accompanied by two color Polaroid photographs of him.

After balancing the reliability of Mrs. Brownlow\u2019s identification, which the court found \u201cextremely reliable\u201d based on the relevant factors, against the manner in which this situation was created, the court sustained the state\u2019s objection. The court held: \u201cI think it\u2019s fundamental that the Court cannot allow a witness to be placed in an impeachable situation by [the defendant\u2019s] own actions post arrest and incarceration . . . . [B]ased on the other factors that have been brought up, which I have indicated strengthen the reliability of the identification, I see very little relevance at all to these photos . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> Out of the presence of the jury, the court questioned Mrs. Brownlow, whose veracity was not impeached, about whether she had based her identification of the defendant on those photographs. Mrs. Brownlow replied, \u201cIt has nothing to do with that picture. In fact, I thought the picture was a trick because the color photograph makes him so much lighter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\"> During the offer of proof, Gary testified that as of December, 1988, she had been living with the defendant for over one year and was in love with him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b135-10\"> In particular, the defendant testified that Donald Payne did not admit that he committed this burglary and that the ring Donald offered to sell to Gary was one he had purchased for his fiancee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b136-10\"> The defendant did testify before the jury that he was home on the night of this burglary; that he was visited by his brother Donald and Donald\u2019s friend late that night; that Donald and his friend returned early the next morning; and that Donald then had in his possession a gold ring with a clear stone in it. This testimony was admitted for the purpose of establishing an alibi.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b138-8\">Covello, J., with whom Hull, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AF3\">joins, dissenting. I do not believe that the defendant has shown that it is more probable than not that the introduction of the \u201csubsequent crimes\u201d testimony influenced the trial\u2019s outcome. I would therefore not order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u201c When a trial error in a criminal case does not involve a constitutional violation the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate the harmfulness of the court\u2019s error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>181 Conn. 187, 196-97, 435 A.2d 3 (1980). The defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>171 Conn. 293, 300, 370 A.2d 928 (1976).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>205 Conn. 723, 732, 535 A.2d 808 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>Vilalastra, </em>207 Conn. 35, 47, 540 A.2d 42 (1988). Thus, in the context of this case, with the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s identity, the defendant must demonstrate, therefore, that the introduction of the \u201csubsequent crimes\u201d testimony, despite the court\u2019s careful limiting instruction, improperly influenced the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The majority overlooks the cumulative effect of: (1) the terrifyingly specific circumstances under which Mrs. Brownlow had an opportunity to form a specific and lasting impression of the defendant; (2) the positive and certain manner in which she thereafter recalled him; (3) the defendant\u2019s own reaction when he again observed Mrs. Brownlow; and (4) the trial court\u2019s very specific limiting instructions concerning the \u201csubsequent crimes\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The jury learned that as the Brownlows lay asleep, at approximately 6 a.m., they were awakened when their bedroom door burst open, <em>the lights were turned on </em>and two black men with guns entered the room. <em>The lights in the bedroom were very bright. </em>The first man who entered proceeded to James Brownlow\u2019s side of the bed and held a handgun to his head. The second man, identified as the defendant, followed the first man into the room and pointed his handgun at Mrs. Brown-low\u2019s head. The man identified as the defendant, wore a fiberglass painter\u2019s mask that covered the lower part of his nose and mouth. While pointing his weapon at Mrs. Brownlow, the defendant rifled through the dresser drawers on her side of the bed. When the defendant\u2019s partner became agitated at the apparent lack of valuable goods, Mrs. Brownlow sat up, took off her engagement ring, and gave it to the defendant. When she gave her ring to him, she got a very good look at his face. She then laid on her side and continued to watch the defendant who was, for the most part, <em>no more than two or three feet from her throughout the entire fifteen minutes the incident lasted.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Although initially uncertain of her ability to identify either burglar, Mrs. Brownlow described the defendant as <em>\u201ca </em>dark-complexioned black male with short hair, approximately 5\u201910\u201d or 11\u201d tall, with a muscular build. He was wearing a sweatshirt under a medium length dark gray or black coat. She later stated that the defendant\u2019s facial features (his prominent widow\u2019s peak and his swollen eyes), were very distinctive and told the jury that she was \u201cextremely certain\u201d as to his identification. When asked to identify the defendant in a lineup of others, Mrs. Brownlow was \u201cvery certain\u201d as to her identification and made it while the defendant was being brought into the courtroom with the other prisoners. It was at this time that the defendant appeared to tell someone nearby, \u201cShe saw me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Further, in connection with the other crimes evidence, the trial court specifically charged the jury: \u201c[I]f you do not believe [the evidence offered of a separate crime] or even if you do, if you find that it does not logically, rationally, and conclusively support the issues or the element for which it is being offered by the State, namely identity, then you may not consider that testimony for any purpose. The danger of receiving evidence of prior misconduct, even for the limited purpose of attempting to prove identity, is that it may predispose your mind uncritically to believe the defendant may be guilty of the offense here charged merely because of the alleged prior misconduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u201cThe jury is presumed, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, to have followed the instructions of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>199 Conn. 389, 396, 507 A.2d 1001 (1986). If the evidence of the separate crime was not \u201c \u2018sufficiently distinctive to support a reasonable belief that the same person committed both\u2019[;] <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>[187 Conn. 348, 354, 446 A.2d 382 (1982)]\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 681, 469 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>A.2d 760 (1983); it must be presumed that the jury followed the trial court\u2019s instructions and concluded that the evidence did not \u201clogically, rationally and conclusively\u201d support the issue of identification and therefore, could \u201cnot Poe] considered] ... for any purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
