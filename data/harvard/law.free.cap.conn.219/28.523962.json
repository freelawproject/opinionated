We conclude that an employee is entitled to receive a dependency allowance for the child under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The parties have stipulated to the relevant facts. The plaintiff, Larry D. Crook, was employed by the named defendant, Academy Drywall Company,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when he suffered a compensable injury to his lower back on January 8, 1987. The plaintiff had two children at the time of his injury and a third child was bom to the plaintiff and his spouse on April 15, 1987, approximately three months after the date of his injury. Under General Statutes \u00a7 31-307,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the plaintiff is entitled to receive a weekly base compensation rate of $367.30 for his total incapacity. It is undisputed that the plaintiff is entitled under \u00a7 31-308b to receive a dependency allowance of $10 per week per child for the two children born prior to the date of his injury. In addition, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) for the fourth district concluded that as of April 15, 1987, the date of birth of the third child, the plaintiff was eligible to receive a dependency allowance for that child as well. On appeal, the compensation review division (CRD) affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. The defendants appealed the decision of the CRD to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the matter to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We now affirm the judgment of the CRD.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Section 31-308b provides that \u201c[e]ach employee entitled to receive compensation for total incapacity under the provisions of section 31-307, shall be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number><em>... a </em>dependency allowance . .. . for each of such employee\u2019s children or stepchildren who ... at the time of injury for which such compensation is being paid, were being wholly or mainly supported by such employee and who, as of the date of compensation payment for such week, are under eighteen years of age . . . .\u201d The statutory language establishes that the critical date in the determination of an employer\u2019s liability for the dependency allowance is the date of the employee\u2019s injury. The dispositive issue in this case, therefore, is whether the plaintiff\u2019s third child, who was conceived prior to the date of his compensable injury but was born after that date, was a child being \u201cwholly or mainly supported\u201d by the plaintiff at the time of the injury. The defendants argue that under the plain language of the statute the plaintiff is not entitled to a dependency allowance for his third child because a child en ventre sa mere<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is wholly or mainly supported by its mother, not the father, who is the covered employee in this case. The defendants further assert that even if the child\u2019s mother was being supported wholly or mainly by the plaintiff at the time of the injury, the plaintiff is still not entitled to the allowance because \u00a7 31-308b does not provide for a dependency allowance for a spouse and therefore the plaintiff cannot assert that by supporting his wife during her pregnancy he was also supporting his child.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>It is well established that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is remedial in nature and \u201c \u2018that it should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose. . . .\u2019 <em>\u201d Ash v. New Milford, </em>207 Conn. 665, 672, 541 A.2d 1233 (1988); <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden Division, </em>177 Conn. 107, 117, 411 A.2d 924 (1979); <em>DeCarli </em>v. <em>Manchester Public Warehouse Co., </em>107 Conn. 359, 364, 140 A. 637 (1928). Construing the statute liberally advances its underlying purpose of providing financial protection for injured workers and their dependents. <em>English </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>175 Conn. 392, 397-98, 399 A.2d 1266 (1978); <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Hotel Bond, Co., </em>89 Conn. 143, 146, 93 A. 245 (1915).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The defendants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 31-308b ignores that canon of statutory construction. Although a rigid construction of the statute might lead to a conclusion that a child en ventre sa mere is wholly supported by his mother, such an interpretation would hardly seem to further the legislature\u2019s goal of providing financial protection for injured workers and their dependents. A review of the legislative history does not provide any evidence that the legislature intended to exclude from coverage children conceived prior to the date of an injury but born after that date and supported by the injured worker. See 12 S. Proc., Pt. 5,1967 Sess., pp. 2254-61; 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 7,1967 Sess., pp. 3054-64, 3259-64, and Pt. 9, 1967 Sess., pp. 4032-51; Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor, 1967 Sess., p. 248. It therefore appears likely that the legislature never considered the situation at hand. We conclude, however, that such an oversight does not mandate that we deny the plaintiff a dependency allowance for his third child.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In <em>Routh </em>v. <em>List &amp; Weatherly Construction Co., </em>124 Kan. 222, 223-25, 257 P. 721 (1927)-, the Supreme Court of Kansas addressed a similar issue. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>tiff in that case was a child of a worker who was injured after the date the child was conceived but born after the date of the worker\u2019s injury. Id., 223. The worker died as a result of his injury shortly after the child\u2019s birth, and the child\u2019s mother brought an action on the child\u2019s behalf seeking to recover death benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation act. Id. Although the statute did not specifically provide for benefits for children born after a compensable injury, the court held that the child qualified for dependency benefits under provisions that defined dependents as \u201c \u2018members of the workman\u2019s family as were wholly or in part dependent upon the workman at the time of the accident.\u2019 \u201d Id., 224. In reaching its conclusion, the court did not find it necessary to determine whether the worker was in fact supporting the child. Id., 224-25. Rather, the court reasoned that \u201c \u2018[flor certain purposes, indeed for all beneficial purposes, a child <em>en ventre sa mere </em>is to be considered as born. . . . It is regarded as <em>in esse </em>for all purposes beneficial to itself, but not to another. . . .\u2019\u201d Id., 224. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[a] child <em>en ventre sa mere </em>at the time of the father\u2019s death is deemed to have been born so far as it is for the benefit of such child, and will be entitled to claim compensation as a legal dependent . . . and the posthumous child of a deceased workman would have the same rights to compensation as other children.\u2019 \u201d Id., 224-25, quoting S. Harper, Workmen\u2019s Compensation (2d Ed.) p. 261; see also <em>S.L.W. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, </em>490 P.2d 42, 46 (Alaska 1971); <em>Ide </em>v. <em>Scott Drilling, Inc., </em>341 Mich. 164, 166-68, 67 N.W.2d 133 (1954); <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Division </em>v. <em>Halstead, </em>795 P.2d 760, 766-67 (Wyo. 1990); see generally 2A A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law \u00a7 62.22 (d), pp. 11-45-11-49; annot., 18 A.L.R.3d 900.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">When the legislature adopted the \u201cwholly or mainly supported\u201d test for determining a worker\u2019s entitlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>to a dependency allowance for children, it did not address the question of whether a child en ventre sa mere is supported by the worker, albeit indirectly, at the time of the injury. Because the test set forth in \u00a7 31-308b does not appear to have been formulated in contemplation of the circumstances in the present case, we should not apply the \u201cwholly or mainly supported\u201d test in a mechanical fashion. Rather, in light of our mandate to construe the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act liberally and in light of the fact that the worker has a statutory duty to support a child if it is subsequently born alive; General Statutes \u00a7 46b-215 (a); we shall presume that a child conceived prior to a worker\u2019s injury is being wholly or mainly supported by the worker at the time of the injury for the purposes of determining the worker\u2019s eligibility for a dependency allowance. See 2A A. Larson, supra, p. 11-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Because we agree with the commissioner\u2019s decision that a worker can receive a dependency allowance only for the period subsequent to the child\u2019s birth, we note as a practical matter that the determination of eligibility for the dependency allowance for a child en ventre sa mere at the time of the worker\u2019s injury cannot be made until after the child has been born. At that point it can readily be determined whether the child is in fact being \u201cwholly or mainly supported\u201d by the worker. If the worker is not providing such support for the child after birth, the employer can invoke General Statutes \u00a7 31-315<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to argue that the worker is not entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>receive the dependency allowance. Therefore, the presumption that a child en ventre sa mere is a dependent will have no practical effect if the child is not supported wholly or mainly by the injured worker after the child\u2019s birth.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We also note that because our Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not address directly the dependency status of children born after a worker\u2019s compensable injury or after a worker\u2019s death, the legislature may wish to clarify the statutes in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b48-12\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 31-308b. dependency allowance.

Dependency allowances shall be in addition to the compensation benefits otherwise payable, shall not be considered part of an employee\u2019s total compensation benefit and shall not be counted in determining whether compensation exceeds the maximum weekly benefit rate set forth in section 31-309. If both a husband and a wife are receiving compensation benefits for the same week, only one of them shall be entitled to a dependency allowance with respect to any child or stepchild. No dependency allowance shall be payable with respect to any week unless a compensation benefit is also payable with respect to such week, but any such dependency allowance which would be payable on a weekly basis may be included in a monthly, quarterly or lump sum award by the commissioner payable under the provisions of section 31-302. No dependency allowance shall be paid to any employee entitled to receive permanent partial disability benefits, disfigurement benefits or temporary partial disability benefits or to any beneficiary entitled to receive death benefits payable under section 31-306. Dependency allowances shall be payable to an injured employee working for more than one employer whose average weekly wages are calculated upon the basis of wages earned from all such employers during the period involved under section 31-310 by the employer in whose employ he was engaged at the time of his injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-7\"> The other defendant is Nationwide Insurance Company, which provides workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the named defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b50-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-307 provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf any injury for which compensation is provided under the provisions of this chapter results in total incapacity to work, there shall be paid to the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of his average weekly earnings at the time of the injury . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b51-5\"> \u201cEn ventre sa mere\u201d is defined as \u201cin \u00fatero and therefore for beneficial purposes legally bom.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b51-6\"> The record does not indicate whether the plaintiff did in fact \u201cwholly or mainly\u201d support his wife during the pregnancy.

The commissioner shall also have the same power to open and modify an award as any court of the state has to open and modify a judgment of such court.

We first note that this issue is not a factor in this case, where the child was bom approximately three months after the injury. It is also unlikely that the exact date of conception will be an issue in a significant number of cases. Finally, the defendants suggested that this court could distinguish the entitlement of a child en ventre sa mere to death benefits under General Statutes \u00a7 31-306 from entitlement to the dependency allowance under General Statutes \u00a7 31-308b. Although it must be emphasized that we express no opinion on the issue, were we to conclude that a child en ventre sa mere at the time a worker suffers a fatal injury is entitled to death benefits under \u00a7 31-306, the date of conception would be equally relevant in that case as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
