Parker, on September 22,1984. The incident in which the plaintiff was injured occurred on the property of the defendant at 110 Bishop Street, Waterbury.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">As a result of the shooting, the defendant was arrested and charged in an information with assault in the first degree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was subsequently tried by a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Waterbury. On March 14, 1985, the jury found the defendant guilty of assault in the first degree in violation of both General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (3), <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as charged in the second count of the information. After the verdict was returned, the jury was not polled to determine the particular subdivision of \u00a7 53a-59 of which the defendant had been found guilty. Consequently, the record indicates that the defendant was found guilty of assault in the first degree under both subdivisions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In order to have convicted the defendant of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), the jury was required to have found that the defendant <em>intended </em>to cause serious physical injury and to have caused such injury to the plaintiff by means of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument. In order to have convicted the defendant of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), the jury would have to have found that the defendant, under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, <em>recklessly </em>engaged in conduct that created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>a risk of death to another person and thereby caused serious physical injury to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">After the defendant was found guilty in the criminal action, the plaintiff brought a civil action for damages to compensate him for the serious injuries to his left arm. In the first count of his complaint, the plaintiff alleged that his injuries were caused by the defendant\u2019s negligent and careless discharge of the shotgun. In the second count, he alleged that his injuries were caused by the intentional or reckless discharge of the shotgun. In the third count, he alleged that his injuries were caused by the defendant\u2019s recklessness and carelessness in discharging the shotgun in a manner likely to cause bodily injury or death in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-203.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The civil action was not commenced until July 20, 1987, nearly two years and ten months after the plaintiff was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">In his answer, the defendant raised the special defense of the statute of limitations. Specifically, the defendant claimed that as to counts one and three of the complaint, which allege negligence, carelessness and recklessness, and as to that portion of count two which alleges recklessness, the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was barred because he had not initiated suit within two years as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-584.\u00ae After the pleadings were closed in the civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>action, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment on the second count of his complaint, which alleged that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs injuries were caused by the defendant Claude L. Parker, who intentionally or recklessly discharged a shotgun in the direction of the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In his motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff claimed that under the doctrine of collateral estoppel the defendant was precluded \u201cfrom raising or litigating the issue of whether he <em>intentionally </em>caused serious physical injury to the plaintiff by means of a deadly weapon because the defendant Piad been] convicted by a jury of Assault in the First Degree based on the same facts involved in this case and that finding is dispositive of this issue.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The trial court agreed with the plaintiff that the defendant was collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of whether the defendant had intentionally caused the plaintiffs injury and granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment. In a later memorandum of decision, issued in response to the defendant\u2019s motion to reargue, the court stated that, although the verdict of the jury in the defendant\u2019s criminal case was \u201cgeneral\u201d and convicted the defendant of both \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (3), it made no difference in the result because the second count of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleged that the defendant\u2019s actions were \u201c \u2018reckless or intentional\u2019 \u201d and the plaintiff need only prove that the defendant\u2019s actions were \u201cone or the other but not both.\u201d The trial court then confirmed its previous action in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>ond count of Ms complaint. Subsequently, the court held a hearing in damages and awarded the plaintiff the sum of $475,000 for his injuries. Thereafter, the parties stipulated to the withdrawal of counts one and three of the plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The defendant appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>22 Conn. App. 610, 579 A.2d 532 (1990). The Appellate Court determined that the record demonstrated that the defendant had, in fact, been convicted by the jury in Ms criminal trial of violating both \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (3). Id., 613. The Appellate Court concluded, however, that by choosing not to appeal his criminal conviction the defendant had \u201ceffectively accepted the judgment of conviction that had been rendered on the basis of both reckless and intentional assault.\u201d Id. The Appellate Court found irrelevant the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s claim based on the defendant\u2019s conviction for reckless conduct might be barred by \u00a7 52-584, because the defendant\u2019s claim based on intentional conduct was not so barred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id., 614. The Appellate Court then went on to decide that the defendant was estopped by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from relitigating in the civil action the \u201cprecise issue\u201d determined by a higher standard of proof in the prior criminal action. Id., 623. In its conclusion, the Appellate Court stated that \u201c \u2018[a] prior conviction estops a party in a later civil suit from contesting facts necessarily established in the criminal proceeding.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Compton </em>v. <em>Ide, </em>732 F.2d 1429, 1434 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal three issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>216 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>825, 582 A.2d 204 (1990). We find it necessary and judicious to address only one of those issues, namely, \u201c[wjhether the Appellate Court was correct in concluding that the issue of intentional assault was necessarily determined in the prior criminal action?\u201d We conclude that it was not correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">As previously noted, the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) required that the jury have found that the defendant acted with the <em>intent </em>to cause serious physical injury to the plaintiff. On the other hand, its verdict of guilty under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) necessitated a finding that the defendant <em>recklessly </em>engaged in conduct that caused serious physical injury to the plaintiff. The intent to cause serious physical injury required for a conviction of assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1), by definition, required a jury finding that the defendant acted with the \u201cconscious objective\u201d to cause serious physical injury. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (ll); <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>see State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 593, 583 A.2d 896 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>199 Conn. 1, 4, 505 A.2d 683 (1986). In order to find the defendant guilty of assault in the first degree under \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3), however, the jury was required to find that the defendant acted recklessly, that is, with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>out a conscious objective. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>supra. To return a verdict of guilty of assault in the first degree under both \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and (3), therefore, the jury in the defendant\u2019s criminal case would have to have found that the defendant simultaneously acted intentionally and recklessly with regard to the same act and the same result, namely, the firing of the shotgun and the consequent serious physical injury to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u201cAs is evident, however, the statutory definitions of \u2018intentionally\u2019 and \u2018recklessly\u2019 are mutually exclusive and inconsistent. \u2018Reckless conduct is not intentional conduct because one who acts recklessly does not have a conscious objective to cause a particular result.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Beccia, </em>supra, 4. Therefore, the transgression that caused the victim\u2019s injuries was either intentional or reckless; it could not, at one and the same time, be both. Id.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>132 Ill. 2d 399, 442, 548 N.E.2d 1003 (1989); <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>69 N.Y.2d 525, 529, 508 N.E.2d 909, 516 N.Y.S.2d 174 (1987); <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>145 App. Div. 2d 184, 186, 538 N.Y.S.2d 122 (1989), aff\u2019d, 75 N.Y.2d 879, 553 N.E.2d 1021, 554 N.Y.S.2d 473 (1990). Where a determination is made that one mental state exists, to be legally consistent the other must be found not to exist. <em>People </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>[112 Ill. 2d 396, 403-404, 493 N.E.2d 1030 (1986)]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>106 Ill. 2d 186, 195, 478 N.E.2d 335, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 847,106 S. Ct. 139, 88 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1985). \u2018By no rational theory could the jury have found the defendant guilty of both crimes.\u2019 <em>People </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>supra, 530; <em>People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Toole, </em>138 App. Div. 2d 639, 640, 526 N.Y.S.2d 223 (1988).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 593-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The problem that the jury\u2019s inconsistent verdict creates is that neither the trial court in the defendant\u2019s civil case, the Appellate Court, nor this court had or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>have any means of determining from the record which state of mind the jury found that the defendant possessed when he shot the plaintiff. See id., 594-95. Because the defendant could not simultaneously have had mutually exclusive states of mind, there remains a question of fact as to which state of mind he did have. Because that question of fact was not resolved in the criminal litigation, and the resolution of that question is crucial to the determination of the viability of the defendant\u2019s special defense, the doctrine of collateral estoppel should not have been invoked and the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment should not have been granted. Practice Book \u00a7 384; <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 488, 280 A.2d 359 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to vacate the damage award and to deny the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> The defendant was also charged with murder and assault in the second degree as a result of the same incident. Those charges, however, related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>to other victims.
