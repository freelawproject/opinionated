The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether an order requiring attorneys holding such proceeds to provide an accounting, so as to enable the state to enforce its \u00a7 17-83f (a) lien, is a final judgment from which the attorneys are entitled to take an immediate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The plaintiff, the state of Connecticut (state), brought this action seeking damages and injunctive relief from the defendants Norman Ebenstein and Ebenstein &amp; Ebenstein, P.C. (attorneys), alleging that each of fifty-two named welfare clients had been represented by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>attorneys in a claim for damages as a result of which each claimant had become entitled to a sum of money. In response to the attorneys\u2019 contention that the state had been properly reimbursed by payments previously made, the state sought injunctive relief compelling the attorneys to provide information relevant to the calculation of the amount due the state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment for this purpose. The attorneys<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appealed to the Appellate Court and we transferred the appeal here pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We now dismiss the appeal for lack of a final judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The contours of a final judgment are established by the two part test set out in <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). Under <em>Curdo, </em>an interlocutory order may be appealed immediately only if: (1) the order or action terminates a separate or distinct proceeding, or (2) the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. In our view, the present interlocutory order does not qualify for immediate appealability under either test.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The parties\u2019 argument in favor of appealability has focused on the first <em>Curdo </em>test. Both the state and the attorneys urge us to conclude that the injunctive order for an accounting in this case is a separate proceeding warranting independent appellate resolution. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The only authority for the state\u2019s claim for injunctive relief is \u00a7 17-83f (a), which gives the state a lien against the proceeds of causes of action of beneficiaries of state aid \u201cin the amount of the assistance paid or fifty per cent of the proceeds received\u201d after payment of specified expenses. At oral argument, the state acknowledged that this statute confers no right to an accounting except insofar as such an accounting is a requisite to enforcement of the state\u2019s statutory lien.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To enforce that lien, the complaint filed by the state sought money damages as well as injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Read in its entirety, this complaint belies the assertion that the only object of the state\u2019s lawsuit was to require disclosure of the information sought in the request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">An ancillary injunctive order requiring an accounting is no more a final judgment than is an ancillary order for the appointment of a receiver. We have consistently held that an order granting a request for a rent receivership in a foreclosure action is not a final judgment, even though such an order provides additional security for the foreclosing mortgagee and impairs the ownership rights of the mortgagor. <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>195 Conn. 218, 223, 487 A.2d 528, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 845, 106 S. Ct. 135, 88 L. Ed. 2d 111 (1985); <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>192 Conn. 1, 3-5, 469 A.2d 778 (1984); <em>Young </em>v. <em>Polish Loan &amp; Industrial Corporation, </em>126 Conn. 714, 715, 11 A.2d 395 (1940). A receivership in advance of a final resolution of the dispute between the parties is not an appealable order because \u201c[a]ll of the parties concerned in the . . . controversy will still be before the court when the ultimate determination of their rights in respect to the distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>button of the rents is made after the mortgaged premises are sold.\u201d <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra, 225. That rationale applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The attorneys urge, however, that the appropriate analogy is not a rent receivership but a bill of discovery. They point to several cases in which this court reached the merits of judgments rendered in actions for bills of discovery without apparent concern about their immediate appealability. See, e.g., <em>Pottetti </em>v. <em>Clifford, </em>146 Conn. 252, 150 A.2d 207 (1959); <em>Peyton </em>v. <em>Werhane, </em>126 Conn. 382, 11 A.2d 800 (1940). Those cases reflect, however, the special nature of bills of discovery. Before revision of the rules of practice made discovery generally available, an independent bill of discovery was the only procedural vehicle by which \u201ca party to an action at law could obtain the same discovery from an adversary that he could obtain had the action been in equity.\u201d 1 E. Stephenson, Connecticut Civil Procedure (2d Ed. 1970) \u00a7 136, p. 562. Such a bill of discovery, although in fact ancillary to another action, was procedurafly \u201can independent action [that had to] be initiated by a new writ and complaint, served on the person from whom discovery is sought in the same manner as for any in personam action.\u201d Id., \u00a7 143 (e), p. 602. Because the bill of discovery was an independent action, its merits could only be reviewed in an independent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The procedural constraints that surround a bill of discovery do not apply to the present injunctive order for an accounting. As in <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra, the parties in this case will \u201cstill be before the court\u201d upon a final determination of their respective rights to the proceeds of lawsuits brought on behalf of recipients of public assistance. Because the partial summary judgment rendered by the trial court is ancillary to the adjudication of the state\u2019s statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>lien pursuant to \u00a7 17-83f (a), the judgment has not terminated a proceeding so separate or distinct as to satisfy the first test of <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Our precedents equally establish that the injunctive order for an accounting does not satisfy the alternative <em>Curcio </em>test of an order or action that so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them. The attorneys\u2019 principal objection to enforcement of the trial court\u2019s order rests on their allegation that they have an ethical obligation to treat as confidential the information that they have gained in the course of representing their clients. While it is true that the confidentiality of information cannot be fully retrieved once disclosure has been ordered, we have repeatedly ruled against the immediate appealability of ancillary discovery orders that seek such information in civil cases. <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>202 Conn. 252, 255-58, 520 A.2d 605 (1987); <em>Barbato </em>v. <em>J. &amp; M. Corporation, </em>194 Conn. 245, 249-50, 478 A.2d 1020 (1984); see also <em>Chrysler Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 226, 429 A.2d 478 (1980). As we pointed out in <em>Melia, </em>the risk of impairment of the attorney-client privilege is not limited to pretrial disclosure orders but can as easily arise in \u201ca ruling on evidence during trial, which would have to await final judgment for appellate review unless trials were to be interrupted whenever such a ruling occurred.\u201d <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>supra, 257. Because appellate review after a final judgment can provide significant safeguards with respect to the use of privileged materials, we adhere to our holdings that invocation of a privilege does not demonstrate that the rights of the parties have been so concluded that further proceedings cannot affect them. Accordingly, we hold that the injunctive order for an accounting fails to satisfy the second <em>Curcio </em>test for immediate appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-14\"> General Statutes \u00a7 17-83f provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) In the case of causes of action of beneficiaries of aid under this chapter, subject to sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>sections (b) and (c) of section 17-83e, or of a parent of a beneficiary of the aid to families with dependent children program, the claim of the state shall be a lien against the proceeds therefrom in the amount of the assistance paid or fifty per cent of the proceeds received by such beneficiary or such parent after payment of all expenses connected with the cause of action, whichever is less, for repayment under section 17-83e, and shall have priority over all other claims except attorney\u2019s fees for said causes, expenses of suit, costs of hospitalization connected with the cause of action by whomever paid over and above hospital insurance or other such benefits, and, for such period of hospitalization as was not paid for by the state, physicians\u2019 fees for services during any such period as are connected with the cause of action over and above medical insurance or other such benefits; and such claim shall consist of the total assistance repayment for which claim may be made under the provisions of this chapter.
