Hennessy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ast\">The sole issue in this consolidated appeal is whether the plaintiffs have standing to appeal two decisions of the defendant department of public utility control (DPUC) granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity (certificate) to the defendant John Balkun III doing business as Jack\u2019s Rigging and Machinery Sales (Balkun).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, Light Rigging Company, J. R. Christoni, Inc., Walker Crane and Rigging Corporation, Northeast Riggers, Inc., and Paul J. Buccheri Company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (plaintiffs), who hold certificates similar to that granted to Balkun, appealed the DPUC\u2019s decisions to the Superior Court. The court, finding that the plaintiffs were not aggrieved, rendered judgments dismissing the appeals. From those judgments the plaintiffs appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The relevant facts are as follows. On January 31, 1986, Balkun filed an application with the DPUC seeking motor carrier authorization, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 16-283,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to transport small machinery and accessories, new and used, over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>irregular routes between all points in Connecticut. On August 22,1986, the DPUC granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition.for party status to protest Balkun\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">On August 28, 1986, and September 5, 1986, the DPUC held public hearings on Balkun\u2019s application, as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 16-284, <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at which time Balkun and the plaintiffs were heard. On December 10, 1986, the DPUC mailed its proposed decision to Balkun and the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs filed written exceptions to the proposed decision with the DPUC on December 22,1986. On January 6,1987, the DPUC issued its final decision granting Balkun\u2019s application and issuing him a certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Following the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal of the DPUC\u2019s January 6, 1987 decision to the Superior Court, but prior to a hearing on the appeal, the DPUC, on its own motion pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 16-9,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> reopened the docket on Balkun\u2019s application to allow the plaintiffs an opportunity to present written briefs and oral argument on the proposed decision of December, 1986. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>On October 13,1987, the plaintiffs appeared before the DPUC, under protest, to present oral argument. On November 3,1987, the DPUC again approved Balkun\u2019s application, and the plaintiffs filed a second appeal with the Superior Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 two appeals were consolidated by order of the court, <em>Allen, J., </em>on May 16, 1988. The DPUC filed motions to dismiss the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to plead and prove sufficient facts to support a finding of aggrievement, in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">Although the plaintiffs have briefed eight issues, the sole issue that we need to consider is whether the trial court properly dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Issues two through eight<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>merits of the DPUC\u2019s decision. The trial court, however, was bound to dismiss the case upon finding that it had no jurisdiction; <em>Kinney </em>v. <em>State, </em>213 Conn. 54, 58, 566 A.2d 670 (1989); and therefore never addressed the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. Thus issues two through eight are not properly before us. See <em>Hartford Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>181 Conn. 607, 608-609, 436 A.2d 1259 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Pleading and proof of aggrievement are prerequisites to a trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the subject matter of an administrative appeal. <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>193 Conn. 59, 65, 475 A.2d 283 (1984). \u201cIt is [therefore] fundamental that, in order to have standing to bring an administrative appeal, a person must be aggrieved.\u201d <em>Connecticut Business &amp; Industry Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>214 Conn. 726, 729, 573 A.2d 736 (1990); <em>Beckish </em>v. <em>Manafort, </em>175 Conn. 415, 419, 399 A.2d 1274 (1978). \u201c \u2018Standing (however] is not a technical rule intended to keep aggrieved parties out of court; nor is it a test of substantive rights. Rather it is a practical concept designed to ensure that courts and parties are not vexed by suits brought to vindicate nonjusticiable interests and that judicial decisions which may affect the rights of others are forged in hot controversy, with each view fairly and vigorously represented. See, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962); <em>Stern </em>v. <em>Stern, </em>165 Conn. 190, 192, 332 A.2d 78 (1973). . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>Board of Pardons </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 Conn. 646, 648-49, 556 A.2d 1020 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Neither the DPUC nor the plaintiffs deny that aggrievement is a prerequisite for appeal, nor do they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>quarrel with the test for aggrievement as set out in our decision in <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>203 Conn. 295, 524 A.2d 636 (1987). In that case, we stated that \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he fundamental test for determining aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, \u2018the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that the specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u2019 . . .\u201d \u2019 <em>Cannavo Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>194 Conn. 43, 47, 478 A.2d 601 (1984); <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>[supra, 65].\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 299-300. We also stated that \u201c \u2018[a]ggrievement is established if \u201cthere is a possibility, as distinguished from a certainty, that some legally protected interest . . . has been adversely affected.\u201d <em>O\u2019Leary </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>140 Conn. 80, 83, 98 A.2d 660 (1953).\u2019 <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>181 Conn. 442, 445, 435 A.2d 975 (1980).\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The trial court concluded, and we agree, that the plaintiffs satisfied the first prong of the aggrievement test. The plaintiffs demonstrated their specific personal and legal interest in the subject of the DPUC\u2019s decision by alleging and providing evidence that their DPUC certificates, for the intrastate operations that they own, authorize them to provide services similar to those that Balkun\u2019s contested certificate would authorize Balkun to provide. Neither the DPUC nor the plaintiffs challenge this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The plaintiffs contend, however, and we agree, that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>had failed to satisfy the second prong of the test\u2014to show that their specific personal and legal interests had been specially and injuriously affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The plaintiffs have alleged in both appeal petitions that they are aggrieved by the decision of the DPUC to grant Balkun\u2019s certificate without any showing of a public need for the service Balkun proposes to render beyond a small circumscribed need in the greater New Britain area. In affidavits attached to their memoranda of law in opposition to the DPUC\u2019s motions to dismiss, the plaintiffs have asserted that their motor carrier certificates are transferable, saleable and traded in commerce as assets of economic value, and that the existence of additional certificates causes a dilution and diminution in the value of each of their certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In finding that the plaintiffs\u2019 legal interest in their certificates had not been specially and injuriously affected by the DPUC\u2019s grant of a certificate to Balkun, the trial court relied upon the principle that absent an allegation of unfair or illegal competition, \u201can allegation merely of competition likely to result in lost revenues is ordinarily insufficient to confer standing.\u201d <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, 302. The court concluded that because the plaintiffs had not alleged or provided evidence that competition caused by the grant of authority to Balkun was unfair or illegal, they had done no more than to allege normal business competition. The court distinguished between the value of the license to operate and the value of the plaintiffs\u2019 business operations and concluded that the plaintiffs had failed to establish that the grant of a certificate to Balkun in any way adversely affected the value of their legally protected interests in their certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>supra, the principle relied upon by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>court was applied to determine whether a physician\u2019s allegations of lost revenues from competition satisfied the second prong of the aggrievement test.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The physician in that case was licensed in Connecticut on his satisfaction of state requirements that do not include consideration of either the effect of his licensing upon other physicians or the need for his services.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Unlike the statutory requirements for a physician\u2019s license, General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 16-286<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> requires the DPUC to consider \u201cthe existing motor transportation facilities and the effect upon them of granting such certif\u00edcate, [and] the public need for the service the applicant proposes to render\u201d when determining whether to grant a certificate of public convenience and necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The plaintiffs seek a judicial review of the DPUC\u2019s determination that a need for Balkun\u2019s certificate exists. If we conclude, as the trial court did, that the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of business competition and diminution in the value of their certificates are insufficient to show aggrievement, the plaintiffs are foreclosed from a judicial review of the agency\u2019s findings as to the need for another certificate holder. We find this position untenable since the possibility exists that the alleged loss of business and diminution in value of the plaintiffs\u2019 certificates would result from competition for which no need exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The plaintiffs hold certificates that enable them to operate in a regulated industry. Those certificates, like the business operations that they authorize, have an economic value that is affected by competition in the motor common carrier industry. The plaintiffs\u2019 certificates to operate do not entitle them to be free of competition. Because \u00a7 16-286 expressly requires the DPUC to consider public need for the services to be rendered by an applicant before granting a certificate, however, existing certificate holders are entitled to be free of competition for which no need has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The question of whether the DPUC correctly concluded that public need existed for Balkun\u2019s proposed service involves the merits of those decisions and is an issue on which we express no opinion, for \u201c[standing is an examination of the parties, not the merits of the action.\u201d <em>Manchester Environmental Coalition </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>184 Conn. 51, 64, 441 A.2d 68 (1981). Because a possibility exists, however, that the alleged competition and the resulting diminution in value of the plaintiffs\u2019 certificates arise from the grant of a certificate for which no public need exists, we conclude that, under this particular statutory administrative scheme, such allegations were sufficient to establish that there is a possibility that the plaintiffs\u2019 specific personal and legal interests in their certificates have been specially and injuriously affected by the DPUC\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">We further note that the plaintiffs were made parties to the agency proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 16-1-17 (c) of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>when it was found that their legal rights, duties or privileges were substantially and specifically affected by the proceedings. Thus at the administrative level, there was a finding that the plaintiffs legal rights, duties or privileges would be affected by the agency\u2019s decision regarding the issuance of a certificate to Balkun.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">While the plaintiffs\u2019 status as parties at the agency level does not constitute aggrievement; <em>Bakelaar </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>supra, 66; the trial court should have closely reviewed this administrative finding because many of the elements considered by the agency in granting this status closely track the elements that the court would have to find to determine whether a party is aggrieved. We conclude that given the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and supporting affidavits, these plaintiffs have proved their aggrievement and are entitled to have the opportunity to challenge the merits of the DPUC\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\"> The DPUC acted pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) c. 285, \u00a7\u00a7 16-281 through 16-308.
