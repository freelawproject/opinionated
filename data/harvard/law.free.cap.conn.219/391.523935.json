We hold that in an action to compel arbitration of an uninsured motorist insurance claim the court should order arbitration of this issue as well as all other issues that may reasonably be characterized as issues of coverage. Because the trial court in this case sought to resolve in the first instance a legal issue pertaining to a claim for uninsured<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motorist coverage, instead of granting the claimant\u2019s request for arbitration, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">The plaintiff, William Gaudet, filed a complaint against the defendant, Safeco Insurance Company (Safeco), seeking an order compelling Safeco to arbitrate Gaudet\u2019s claim for uninsured motorist coverage. The complaint alleged that on September 25, 1987, when the accident that caused Gaudet\u2019s injuries occurred, Gaudet had been a passenger in an automobile owned by Stephen A. Chilinsky and insured by Safeco. The automobile allegedly had been operated by James Robinson, who was uninsured.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Safeco answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>by a general denial and raised one special defense: \u201cThe plaintiff is precluded from recovering pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 38-331.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Gaudet moved to strike this defense. In opposing the motion, Safeco claimed that Gaudet and Robinson had stolen the Chilinsky vehicle, that \u00a7 38-331 barred Gaudet from recovering uninsured motorist\u2019s benefits under Chilinsky\u2019s policy, and that, because the statute barred Gaudet from recovering under the policy, the statute also prevented him from compelling arbitration of his coverage claim. In response, Gaudet asserted that he was a friend of Chilinsky\u2019s daughter, Magdalena, and had believed he had her implied permission to use the vehicle, that in any event, \u00a7 38-331 did not apply to claims for uninsured motorist coverage, and that even if it did apply to such claims, the issue presented a mixed question of fact and law to be decided, in the first instance, by an arbitrator. The trial court, <em>Kulawiz, J., </em>agreed with Safeco, and,denied Gaudet\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">During the ensuing three day trial, the court, <em>Meadow, J., </em>heard nine witnesses and entered twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>one items into evidence. The trial generated 551 pages of transcript. The transcript indicates that neither side presented opening or closing arguments, instead filing pretrial and posttrial briefs. The only issue at trial was whether Gaudet had \u201cconverted\u201d the vehicle within the meaning of \u00a7 38-331; the only other issues briefed were those previously raised by Gaudet.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court held that, once Safeco had raised a defense based on \u00a7 38-331, Gaudet, as part of his responsibility to prove he was entitled to uninsured motorist insurance benefits, was also required to prove \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, no conversion or a good faith belief by the applicant that he had permission to use the vehicle under the coverages provided\u201d and that Gaudet \u201chas not met this burden.\u201d The court found that the vehicle had been converted under \u00a7 38-331, but that \u201c[t]he evidence did not demonstrate who was the converter, only that the conversion took place and that Gaudet participated in the unlawful activity.\u201d The court concluded that because \u201cGaudet participated in an unlawful activity,\u201d \u201cpublic policy prevents recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 38-175c<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requires binding arbitration for \u201cfinal determination of insurance coverage\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>with respect to uninsured motorist claims if the insurance policy includes a provision for binding arbitration. The history of this provision is well documented in our case law. See, e.g., <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 657, 591 A.2d 101 (1991); <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>181 Conn. 37, 41, 434 A.2d 304 (1980). Suffice it to say that this provision requires arbitration, in the first instance, of all issues pertaining to coverage. <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 658; <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Safeco insists that its special defense did not involve an \u201cissue of coverage\u201d because it was based not on the policy, but on the statutes. We have previously rejected such a distinction. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Security Ins. Group, </em>199 Conn. 618, 624, 509 A.2d 467 (1986); see also <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>203 Conn. 258, 265, 524 A.2d 616 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Safeco also contends that our holding in <em>Oliva </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, that all issues of coverage must be decided by the arbitrator in the first instance, does not extend to claims made by \u201cstrangers to the contract.\u201d Safeco points out that General Statutes \u00a7 52-410 (a)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> permits only a \u201cparty\u201d to a written contract providing for binding arbitration to bring an action to compel the other party to arbitrate his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Technically, the only \u201cparties\u201d to the contract are the insurance company and the purchaser, or, perhaps, the named insureds. In <em>Paranko </em>v. <em>State, </em>200 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>51, 54, 509 A.2d 508 (1986), we observed, however, that while \u00a7 52-410 \u201climits the availability of the remedy to \u2018parties\u2019 . . . the word is not defined.\u201d We concluded that \u201c[t]he term is used generically\u201d so that its \u201cmeaning must therefore be derived from the agreement itself.\u201d Id.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">Where certain terms of a contract have been, in effect, legislatively dictated, it is appropriate to consider legislative intent in interpreting those terms. Here, the clear legislative purpose favoring arbitration of all uninsured motorist coverage issues would be defeated if it were available only to named insureds. In enacting \u00a7 38-175c, the legislature thus implicitly assumed that the word \u201cparty\u201d in \u00a7 52-410 would encompass all persons to whom the uninsured motorist statute gave enforcement powers. In the context of uninsured motorist coverage, therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 52-410 does not exclude enforcement of its terms by third party beneficiaries. We construe the word \u201cparty\u201d within \u00a7 52-410 to refer to anyone on whom the agreement confers enforcement rights.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Section 52-410 aside, however, Safeco contends that <em>Oliva </em>does not require arbitration of coverage issues until a claimant first has proved his status as an \u201cinsured,\u201d at least to the extent of proving that he was not statutorily precluded from being an \u201cinsured,\u201d as a condition precedent to asserting a contractual right to enforce the policy\u2019s arbitration clause. Safeco points to language contained in \u00a7 38-175c (a) (1), which mandates arbitration of uninsured motorist claims by those \u201clegally entitled\u201d to uninsured motorist insurance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">This is putting the cart before the horse. Were every third party claimant seeking uninsured motorist coverage required to prove first that he ultimately would be entitled to receive the coverage sought in order to compel arbitration of his claim, he would have little left to arbitrate. Such a circular approach to \u00a7 38-175c frustrates the legislative intent to vest primary jurisdiction of coverage issues in the arbitrator in order \u201cto avoid the institutional difficulty perceived by the court in <em>Frager </em>[v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>155 Conn. 270, 231 A.2d 531 (1967)], namely, clogging the courts with piecemeal litigation, and leveling the procedural playing field by guarding against the possibility of insurers unfairly using their superior economic resources to delay the final resolution of claims by their insureds.\u201d <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>supra, 658. In this case the trial court needlessly consumed three days of court time in order to determine whether Gaudet had converted the Chilinsky vehicle, an issue equally pertinent to the policy exclusion from coverage for an otherwise \u201ccovered person\u201d who uses the vehicle without a reasonable belief that he is entitled to do so. The trial court sought to resolve this issue so that the insurer would be spared \u201ccostly protracted arbitration\u201d of a claim doomed to failure by a relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>statute. The legislature, however, intended arbitration to prevent more costly and protracted litigation in the courts, not the other way around.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">By characterizing the conversion issue as an issue of arbitrability, moreover, the court effectively preempted arbitration of the merits of Gaudet\u2019s claim, whatever its disposition of that issue. Had the trial court found the issue in Gaudet\u2019s favor, collateral estoppel might have foreclosed the arbitrator from considering the insurer\u2019s claim that Gaudet was excluded from coverage because he had used the vehicle without a reasonable belief that he was entitled to do so. Contrary to the intention of the legislature, the trial court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 38-175c inevitably requires the court, rather than an arbitrator, first to hear the merits of an uninsured motorist insurance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">We adhere to the established rule that \u201carbitrability .. . is ordinarily a legal question for the courts.\u201d <em>Beloff v. Progressive Casualty Ins. Co., </em>203 Conn. 45, 54, 523 A.2d 477 (1987); see also <em>Welch Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Creative Drywall, Inc., </em>215 Conn. 464, 467, 576 A.2d 153 (1990). Arbitrability includes the issue of who is entitled to arbitrate a claim. See, e.g., <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 546-47, 84 S. Ct. 909, 11 L. Ed. 2d 898 (1964). Where an issue may fairly be characterized as either (1) an issue of arbitrability, i.e., a question for the courts to decide in the first instance, or (2) an issue of insurance coverage, i.e., a question for an arbitrator to decide in the first instance, legislative policy requires the court to elect the latter characterization and submit the issue to the arbitrator together with all other issues of insurance coverage. In this case, \u201cit was the trial court\u2019s obligation to decide first whether the issue was arbitrable, that is, whether the claim <em>involved </em>a coverage dispute. Only if the court answered no to this question should the court have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>reached the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Security Ins. Co. of Hartford </em>v. <em>DeLaurentis, 202 </em>Conn. 178, 187-88, 520 A.2d 202 (1987).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">In order to compel arbitration under \u00a7 52-410, therefore, one claiming uninsured motorist coverage need prove to the court only that (1) the policy was in effect at the time of the accident, (2) the policy provides for arbitration, (3) the claimant was in the class of \u201ccovered persons,\u201d e.g., as provided in the Chilinsky policy, an owner, occupant or driver of the insured vehicle, for whom the policy provided uninsured motorists\u2019 coverage, and (4) the insurer has refused to pay the claim for uninsured motorist benefits arising out of the claimed accident. The claimant must also state the nature of the claim to be arbitrated, which would ordinarily include allegations that his injuries were caused in a manner that, under the terms of the policy and applicable statutes, entitle him to uninsured motorist benefits, and that there is no other coverage adequate to satisfy his claim. Gaudet met these requirements and was entitled to arbitrate his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Judicial economy would scarcely be served, however, if we remanded the case for arbitration without reviewing the trial court\u2019s conclusion that, as a matter of law, \u00a7 38-331 (now \u00a7 38a-375) bars recovery of uninsured motorist benefits under an automobile owner\u2019s policy by the converter of a vehicle. We ordinarily address legal issues likely to arise following a remand for further proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Building Wrecking Co. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>218 Conn. 580, 605-606, 590 A.2d 447 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>The language of \u00a7 38-331 is plain. It begins: \u201cA person who converts a private passenger motor vehicle is disqualified from <em>basic or added reparations benefits as provided in this chapter, </em>including benefits otherwise due him as a survivor, from any source other than an insurance policy under which the converter is a basic or added reparations insured . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The \u201cchapter\u201d referred to is chapter 690 of the General Statutes, entitled \u201cNo-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance.\u201d Section 38-331 does not purport to limit benefits available under any other chapter, such as chapter 681 of the General Statutes, the chapter containing \u00a7 38-175c, entitled \u201cUninsured Motorist Coverage.\u201d It plainly limits only \u201cbasic or added reparations benefits,\u201d that is, \u201cno-fault\u201d benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Safeco maintains, however, that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 38-326<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 38-327,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which require motorists to maintain \u201cresidual liability insurance,\u201d incorporate uninsured motorist coverage required by \u00a7 38-175c into chapter 690 and indicate a legislative intent to include uninsured motorist coverage within the \u201cbenefits\u201d which \u00a7 38-331 disqualifies a converter from receiving. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The general references in \u00a7\u00a7 38-326 and 38-327 to other insurance coverage cannot be given the effect of altering the plain language of \u00a7 38-331. The phrase of \u00a7 38-331 upon which Safeco relies, moreover, \u201cincluding benefits otherwise due him as a survivor, from any source other than an insurance policy under which the converter is a basic or added reparations insured,\u201d only modifies the term \u201cbasic or added reparations benefits\u201d; it does not set out an additional category of benefits from which a converter is to be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Safeco reminds us that we have held that chapter 690 supplements our other statutes governing motor vehicle operation and insurance; see <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 299-304, 363 A.2d 1, appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1975). If we read these statutes to form a unified body of law, Safeco asks, \u201ccan there be any serious doubt that the legislature intended to prohibit someone who participates in the conversion of a vehicle from benefiting by that act?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">\u201cTo determine the collectively expressed legislative intent, we look first to the language of the statute itself. If that language is plain and unambiguous, we go no further.\u201d <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). Simply because the statutory language fails to address a claimed inequity does not make that language ambiguous. \u201cThis court cannot . . . by a tortured construction of the statutory and regulatory provisions, indirectly eliminate possible inequities in coverage, where the legislature has failed to do so directly.\u201d <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Centennial Ins. Co., </em>171 Conn. 463, 476, 370 A.2d 1011 (1976).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">In its preliminary counterstatement of issues, Safeco included the following question: \u201cDoes public policy preclude a converter of a motor vehicle from obtaining uninsured motorist benefits from the vehicle\u2019s owner\u2019s insurance company?\u201d It failed to brief this issue, and we consider it abandoned. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 66 n.12, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); <em>Milford Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>179 Conn. 678, 681 n.4, 427 A.2d 859 (1980); <em>Pastir </em>v. <em>Bielski, </em>174 Conn. 193, 384 A.2d 367 (1978); <em>Martino </em>v. <em>Grace-New Haven Hospital, </em>146 Conn. 735, 736, 148 A.2d 259 (1959).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The judgment is vacated and case is remanded with direction to order the parties to proceed to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> Throughout this opinion, we use the term \u201cuninsured\u201d to refer to both \u201cuninsured\u201d and \u201cunderinsured\u201d motorist coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-10\"> The trial court, <em>Curran, J., </em>subsequently granted Safeco\u2019s motion to cite in as a party defendant American Mutual Insurance Company (American), which insured Gaudet\u2019s parents. When American was declared insolvent, Gaudet, apparently without objection, withdrew the complaint as to American. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 38-175c, requiring uninsured motorist coverage to protect those otherwise entitled to recover from owners or operators of \u201cinsured motor vehicles, the insurer of which becomes insolvent prior to payment of such damages.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1987)] Sec. 38-331. converter of private passenger motor vehicle disqualified.

If the converter dies from the injuries his survivors are not entitled to basic or added reparations benefits from any source other than an insurance policy under which the converter is a basic reparations insured. For the purpose of this section, a person is not a converter if he uses the motor vehicle in the good faith belief that he is legally entitled to use it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">This section has been transferred to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 38a-375.

Since 1929, the wheel has turned, and most courts favor arbitration as an expeditious method of settling certain types of disputes.
