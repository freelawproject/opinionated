The town filed a motion to strike, which the trial court granted on the ground that General Statutes \u00a7 52-557n bars any action for injury to person or property caused by a defective road unless it is brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13a-149. That section imposes liability on a town for damages caused by means of a defective road or bridge when the town was \u201cbound to keep it in repair.\u201d After the plaintiff had failed to amend her complaint, the court rendered a final judgment for the town. See Practice Book \u00a7 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In her appeal from the judgment, the plaintiff raises only a single issue, whether \u00a7 52-557n eliminates the common law action for an absolute nuisance created by positive acts of a municipality upon a public highway and makes \u00a7 13a-149 the exclusive remedy against a municipality for any injury caused by a defective highway. Having concluded recently in <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 592 A.2d 912 (1991), that \u00a7 52-557n bars <em>any </em>action based upon a defective highway that has not been brought pursuant to \u00a7 13a-149, we hold that a common law action for nuisance is barred by \u00a7 52-557n and affirm the judgment striking the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">In <em>Sanzone </em>we held that the proviso in \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) that \u201cno cause of action shall be maintained for damages resulting from injury to any person or property by means of a defective road or bridge except pursuant to section 13a-149\u201d applied to \u201cthe entire content of subdivision \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1), <em>not merely subdivision (a) (1) (C),\u201d </em>to which its application was clearest. (Emphasis added.) Id., 190. Subdivision (a) (1) (C) of \u00a7 52-557n relates expressly to a common law nuisance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>action against a municipality: \u201cacts of the political subdivision which constitute the creation or participation in the creation of a nuisance.\u201d The complaint in this case alleges precisely such an action based on the slippery condition caused by resurfacing the road. If the proviso restricting highway defect claimants to the remedy provided by \u00a7 13a-149 is to have any application whatsoever, it must be deemed to apply to the nuisance action pleaded by this plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In <em>Sanzone </em>we also considered the effect of the savings clause, \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law,\u201d with which \u00a7 52-557n (a) (1) begins. The plaintiff relies primarily on this clause in arguing that common law nuisance actions are not affected by the statute. We concluded in <em>Sanzone </em>that this provision was not intended \u201cto preserve without modification <em>all </em>existing law, common and statutory, including such actions for positive nuisance,\u201d (emphasis in original) because \u201c[t]he legislature could not have intended the general language of the introductory clause to swallow up and nullify the section\u2019s other provisions.\u201d Id., 191. We held that the meaning of the word \u201claw\u201d in the savings clause must be limited to state and federal statutes and did not include the common law. Id., 191-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-11\"> The original complaint alleged negligence against James F. Turner, the owner of the vehicle that Dorinda Leonard had been driving, and also against the town of Litchfield. At the time the motion to strike was granted, the complaint had been amended to remove the allegations of negligence against Turner, although he was referred to as a \u201cdefendant\u201d and the file does not contain a withdrawal of the action against him. The original allegations of negligence against the town of Litchfield had also been converted to allegations of nuisance based upon the facts set forth in the original complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
