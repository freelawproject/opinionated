We conclude that the plaintiffs claims are not barred and accordingly reverse the decision of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant, Middlesex Insurance Company, for alleged violations of CUIPA and CUTPA and for breach of contract. The defendant moved to strike the plaintiffs CUIPA and CUTPA claims. The trial court, <em>Berdon, J., </em>denied the motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant next moved for summary judgment alleging that the plaintiffs suit was barred by the one year suit limitation provision in the insurance contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Thompson, J., </em>granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court decision. <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>23 Conn. App. 814, 581 A.2d 287 (1990). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the above stated issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The trial court found the following facts for purposes of the summary judgment. On May 9, 1982, a fire destroyed the home of the plaintiff. At the time of the loss, the plaintiff\u2019s home was insured by the defendant. On August 9, 1982, the plaintiff filed two proof of loss statements with the defendant, one for loss of the dwelling and the other for loss of the contents of the dwelling. By letter dated August 16, 1982, the defendant rejected both proofs of loss as being \u201cexcessive and premature.\u201d On November 1, 1982, the defendant paid the plaintiff\u2019s claim for loss of the dwelling but, without explanation, made no payment on the claim for loss of the contents. There was no further communication between the parties until August 23, 1983, when the plaintiff made a written inquiry requesting an explanation for the denial of her loss of contents claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">On August 16,1985, the plaintiff instituted this suit by way of a three count complaint alleging that the defendant had: (1) breached the insurance contract; (2) engaged in unfair insurance practices in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>of CUIPA; see footnote 1, supra; and (3) engaged in unfair trade practices in violation of CUTPA. See footnote 2, supra. The defendant moved for summary judgment alleging that the one year suit limitation provision in the insurance contract barred the plaintiffs suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant on all three counts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> With respect to the second and third counts, the court held that \u201csince the CUIPA and CUTPA claims necessarily arise from the relationship between the parties created by the insurance contract, they, too, are subject to the policy provision requiring the institution of suit within one year [as a matter of law].\u201d The Appellate Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Lees </em>v. <em>Middlesex Ins. Co., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court was incorrect as a matter of law in granting summary judgment on the second and third counts because the CUIPA and CUTPA claims alleged in those counts are not actions \u201con this policy\u201d but are independent statutory tort actions and, therefore, the one year suit limitation provision in \u00a7 38-98 does not apply. The defendant claims that: (1) the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment because all claims by an insured against an insurer, regardless of their nature, are governed by the one year suit limitation provision of \u00a7 38-98; and (2) even if the plaintiffs CUIPA and CUTPA claims are not governed by the one year suit limitation of \u00a7 38-98, that limitation nevertheless controls unless the plaintiff has advanced a viable CUIPA or CUTPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>claim. We agree with the plaintiff that her CUIPA and CUTPA claims are not subject to the one year suit limitation of \u00a7 38-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is well established. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 384 provides that summary judgment \u2018shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zichichi </em>v. <em>Middlesex Memorial Hospital, </em>204 Conn. 399, 402, 528 A.2d 805 (1987); see also <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 562, 590 A.2d 914 (1991). The issue, therefore, is whether the Appellate Court properly determined that judgment for the defendant was required as a matter of law because the plaintiff\u2019s CUIPA and CUTPA claims were barred by the one year suit limitation of \u00a7 38-98 for a suit on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Construction of a statute is a question of law for the court. <em>Griffin Hospital </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 489, 496, 512 A.2d 199, appeal dismissed, 479 U.S. 1023, 107 S. Ct. 781, 93 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1986). In every case involving the construction of a statute, our starting point must be the language employed by the legislature. <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324, 332, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987). Section 38-98 requires the standard fire insurance policy form to contain the following provision: \u201cNo suit or action <em>on this policy </em>for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable . . . unless commenced within twelve months next after inception of the loss.\u201d (Emphasis added.) To determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s CUIPA and CUTPA claims are governed by the one year limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>tation of \u00a7 38-98, we must first determine if the plaintiffs CUIPA and CUTPA claims are actions \u201con this policy\u201d as required by the statute. We conclude that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The plaintiff claims that her CUIPA and CUTPA claims are not actions \u201con [the] policy.\u201d The plaintiff contends that if \u00a7 38-98 were interpreted to include all suits against the insurer, the words \u201con this policy\u201d would be superfluous. By contrast, the defendant\u2019s claim is essentially that \u00a7 38-98 should be interpreted to provide that <em>any </em>cause of action brought by an insured against her insurer is governed by the one year suit limitation in the statute. In support of its claim, the defendant relies on a line of cases that have held that any form of action, including tort actions, growing out of the contractual relationship, constitutes an action on the policy and, therefore, is governed by the limitation provision in the insurance contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number><em>Barrow Development Co. </em>v. <em>Fulton Ins. Co., </em>418 F.2d 316 (9th Cir. 1969); <em>Hawley Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Reliance Ins. Co., </em>621 F. Sup. 190 (D. Conn. 1985); <em>Zieba </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>549 F. Sup. 1318 (D. Conn. <em>1982);</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> Modern Carpet Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Factory Ins. Assn., </em>125 Ga. App. 150, 186 S.E.2d 586 (1971); <em>Zehner </em>v. <em>MFA Ins. Co., </em>451 N.E.2d 65 (Ind. App. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In the construction of a statute, no word should be treated as superfluous or insignificant. <em>O\u2019Brien Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>215 Conn. 367, 372-73, 576 A.2d 469 (1990). The statute states only that an action \u201con this policy\u201d must be brought within one year. The defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute, however, would in effect broaden the language to provide that <em>any </em>suit or action against an insurer must be brought within one year. Such an interpretation would render the words \u201con this policy\u201d superfluous because all actions between the respective parties, whether \u201con [the] policy\u201d or not, would be subject to the one year limitation provision. Had the legislature intended all actions between an insurer and an insured to be subject to the one year provision it could have explicitly so provided. We ordinarily decline to read into statutes provisions not clearly stated; <em>Local 218 Steam Fitters Welfare Fund </em>v. <em>Cobra Pipe Supply &amp; Coil Co., </em>207 Conn. 639, 645, 541 A.2d 869 (1988); and we see no compelling reason to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>Furthermore, the phrase \u201con this policy\u201d strongly suggests that it was not intended to encompass CUIPA and CUTPA claims because that phrase and those claims ordinarily involve different factual inquiries, and because the duties ordinarily associated with them derive from different sources. In an action on an insurance policy, the conduct giving rise to the insurer\u2019s liability is a failure to pay out the policy proceeds when the insurer is contractually bound to do so. The factual inquiry focuses on the nature of the loss, the coverage of the policy and whether the parties have complied with all of the terms of the policy. In a CUIPA and CUTPA claim, however, the insurer\u2019s liability is ordinarily based on its conduct in settling or failing to settle the insured\u2019s claim and on its claims settlement policies in general. The factual inquiry focuses, not on the nature of the loss and the terms of the insurance contract, but on the conduct of the insurer. Furthermore, in an action \u201con [the] policy,\u201d the insurer\u2019s duty to comply with the policy provisions stems from the private insurance agreement and is contractual in nature. In a CUIPA and CUTPA claim, the insurer\u2019s duty stems not from the private insurance agreement but from a duty imposed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We note further that General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (f)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides for a three year statute of limitations for bringing a CUTPA claim. If we were to adopt the defendant\u2019s position that a CUTPA claim is governed by the one year provision in \u00a7 38-98, it would render the statute of limitations prescribed in \u00a7 42-110g (f) meaningless, as applied to claims based upon improper practices of insurers. We presume, however, that the legislature intended \u00a7\u00a7 38-98 and 42-110g (f) to be harmonious with each other and we therefore \u201c \u2018construe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>each to leave room for meaningful operation of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>Milford </em>v. <em>Local 1566, </em>200 Conn. 91, 100, 510 A.2d 177 (1986). Thus, we interpret the statute of limitations in \u00a7 42-110g (f) to operate independently of that prescribed in \u00a7 38-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Furthermore, although the legislature has not expressly provided a specific statute of limitation provision for CUIPA claims, it would be anomalous to apply the \u00a7 38-98 limitations period to CUIPA claims since we have held that a private cause of action exists under CUTPA to enforce alleged CUIPA violations. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Bums, </em>199 Conn. 651, 665-66, 509 A.2d 11 (1986). This linkage counsels strongly against reading a CUIPA claim as an action \u201con [the] policy\u201d under \u00a7 38-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Finally, pursuant to \u00a7 42-110g (a) and (d)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the court may award punitive damages and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for a violation of CUTPA. These are damages that could be awarded even if the plaintiff\u2019s principal damages were proven to be only the amount of her loss covered by the policy. This further supports the conclusion that a CUTPA violation gives rise to a separate cause of action and is not governed by the limitations period provided in \u00a7 38-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Our conclusion is not inconsistent with <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>217 Conn. 340, 354-55, 586 A.2d 567 (1991), in which we recently addressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the argument that an insurer\u2019s equitable claim to contribution was not one that rested \u201con the policy.\u201d In that case, two insurance companies had provided fire insurance coverage to the insured. When the insured\u2019s place of business was damaged in a fire, one insurance company paid the entire claim while the remaining company refused to pay. The company that paid the claim eventually brought a subrogation action against the nonpaying company, in which it sought reimbursement of one half of the amount it had paid to the insured. Because that action had been brought more than one year after the fire loss, we held that it was barred by \u00a7 38-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The insurer seeking reimbursement argued, however, that it had an independent, equitable right to contribution that did not rest \u201con [the] policy\u201d and, therefore, was not barred by \u00a7 38-98. Without deciding that question, we noted \u201cthat the policy of swift settlement of claims promoted by the one year suit provision in \u00a7 38-98 would be undermined if insurers who failed to bring a timely subrogation claim could simply bypass the one year suit requirement ... by also alleging an independent contribution claim . . . .\u201d <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>supra, 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Our discussion in <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>rested on the understanding that in nearly every circumstance where an insurer had a subrogation claim against another insurer, it could also assert a parallel right to contribution. CUTPA and CUIPA claims, however, do not pose the same problem. Such claims, as we noted earlier, generally involve different factual inquiries than do breach of contract claims. Thus, there is a substantially reduced likelihood that a party asserting an untimely breach of contract claim would readily be able to circumvent the one year suit provision by alleging a CUTPA or CUIPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The defendant next claims that even if CUIPA and CUTPA claims are not actions on the policy, we should adopt the position that the one year suit limitation provision controls unless the insured has advanced a viable CUIPA and CUTPA claim. The defendant argues that if the plaintiffs CUIPA and CUTPA claims are essentially a pretextual attempt to recover the policy proceeds, the claims should be governed by the one year suit limitation provision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that this rule applies here because the plaintiff has not alleged any misconduct on the defendant\u2019s part after the loss other than those acts relating to the denial of the claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We reject this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The trial court, by denying the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiff\u2019s CUIPA and CUTPA claims, determined that the plaintiff had alleged valid CUIPA and CUTPA violations. If the plaintiff ultimately prevails on her CUIPA or CUTPA claim, the defendant may then appeal and secure appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision on the motion to strike. If the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>tiff proves that the defendant\u2019s conduct violated CUIPA, CUTPA, or both, we see no reason to deny relief simply because \u00a7 38-98 would bar an action on the insurance policy. To accept the defendant\u2019s argument would be inconsistent with the recognition of CUIPA and CUTPA claims as independent actions based on factual inquiries and sources of duty separate from actions on the policy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b668-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1981)] Sec. 38-60. unfair practice prohibited.

Conn. 1982) (alleged tortious conduct of insurer arises out of its obligations under contract and, therefore, plaintiff\u2019s bad faith claim governed by one year limitation in insurance policy). We note, however, that we need not defer to the District Court\u2019s decisions on issues of Connecticut law. <em>Rego </em>v. <em>Connecticut Ins. Placement Facility, </em>219 Conn. 339, 350, 593 A.2d 491 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (f) provides: \u201cAn action under this section may not be brought more than three years after the occurrence of a violation of this chapter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b676-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (a) and (d) provide in pertinent part: \u201caction foe damages, class actions, costs and fees, equitable belief, (a) . . . . The court may, in its discretion, award punitive damages and may provide such equitable relief as it deems necessary or proper. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">\u201c(d) In any action brought by a person under this section, the court may award, to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b678-8\"> This view has been adopted by at least one California appellate court. See <em>Abari </em>v. <em>State Farm &amp; Casualty Co., </em>205 Cal. App. 3d 530, 252 Cal. Rptr. 565 (2d Dist. 1988) (plaintiff\u2019s bad faith and unfair practice claims barred by one year suit limitation for actions on policy because they are a \u201ctransparent attempt to recover on the policy\u201d); <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Western Mutual Ins. Co., </em>204 Cal. App. 3d 565, 251 Cal. Rptr. 319 (2d Dist. 1988) (if allegation of tortious bad faith relates to claim on underlying policy rather than to conduct or event subsequent to loss, action is on the policy).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\"> Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, however, the plaintiff has alleged acts of misconduct by the defendant occurring after the loss that are unrelated to the policy proceeds. Specifically, the plaintiff has alleged that the defendant failed to deny or confirm coverage of her claim within a reasonable time after the proof of loss statements were completed in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 38-61 (6) (e). The plaintiff has also alleged that the defendant failed to provide any explanation as to why the defendant denied the plaintiff\u2019s claim in violation of \u00a7 38-61 (6) (n).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b679-11\"> The defendant attempts to raise an alternative ground on which to affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s decision. It claims that, because the trial court determined that the plaintiff was unable to establish the existence of an issue of material fact with respect to a claim of estoppel that the plaintiff raised in response to the motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff likewise has failed to establish the existence of an issue of material fact with respect to her CUIPA and CUTPA claims. We decline to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-12\">The defendant is essentially asking us to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged valid CUIPA and CUTPA claims. As previously noted; see footnote 4, supra; we declined to consider in this appeal whether the trial court was correct in concluding that the plaintiff\u2019s CUIPA and CUTPA counts alleged valid causes of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
