The trial court, <em>M. Hennessey, J., </em>granted the plaintiff\u2019s request for a permanent, injunction, and this court affirmed the judgment on appeal. <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Youth Challenge of Greater Hartford, Inc., </em>206 Conn. 316, 318-19, 537 A.2d 480 (1988) <em>(Youth Challenge I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Thereafter, in November, 1988, the plaintiff moved that the defendants be held in contempt, alleging that they were violating the permanent injunction by continuing to operate two unlicensed substance abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>treatment facilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Satter, J., </em>held the named defendant in contempt<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and modified the 1986 injunction. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred that appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The facts leading to this appeal are as follows. The defendant operates a licensed substance abuse treatment facility at 15-17 May Street, Hartford. In August, 1986, the plaintiff filed a petition for enforcement seeking to enjoin the defendants from operating two unlicensed substance abuse treatment facilities, the Youth Challenge Ranch (Ranch) in Moosup, and the Youth Challenge Girls\u2019 Home (Girls\u2019 Home) in Hartford. In December, 1986, Judge Hennessey found that the defendants managed and operated the Ranch and the Girls\u2019 Home, and that the Ranch and the Girls\u2019 Home were drug and alcohol treatment facilities operating without a license. See <em>Youth Challenge I, </em>supra, 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In particular, Judge Hennessey found that the tax returns of the defendants listed the Girls\u2019 Home as a \u201cdrug rehabilitation program,\u201d and the Ranch as a \u201cresident drug program.\u201d The Girls\u2019 Home was described in its brochure as having the purpose of \u201cinstilling in the drug dependent person, the incentive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>forsake his drug habit for the pursuit of a new life.\u201d The court further found that the Girls\u2019 Home was engaged in detoxification of its residents, and also provided a supervised and supportive living situation for abusing or drug dependent persons, treatment and rehabilitative programs, assessment of the residents\u2019 physical and psychological condition, referral for medical care, psychiatric evaluation and continuing treatment, and storage of medication. Similarly, Judge Hennessey found that the services provided by the Ranch, the second phase of a residential rehabilitation program for males that follows the induction phase at the defendants\u2019 licensed facility, included planned treatment and rehabilitation programs, training and vocational rehabilitation, referral for continuing treatment and/or medical care, dietary services, central storage of medication and administration of medication, assessment of the individual\u2019s physical and psychological condition to determine appropriateness for admission, and ongoing assessments to establish a program for maintaining alcohol and/or drug free status.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\">Based on these findings, Judge Hennessey concluded that both facilities were drug or alcohol treatment facilities that were required to be licensed under the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 19a-491 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>The court rendered judgment granting a permanent injunction. The terms of the injunction provided, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he defendants are enjoined from operating any unlicensed facilities providing treatment to drug and/or alcohol dependent persons unless, and until, they obtain a license from the Department of Health Services. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">In November, 1988, the plaintiff instituted these proceedings, seeking to have the defendants held in contempt for violation of the injunction, alleging that the defendants were continuing to operate the two unlicensed substance abuse treatment facilities. After four days of hearings, the trial court, <em>Satter, J., </em>found that since the injunction was entered in 1986, the operations at both the Ranch and the Girls\u2019 Home had remained unchanged. The court also found that virtually all of the residents of the Girls\u2019 Home had histories of drug or alcohol abuse problems, a fact it considered relevant under the definition of \u201csubstance-dependent persons\u201d as \u201cindividuals who are physically or psycho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>logically reliant upon alcohol or a drug (1) as a result of substance abuse . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 19a-495-570 (a) (37). The court also found from an examination of the medical records of numerous residents of the Ranch and the Girls\u2019 Home that the residents were dependent psychologically on drugs, despite the fact that the residents may not have been actively using drugs or experiencing withdrawal symptoms at the time of admission.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This finding comports with the definition of a substance dependent person pursuant to the department of health service regulation \u00a7 19a-495-570 (a) (37).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">Based upon these findings, the court further found that the defendant had continued to operate the Girls\u2019 Home and the Ranch as unlicensed drug or alcohol treatment facilities in violation of paragraph one of the 1986 injunction, and, therefore, held the defendant in contempt. Pursuant to its finding of contempt, the trial court modified the injunction as follows: \u201c(1) The defendant shall be fined $200.00 per day to begin 30 days after the Court\u2019s issuance of this contempt order unless and until the defendant has either (a) discharged all residents from the Girls\u2019 Home and Ranch by transferring them to a licensed substance abuse treatment facility or otherwise discharging them after giving them information about licensed substance abuse treatment facilities in their community, or (b) applied for a license <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>from the Department of Health Services for the Ranch and the Girls\u2019 Home. If the applicant applies for a license in a timely fashion but has not received a license for a facility within 4 months of the application, the defendant must comply with the discharge provisions of this order within 30 days of the passage of the 4-month period. The.defendant may request a written extension of time from the Department if it is in the process of applying for a license and it appears that a decision on the application will not be made within the 4 months. If the Department grants the extension of time, the applicant must meet the new deadline or implement the discharge provisions of this order within 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">\u201c(2) If the defendant chooses or becomes subject to the discharge of residents provision in (1) above, then the defendant must comply with the following additional provisions to ensure that the facilities do not revert back to substance abuse facilities: (a) The defendant shall not allow anyone to reside at the Ranch or Girls\u2019 Home who has had a history of substance abuse within one year prior to admission. This means that anyone applying to reside at the Ranch or Girls\u2019 Home who was abusing drugs or alcohol or who was in a substance abuse treatment facility within the preceding twelve-month period cannot be admitted. The defendant must verify this by questioning the individuals, the referring person, if known[,] and by checking the person\u2019s medical records. The defendant shall maintain documentation of this verification for each person it admits to the Ranch or Girls\u2019 Home. This documentation shall be made available to Department inspectors upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\u201c(b) The defendant shall report to the Department on a bi-monthly basis for the first two years following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>this order and annually thereafter and provide the Department with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-4\">\u201c(A) the names and dates of birth of any new residents; their date of admission and length of stay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-5\">\u201c(B) whether the resident is receiving any money and/or reimbursement for costs or is being provided with any services from any state, city or federal agency and the reason such services/money/reimbursement is being provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\u201c(3) The Department shall have access to the Ranch and the Girls\u2019 Home for a period of two years from this order to verify compliance with the injunction and with this order. Access is to consist of unannounced visits by Department staff. Department staff are to be allowed to tour the facility, review any resident records, and talk to staff and residents.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The defendant first claims that \u201c[tjhere being no \u2018drug and/or alcohol dependent persons\u2019 in the Girls\u2019 Home and the Ranch, the court erred in finding the defendant in contempt of the December 4,1986 Injunction . . . . \u201d The essence of the defendant\u2019s first claim is a challenge to the factual findings of the trial court. We reject this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">We first note that this appeal is from a finding of civil contempt, and, therefore, \u201cour review is technically limited to \u2018questions of jurisdiction such as whether the court had authority to impose the punishment inflicted and whether the act or acts for which the penalty was imposed could constitute a contempt.\u2019 . . . This limitation originates because by its very nature the court\u2019s contempt power . . . must be balanced against the contemnor\u2019s fundamental rights and, for this reason, there exists the present mechanism for the eventual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>review of errors which allegedly infringe on these rights. . . . We have found a civil contempt to be improper or erroneous because: the injunction on which it was based was vague and indefinite . . . the findings on which it was based were ambiguous and irreconcilable . . . the contemnor\u2019s constitutional rights were not properly safeguarded . . . the penalties imposed were criminal rather than civil in nature . . . and the contemnor, through no fault of his own, was unable to obey the court\u2019s order.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Papa </em>v. <em>New Haven Federation of Teachers, </em>186 Conn. 725, 731-32, 444 A.2d 196 (1982). \u201cAlthough <em>Papa </em>recognizes that plenary review of civil contempt orders extends to some issues that are not truly jurisdictional, its emphasis on fundamental rights underscores the proposition that the grounds for any appeal from a contempt order are more restricted than would be the case in an ordinary plenary appeal from a civil judgment.\u201d <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>217 Conn. 24, 29-30, 584 A.2d 445 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Although various claims are strewn throughout its brief, the defendant fails adequately to raise a challenge to the contempt order based upon the vagueness or indefiniteness of the injunction, upon an assertion that its constitutional rights were not adequately safeguarded or upon an assertion that it was unable to obey the court\u2019s order. Furthermore, the defendant does not claim that the findings upon which the contempt order was based are \u201cambiguous and irreconcilable . . . .\u201d <em>Papa </em>v. <em>New Haven Federation of Teachers, </em>supra, 732. Rather, the gravamen of the defendant\u2019s claim is that the trial court should have found facts favorable to it contrary to those the court did find.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\u201cThe resolution of conflicting factual claims falls within the province of the trial court. . . . 'The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . \u2019 We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>207 Conn. 468, 473, 542 A.2d 692 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The defendant\u2019s claim is premised upon its assertion that none of the inhabitants of the Girls\u2019 Home or the Ranch is dependent on drugs or alcohol. A review of the evidence presented to the trial court, however, demonstrates that sufficient evidence was presented to support its conclusion that the Girls\u2019 Home and the Ranch both were still operating substance abuse treatment facilities in violation of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">In support of the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant was continuing to treat drug or alcohol dependent persons, the acting medical director of the Girls\u2019 Home and the Ranch, Anthony Ardolini, testified, in regard to the Girls\u2019 Home, that \u201cthe residents of the Home are psychologically dependent on drugs, even though at the time of admission they may not have been using drugs or having withdrawal symptoms.\u201d He also stated that the Girls\u2019 Home residents \u201c \u2018are allotted an alternative, comprehensive lifestyle that allows them to remain drug free. That fits my definition of a drug rehabilitation program.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In regard to the Ranch, Ardolini testified that \u201cthese [residents] are very addictive individuals. There is something about their psychological make-up, I believe, that makes them that way. This [Ranch] happens to be a very religious organization . . . but they get very much involved\u2014no[t] in a negative way, but addicted\u2014 to religious activities of the group, and that offers them a very plausible, certainly a safer, environment where they could go ahead and become more productive members of society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>In support of the plaintiffs claim that the defendant had continued to operate an unlicensed drug or alcohol treatment facility in violation of the injunction, Louie Collazo, one of the directors of the defendant, testified that \u201ceverything is the same, classes, the major operations or the way of homes working on a daily basis have been the same.\u201d Collazo testified that \u201cthe only change that may be a change [since the 1986 injunction] was when I went there we changed the name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The defendant does not dispute this evidence, but disagrees with the findings and conclusions reached by the trial court. It is not the function of this court, however, to pass upon credibility; <em>Nor\u2019easter Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Colossale Concrete, Inc., </em>supra; and, upon reviewing the entire record, we can find no reason to disturb the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant has continued to operate two substance abuse treatment facilities in violation of the 1986 injunction. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s factual findings and ultimate conclusion are adequately supported by the record and are not clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 4061; see also <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>[181 Conn. 217, 221-22, 435 A.2d 24 (1980)]; <em>Howie\u2019s Painting Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ferreria, </em>12 Conn. App. 583, 584, 532 A.2d 1318 (1987).\u201d Id., 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly modified the 1986 injunction at the contempt hearing. The defendant does not challenge the specific modifications entered by the court, but claims that the court should not have modified the 1986 injunction because there were \u201cno pleadings, no notice, no trial and no opportunity for representation by counsel . . . .\u201d Although we generally will not review a claim based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>upon a bare assertion of a due process violation; <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 66 n.12, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); we address the claim but conclude that it is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">At the outset, the defendant\u2019s claim that it received no notice, no pleadings, no trial, and no opportunity for presentation of evidence by counsel is easily refuted by an examination of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for contempt. In its prayer for relief, the plaintiff requested, inter alia: (a) that the defendant be compelled to allow unannounced visits of the facilities and to allow inspectors to review resident records; (b) that the defendant be forced to show that it has ceased holding itself out to the public as a substance abuse treatment facility; (c) that the defendant be compelled to show that the facilities are no longer operating as substance abuse treatment facilities; and (d) any other equitable relief available. The plain language of this prayer for relief should have alerted the defendant that the plaintiff was requesting relief greater than that provided for in the 1986 injunction. Thus, the defendant should have been aware of the fact that certain modifications were being sought, even before trial began. The defendant had ample notice of the request and ample opportunity both prior to and during trial to present the court with pleadings and evidence demonstrating that such a modification was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Furthermore, after four days of trial, the plaintiff filed a posttrial brief to the court. In the brief, the plaintiff submitted a proposed modification of the 1986 injunction. Although the defendant submitted a reply brief, it neither addressed the modification nor requested a hearing thereon. The trial court thereafter adopted the modification of the 1986 injunction proposed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>The defendant does not dispute that it had the opportunity to address the proposed modification in its reply brief, but failed to do so. The defendant also does not dispute that it never requested a hearing on the proposed modification prior to the determination by the trial court. Nevertheless, the defendant argues, without authority, that its due process rights were violated by the court\u2019s adoption of the modification. We conclude, however, that the defendant\u2019s failure to respond to the modification requested by the plaintiff and its failure to request a hearing thereon were due to its own laxity and, therefore, do not result in a violation of its due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">Furthermore, it is undisputed that \u201cin dealing with judgments that decree injunctive relief . . . \u2018courts have inherent power to change or modify their own injunctions where circumstances or pertinent law have so changed as to make it equitable to do so.\u2019 <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Vaill, </em>158 Conn. 478, 482, 262 A.2d 169 (1969); <em>Collens </em>v. <em>New Canaan Water Co., </em>155 Conn. 477, 494, 234 A.2d 825 (1967).\u201d <em>Department of Health Services </em>v. <em>Commission On Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>198 Conn. 479, 487, 503 A.2d 1151 (1986). \u201cCourts have in general the \u2018power to fashion a remedy appropriate to the vindication of a prior . . . judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Dichello Distributors, Inc., </em>14 Conn. App. 184, 192, 540 A.2d 704 (1988), quoting <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>191 Conn. 555, 563, 468 A.2d 1230 (1983). \u201cHaving found noncompliance, the court, in the exercise of its equitable powers, necessarily had the authority to fashion whatever orders were required to protect the integrity of [its original] judgment.\u201d <em>Connecticut Pharmaceutical Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Milano, </em>supra, 563-64; see also <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>163 Conn. 281, 282, 303 A.2d 720 (1972) (Superior Court has power to enforce its own judgments).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The dissent, based on the plain error doctrine, would remand the case to the trial court on order to modify the injunction to cure what the dissent perceives as its overbreadth. This approach, however, reaches to find plain error where none plainly exists. Plain error is properly reserved for those extraordinary situations where the error is so obvious that the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial process would be impaired were we to fail to address an issue that was not raised or preserved at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 659-60, 588 A.2d 127 (1991). This is not such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">First, as the dissent acknowledges, the defendant has never\u2014in the trial court or in this court\u2014raised the claim of modification relied on by the dissent. The defendant\u2019s claim was confined to a wholesale attack on the authority of the trial court to make any modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Second, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, there is no implied finding by the trial court that there are any residents of the Girls\u2019 Home or Ranch who have not had drug or alcohol abuse problems. Of course, it was the obligation of the defendant, as the appellant, to cure any ambiguity in the court\u2019s decision; <em>O\u2019Hara </em>v. <em>State, </em>218 Conn. 628, 635, 590 A.2d 948 (1991); a remedy the defendant declined to seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">It is true that the trial court found that \u201c[ajlmost all the residents of the Girls\u2019 Home have histories of drug and/or alcohol abuse problems,\u201d and that \u201calmost all the residents of the Ranch have substance abuse problems.\u201d We read these references, however, as indicating only that the trial court may not have read the medical histories of all the residents. Instead, the court specifically relied on the testimony of Ardolini \u201cthat <em>the residents </em>of the Home are psychologically dependent on drugs, even though at the time of admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>they may not have been using drugs or having withdrawal symptoms.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court also specifically found that \u201c[t]he Ranch is the second phase of a program which begins at the Youth Challenge Men\u2019s Home in Hartford which is a licensed substance abuse facility. The staff of the Men\u2019s Home and Ranch mutually decide when a resident is ready to move to the Ranch to continue his rehabilitation.\u201d The court further found that \u201c[t]he heavy emphasis on religious study at the Ranch is designed to help residents control drug problems.\u201d Thus, it is clear from this record, and from the record of the earlier case, that the defendant is not operating general bible study schools that happen to have some students with substance abuse backgrounds. Rather, the defendant employs bible study as a form of unlicensed substance abuse treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">In view of these findings, and in view of the total lack in the defendant\u2019s brief of any factual or legal elaboration of a denial of its right to practice religion, it is difficult to comprehend the dissent\u2019s insistence that the modified injunction constitutes <em>\u201ca </em>clear violation\u201d of the defendant\u2019s right to do so. Furthermore, there is no basis here that we can see for the defendant vicariously to assert its residents\u2019 religious rights, as the dissent would permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In this instance, the trial court, after having found that the defendant had violated the 1986 injunction prohibiting it from operating two unlicensed substance abuse treatment facilities, had the equitable power to modify the injunction in order to \u201cvindicate\u201d its prior judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the defendant does not challenge any of the specific provisions of the modified injunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>tion, but rather the power of the court to so modify, we end our inquiry here.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">In this opinion Glass, Covello and F. X.

Although the function of the appellant\u2019s reply brief is to respond to the arguments and authority presented in the appellee\u2019s brief, that function does not include raising an entirely new claim of error.\u201d <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>5 Conn.

On December 20, 1988, the trial court, <em>Satter, J., </em>bifurcated the contempt hearing on the alleged violations. Judge Satter held the defendants in contempt after finding that they had refused the inspectors access to the facilities, and fined the defendants $1000. The defendants appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment in <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Youth Challenge of Greater Hartford, Inc., </em>20 Conn.

I agree with the majority opinion in all respects except its attempted justification of the overbreadth of the modified injunction in requiring that <em>all </em>residents of the facilities operated by the defendant be discharged despite indications in the finding that not all of them have a history of drug or alcohol abuse. There is a significant discrepancy between the finding of the trial court that <em>\u201calmost all </em>the residents\u201d of the Girls\u2019 Home and of the Ranch have substance abuse problems and the terms of the modified injunction, which require the defendant to discharge <em>\u201call </em>residents from the Girls\u2019 Home and Ranch\u201d unless it applies to the department of health to obtain licenses for these facilities as drug and alcohol abuse treatment centers. (Emphasis added.) If there are any residents of the Girls\u2019 Home or the Ranch who have not had drug or alcohol abuse problems, as the finding implies, the modified injunction should not have required that these persons be compelled to leave the defendant\u2019s facilities. No license is required for the defendant to operate its religion study program for the benefit of those residents who are not \u201csuffering from . . . alcoholism or other drug addiction.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 19a-490. \u201cWhere the subordinate facts found by the trial court do not . . . support the injunction issued, the injunction must be vacated\u201d; <em>Karls </em>v. <em>Alexandra Realty Corporation, </em>179 Conn. 390, 403, 426 A.2d 784 (1980); or modified to conform to the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The defendant has made only a general claim that the modified injunction is overbroad and has not spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>cifically pointed to the finding as a limitation on its proper scope. This court, nevertheless, should regard this obvious flaw as plain error; Practice Book \u00a7 4185; see <em>Finley </em>v. <em>Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co., </em>202 Conn. 190, 196, 520 A.2d 208 (1987); and direct a further modification of the injunction to exclude any residents who have no history of substance abuse. See <em>DeCecco </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>174 Conn. 29, 35-36, 381 A.2d 543 (1977). With respect to such persons, the operation of the injunction in its present form would constitute a clear violation of their constitutional right as well as that of the defendant to engage in the practice of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Accordingly, I dissent from the affirmation of the judgment without further modification of the terms of the injunction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
