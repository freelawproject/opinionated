We conclude that such a finding is not a prerequisite to the admission of constancy evidence and therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The defendant, Robert Parris, was convicted after a jury trial of one count of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one count of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one count of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) and (C).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant was sentenced to a total effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>tive term of twenty years imprisonment, execution suspended after fifteen years, to be followed by three years probation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. In March of 1986, when the victim was fourteen years old, she lived in an apartment building where the defendant also resided. On the evening of March 12, 1986, the defendant accompanied the victim to a friend\u2019s house. At some point during their return, he dragged her into an abandoned building known as the \u201cfan gallery.\u201d The defendant then performed various sexual acts upon the victim, including intercourse, against her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">The defendant\u2019s principal claim focuses upon the admission of the testimony of three of the four constancy of accusation witnesses called by the state at trial: Eric Sutherland, the victim\u2019s \u201cclose friend\u201d; Fran Dwyer, who counselled the victim at a clinic; and Detective Patricia Miranda, to whom the victim officially reported the incident. Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the testimony of these witnesses, as well as that of Geraldine Katz, the victim\u2019s school guidance counsellor who ultimately testified at trial, and Cindy Howell, an assault crisis counsellor who did not testify. The defendant argued that the victim\u2019s statements to all of the proposed witnesses should be excluded as hearsay, and advanced the related claim that her statements, made from approximately ten to nineteen months after the crimes, had not been made at a \u201cnatural\u201d time. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>190 Conn. 84, 99, 459 A.2d 1005 (1983). Alternatively, the defendant sought to limit the number of constancy witnesses permitted to testify, as well as the victim\u2019s testimony regarding the number of people to whom she had reported the incident, in view of the \u201cprejudicial effect\u201d of the testimony. The state countered that the chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>lenged testimony was admissible under the constancy of accusation \u201cexception to the hearsay rule,\u201d that the victim had made the statements at a \u201cnatural\u201d time, and that the testimony was not more prejudicial than probative. In support of its contentions, the state offered the victim\u2019s voir dire testimony. The victim named all of the proposed witnesses as persons to whom she had reported the incident, gave reasons for her delay in making the reports, and described the circumstances that eventually had prompted her to make them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">After hearing the victim\u2019s testimony, the court found that while she normally would have reported such an incident to her mother, \u201cshe was afraid that her mother would not believe her.\u201d The court further surmised that \u201cnot reporting something like that . . . because of the fear that she would be disbelieved as time went on [probably made it] more difficult to make the report. When the report was made, it was made to a Counsellor [Katz] after a presentation of a movie on the subject [sexual assault]. I think that would be a natural time for someone who had this on their mind for a considerable period of time to make the report.\u201d Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>ingly, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. At trial, the victim testified on direct examination to the facts of the incident and stated that she had told her ex-boyfriend, Howell, Katz, Sutherland and Miranda that the defendant had sexually assaulted her. The state then called Sutherland, Dwyer, Katz and Miranda, who related the victim\u2019s statements about the incident in varying degrees of detail.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the court improperly: (1) admitted the testimony of Sutherland, Dwyer and Miranda without making a preliminary finding that the victim\u2019s statements to them had been made at a \u201cnatural\u201d time; and (2) refused to restrict the number of the state\u2019s constancy witnesses, as well as the victim\u2019s testimony regarding the number of people to whom she had reported the incident, despite the \u201cprejudicial effect\u201d of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The defendant first attacks the court\u2019s failure to make a preliminary finding, before admitting the testimony of Sutherland, Dwyer and Miranda, that the victim\u2019s statements to them had been made at a \u201cnatural\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>time. In the defendant\u2019s view, the court found only that the victim\u2019s statements to Katz had been made at a \u201cnatural\u201d time, and in the absence of a similar finding regarding her statements to Sutherland, Dwyer and Miranda, their testimony should have been excluded, and his conviction accordingly should be reversed, under the authority of <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ouellette, </em>supra, 99, this court indicated that before constancy of accusation evidence can be admitted, \u201cthe trial court must find, under the circumstances in each case, first that the statement was made at a time when it was natural t\u00f3 make it; second that the witness has been impeached by a suggestion of recent contrivance.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <em>Ouellette </em>court provided two grounds for this dual prerequisite to the admission of constancy evidence. First, the court determined that because the rationale for admitting such evidence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cis essentially the same as that ... for admitting prior consistent statements to counter a suggestion of recent contrivance or fabrication,\u201d there was \u201cno analytical reason\u201d to approach the two kinds of evidence differently. Id. Second, the court concluded that analyzing constancy evidence in a manner analogous to prior consistent statements to counter a suggestion of recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>fabrication would reduce \u201cthe confusion surrounding the admissibility of constancy of accusation evidence . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">While phrased in terms of a rule to be applied in future cases involving constancy of accusation evidence, however, the prerequisite announced in <em>Ouellette </em>was not essential to the outcome of that case. The constancy of accusation doctrine ultimately was found inapplicable in <em>Ouellette </em>because the victim\u2019s disputed statement \u201cdid not concern the crime charged and was therefore not an \u2018accusation\u2019 . . . .\u201d Id., 100. Consequently, the prerequisite was merely dictum, without the force of precedent insofar as proper constancy evidence is concerned. \u201c[T]he precedential value of a decision should be limited to the four corners of the decision\u2019s factual setting.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Moreover, were we to adopt the <em>Ouellette </em>dictum by applying it in this case, our decision effectively would overrule a long line of precedent in the constancy of accusation context with which that dictum directly conflicts. The decisions of this court predating <em>Ouellette, </em>for example, did not condition the admission of constancy evidence upon a court\u2019s finding that the victim\u2019s statements had been made at a \u201cnatural\u201d time. Rather, the admission of such evidence was approved \u201cwhen the complainant first has testified, in court, to the facts of the alleged occurrence .... She is then permitted to state that she made complaint to some other person.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thereupon, the person to whom she complained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>out of court and in the absence of the defendant is permitted to testify not only to the fact that a complaint was made but also to its details.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Segerberg, </em>131 Conn. 546, 548-49, 41 A.2d 101 (1945); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 453-54, 442 A.2d 906 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Furthermore, contrary to the dictum in <em>Ouellette, </em>the term \u201cnatural\u201d as employed in our prior caselaw was not connected to any preliminary issue of admissibility for the trial court\u2019s resolution. That term merely represents the phenomenon of human behavioral expectations that lends corroborative force, on one hand, to a sexual assault victim\u2019s report of the fact of the incident and its details to another, and lends impeaching force, on the other hand, to the victim\u2019s failure to make such a report or include particular details in a report made. In an early decision, this court explained the corroborative quality of constancy evidence and the impeaching quality of the lack thereof as follows: \u201cWhy has the rule been adopted that in prosecutions for rape, and for attempts to commit rape, the public prosecutor may show that the woman on whom the assault was made complained of it to her friends? It is simply because such a course would be natural if the crime had been committed, but very unnatural if it had not been. But her natural impulses would prompt her to tell all the details of the transaction. Why, on the same principle, ought not her statement of the details to be evidence? . . . If her story were true, the evidence would show constancy in the charge even to the details, and the truth [of her testimony] would more clearly appear.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>44 Conn. 153, 156-57 (1876).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Finally, again conflicting with the dictum in <em>Ouellette, </em>the significance of the timing of a victim\u2019s report of the incident traditionally was a matter to be considered by the jury, exclusively, in evaluating the victim\u2019s credibility. If the victim\u2019s report had been immediate as would be expected after \u201csuch an outrage has been committed on [his or] her person\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeWolf, </em>8 Conn. 93, 100 (1830); the jury might logically infer that the victim\u2019s trial testimony more probably was truthful.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A delayed report, while suggesting a contrary inference,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was not subject to exclusion on the ground that it had not been made at a \u201cnatural\u201d time. The state was entitled to introduce evidence of the delayed report and the victim was permitted to counteract the negative implications of the delay by giving reasons for it that the jury might find understandable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>186 Conn. 521, 529, 442 A.2d 927 (1982) (\u201creason that the victim did not tell the police initially was . . . a fact for the jury to pass upon with all the other evidence\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>47 Conn. 465, 466 (1880). In other words: \u201cWhatever delay took place between the time of the attack and the time the victim first told witnesses of it does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, but merely presents a question of fact for the trier as to the weight to be given it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brigandi, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Dziob, </em>133 Conn. 167, 169, 48 A.2d 377 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>We have stated that \u201cthe necessity of certainty and continuity in the law dictates that \u2018a court should overrule its own precedents for only the most compelling reasons. . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>194 Conn. 416, 435, 481 A.2d 56 (1984). While it may well be that the analytical underpinnings of our constancy of accusation doctrine resemble those of the hearsay exception for prior consistent statements to rebut a suggestion of recent fabrication, we do not find that similarity, nor has the defendant offered any additional reason, sufficiently compelling to warrant a restriction of the doctrine iti the manner suggested by <em>Ouellette. </em>Constancy evidence is properly viewed as a peculiar species of evidence, and, rather than further attempt to conform our traditionally liberal doctrine to evidentiary rules designed for other classes of evidence, we leave any curtailment of the doctrine to future cases where compelling reasons presented by litigants might persuade us to do so. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 203, 506 A.2d 118 (1986). We are satisfied that the doctrine in its form prior to <em>Ouellette </em>is \u201crationally and socially adapted to ascertaining the truth\u201d; id., 202 n.9; and advantageously provides criminal defendants with \u201ca fertile field for cross-examination of a complainant with reference to ascertaining where the truth lies.\u201d Id., 202; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>supra, 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Accordingly, we discard the dictum in <em>Ouellette </em>to the extent that it pertains to constancy of accusation evidence, and we reaffirm our precedents prior to <em>Ouellette </em>that leave the evaluation of the timing of a victim\u2019s statements and any \u201cnaturalness\u201d thereof in the hands of the jury. The defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s failure to make a preliminary finding that the victim\u2019s statements to Sutherland, Dwyer and Miranda had been made at a \u201cnatural\u201d time must therefore be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The defendant next argues that the court improperly-refused to restrict the number of constancy of accusation witnesses and the victim\u2019s testimony regarding the number of persons to whom she had reported the incident due to the \u201cprejudicial effect\u201d of the testimony. The defendant maintains that the court\u2019s refusal, to his prejudice, allowed the state to \u201cbombard\u201d the jury with the testimony of the \u201csheer number\u201d of witnesses who related the victim\u2019s reports and the victim\u2019s testimony identifying the \u201csheer number\u201d of people to whom she had reported the incident. In addition, the defendant contends that Miranda\u2019s testimony was \u201cparticularly harmful\u201d because she gave \u201cthe only detailed account\u201d of the incident as described to her by the victim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">A trial court\u2019s broad discretion to exclude evidence more prejudicially cumulative than probative certainly encompasses the power to limit the number of witnesses who may be called for a particular purpose. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 702-703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982). \u201cIn excluding evidence on the ground that it would be only \u2018cumulative,\u2019 care must be taken <em>not </em>to exclude merely because of an <em>overlap </em>with evidence previously received. To the extent that evidence presents new matter, it is obviously not cumulative with evidence previously received.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) 2 D. Louisell &amp; C. Mueller, Federal Evidence \u00a7 128. In the present case, each item of the state\u2019s constancy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>evidence, while overlapping in the sense that it related to the same incident, pertained to a different statement that the victim had made to a different person at a different point in time. Rather than prejudicially cumulative, therefore, the evidence covered new matter by demonstrating, as was its relevant purpose, that the victim previously had reported the incident she described on direct examination in a constant and consistent fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">With respect to Miranda\u2019s testimony providing the details of the victim\u2019s report to her, the court minimized any appreciable danger that the jury might treat her testimony as substantive evidence by giving an appropriate instruction as to its limited corroborative use.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The jury is presumed, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary, to have followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 669, 588 A.2d 127 (1991). Finding no such indication in the record we conclude that the court properly refused to exclude or restrict the volume of the state\u2019s constancy of accusation evidence as more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b306-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1985)] Sec. 53a-70. sexual assault in the first degree: class b felony: one year not suspendable.

Emotional upset had prompted her first to reveal the incident to her ex-boyfriend, though she could not recall the date of that revelation. After a school lecture and film on the subject of sexual assault on January 8,1987, the victim had spoken about the incident to the lecturer, Cindy Howell, because she had \u201cneeded to tell somebody what happened.\u201d The victim had related the incident to Katz on the following day at a meeting attended by her mother. Thereafter, the victim had informed Dwyer of the incident in connection with counselling sessions during October of 1987. She then had described the incident to Sutherland on a date she could not remember. The victim had officially reported the incident to Miranda on October 14, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\"> Sutherland testified that on a date uncertain, the victim had told him \u201ca little story that she was raped. . . .
