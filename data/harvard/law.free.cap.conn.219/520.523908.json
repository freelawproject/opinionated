Because we conclude that the phrase also encompasses commissions earned by employees who <em>perform </em>services, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">This appeal arises from an administrative ruling by the defendant, the department of labor,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> determining that the plaintiff, Roto-Rooter Services Company, did not qualify for exemption under \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g), which provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe provisions of [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 31-76b to 31-76j, inclusive, shall not apply with respect to . . . any employee except outside salesmen (1) whose regular rate of pay is in excess of two times the minimum hourly rate applicable to him under section 31-58, (2) more than half of whose compensation for a representative period, being not less than one month, represents commissions on goods or services, and (3) who does not work more than fifty-four hours during a work week of seven consecutive calendar days. . . .\u201d The defendant\u2019s ruling was issued on the following stipulated facts. The plaintiff's employees sell the plaintiff\u2019s plumbing, drain and sewer cleaning products and services. They also perform the services sold. In response to the plaintiff\u2019s customers\u2019 service inquiries, the employees examine and determine the nature of the particular problem at the customers\u2019 premises. The employees then recommend and quote <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>a price for the products and services necessary to rectify the problem. If the customers agree to purchase the recommended products and services, the employees provide the products and perform the services. The plaintiff pays the employees a fixed dollar \u201ccommission, which varies by the product, per unit of [the plaintiffs] product purchased\u201d by the customers, and a percentage of the gross amount paid by the customers for any service performed. These payments are the sole sources of the employees\u2019 weekly income. Each employee\u2019s rate of pay, determined by dividing his or her total weekly earnings by the number of hours worked per week, exceeds twice the minimum hourly rate applicable under General Statutes \u00a7 31-58; see General Statutes \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (1); and most of the employees work less than fifty-four hours during a work week of seven consecutive calendar days. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-761 (g)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">On these facts, the defendant found that while the plaintiff\u2019s employees satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (1) and (3), more than one half of their compensation did not represent \u201ccommissions on goods or services\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2). With respect to \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2), the defendant determined that the phrase \u201ccommissions on goods or services\u201d means commission compensation earned by employees who only <em>sell </em>goods or services. Since more than one half of the commission compensation earned by the plaintiff\u2019s employees derived from their performance, rather than sale, of services, the defendant ruled that the plaintiff did not qualify for exemption under \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The plaintiff challenged the defendant\u2019s adverse ruling by seeking a declaratory judgment in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-175 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>eluding that the defendant had interpreted and applied \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) correctly, the court rendered judgment for the defendant. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court in accordance with Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the compensation that its employees earn by performing services did not constitute \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2). In the plaintiffs view, that phrase unambiguously encompasses compensation calculated on a commission basis and generated by the performance of services. The defendant contends that the exemption created by \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) is ambiguous because, unlike the duty-specific exemptions in the remaining subsections of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd, it does not expressly designate the duties an employee must undertake to earn \u201ccommissions on . . . services.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2). Drawing upon various interpretive aids, the defendant would resolve that purported ambiguity by attributing to the legislature an intent to confine the meaning of that phrase to commissions earned by employees who sell but do not perform services. We agree with the plaintiff that its employees\u2019 performance of services generates \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>The legislature\u2019s failure to impose a duty-specific limitation on the scope of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2) does not, in and of itself, render the exemption ambiguous. Because we are constrained to interpret statutory provisions as written; <em>Ghent </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>219 Conn. 511, 515, 594 A.2d 5 (1991); the clarity of legislative expression in \u00a7 31-76i (g) (2) must be determined by looking first to its language. <em>Sanzone </em>v. <em>Board of Police Commissioners, </em>219 Conn. 179, 187, 592 A.2d 912 (1991). It is not what the legislature might have said, but rather, the meaning of what it did say, that dictates the scope of the exemption. See <em>Stamford Ridgeway Associates </em>v. <em>Board of Representatives, </em>214 Conn. 407, 431, 572 A.2d 951 (1990); <em>Schurman </em>v. <em>Schurman, </em>188 Conn. 268, 273, 449 A.2d 169 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">What the legislature clearly did say in \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2) is that an employer whose employees earn \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d clears a preliminary hurdle to qualification for exemption from the overtime pay requirements of \u00a7 31-76c. In accordance with its commonly approved usage; see General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); the word \u201ccommission\u201d means \u201ca fee paid to an agent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>or employee for transacting a piece of business or <em>performing a service\u201d-, </em>(emphasis added) Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary; which fee is \u201cusually calculated as a percentage on the amount of his transactions or amount received or expended.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979). The plaintiff\u2019s employees, whose compensation is calculated as a percentage of the gross amount paid by customers for the services that they perform, undoubtedly earn \u201ccommissions\u201d within the ordinary import of that word. Absent an express statutory definition, the words of a statute must be assigned their commonly approved meaning unless their context indicates that \u00e1 different meaning was intended. <em>DuBaldo </em>v. <em>Department of Consumer Protection, </em>209 Conn. 719, 722, 552 A.2d 813 (1989); <em>see State </em>v. <em>Lubus, </em>216 Conn. 402, 407, 581 A.2d 1045 (1990); <em>State Medical Society </em>v. <em>Board of Examiners in Podiatry, </em>208 Conn. 709, 721, 546 A.2d 830 (1988).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s contrary assertion,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we find the statutory context of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2) consist<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>ent with a construction of the phrase \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d that encompasses commissions earned by employees who perform services. Particularly significant is the conspicuous absence of any express limitation of subsection (g), in marked contrast to subsections (f), (i) and (j) of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd, to any type of \u201csalesman.\u201d If the legislature had intended to confine the application of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) to employees whose duties are restricted to selling, it certainly was aware of the explicit language with which it could do so. Furthermore, in the nature of a rule stated in direct operational terms; see 1A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands 1985 Rev.) \u00a7 27.01; subdivision (3) of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) mandates: \u201cIn determining the proportion of compensation representing commissions, all earnings resulting from the application of a bona fide commission rate shall be deemed commissions on . . . services.\u201d This provision suggests that \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2) are simply earnings calculated on a commission basis, without regard to whether employees generate such earnings by selling services. Finally instructive is the reference in \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (i) to compensation \u201cpaid on a commission basis as defined in the regulations of the labor commissioner issued pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 31-60 . . . .\u2019\u2019In the only regulation so issued, the definition of \u201ccommissions\u201d is sufficiently broad to include commissions derived from the performance of services: \u201c \u2018Commissions\u2019 means any premium or incentive corn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>pensation for business transacted whether based on per centum of total valuation or specific rate per unit of accomplishment. . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 31-60-1 (a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Considering \u00a7 31-76\u00cd as a whole, therefore, we perceive no manifest legislative purpose to restrict the ordinary import of the phrase \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d in \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2) to earnings generated by employees who only sell, rather than perform, services. The trial court, accordingly, should not have read such a restriction into \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2). Since it is undisputed that the plaintiffs employees satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (1) and (3), and we hold that those employees earn \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2), the plaintiff qualifies for the exemption from \u00a7 31-76c under \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1989)] Sec. 31-76\u00cd. exceptions.

The agency shall be made a party to the action.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AVE\"> At this juncture, we note that in 1989, the legislature amended General Statutes \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) in a manner that, if the amendment were applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>retrospectively, would necessitate the resolution of the present controversy in the defendant\u2019s favor. Amended \u00a7 31-76i (g) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[A]ny inside salesperson whose sole duty is to sell a product or service (1) whose regular rate of pay is in excess of two times the minimum hourly rate applicable to him under section 31-58, (2) more than half of whose compensation for a representative period, being not less than one month, represents commissions on goods or services, and (3) who does not work more than fifty-four hours during a work week of seven consecutive calendar days. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Public Acts 1989, No. 89-24. Because the amendment to \u00a7 31-76i (g) affects the substantive obligation of employers to pay overtime compensation, and in view of the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent that the amendment shall apply retrospectively, we agree with the trial court that the amendment is not subject to retrospective application. See General Statutes \u00a7 55-3; see also <em>Miano </em>v. <em>Thorne, </em>218 Conn. 170, 175-76, 588 A.2d 189 (1991); <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>216 Conn. 523, 529, 582 A.2d 764 (1990). We therefore interpret and apply \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) in its form prior to the amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-5\"> Because we find General Statutes \u00a7 31-76i (g) unambiguous, we need not, as the defendant proposes, resort to its legislative history for guidance as to its intended scope. See <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 538, 582 A.2d 1184 (1990). We also decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to defer to the labor department\u2019s purported longstanding interpretation of the exemption, or to adopt the construction of the statute suggested by the attorney general in an unpublished opinion based on inapposite facts. See <em>Quinnipiac Council, Boy Scouts of America, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Bights &amp; Opportunities, </em>204 Conn. 287, 295, 528 A.2d 352 (1987) (agency interpretation of statute not previously subjected to judicial scrutiny not entitled to deference); <em>Connecticut Hospital Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>200 Conn. 133, 143, 509 A.2d 1050 (1986) (attorney general\u2019s opinion \u201centitled to careful consideration\u201d and \u201cgenerally regarded as highly persuasive\u201d but \u201cnot binding on a court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\"> The defendant argues that if \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2) means all earnings calculated on a commission basis, subsections (i) and (j) of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd would be rendered superfluous, a result that the legislature could not have intended. This argument overlooks the rate of pay and hours per week requirements respectively contained in \u00a7 31-76i (g) (1) and (3), with which an employer seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>exemption under subsections (i) and (j) of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd need not comply. Consequently, even if the phrase \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d were construed to mean all earnings calculated on a commission basis, subsection (g) of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd would not be coextensive with subsections (i) and (j) of the statute, and therefore, the latter subsections would not be rendered superfluous. We, in any event, have no occasion to consider whether \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d means all earnings calculated on a commission basis. The facts of this case present the narrower issue of whether such earnings, if generated by the performance of services, fall within the scope of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b550-6\"> Because the phrase \u201ccommissions on goods or services\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2) tracks the language of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207 (i), which exempts certain employers from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, our interpretation of the Connecticut exemption is aided by federal precedent respecting the meaning and scope of the analogous federal exemption. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn., </em>184 Conn. 285, 303, 439 A.2d 997 (1981). In <em>Mechmet </em>v. <em>Four Seasons Hotels, Ltd., </em>825 F.2d 1173 (7th Cir. 1987), for example, the court held that an employer whose employees earned compensation calculated on a commission basis solely by performing services satisfied the requirements of the federal exemption. Also worthy of note are certain of the federal regulations that are designed to provide \u201cguiding principles for determining whether an employee\u2019s employment and compensation meet the conditions\u201d set forth in \u00a7 207 (i). 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.410. One such regulation explicitly disclaims a sales oriented limitation on the scope of \u00a7 207 (i): \u201cAlthough typically . . . commission payments are keyed to sales, the requirement of [\u00a7 207 (i) (2)] is that more than half the employee\u2019s compensation represent commissions \u2018on goods or services,\u2019 which would include all types of commissions customarily based on the goods or services which the [employer] sells, and not exclusively those measured by \u2018sales\u2019 of these goods or services.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.413 (b). The regulations also describe \u201ca bona fide commission rate\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 207 (i) (2), a phrase likewise contained in our \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (3), as one that \u201cvar[ies] in accordance with the employee\u2019s performance on the job . . . .\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 779.416 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b550-7\"> As an alternate ground for affirmance of the judgment, the defendant contends that the plaintiff failed to satisfy its burden of proving that more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>than one half of its employees\u2019 compensation represented commissions on goods or services \u201cfor a representative period, being not less than one month.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2). We reject this contention because the defendant stipulated to the fact that the \u201csole sources of the weekly earnings\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s employees were: (1) the earnings generated by their performance of services that we hold constitute \u201ccommissions on . . . services\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2); and (2) the \u201cfixed dollar commissionjs]\u201d generated by their sale of products, which the defendant does not claim constitute other than \u201ccommissions on goods\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 31-76\u00cd (g) (2). In accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation, more than one half of the employees\u2019 compensation necessarily would represent commissions on goods or services for a representative period of <em>any </em>duration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
