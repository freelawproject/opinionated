J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1G\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether, contrary to our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>197 Conn. 219, 496 A.2d 498 (1985), article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution permits a court to determine the existence of probable cause on the basis of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d when it reviews a search warrant application based on information provided to the police by a confidential informant. The state charged the defendant, Timothy Barton, with possession of over a kilogram of marihuana with intent to sell and with possession of marihuana, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278 (b) and 21a-279 (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> respectively, after police, acting under the authority of a warrant, had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>searched his home and had seized more than fifty-pounds of marihuana there. The defendant moved to suppress the seized evidence, and the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion on the ground that the affidavit accompanying the search warrant application failed to state the informant\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge.\u201d The charges were subsequently dismissed with prejudice. With the permission of the trial court, the state appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed. <em>State </em>v. Barton, 22 Conn. App. 62, 576 A.2d 561 (1990). We granted certification to reconsider the state constitutional issue presented,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The opinion of the Appellate Court reports the relevant facts. On August 7,1988, officers of the Winsted police department, acting on the authority of a search and seizure warrant obtained that day on the basis of information provided by a confidential informant, searched the defendant\u2019s apartment in Winsted. Although the defendant was not at home when the police arrived to execute the warrant, they obtained a key from the owner of the apartment. In the course of their search, the police found some fifty-two pounds of marihuana wrapped in clear plastic bags and kept in larger garbage bags in a bedroom. When the defendant returned home after midnight, the police arrested him. Id., 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant, contending that the search and seizure violated his rights under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution and the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>amendment to the United States constitution. Both the trial court and the Appellate Court applied the two-pronged analysis mandated by this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, which requires a magistrate, in determining whether probable cause exists for a search or seizure, to evaluate both the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d and the \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d of an informant upon whose information the police have relied. See id., 233-37; see also <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969); <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964). In the circumstances of this case, both the trial court and the Appellate Court concluded that the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not adequately set forth the unnamed informant\u2019s basis of knowledge and therefore failed to establish probable cause. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 70. Both courts accordingly agreed that the evidence seized in reliance upon the warrant had to be suppressed. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In the present appeal, the state urges us to overrule our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, and to adopt the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d standard for determining probable cause used in the federal courts pursuant to the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527, reh. denied, 463 U.S. 1237, 104 S. Ct. 33, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1453 (1983). The state argues that our decision in <em>Kimbro </em>(1) did not accurately reflect either the preconstitutional law of Connecticut or the case law of this court construing article first, \u00a7 7, prior to the time when the fourth amendment to the federal constitution was made applicable to the states, and (2) needlessly constitutionalized a standard for the use of hearsay in warrant affidavits that is susceptible to rigid and inconsistent application by lower courts and that impairs legitimate law enforcement efforts. The state argues, alternatively, that the trial court and the Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>late Court were mistaken in concluding, under any standard of review, that the affidavit in this case failed to establish probable cause. We agree with the state that application of the standards mandated by <em>Kimbro </em>has resulted at times in unduly technical readings of warrant affidavits, and we reject such an inappropriate methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In deciding this question, we consider first the analysis that led the United States Supreme Court to reject the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. We next examine the constitutional basis underlying <em>Kimbro </em>to distinguish the goals we sought to achieve in retaining the <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>test in that decision from the nonconstitutional encrustations that accompanied it. Finally, we review the warrant affidavit at issue in this case to determine whether it satisfies the requirements of article first, \u00a7 7. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 235, the United States Supreme Court rejected the \u201ccomplex superstructure of evidentiary and analytical rules\u201d that had evolved from its earlier decisions in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, and <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra. As commonly cited and applied, the \u201ctwo-pronged\u201d <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test provides a method for evaluating the existence of probable cause consistent with the requirements of the fourth amendment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when a search warrant affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>is based upon information supplied to the police by a confidential informant. The issuing judge must be informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances relied on by the informant in concluding that the facts are as he claims they are, and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer seeking the warrant concluded (a) that the informant, whose identity need not be disclosed, was credible, or (b) that the information was reliable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>212 Conn. 223, 228-29, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S. Ct. 1144, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delmonaco, </em>194 Conn. 331, 338, 481 A.2d 40, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1036, 105 S. Ct. 511, 83 L. Ed. 2d 401 (1984). When the information supplied by the informant fails to satisfy the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, probable cause may still be found if the warrant application affidavit sets forth other circumstances\u2014typically independent police corroboration of certain details provided by the informant\u2014that bolster the deficiencies. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>supra, 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The <em>Gates </em>court identified two principal flaws in the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test. First, because courts and commentators had generally regarded the two prongs of the test to be entirely independent of each other, courts had struggled to formulate rules regarding what types of information and what types of corroboration might satisfy each of the prongs. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 229 n.4; see also 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 3.3 (a), pp. 612-27. Specifically, some courts had concluded that independent police investigation might corroborate the \u201creliability\u201d of the information, but could never satisfy the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong of the test, while ample \u201cself-verifying details\u201d might establish that the informant had personal knowledge of the alleged activity and thus could satisfy the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong, but could never compensate for a deficiency in the \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d prong. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>See, e.g., <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Md. App. 507, 313 A.2d 847 (1974); see also <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1959). The \u201celaborate set of legal rules\u201d that had resulted from this emphasis on the independent character of the two prongs had led courts, in many cases, to dissect warrant applications in an excessively technical manner, \u201cwith undue attention being focused on isolated issues that [could not] sensibly be divorced from the other facts presented to the magistrate.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 229, 234-35. Such a result was inconsistent with the nature of a probable cause determination, which, as the <em>Gates </em>court noted, involves a \u201c \u2018practical, nontechnical conception.\u2019 \u201d Id., 231, quoting <em>Brinegar </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 176, 69 S. Ct. 1302, 93 L. Ed. 1879, reh. denied, 338 U.S. 839, 70 S. Ct. 31, 94 L. Ed. 513 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The second principal flaw in the application of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, according to the <em>Gates </em>court, was that the test had caused reviewing courts, both at suppression hearings and at appellate levels, to test the sufficiency of warrant affidavits by de novo review. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 236. Such de novo review, in the view of the <em>Gates </em>majority, was inconsistent with the constitution\u2019s \u201cstrong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant.\u201d A reviewing court should rather determine whether the magistrate issuing the warrant had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for concluding that a search would uncover evidence of criminal activity. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In rejecting the. complex structure of rules that had evolved from <em>Aguilar </em>and <em>Spinelli, </em>however, the <em>Gates </em>court did not reject out of hand the underlying concerns that had originally been expressed in <em>Aguilar. </em>In that case, the United States Supreme Court invalidated a search warrant supported by an affidavit that stated only that the \u201c[ajffiants have received reliable information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>from a credible person,\u201d without stating any of the underlying circumstances that would support a finding of probable cause. <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 109. The <em>Aguilar </em>court ruled that such a conclusory affidavit failed to state a factual basis on which a neutral and detached magistrate could determine the existence of probable cause. Id., 113-14. In <em>Gates, </em>the court reaffirmed that the \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d and the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d inquiries formulated <em>in Aguilar </em>remain \u201chighly relevant\u201d in the determination of probable cause and should be regarded as \u201cclosely intertwined issues that may usefully illuminate the commonsense, practical question\u201d of the existence of probable cause to believe that contraband or evidence is located in a particular place. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 230. The <em>Gates </em>court abandoned only a \u201crigid compartmentalization\u201d of the inquiries and denied that the court had ever intended them to be understood as \u201centirely separate and independent requirements to be rigidly exacted in every case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In the place of the \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>test, the <em>Gates </em>court directed lower courts to apply a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis more consistent with traditional assessments of probable cause. While still employing the analytical frame of reference established in <em>Aguilar, </em>a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis permits a judge issuing a warrant greater freedom to assess \u201cthe relative weights of all the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant\u2019s tip.\u201d Id., 234. Under the analysis approved in <em>Gates, </em>\u201c[t]he task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, commonsense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Id., 238. The task of a subsequent court reviewing the magistrate\u2019s decision to issue a warrant is to determine whether the magistrate had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for concluding that probable cause existed. Id., 238-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">The court\u2019s decision in <em>Gates </em>emphasized the necessity of a case-by-case analysis of probable cause based on <em>all </em>of the facts presented to the judge issuing the warrant, not merely on those capable of categorization as indicating the \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of a particular informant. Underlying the court\u2019s emphasis on the factbound nature of the probable cause determination were two premises: first, that probable cause is a practical, commonsense determination, requiring \u201c \u2018only the probability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity\u2019 id., 235, quoting <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 419; and second, that one of the principal safeguards of the fourth amendment\u2019s warrant requirement is the interposition of a neutral and detached magistrate who is charged with exercising discretion to arrive at an informed and independent decision as to whether probable cause exists. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 239-40. Because none of these underlying propositions are in apparent conflict with our prior decisions construing Connecticut\u2019s probable cause requirement, we turn now to a reconsideration of our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We note, at the outset, that our decision in <em>Kimbro </em>did not rely upon historical analysis to determine the standard by which probable cause should be measured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>We relied, rather, upon our determination that the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, \u201cwith its two prongs of \u2018veracity' or \u2018reliability' and \u2018basis of knowledge,\u2019 offers a practical and independent test under our constitution that predictably guides the conduct of all concerned, including magistrates and law enforcement officials, in the determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, 236-37. We regarded the <em>Gates </em>\u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis as an \u201camorphous standard\u201d that inadequately safeguarded the rights of indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>viduals to be free from unjustified intrusions. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, 230-31, 237. Upon careful review of that determination, we agree with the conclusion of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Gates </em>that the two prongs of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test are highly relevant evidentiary questions that a magistrate issuing the warrant must consider in deciding whether probable cause for a search or seizure exists, but that they are not wholly independent and dispositive constitutional tests for which de novo review exists at a suppression hearing. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">In reaching our present conclusion we return to first principles. Article first, \u00a7 7, of our constitution provides: \u201cThe people shall be secure in their persons, houses, papers and possessions from unreasonable searches or seizures; and no warrant to search any place, or to seize any person or things, shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause supported by oath or affirmation.\u201d This provision, like the fourth amendment to the federal constitution that it closely resembles,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> safeguards the privacy, the personal security, and the property of the individual against unjustified intrusions by agents of the government.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">One of the principal means by which the warrant requirement protects the privacy and property of the individual is by the interposition of a neutral and detached magistrate<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> who must judge independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>the sufficiency of an affidavit supporting an application for a search warrant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether applying the fourth amendment or article first, \u00a7 7, of our own constitution,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we have frequently recognized that a magistrate issuing a warrant cannot form an independent opinion as to the existence of probable cause unless the affidavit supporting the warrant application sets forth some of the facts upon which the police have relied in concluding that a search is justified. \u201c \u2018Recital of some of the underlying circumstances in the affidavit is essential if the magistrate is to perform his detached function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>168 Conn. 623, 627, 362 A.2d 813 (1975), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109, 85 S. Ct. 741, 13 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>When a police officer seeking a search warrant relies on hearsay information supplied by confidential informants rather than on personal knowledge and observations, certain additional facts are necessary to ensure that the magistrate\u2019s decision to issue the warrant is informed and independent. The <em>Aguilar </em>test originated when the United States Supreme Court identified two additional factors that magistrates must consider in evaluating the existence of probable cause in such cases: (1) the reliability of the way in which the informant reached his conclusions about the alleged illegal activity; and (2) the circumstances from which the police concluded that the informant was credible or that the information itself was reliable. <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Although <em>Aguilar </em>spawned progeny that became noted for their technicality, the court\u2019s analysis in <em>Aguilar </em>itself was pragmatic and commonsensieal. Its unstated premise was that confidential informants<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> are themselves often \u201ccriminals, drug addicts, or even pathological liars\u201d whose motives for providing information to the police may range from offers of immunity or sentence reduction, promises of money payments, or \u201csuch perverse motives as revenge or the hope of eliminating criminal competition.\u201d M. Rebell, \u201cThe Undisclosed Informant and the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Amendment: A Search for Meaningful Standards,\u201d 81 Yale L.J. 703, 712-13 (1972); see also 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 3.3, p. 611. Because such an informant\u2019s reliance on rumors circulating on the street is not unlikely and the veracity of such an informant is questionable, a magistrate reviewing a search warrant application based on such an informant\u2019s word can best assess the probable reliability of the information if she or he is informed of some of the predicate facts that indicate <em>how </em>the informant gained his information and <em>why </em>the police officer believes that the information is reliable in order to decide, independently, whether the police officer\u2019s inferences from the informant\u2019s statements are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In <em>Kimbro, </em>we expressed concern that the \u201cfluid\u201d \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis approved in the fourth amendment context of <em>Illinois </em>v. Gates, supra, would inadequately inform magistrates and law enforcement officials of their obligation to scrutinize the information gathered from confidential police informants with appropriate caution. <em>State </em>v. Kimbro, supra, 233-38. In construing article first, \u00a7 7, of our constitution to require continued application of the <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>test, we sought to make clear certain benchmarks to guide the discretion of our judges in reviewing ex parte applications for search and seizure warrants based on confidential informants\u2019 tips.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Nonetheless, over time, the case law applying the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test has come to be encrusted with an overlay of analytical rigidity that is inconsistent with the underlying proposition that it is the constitutional function of the magistrate issuing the warrant to exercise discretion in the determination of probable cause. That discretion must be controlled by constitutional principles and guided by the evidentiary standards developed in our prior cases, but it should not be so shackled by rigid analytical standards that it deprives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>the magistrate of the ability to draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented. To the extent that <em>Kimbro </em>stands for the proposition that the exercise of discretion by a magistrate is reviewable only according to fixed analytical standards, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Our adoption of a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis does not mean, however, that a magistrate considering a search warrant application should automatically defer to the conclusion of the police that probable cause exists. Such deference would be an abdication of the magistrate\u2019s constitutional responsibility to exercise an independent and detached judgment to protect the rights of privacy and personal security of the people of Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">In essence, our adoption of a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis of the probable cause requirement of article first, \u00a7 7, of our constitution means simply this: When a search warrant affidavit is based on information provided to the police by confidential informants, the magistrate should examine the affidavit to determine whether it adequately describes both the factual basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge and the basis on which the police have determined that the information is reliable. If the warrant affidavit fails to state in specific terms how the informant gained his knowledge or why the police believe the information to be trustworthy, however, the magistrate can also consider all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit to determine whether, despite these deficiencies, other objective indicia of reliability reasonably establish that probable cause to search exists. In making this determination, the magistrate is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented. When a magistrate has determined that the warrant affidavit presents sufficient objective indicia of reliability to justify a search and has issued a warrant, a court reviewing that warrant at a subsequent suppression hearing should defer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>to the reasonable inferences drawn by the magistrate. Where the circumstances for finding probable cause are detailed, where a substantial basis for crediting the source of information is apparent, and when a magistrate has in fact found probable cause, the reviewing court should not invalidate the warrant by application of rigid analytical categories. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>supra, 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">In adopting the <em>Gates </em>\u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis, as we have here construed it, as the standard of analysis applicable to article first, \u00a7 7, of our constitution, we do not intend to dilute the constitutional safeguards of the warrant requirement. This court has both the constitutional duty to construe article first, \u00a7 7, in a way that adequately protects the rights of individuals in Connecticut and also the supervisory responsibility, as the overseer of the judiciary in Connecticut, to ensure that the standards adopted here require law enforcement officers to provide magistrates with adequate information on which to base their decisions in an ex parte context. If a warrant affidavit does not provide a substantial basis for the finding of probable cause, then evidence or contraband seized in the execution of that warrant will be suppressed, even when the officer executing the warrant has relied in good faith on its authority. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 171, 579 A.2d 58 (1990). In rejecting a good faith exception to cure errors in warrants, we expressly focused on the importance attached in this state to providing reliable and probative information to Superior Court judges, who are the only persons authorized to issue warrants in this state. Id., 169-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Our adoption here of federal constitutional precedents that usefully illuminate the open textured provisions of our own organic document in no way compromises our obligation independently to construe the provisions of our state constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>216 Conn. 172, 184, 579 A.2d 484 (1990). As we have observed in the past, federal constitutional and statutory law \u201cestablishes a <em>minimum </em>national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984). In particular circumstances, therefore, and with regard to particular provisions of our own constitution, we have concluded that our constitution provides more substantive protection of individual rights than does its federal counterpart. <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 160. Respect for settled interpretations of the organic law of our own state, moreover, requires that we examine changes in the interpretation of federal constitutional provisions to determine whether they are consistent with the history and policy concerns of analogous Connecticut constitutional provisions before adopting such changes as a matter of state constitutional law. In this case we conclude, upon careful reconsideration, that the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis adopted in <em>Gates </em>will continue to guarantee the people of Connecticut \u201cthe full panoply of rights\u201d that they have come to expect as their due. Id.; <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 642, 376 A.2d 359 (1977). We accordingly depart from the more rigid analytical structure imposed in <em>Kimbro </em>in order to restore the proper constitutional authority of magistrates to weigh the sufficiency of the information presented to them in warrant affidavits and to balance the legitimate needs of law enforcement officers against the highly prized rights of privacy and personal security afforded by our constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">We now consider the affidavit presented in this case in light of the proper constitutional standards. The Winsted police presented the warrant application for ex parte judicial approval on August 7,1988. The affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>davit attached to the application stated that the police had received the relevant information from an informant earlier on the same day. The affidavit consisted of five paragraphs,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> four of which have little significance for the determination of probable cause in this case. The first two paragraphs recite the training and experience of the affiants, two Winsted police officers. The fourth paragraph identifies the owners of the property that was the subject of the search, and the fifth paragraph requests that the court issue the warrant on the basis of the information provided. As both the trial court and the Appellate Court concluded, the third paragraph is the only basis upon which probable cause could have been established. <em>State </em>v. Barton, supra, 65-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">That paragraph provides: \u201c \u2018That the affiants state on Sunday, August 7, 1988 Sgt. Gerald O. Peters received information from a confidential informant at police headquarters pertaining to Tim Barton who resides at 232 Perch Rock Trail, Winsted, Connecticut, first floor that Barton has in his apartment a large quantity of marijuana in plastic garbage bags, which are kept in a closet. That the informant also provided Sergeant Peters of [sic] a sample of the marijuana that is in the bags. A field test of the marijuana substance that was provided to Sgt. Peters was field tested and the test results was [sic] positive for cannibas [sic] substance. The informant further stated that Tim Barton operates a Texas registered vehicle and after being away for approximately one week Barton returned home on Saturday, August 6,1988 and unloaded several large plastic bags in the evening hours. The informant further stated that shortly after that four to five people arrived at the Barton apartment and stayed a short while and then left with plastic garbage bags.\u2019 \u201d Id., 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Probable cause, broadly defined, comprises such facts \u201cas would reasonably persuade an impartial and reasonable mind not merely to suspect or conjecture, but to believe\u201d that criminal activity has occurred. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>12 Conn. 218, 230, 30 A. 611 (1837); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Middleton, </em>170 Conn. 601, 604, 368 A.2d 66 (1976). Probable cause to search exists if: (1) there is probable cause to believe that the particular items sought to be seized are connected with criminal activity; and (2) there is probable cause to believe that the items named will be found in the place to be searched. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflet, </em>199 Conn. 718, 745-46,-508 A.2d 748 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 528-29, 427 A.2d 1338 (1980). Unless the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that the affiant knowingly and intentionally or recklessly included a false statement in the warrant affidavit; see <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978); a reviewing court can consider only the information that was actually in the warrant affidavit presented to a judge issuing a warrant at the time that he or she signed the warrant. <em>State </em>v. <em>Shifflet, </em>supra, 746; see <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 109 n.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Reviewing the allegations set forth in the third paragraph of the affidavit in this case, the Appellate Court concluded that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause because it was defective under the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test mandated by <em>Kimbro. </em>The Appellate Court cited the following deficiencies: (1) the affidavit did not expressly indicate that the informant had ever been inside the defendant\u2019s apartment; (2) the details regarding the truck and the carrying in and out of garbage bags were \u201cinnocuous\u201d; (3) the affidavit did not indicate that the informant had said that he had purchased the marihuana from the defendant, or that he had observed the defendant \u201cconstantly in possession\u201d of marihuana in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>the apartment; and (4) the informant did not give a detailed description of the apartment but merely alleged that the garbage bags were in a closet. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 68-70. We agree that the affidavit does not expressly state that the informant had personal knowledge of the facts described. Legitimate law enforcement efforts, however, should not be unduly frustrated because a police officer, in the haste of a criminal investigation, fails to recite his information in particular formulaic phrases. Probable cause does not depend upon the incantation of certain magic words. Having reviewed the circumstances described by the informant, we conclude that the affidavit provided a substantial basis for the magistrate\u2019s inference that the informant was reporting events that he had personally observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">This inference could reasonably be drawn from the following facts. First, the affidavit reported that the informant provided the police with a sample of marihuana that had come from the garbage bags. Although that fact alone might not support an inference that the informant had personally seen the bags, other details in the affidavit do provide a basis for such an inference. The informant said that the defendant had been out of town for about a week and had returned the previous night, in a truck with a Texas registration, with several large plastic garbage bags, and that shortly after the defendant\u2019s arrival four or five other individuals had come to the defendant\u2019s apartment and had left soon afterwards with plastic garbage bags. These details, if credited, support an inference that the informant was sufficiently acquainted with the defendant to have known of a week-long absence and to have been present to observe the defendant\u2019s activities upon his return. When considered together with the detail that the garbage bags were kept in a closet and with the fact that the informant provided the police with a mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>ihuana sample purportedly from the same bags, these ' details support a reasonable, commonsense inference that the informant had personally observed the events he reported and had secured the marihuana sample directly from the defendant at his apartment. The affidavit did not merely state that an informant had reason to believe that marihuana could be found at the defendant\u2019s apartment; rather, it provided \u201csome of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were.\u201d <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra, 114. Although the magistrate could have properly exercised his discretion to reject the warrant application or to require the affiants to supplement it or corroborate some of its details; see <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 240; we conclude that the inference drawn by the magistrate that the informant had firsthand knowledge of the defendant\u2019s activities was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Because the Appellate Court invalidated the warrant for its failure to state expressly the basis of the informant\u2019s knowledge, it did not proceed to consider the question of the informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 70. The trial court, however, concluded that the informant\u2019s veracity was adequately established because the act of providing a sample of the marihuana to the police was a \u201cdeclaration against his penal interest.\u201d We agree that the affidavit provided a substantial basis for the magistrate\u2019s inference that the informant\u2019s information was reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The first circumstance supporting an inference of \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d is the fact that the informant was not anonymous. The affidavit states that the informant provided his statement in person at police headquarters. Because his identity was known to the police, the informant could expect adverse consequences if the information that he provided was erroneous. Those consequences might range from a loss of confidence or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>indulgence by the police to prosecution for the class A misdemeanor of falsely reporting an incident under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-180, had the information supplied proved to be a fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">More significantly, however, the informant supplied the police with a sample of a substance that the police tested and confirmed to be marihuana. By entering the police station with the marihuana in his possession and by exhibiting the marihuana to the police, the informant rendered himself liable to arrest, conviction, and imprisonment under General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279. \u201cPeople do not lightly admit a crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their own admissions. Admissions of crime, like admissions against proprietary interests, carry their own indicia of credibility\u2014sufficient at least to support a finding of probable cause to search.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 583, 91 S. Ct. 2075, 29 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1971); <em>State </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>189 Conn. 717, 721-24, 458 A.2d 1147 (1983). Although the informant\u2019s motive may be no loftier than the hope of leniency on other charges or the promise of a payment, courts have thought \u201cthat one who knows the police are already in a position to charge him with a serious crime will not lightly undertake to divert the police down blind alleys.\u201d 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (2d Ed. 1987) \u00a7 3.3 (c), p. 649. In the present case, the informant did more than make an incriminating admission that might or might not support a subsequent conviction; here he actually provided the physical evidence of his illegal possession to the police. Although the warrant application would have unquestionably been stronger if the affiants had bolstered the reliability of the informant by independently corroborating some of the details he reported; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>supra, 229-31; <em>State </em>v. <em>Daley, </em>supra; we conclude that the affidavit sufficiently set forth \u201csome of the underlying circumstances\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>which the police could have concluded that the informant was credible or that his information was reliable. <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">As our discussion of this affidavit demonstrates, the determination of an informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d or \u201creliability\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d remains highly relevant under the constitutional standard announced in this decision. As a matter of state constitutional law under article first, \u00a7 7, the task of the magistrate issuing the warrant is to make a practical, nontechnical decision whether there is a fair probability of finding contraband or evidence of a crime in a particular place. In coming to that decision, the magistrate must consider all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, including the factual circumstances from which the \u201cveracity\u201d and the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d of persons supplying hearsay information can be determined. A reviewing court, in turn, must determine that the affidavit presented a substantial factual basis upon which the magistrate could conclude that probable cause existed. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 238-39; see also <em>Alabama </em>v. <em>White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 328-29, 110 S. Ct. 2412, 110 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1990) (discussing the continuing relevance of \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d inquiries when relying on informants\u2019 tips). \u201cAlthough in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>supra. This is a marginal case; the magistrate could reasonably have demanded more information. We will not invalidate a warrant, however, merely because we might, in the first instance, have reasonably declined to draw the inferences that were necessary here. Having reviewed all the circumstances presented to the magistrate in this affidavit, we conclude that the affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>davit provided a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the Appellate Court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In this opinion Shea, Callahan, Covello, Borden and Santaniello, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marihuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years.

Ed. 1782 (1949), provides: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b560-9\"> The state correctly argues in this appeal that the sparse preconstitutional and early constitutional history of article first, \u00a7 7, would not support the conclusion that our state constitution mandated a stricter standard for the determination of probable cause than did the federal constitution. Although cases decided as matters of common law prior to the adoption of the state\u2019s first postrevolutionary constitution indicate that independent magisterial review was required before a search warrant could issue; see <em>Frisbie </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>Butler, </em>Kirby 213 (1787), and <em>Grumon </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>1 Conn. 40 (1814); no state statutory or constitutional provision requiring the existence of probable cause for the issuance of warrants existed until Connecticut\u2019s citizens adopted the constitution of 1818. See C. Collier, \u201cThe Connecticut Declaration of Rights before the Constitution of 1818: A Victim of Revolutionary Redefinition,\u201d 15 Conn. L. Rev. 87, 93 n.19 (1982). The declaration of rights adopted in 1818 appears to have its antecedents in the Mississippi constitution of 1817, which in turn derived from the federal bill of rights and the Virginia declaration of rights of 1776. Id., 96-97 n.30. The search and seizure provision in our 1818 constitution, then article first, \u00a7 8, closely resembles the fourth amendment to the United States constitution. Although its enumeration was changed to article first, \u00a7 7, when the 1965 constitution incorporated article first, \u00a7 4, into article seventh, its language has not been altered since its original adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">This court seldom had occasion to construe the search and seizure provision of our constitution prior to the mid-twentieth century. In 1862, this court considered whether then article first, \u00a7 8, required an affiant to inform the magistrate issuing the warrant of the underlying facts and circumstances upon which the affiant had concluded that probable cause exists. See <em>Lowrey </em>v. <em>Gridley, </em>30 Conn. 450 (1862). This court determined that an affiant\u2019s oath that he had \u201creason to believe\u201d probable cause existed was sufficient to satisfy our constitution\u2019s probable cause requirement, even when the affiant was a prosecutor relying upon \u201ca secret and confidential communication\u201d from an alleged accomplice. Id., 457-59. Federal courts, in contrast, appear to have required a statement of the circumstances giving rise to the belief that probable cause existed in order to determine the sufficiency of the affidavits. See, e.g., <em>Locke </em>v. <em>United States, </em>11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 339 (1813). In 1933, the United States Supreme Court, relying on the assumptions of prior federal cases such as <em>Locke, </em>expressly ruled that the fourth amendment to the federal constitution requires such a statement of underlying circumstances in order to satisfy the magistrate issuing the warrant that probable cause for a search and seizure exists. <em>Nathanson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>290 U.S. 41, 47, 54 S. Ct. 11, 78 L. Ed. 159 (1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\"> See footnote 3, supra, for the text of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> Justice Story noted that the fourth amendment to the federal constitution \u201cseems indispensable to the full enjoyment of the rights of personal security, personal liberty, and private property.

In Connecticut, unlike many jurisdictions, only judges of the Superior Court are authorized to issue warrants. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b563-6\"> Our earliest recorded cases involving search warrants indicate the importance we have long attached to the interposition of a neutral magistrate between the citizen and the law enforcement officer who desires to search his property or his person. In <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>Kirby 213, 215 (1787), the court observed that \u201cit is the duty of a justice of the peace granting a search warrant (in doing which he acts judicially) to limit the search to such particular place or places, as he, from the circumstances, shall judge there is reason to suspect . . . . \u201d At common law, both the judge who issued a defective or insufficiently limited warrant and the officer who executed it could be held liable in trespass to the person whose property was searched. <em>Grumon </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>1 Conn. 40, 47-48 (1814). As <em>Grwmon </em>indicates, a judge who attempted to issue a valid warrant but erred through some oversight or mistake would not be liable for trespass, but a judge who issued an overbroad warrant enjoyed no immunity. From this common law distinction we can infer that magistrates were expected to consider the precise factual situation described to them and independently to limit the search in accordance with the purposes that they deemed to be lawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\"> It is true that more than one century ago this court concluded that a magistrate could issue a warrant on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s oath that he had reason to suspect criminal activity, without a statement of the underlying circumstances on which his suspicion was founded. <em>Lowrey </em>v. <em>Gridley, </em>30 Conn. 450, 457 (1862). In this century, however, we have rejected such conclusory affidavits under both the state and federal constitutions. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Heinz, </em>193 Conn. 612, 617, 480 A.2d 452 (1984). In <em>Heinz, </em>we regarded the fourth amendment and article first, \u00a7 7, as equally requiring that the warrant application set forth some of the facts on which the affiant relied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b564-7\"> Although anyone who gives information to the police in confidence might be called a \u201cconfidential informant,\u201d the term is usually employed in a more restricted sense to describe a person who is himself in the underworld, so that he is particularly well placed to know its secrets. Courts have properly distinguished between such \u201cconfidential informants\u201d and the average citizen who, as a victim or a witness, happens to have information useful to the police. Such \u201ccitizen informers\u201d are considered more deserving of credibility than are underworld informers, and courts have accordingly tended to examine the basis and sufficiency of a citizen informer\u2019s information more closely than his credibility. 1 W.

Uncontrolled search and seizure is one of the first and most effective weapons in the arsenal of every arbitrary government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 274-75, (Brennan, J., dissenting). After today\u2019s toppling of the analytical framework of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, the principles of which the majority deems procedural encrustations that unduly inhibit a magistrate\u2019s \u201cdiscretion in the determination of probable cause,\u201d just what remains to control that discretion, or for that matter, to guide the conduct of the warrant seeking police? Such actors, unfettered by meaningful standards by which to discharge their respective functions in the war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>rant process, are now granted the unbridled play to accord weight to their subjective preferences in determining the \u201ccircumstances\u201d whose \u201ctotality\u201d permissibly adds up to probable cause. See Y. Kamisar, <em>\u201cGates, </em>\u2018Probable Cause,\u2019 \u2018Good Faith,\u2019 and Beyond,\u201d 69 Iowa L. Rev. 551, 571 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\u201c [Consisting largely of an exhortation to use common sense,\u201d the <em>Gates </em>approach thus \u201cenhances the risk that probable cause determinations will be grounded more upon the predilections of the decision-maker and less upon established principles of law . . . . \u201d W. LaFave, \u201cFourth Amendment Vagaries (Of Improbable Cause, Imperceptible Plain View, Notorious Privacy, and Balancing Askew),\u201d 74 J. Crim. L. &amp; Criminology 1171, 1190 (1983). That risk is not perceptibly diminished by the \u201creasonably\u201d established by \u201cother objective indicia of reliability\u201d standard that the majority would apply where a warrant proves deficient under both prongs of the remains of <em>AguilarSpinelli. </em>Absent ascertainable guidelines, what \u201cother\u201d \u201cindicia\u201d objectively display the requisite magnitude of reliability to \u201creasonably\u201d establish probable cause depends on the eye of the beholder, whether a police officer, a magistrate or a reviewing court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">For the above reasons, I consider the <em>Gates </em>approach to warrant sufficiency a poor substitute for the principled guidelines of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test found in <em>Kimbro </em>to be rooted in the Connecticut constitution. The <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test, in my opinion, allows ample room for the application of common sense and the evaluation of the unique facts presented by particular cases. I do not, therefore, share the majority\u2019s desire to strip probable cause determinations of the \u201cfixed, analyti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>cal standards\u201d <em>o\u00ed Aguilar-Spinelli </em>that have served to protect the free men and women of Connecticut from unreasonable government intrusion in a way that the standardless <em>Gates </em>approach, I submit, will never do. As this court recognized in <em>Kimbro, </em>we, as the court of last resort in this sovereign state, are not bound to contract the contours of our state constitution to mirror the United States Supreme Court\u2019s increasingly restrictive perception of the scope of the individual liberties guaranteed by the federal constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kimbro, </em>supra, 234 n.16. We refused to do so in Kimbro.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In my view, the Connecticut constitution is not a document so fragile that a swift stroke of the federal pen suffices, as is allowed today, to erode the substantive protections found not six years ago to be afforded thereunder to the citizens of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">Accordingly, I concur in the result reached by the majority, but respectfully dissent in the majority\u2019s overruling of <em>Kimbro </em>in the course of reaching that result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-10\"> Considering the marihuana sample and the information contained in the affidavit, as well as the reasonable inferences, as set forth in part II of the majority opinion, that can be drawn therefrom, I conclude that the warrant exhibits adequate information independently to demonstrate the informant\u2019s \u201cveracity\u201d and \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d as required by the <em>AguilarSpinelli </em>test for determining probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\"> See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 373, 476 N.E.2d 548 (1985) (rejecting the \u201c \u2018unacceptably shapeless and permissive\u2019 \u201d <em>Gates </em>approach and retaining the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>test on state constitutional grounds); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>102 Wash. 432, 435, 688 P.2d 136 (1984) (retaining <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>under the Washington constitution in lieu of the \u201cnebulous\u201d <em>Gates </em>approach).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-9\"> It is worth noting that experts in the search and seizure field have decried as untenable the string of propositions forming the foundation of the majority opinion in <em>Gates.
