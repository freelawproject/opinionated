App. 642, 583 A.2d 1303 (1990), we consider whether a defendant can be found voluntarily to have waived the right of presence at an ongoing court proceeding upon a failure to appear in court without explanation other than the fact that, in the twenty-one day interim resulting from a continuance granted by the court at the defendant\u2019s request, the defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced and incarcerated on an unrelated charge in a foreign state. We conclude that out-of-state incarceration, alone, does not preclude a trial court from inferring such a defendant\u2019s voluntary waiver from the totality of the circumstances. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">In January, 1989, following his conviction of the crime of possession of narcotics, the defendant, Timothy James Durkin, was sentenced to a term of five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>imprisonment, execution suspended, with three years probation. The conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation included the special condition that he remain \u201cdrug free,\u201d and the standard condition that he obtain permission from his probation officer before leaving Connecticut. Despite his written acknowledgment that he understood these conditions, subsequent drug tests revealed that the defendant had used cocaine on four occasions between March and May, 1989. The defendant thereafter was arrested pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was charged with violating his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>probation by failing to remain \u201cdrug free.\u201d The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge and was released on a written promise to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On September 20, 1989, the defendant appeared before the trial court for the commencement of his violation of probation hearing. After the state presented its entire case and rested, the defendant requested and was granted a continuance until October 11, 1989, on which date, defense counsel stated, the defense would present its case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the October 11,1989 hearing, however, the defendant did not appear in court. Defense counsel explained that at some point between the hearings, the defendant had been sentenced and incarcerated on an unrelated charge in either North or South Carolina. While professing a lack of knowledge as to the precise circumstances prompting the defendant\u2019s absence and incarceration, defense counsel indicated that he intended to assist the defendant in preparing a request to return voluntarily to Connecticut under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD); see General Statutes \u00a7 54-186; for the purpose of answering an unrelated felony charge then pending in Connecticut. Defense counsel then proposed that the revocation proceeding be continued until the defendant\u2019s return. Expressing its belief that the IAD did not apply to the revocation proceeding because it already had commenced and thus was not a \u201cpending\u201d matter, the trial court ordered a continuance until October 18,1989, to permit the parties to research applicable law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>At the October 18,1989 hearing, the defendant again failed to appear in court. Defense counsel notified the trial court that the sentencing and incarceration of the defendant had occurred in South Carolina, and further indicated that he did not believe that the defendant had \u201cintended when he went down to South Carolina to end up going to prison, and I don\u2019t know exactly what did happen.\u201d Finding the explanation provided for the defendant\u2019s absence to be both unsubstantiated and insufficient, the trial court determined that his absence was a consequence of his voluntary act of leaving Connecticut \u201cto meet whatever he felt to be his responsibilities\u201d in South Carolina. The trial court then granted the state\u2019s request to proceed in the defendant\u2019s absence and found him in violation of the terms of his probation on the basis of the evidence introduced by the state. As a consequence, the trial court terminated the defendant\u2019s probation, opened the original judgment, and reimposed the original sentence of five years imprisonment. The trial court nonetheless granted defense counsel\u2019s request for a continuance until November 20, 1989, to obtain a certified copy of the defendant\u2019s South Carolina conviction. Although refusing to vacate its orders, the trial court informed defense counsel that if, at the subsequent hearing, he \u201ccan persuade the court to modify [or] change . . . orders, fine. I have no problems with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pAEg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>At the November 20,1989 hearing, defense counsel produced a certified copy of the South Carolina conviction indicating that on September 26,1986, less than one week after the commencement of the Connecticut revocation proceeding, the defendant had pleaded guilty to a South Carolina charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and that he had been sentenced to a term of five years imprisonment. The document also bore a South Carolina judge\u2019s handwritten notation of the following \u201cspecial condition\u201d: \u201cI would like this sentence to be concurrent with any revocation in Connecticut if possible.\u201d Upon examination of the document, the trial court found that its contents lent additional support to its prior determination that the defendant had \u201cacted on his own to leave the jurisdiction of this state, and do whatever he considered himself doing, and therefore his absence here was of his own volition.\u201d The trial court further inferred from the presiding judge\u2019s notation respecting a \u201crevocation in Connecticut\u201d that the defendant had \u201cleft this jurisdiction . . . knowing he had . . . the revocation of probation here. And, then told the authorities in the State of South Carolina about it\u2014how else would they know.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Over defense counsel\u2019s assertion that the defendant\u2019s \u201cinvoluntary\u201d detention in South Carolina prohibited the court from acting in the defendant\u2019s absence, the trial court terminated the proceeding, thus leaving its judgment revoking the defendant\u2019s probation undisturbed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of revocation of probation to the Appellate Court. Conclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ing that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the defendant voluntarily had waived his right of presence at the revocation proceeding, the Appellate Court reversed the judgment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>supra. We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following question: \u201cDid the Appellate Court correctly conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it found that the defendant was voluntarily absent from his probation revocation hearing?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>217 Conn. 808, 584 A.2d 1192 (1991). We answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution requires that certain minimum procedural safeguards be observed in the process of revoking the conditional liberty created by probation. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 610, 105 S. Ct. 2254, 85 L. Ed. 2d 636 (1985); <em>see Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972). Among other things, due process entitles a probationer to a final revocation hearing under the conditions set forth in <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>supra, which include an <em>\u201copportunity </em>to be heard <em>in person </em>and to present witnesses and documentary evidence . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.; see <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S. Ct. 1756, 36 L. Ed. 2d 656 (1973); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Roberson, </em>165 Conn. 73, 81-82, 327 A.2d 556 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>38 Conn. Sup. 472, 474-75, 451 A.2d 583 (1982); see generally General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since our courts are vested with the discretion to order a continuation of probation in lieu of a revocation; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b);<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> see Practice Book \u00a7 943; a probationer must be afforded the opportunity at such a hearing to demonstrate \u201cnot only that he did not violate the conditions [of proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>tion], but also that there was a justifiable excuse for any violation or that revocation is not the appropriate disposition.\u201d <em>Black v. Romano, </em>supra, 612; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>899 F.2d 189, 194 (2d Cir. 1990). These procedural safeguards protect the probationer \u201cagainst revocation of probation in a constitutionally unfair manner.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>supra, 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Nonetheless, like the constitutional right of presence at a criminal trial,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a probationer\u2019s due process rights in a final revocation proceeding may knowingly and voluntarily be waived. See <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>216 Conn. 678, 694, 583 A.2d 1277 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>200 Conn. 113, 128-29, 509 A.2d 1039 (1986). Waiver need not be express, but rather, may be implied from the totality of the circumstances, including the probationer\u2019s conduct. <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>202 Conn. 75, 79, 519 A.2d 1194 (1987). If unaccompanied by a justification in the nature of \u201c \u2018good cause\u2019 \u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>205 Conn. 673, 688, 535 A.2d 345 (1987); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>790 F.2d 245, 249 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 989, 107 S. Ct. 584, 93 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1986); a probationer\u2019s voluntary absence from a known, ongoing revocation proceeding \u201c \u2018operates as a waiver\u2019 \u201d of his rights therein, and \u201c \u2018leaves the court free to proceed ... in a like manner and with like effect as if he were present.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>414 U.S. 17, 19, 94 S. Ct. 194, 38 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1973); see Practice Book \u00a7 968; cf. <em>Tait\u00f3n </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>171 Conn. 378, 386, 370 A.2d 965 (1976). A trial court\u2019s determination of waiver will not be disturbed except for an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em>supra, 132; see <em>Talton </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>In concluding that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the defendant voluntarily had waived his due process right of presence at the revocation proceeding, the Appellate Court viewed certain dictum in <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>223 U.S. 442, 32 S. Ct. 250, 56 L. Ed. 500 (1912), as answering \u201cin the negative\u201d the question \u201cwhether a defendant in custody in another state can be deemed to have waived his right to be present.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 649. The Appellate Court also drew support from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fontanez, </em>878 F.2d 33 (2d Cir. 1989), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crutcher, </em>405 F.2d 239 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 908, 89 S. Ct. 1018, 22 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1969), which, in the Appellate Court\u2019s view, stood for the proposition that voluntary waiver cannot be inferred \u201cwhen a defendant was absent due to a subsequent arrest on an unrelated matter.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>supra, 23 Conn. App. 649. On the basis of these precedents, the Appellate Court determined that the defendant had satisfied his burden to justify his absence from the known revocation proceeding when the \u201cdefendant\u2019s counsel offered the fact that his client was incarcerated in another state.\u201d Id., 650. Finding the record \u201c \u2018silent\u2019 \u201d but for that fact, the Appellate Court held that \u201cthe trial court was incorrect in finding that the defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present at the violation of probation hearing.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The state attacks the Appellate Court\u2019s focus on the defendant\u2019s incarceration to the exclusion of the totality of the circumstances from which, the state contends, the trial court reasonably inferred the defendant\u2019s voluntary waiver. According to the state, the circumstances supporting the trial court\u2019s determination include defense counsel\u2019s representation that the defendant \u201cwent down\u201d to South Carolina despite his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>knowledge of the date, time and place that the revocation hearing had been scheduled to continue, the undisputed fact that the defendant\u2019s departure from this state was unauthorized by his probation officer in contravention of a standard condition of his probation, and the lack of evidence demonstrating that either the defendant\u2019s initial absence or his subsequent incarceration was officially compelled or otherwise involuntary. The state argues that because it was the defendant\u2019s burden to justify his absence, the Appellate Court should not have construed any silence in the record in his favor. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 455, the United States Supreme Court commented, in dicta, that courts \u201chave regarded an accused who is in custody ... as incapable of waiving the right\u201d of presence. The court\u2019s underlying rationale was that when in custody, a defendant\u2019s \u201cpresence or absence is not within his own control . . . .\u201d Id. While the fact of a defendant\u2019s custody undoubtedly supplies a sufficient predicate for an Inference of involuntary absence in accordance with the <em>Diaz </em>rationale, we do not read <em>Diaz </em>as mandating such an inference where the surrounding circumstances not only suggest the inapplicability of that rationale, but also support a reasonable inference to the contrary. \u201cThe issue of voluntariness is a question of fact which should not be resolved by per se formulations.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Epps, </em>37 N.Y.2d 343, 350, 334 N.E.2d 556, 372 N.Y.S.2d 606, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 999, 96 S. Ct. 430, 46 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1975); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fontanez, </em>supra, 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Furthermore, \u201c[wjhatever force was once exerted by the dictum that a defendant in custody does not have the power to waive his right to be present at his trial, see <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[supra]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crutcher, </em>supra . . . 243, has been diminished by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 90 S. Ct. 1057, 25 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1970), which held that a defendant who persistently behaves disraptively at his trial may lose his right to be present.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>595 F.2d 101, 104 n.3 (2d Cir. 1979). A defendant in custody who deliberately elects to remain in a jail cell despite the extension of a known opportunity to attend trial likewise may effectively waive the right of presence. Id.; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Epps, </em>supra; see also <em>Broecker </em>v. <em>State, </em>168 Ind. App. 231, 237, 342 N.E.2d 886 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kasper, </em>152 Vt. 435, 440, 566 A.2d 982 (1989); cf. <em>Sekou </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 698. Where, as in these situations, the circumstances give rise to a reasonable inference that a defendant\u2019s presence or absence at a known proceeding was \u201cwithin his [or her] own control\u201d; <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra; a trial court is not precluded from inferring that despite the fact of custody, the defendant waived the right of presence voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances before the trial court in this case,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we cannot agree with the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the defendant voluntarily had waived his due process rights in the revoca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>tion proceeding. The defendant, at liberty on a written promise to appear, was obliged to attend the revocation proceeding on the date that he knew it had been scheduled to continue. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tortora, </em>464 F.2d 1202, 1208 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Santoro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 1063, 93 S. Ct. 554, 34 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1972). The only proffered explanation for his failure to do so was that he \u201cwent down\u201d to South Carolina to tend to a criminal matter, an act that ultimately led to his guilty plea, conviction and incarceration there. Because the defendant was bound by the standard condition of his probation to obtain permission before leaving Connecticut, his unauthorized departure alone evinced a defiance of the laws of this state and a disregard for his responsibilities here. Even after indicating that he had spoken to the defendant\u2019s South Carolina attorney, defense counsel never suggested to the court that either the defendant\u2019s departure or his apparent election to submit to the South Carolina authorities rather than the jurisdiction of a Connecticut court was the product of \u201cofficial connivance or obstruction\u201d; <em>People </em>v. <em>Epps, </em>supra; or otherwise resulted from anything but the defendant\u2019s free, uncompelled choice. Compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fontanez, </em>supra, 36 (defendant\u2019s absence \u201ca direct result of being <em>taken </em>into police custody in connection with a crime unrelated to trial [emphasis added]); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crutcher, </em>supra, 242 (defendant \u201carrested by State authorities ... on charges unrelated to this proceeding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Finally, the trial court was not required to afford the defendant the benefit of his failure to provide an adequate explanation for his absence. The defendant\u2019s absence from the known revocation proceeding cast the burden on him to demonstrate that his absence was in some fashion justified by \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Simino, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>supra; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>supra, 249. In view of the defendant\u2019s failure to do so, and in light of the totality of the circumstances before the trial court, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly determined that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the defendant voluntarily had waived his due process rights in the probation revocation proceeding.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-32. violation of probation OR CONDITIONAL discharge: arrest; procedure, (a) At any time during the period of probation or conditional discharge, the court or any judge thereof may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant for violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge, or may issue a notice to appear to answer to a charge of such violation, which notice shall be personally served upon the defendant. Any such warrant shall authorize all officers named therein to return the defendant to the custody of the court or to any suitable detention facility designated by the court. Any probation officer may arrest any defendant on probation without a warrant or may deputize any other officer with power to arrest to do so by giving him a written statement setting forth that the defendant has, in the judgment of the probation officer, violated the conditions of his probation. Such written statement, delivered with the defendant by the arresting officer to the official in charge of any correctional center or other place of detention, shall be sufficient warrant for the detention of the defendant. After making such an arrest, such probation officer shall present to the detaining authorities a similar statement of the circumstances of violation. Provisions regarding release on bail of persons charged with a crime shall be applicable to any defendant arrested under the provisions of this section. Upon such arrest and detention, the probation officer shall immediately so notify the court or any judge thereof. Thereupon, or upon an arrest by warrant as herein provided, the court shall cause the defendant to be brought before it without unnecessary delay for a hearing on the violation charges. At such hearing the defendant shall be informed of the manner in which he is alleged to have violated the conditions of his probation or conditional discharge, shall be advised by the court that he has the right to retain counsel and, if indigent, shall be entitled to the services of the public defender, and shall have the right to cross-examine witnesses and to present evidence in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">\u201c(b) If such violation is established, the court may continue or revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge or modify or enlarge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence.

App. 642, 650-51 n.4, 583 A.2d 1303 (1990). Defense counsel did not, however, make any such representation to the trial court at the time of its determination of waiver. Because a reviewing court\u2019s assessment of a trial court\u2019s determination of waiver cannot be based on hindsight, but must be confined to the trial court record and the circumstances confronting the trial court at the time of its determination; cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>790 F.2d 245, 251 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 989, 107 S.

Ed. 2d 587 (1986); we decline to consider whether our conclusion would be different if defense counsel had made the above representation to the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\"> We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to uphold the Appellate Court\u2019s decision on the ground that its proper application of the \u201cbalancing\u201d test enunciated in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Tortora, </em>464 F.2d 1202, 1210 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Santoro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>409 U.S. 1063, 93 S. Ct. 554, 34 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1972), demonstrated that the defendant\u2019s due process rights outweighed the state\u2019s interest in proceeding in his absence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Durkin, </em>23 Conn. App. 642, 651-52, 583 A.2d 1303 (1990). Like courts in other jurisdictions; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>119 N.J. 165,183-84, 574A.2d 434 (1990); we previously have declined an invitation to adopt the <em>Tortora </em>test in this state. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Drakeford, </em>202 Conn. 75, 80, 519 A.2d 1194 (1987). The defendant has offered no persuasive reason why the test should be embraced now.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
