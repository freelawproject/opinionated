The trial court denied the motions and rendered judgment on the verdict for the plaintiff. In addition, the court awarded the plaintiff $40,000 in attorney\u2019s fees and granted his motion for reinstatement to his former position. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly: (1) instructed the jury as to the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof under \u00a7 31-290a as well as the measure of the plaintiff\u2019s damages for lost wages; (2) instructed the jury respecting the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proving damages for emotional distress; (3) refused to set aside the verdict or order a remittitur because the verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence; and (4) ordered the plaintiff reinstated to his former position without inquiring into whether such relief was appropriate.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The jury could reasonably have found that for approximately eleven years prior to May 10,1985, the plaintiff had been employed by the defendant as a route truck driver. His primary task was to deliver milk products to the defendant\u2019s customers along a designated route. In 1978, the plaintiff injured his knee when he slipped in snow while unloading his truck. From 1980 to 1985, the plaintiff suffered several additional injuries in the course of this employment for which he missed approximately thirty-eight weeks of work and collected workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The plaintiff\u2019s concern with \u201closing time\u201d prompted him some months before his discharge to approach Russell Roly, the defendant\u2019s vice president of distribution, with a request for a \u201cjob inside.\u201d Roly informed the plaintiff that a position in the defendant\u2019s shipping department might be available, but both Roly and the plaintiff agreed that such a position would be more difficult for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">On May 6,1985, following a ten week absence caused by one of his injuries, the plaintiff was summoned to a meeting in Roly\u2019s office. Roly handed the plaintiff a memorandum entitled \u201cExcessive Personal Injuries\u201d that described each of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries and listed the corresponding number of weeks of workers\u2019 compensation benefits collected by him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>informed that the defendant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation carrier had been \u201cputting pressure\u201d on the defendant because of the number of injuries he had suffered, and he was given a choice between resignation and discharge. After consulting an attorney, the plaintiff informed Roly on May 10, 1985, that he had decided not to resign. Roly handed the plaintiff a second memorandum stating in part that it was \u201cthe opinion of [the defendant] that your chronic knee condition has rendered you unable to perform your duties assigned to you.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff was then formally discharged. Accordingly, the plaintiff\u2019s medical, dental and life insurance coverage, as well as his vested pension rights, were terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">After his discharge, the plaintiff felt \u201cdesolate.\u201d He testified regarding his emotional state as follows: \u201cI just didn\u2019t know what I was going to do because the only thing I knew how to do was drive; and I was forty-eight years old, and I was worried about when I go look for a job, not only my age, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018You worked eleven years at a place. Why did you leave?\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>And, \u2018I was fired.\u2019 ... I was depressed, I was sick over it.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s depression manifested itself in stomach pains and he \u201cpassed out\u201d on two occasions. The plaintiff\u2019s physician prescribed valium for his depression, and he took nonprescription medication for his stomach pains, which continued up to and including the date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s discharge also led to a search for alternative employment that he described as a \u201cnightmare.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s applications for employment at forty-four places of business were rejected before he finally secured a position in September, 1985, at the Douglas Battery Manufacturing Company. After almost two years in that position, the plaintiff was intermittently unemployed or employed at various other places of business. In all of his postdischarge positions, the plaintiff earned less money than he would have earned if he had continued to work for the defendant. He never obtained a position that included pension benefits, and some of his positions did not include medical or life insurance coverage. The plaintiff was unemployed at the time of trial. In the plaintiff\u2019s view, \u201cpeople wouldn\u2019t hire [him]\u201d due to his \u201cage\u201d and \u201cthe reason [he had] lost\u201d his position with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The defendant initially claims that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury on the plaintiff\u2019s burden of proof in a \u00a7 31-290a<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> action and the calculation of the plaintiff\u2019s damages for lost wages. The plaintiff responds that these claims are unpreserved, and hence unreviewable, because the defendant either did not request the particular instructions alleged to have been improperly omitted or did not take exception to the charge as given. Agreeing with the plaintiff, we do not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>This court is not bound to consider claims challenging the failure to give an instruction \u201cunless the matter is covered by a written request to charge or exception has been taken by the party appealing immediately after the charge is delivered.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 315. An exception to a charge serves to alert the court to any claimed deficiency in the charge while there is still time for the court to take appropriate remedial action. See <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>v. <em>Canaan Oil Co., </em>202 Conn. 234, 237-38, 520 A.2d 1008 (1987). \u201c \u2018The time has long since passed when a party can sit silent at the close of a charge and, if the verdict proves unpalatable, thereafter for the first time raise claims of error based on obvious inadvertencies in the charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>212 Conn. 217, 222-23, 561 A.2d 941 (1989). Furthermore, a party may not secure a reversal on the basis of an alleged instructional defect induced by his own actions. Id., 222; see <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>183 Conn. 96, 99, 438 A.2d 839 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The defendant contends that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury that it was the plaintiff\u2019s ultimate burden in a \u00a7 31-290a action to prove that he \u201cwas the victim of discrimination \u2018either directly by persuading [the jury] that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the [defendant] or indirectly by showing that the [defendant\u2019s] proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 40, 54, 578 A.2d 1054 (1990). The defendant\u2019s request to charge with respect to the burden of proof, however, allocated to itself the burden of proving \u201cthat it terminated the plaintiff for reasons other than his filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim\u201d and \u201cthat the reason was more than a pretext . . . .\u2019\u2019In accordance with the defendant\u2019s request, the court allocated this burden to the defendant in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>instructions,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the defendant did not object or take an exception. Even if we were to assume that the court\u2019s instruction were incorrect, therefore, the defendant, having induced the court to give the instruction, cannot obtain a reversal on the ground that it was given in lieu of an instruction allocating the burden of proof to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">As for the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly omitted an instruction that, in calculating the plaintiff\u2019s lost wages, the jury should consider what portion of the loss was caused by his physical problems and employment preferences subsequent to his discharge, the defendant did not request such an instruction, and, again, the defendant did not take exception to the charge as given. The defendant\u2019s posttrial motions, moreover, were not, as claimed, the functional equivalent to an exception to the charge. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Dabkowski, </em>199 Conn. 193, 198, 506 A.2d 118 (1986). Since the motions were filed subsequent to the verdict, they did not provide the court with a timely opportunity to remedy any omission determined improper. See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra, 222-23. At this late date, we, therefore, are not bound to consider the propriety of the omission. Practice Book \u00a7 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">Finally, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that either of the above claims are reviewable as plain error under Practice Book \u00a7 4185.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are not persuaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>that the interests of justice require a review of the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the omission induced; see <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>supra; nor do we find, after a careful review of the record, that the omission with respect to the calculation of the plaintiffs lost wages impaired the effectiveness or integrity of the trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Foreshaw, </em>214 Conn. 540, 547, 572 A.2d 1006 (1990). Consequently, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claims on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The defendant next challenges another omission in the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. The defendant\u2019s claim, as refined at oral argument, is that the court improperly failed to instruct the jury that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages for emotional distress unless he proved the defendant\u2019s common law liability for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. To the extent that the defendant requested such an instruction, it was properly refused.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The plaintiffs action against the defendant was premised upon the defendant\u2019s violation of \u00a7 31-290a, a statutorily created tort action derived from the common law action for wrongful discharge. <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 52. Section 31-290a (b) permits a plaintiff who establishes his or her employer\u2019s liability under the statute to recover \u201cother damages,\u201d including damages for emotional distress, that are \u201ccaused by such discrimination or discharge.\u201d See id., 62. Unlike the defendant, we do not construe the statutory term \u201ccaused\u201d to encumber a plaintiff seeking damages for emotional distress as recompense for his or her employer\u2019s violation of \u00a7 31-290a with the additional burden to prove the employer\u2019s liability for the distinct tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress. We conclude, rather, that the term \u201ccaused\u201d in \u00a7 31-290a embodies the common law principle that \u201cdamages recoverable in tort must be <em>proximately caused </em>by a defendant\u2019s tortious conduct\u201d; (emphasis added) <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Aberman, </em>196 Conn. 359, 385, 493 A.2d 193 (1985); \u201cwhether or not the consequences were reasonably anticipated.\u201d <em>Neiditz </em>v. <em>Morton S. Fine &amp; Associates, Inc., </em>199 Conn. 683, 689 n.3, 508 A.2d 438 (1986); see 1 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 47, comment (b). In a \u00a7 31-290a action, the employer\u2019s tortious conduct is that which is proscribed by the statute. The court\u2019s refusal to deliver a legally incorrect instruction to the jury does not constitute a ground for reversal. See <em>Slicer </em>v. <em>Quigley, </em>180 Conn. 252, 258, 429 A.2d 855 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The defendant next claims that the court should have set aside the verdict or ordered a remittitur because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>the verdict of $67,500 in economic damages and $97,500 in noneconomic damages was contrary to the law and the evidence. We consider the economic and noneconomic components of the verdict separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The defendant argues that the portion of the $67,500 economic damage award representing the plaintiffs lost wages was inflated due to improper calculation. In particular, the defendant asserts that certain evidence demonstrated the plaintiffs physical inability to perform the duties of a route truck driver at the time of his discharge and thereafter. The defendant thus maintains that the jury improperly determined the plaintiffs lost wages by comparing the wages earned by a route truck driver during the period of discharge with the wages actually earned by the plaintiff during that period. In the defendant\u2019s view, the wage loss differential should have been narrowed to account for the plaintiff\u2019s physical incapacity. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">In evaluating the defendant\u2019s claim, we find the court\u2019s jury charge regarding the calculation of economic damages instructive. The court admonished the jury that if it were to award the plaintiff damages for lost wages, the award should reflect \u201cthe difference of what he would have been able to earn since he was discharged . . . and what he would have earned if he continued to work for the defendant.\u201d The court then referred to exhibits in evidence indicating that the driver who had replaced the plaintiff had earned $122,411.42 from the date of the plaintiff\u2019s discharge, and that the plaintiff had earned $55,393.12 from that date. The difference between these figures, as the court pointed out, was $67,018.30. Other economic losses were identified by the court as totaling $506.24, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>it was suggested that the jury might round off its economic damage award, if any, to $67,500. The defendant did not object or take exception to this charge. As noted above, the jury returned a verdict awarding the plaintiff economic damages in the amount of $67,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u201cBy failing to take an exception to the court\u2019s charge to the jury, the [defendant] accepted the instructions as the law of the case.\u201d <em>A-G Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farms, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 200, 212, 579 A.2d 69 (1990). \u201cIt necessarily follows that a verdict rendered in accordance with the unexcepted-to charge of the court is not a verdict contrary to the law.\u201d <em>Lengel </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Light Co., </em>142 Conn. 70, 77, 111 A.2d 547 (1955). \u201c \u2018The jury were bound to follow the court\u2019s instructions and to bring in a verdict for the plaintiff consistent with them, or a verdict for the defendants.\u2019 <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>143 Conn. 31, 37,119 A.2d 118 (1955). We must view the claim of insufficiency of the evidence in light of the law of the case.\u201d <em>A-G Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Pepperidge Farms, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The jury\u2019s economic damage award was entirely consistent with the court\u2019s unchallenged instructions. Furthermore, the defendant has not identified any evidence that it introduced in contradiction to the exhibits indicating the wages of the replacement driver and the plaintiff that the court referred to in its charge. Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict; <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 687, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991); the jury could reasonably have found that the plaintiff was entitled to the amount of economic damages awarded. We therefore conclude that the verdict with respect to economic damages was not contrary to the law or the evidence. Accordingly, the court properly declined to set aside the verdict or to order a remittitur on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">With respect to the verdict of $97,500 in noneconomic damages, the defendant\u2019s principal challenge is based on the plaintiff\u2019s failure to introduce \u201cexpert medical testimony\u201d or \u201cmedical or psychiatric care bills\u201d to substantiate his claim of emotional distress. The defendant also argues that the \u201csize\u201d and the \u201ccharacterization\u201d of the award, that is, \u201cpain-and-suffering,\u201d suggest that the jury \u201cmay not have limited the award solely to the emotional distress arguably attributable to retaliation for filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">While it is true that the jury foreperson labeled the noneconomic component of the damage award \u201cpain- and-suffering,\u201d we do not consider this circumstance to make it manifest that the jury included in the award \u201citems of damage which are contrary to law.\u201d <em>Tomczuk </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>184 Conn. 182, 188, 439 A.2d 935 (1981). The court unambiguously instructed the jury that the \u201conly\u201d noneconomic item of damage awardable was \u201cdamages for mental suffering and emotional distress.\u201d Other than this item and the economic items of damage identified in the charge, the court cautioned: \u201cYou are not to concern yourselves with any other subject matter as far as damages are concerned.\u201d We presume that, as instructed, the jury limited its consideration of noneconomic damages to the emotional distress alleged by the plaintiff, and we are unpersuaded that what appears to be the foreperson\u2019s accidental mislabeling of the award amounts to \u201ca fair indication to the contrary . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>217 Conn. 648, 669, 588 A.2d 127 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">As for the plaintiff\u2019s evidence in support of his claim for damages for emotional distress, the court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>obliged, when ruling on the defendant\u2019s motions to set aside the verdict and for a remittitur, to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff in determining whether the verdict returned was reasonably supported thereby. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018The size of the verdict alone does not determine whether it is excessive. \u201cThe only practical test to apply to this verdict is whether the award falls somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages or whether the size of the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion that the jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id. Every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s refusal to set aside the verdict as excessive should be indulged; <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Glines, </em>217 Conn. 1, 5, 583 A.2d 1044 (1991); and its ruling will not be disturbed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra. We perceive no such abuse here.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">We have already set forth the facts, viewed in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, that the jury could reasonably have found. In sum, we repeat here that from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the jury could have determined that he had suffered significant emotional distress and feelings of desperation as a result of his discharge, his concomitant loss of benefits and the termination of his vested pension rights. The plaintiff\u2019s precarious mental condition, necessitating prescription medication, also manifested itself in physical illness and discomfort. His futile four year search for employment as beneficial and financially secure as his former position was accompanied by numerous humiliating rejections which caused recurring physical problems and led to further emotional distress. We have previously rejected the proposition that proof of the existence of emotional distress requires expert testimony; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number><em>Aspiazu </em>v. <em>Orgera, </em>205 Conn. 623, 631, 535 A.2d 338 (1987); see also <em>LaBieniec </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>11 Conn. App. 199, 204, 526 A.2d 1341 (1987). Similarly, an award may be valid even though it is not substantially based on incurred medical expenses. See <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Michael, </em>188 Conn. 607, 616, 452 A.2d 1157 (1982). \u201cThe test is whether the amount awarded, aside from medical expenses, \u2018 \u201cfalls within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages . . . .\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Given the plaintiffs age, the emotional and physical effects of his discharge and his endurance of a prolonged period of uncertainty as to his future financial security, we cannot say that the verdict, while generous, failed to meet that test. Like the trial court, we conclude that the award was not so large as to shock this court\u2019s sense of justice or to compel the conclusion that the jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption. <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra, 688-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reinstatement to his former position pursuant to \u00a7 31-290a (b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> without first inquiring into whether such relief was appropriate. In support of this claim, the defendant directs our attention to a number of federal cases holding that reinstatement is inappropriate if the position sought no longer exists, an innocent incumbent would be displaced or excessive friction between employee and employer would result. The defendant further relies on federal precedent to the effect that where reinstatement is inappropriate, a court may award damages in lieu thereof.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The defendant cannot prevail on this claim because it has not fulfilled its duty to provide an adequate record for appellate review. See Practice Book \u00a7 4061. Specifically, the defendant has not provided us with the transcript of the hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, and, therefore, we are unable to determine whether or to what extent the court inquired into the appropriateness of reinstatement. In the absence of any indication in the record that the court did not so inquire, the defendant\u2019s claim necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b22-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-290a provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) No employer who is subject to the provisions of this chapter shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, or in any manner discriminate against any employee because the employee has filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits or otherwise exercised the rights afforded to him pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-12\">\u201c(b) Any employee who is so discharged or discriminated against may either: (1) Bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district where the employer has its principal office for the reinstatement of his previous job, payment of back wages and reestablishment of employee benefits to which he would have otherwise been entitled if he had not been discrimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>nated against or discharged and any other damages caused by such discrimination or discharge. The court may also award punitive damages. Any employee who prevails in such a civil action shall be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs to be taxed by the court . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b23-7\"> The defendant also asserts that the court improperly awarded the plaintiff $40,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. Since the defendant indicates in its brief that it challenges the award of fees \u201conly to the extent\u201d that it is based on the verdict claimed excessive, and we conclude that the verdict was not excessive, we have no occasion to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">As for the defendant\u2019s contention that the court improperly denied his motions for a new trial, to set aside the verdict, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a remittitur, its brief addresses only the denial of the latter three motions insofar as the court failed to find the verdict excessive in light of the evidence. We consider the alleged excessiveness of the verdict and the evidence in support thereof in connection with the defendant\u2019s third issue on appeal and deem abandoned any unbriefed claims with respect to the court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b24-6\"> The April 2,1985 memorandum stated in pertinent part: \u201cA review of your accidents indicate to me that you are not a safe worker, that you take no precautions in these situations to protect yourself or the Company\u2019s interest. You have indicated that you have a problem with your knees, perhaps this is a contributing factor to your accident history.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">\u201c[The defendant\u2019s] position in this matter due to the high exposure with our insurance carrier in the past and . . . potential claims in the future would be: (A) Receive your written resignation effective immediately; (B) Discharge from New England Dairies, Inc. employment immediately and forfeiture of all vacation and sick leave benefits.

It is unfortunate that we are left with these alternatives.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b25-6\"> The May 10, 1985 memorandum stated in relevant part: \u201cIn accordance with Article XIII of the Labor Agreement all employees must be physically qualified to perform the duties required of them. It is the opinion of [the defendant] that your chronic knee condition has rendered you unable to perform your duties assigned to you. Under Article XIII, you must be qualified to perform as a route driver and that hazards encountered each day such as ice, snow, climbing up and down on your truck and making deliveries to customers, all have led to a series of personal accidents with extended lost time.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u201cThe first conclusion is that you have made little effort to protect yourself or the Company\u2019s interest. But on the other hand, as you stated in our discussion that the normal hazards can cause your knee to fail and allow you to fall or slip. A review of your accidents indicates your chronic knee condition which you have indicated to me, is the contributing factor. It is apparent that under Article XIII that you are not physically qualified to perform your duties and the general work environment of lifting, climbing up and down, etc., offers no other suitable employment due to your knee problem . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b26-8\"> See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b28-7\"> The defendant\u2019s request to charge reads in pertinent part: \u201cTo prevail, New England Dairies would have to satisfy you that it terminated the plaintiff for reasons other than his filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim.
