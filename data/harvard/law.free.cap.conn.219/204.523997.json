J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2E\">The principal issue in this consolidated appeal is whether General Statutes \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> confers standing upon a bank customer to challenge alleged procedural deficiencies in the manner in which investigative subpoenas for his bank records were served upon his bank. The plaintiffs, Roger Morgan and Paul Legassey (customers), filed applications to quash four administrative subpoenas duces tecum that the defendant, Howard B. Brown, Jr., commissioner of banking (commissioner), had directed to be served, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>(a) and 36-495 (a), on banks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>in which the customers maintained accounts. The trial court granted the applications to quash, in some instances because of the state\u2019s failure to pay witness fees to the banks, and in others because of the sheriff\u2019s choice of an inappropriate person to serve within the bank. The commissioner appealed to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The commissioner caused the administrative subpoenas in this case to be issued in the course of his investigation into the sale of units in four real estate limited partnerships. His investigation was intended to uncover possible violations of the Connecticut Uniform Securities Act; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36-470 through 36-502; which includes the sale of such units within its jurisdiction. The customers have not challenged the commissioner\u2019s regulatory authority to undertake this investigation or to issue the relevant subpoenas. See General Statutes \u00a7 36-495.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The commissioner\u2019s investigation led him to cause four administrative subpoenas to be issued on April 24, 1990. Subpoenas for the financial records of the plaintiff Morgan were served on Northeast Savings Bank, and, with respect to the plaintiff Legassey, on the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, the Bank of Bos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ton, and the Glastonbury Bank and Trust Company. In accordance with \u00a7 36-9Z (a), the commissioner served the customers with certified copies of the bank subpoenas at least ten days prior to the production date stated in the subpoenas. The customers have not challenged the propriety of the commissioner\u2019s conduct with respect to their own service except for their renewal of a claim, rejected by the trial court, that each of them was entitled to be paid witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The trial court found that the commissioner\u2019s service of the subpoenas on the banks was defective in two respects. The court found that, in executing service, the commissioner failed to tender a witness fee to the Northeast Savings Bank, the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, or the Glastonbury Bank and Trust Company, and concluded that this failure violated the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 52-260.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court further found that, in each case, service had been accomplished by in-hand personal service. The persons so served were: for the Northeast Savings Bank, an employee holding the position of staff counsel; for the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, the bank\u2019s assistant secretary; for the Bank of Boston, the branch assistant; and for the Glastonbury Bank and Trust Company, its senior vice president. The court concluded that effecting service on a person with the title of staff counsel or branch assistant violated the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 52-57 (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court concluded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>therefore, that each of the subpoenas was defectively served in one or more respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">In the absence of timely objection by the parties served to such alleged procedural defects, the ordinary rule is that the defects have been waived. See Practice Book \u00a7 144;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Debek, </em>210 Conn. 175, 180, 554 A.2d 728 (1989); <em>Standard Tallow Corporation </em>v. <em>Jowdy, </em>190 Conn. 48, 53, 459 A.2d 503 (1983). The trial court ruled, however, that a different rule obtained in this case because \u00a7 36-9Z (b) conferred standing on the customers to challenge the validity of the subpoenas. The trial court therefore granted the customers\u2019 applications to quash all four subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The commissioner\u2019s appeal raises three issues of statutory construction: (1) do the customers have standing, under \u00a7 36-9\u00cd (b), to challenge the subpoenas because of procedural irregularities in their service on their banks; (2) in light of the state\u2019s sovereign immunity, does \u00a7 52-260 include state investigatory subpoenas within its requirements for the payment of witness fees; and (3) in light of the past practices of the respective banks, does \u00a7 52-57 (c) invalidate the service of process of the subpoenas? The customers urge us to consider, as alternate grounds for affirming the judgment of the trial court, that the subpoenas should have been quashed because (1) the customers them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>selves should have been paid witness fees, and (2) letters accompanying the subpoenas improperly attempted to induce the banks to deliver the requested documents before the expiration of the ten day waiting period specified in \u00a7 36-9Z (a). We agree with the commissioner that the customers lack standing to raise the issues upon which the trial court relied in quashing the subpoenas, and that the trial court correctly ruled against the customers on their alternate grounds for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The dispositive issue on the commissioner\u2019s appeal is the scope of the standing conferred upon a bank customer by \u00a7 36-9Z (b), which provides that \u201c[a] customer of a financial institution shall have standing to challenge a subpoena of his financial records . . . .\u201d Did the legislature thereby intend to confer standing on a bank customer for the specific purpose of permitting him to challenge disclosure of the substantive contents of his financial records? Did the legislature further intend to confer standing on a bank customer to challenge, as a third party surrogate, the procedures by which service of process was effected on the financial institution in which he has his bank account? The text of the statute provides no clear answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Three propositions frame our analysis of the scope of the standing that \u00a7 36-9Z (b) confers on bank customers. First, a bank customer has \u201cno constitutional right to appear and contest the issuance of [a] subpoena for bank records regarding his account. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>425 U.S. 435, 444-45, 96 S. Ct. 1619, 48 L. Ed. 2d 71 (1976); see <em>California Banks Assn. </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>416 U.S. 21, 53, 94 S. Ct. 1494, 39 L. Ed. 2d 812 (1974).\u201d <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>179 Conn. 102, 106, 425 A.2d 588 (1979). Second, a bank customer has no statutory right, apart from \u00a7 36-9Z (b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>to raise procedural defects relating to the service of process on his bank unless those defects adversely implicate a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Debek, </em>supra, 179-80. Third, \u00a7 36-9Z (a), which entitles a bank customer to notice of investigatory inquiries into his bank records, was held by this court not to confer standing to challenge the legal sufficiency of a subpoena duces tecum. <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>supra, 106. In that case, which arose out of a subpoena duces tecum seeking Connecticut bank records for an investigation being conducted by an Illinois grand jury, the customer sought to question both the general authority of a Connecticut court to issue a subpoena for an Illinois inquiry, and the specific materiality of the information that Illinois was trying to subpoena. A separate opinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, concluded that the purpose of \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>(a) and its legislative history required a contrary finding as to standing but not as to the merits of the controversy. Id., 108-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">When the legislature revisited this agenda to enact \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>(b) in 1988, it left virtually no paper trail of its intentions. The recorded legislative history reveals no substantive discussion on the floor of either house of the General Assembly. The bill\u2019s Senate proponent, Senator Stephen C. Casey, reporting favorable committee action and requesting consent status for the bill\u2019s enactment, merely explained: \u201cMr. President, this bill simply gives a bank customer legal standing to challenge a subpoena of his bank records in certain instances.\u201d 31 S. Proc., Pt. 6, 1988 Sess., p. 2225. At the committee level, however, proceedings before the Banks Committee reveal that the bill was intended to overturn the ruling on standing in <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois </em>and to spell out the procedural rights that had been judicially viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to have been lacking earlier. But see <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois, </em>supra, 108 <em>(Peters, J., </em>concurring and dissenting); Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Banks, 1988 Sess., pp. 60-62, 70-82.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u201cWhere an act does not contain an express statement of its public purpose, we may consider the entire act as well as its legislative history to ascertain such a purpose.\u201d <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 634, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985). Viewing \u00a7 36-97 in its entirety, we are persuaded that \u00a7 36-97 (b) was enacted to afford a bank customer the opportunity to contest the validity of those inquiries about his bank records for which he had been entitled to receive notice under \u00a7 36-97 (a) as originally enacted. Armed with notice under \u00a7 36-97 (a) and a right to a hearing under \u00a7 36-97 (b), a customer has standing to challenge the substantive propriety of the disclosure of his records, on grounds such as those at issue in <em>In re Petition of State\u2019s Attorney, Cook County, Illinois: </em>that there is no authority for the issuance of the subpoena; or that the customer\u2019s financial records are immaterial to the investigation. To protect access to these substantive rights, a customer undoubtedly also has standing to challenge the timeliness and the manner of service of his own \u00a7 36-97 (a) notice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Iasevoli, </em>188 Conn. 325, 333-34, 449 A.2d 996 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Nothing in the text of \u00a7 36-97 (b) or in its legislative history suggests, however, that the legislature intended also to confer standing on a bank customer to challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>procedural irregularities in the manner in which an administrative subpoena has been served on the financial institution in which he has his account. To the contrary, Senator Casey\u2019s statement that the statute confers upon a bank customer \u201clegal standing to challenge a subpoena of his bank records <em>in certain </em>instances(emphasis added) 31 S. Proc., supra; confirms a construction that such standing is not unlimited.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In light of the legislature\u2019s articulated preference for the waivability of procedural shortcomings in administrative appeals, manifested the same year that \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>(b) was enacted by adoption of a revised Uniform Administrative Procedure Act; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (c), (d) and (e); we doubt that the legislature intended to authorize bank customers to enforce procedural rights that their banks are content to waive.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">On the commissioner\u2019s appeal, we conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>(b) confers no standing upon bank customers to contest the procedures by which service of process has been made on their banks. The banks having waived the alleged procedural deficiencies at issue in this case, the commissioner\u2019s subpoenas should not have been quashed on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The customers have raised two alternative grounds upon which the trial court might have quashed the subpoenas. They maintain that (1) the commissioner was obligated, in serving each of them pursuant to \u00a7 36-9Z (a) with a \u201csubpoena ... or certified copy thereof,\u201d to pay them witness fees; and (2) the commissioner violated General Statutes \u00a7 36-9n (b)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> by wrongfully attempting to induce premature disclosure of the customers\u2019 financial records. We agree with the trial court\u2019s rejection of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">With respect to the customers\u2019 first claim, the trial court found that the customers had been properly served, with in-hand service, but had not been tendered witness fees. The statute prescribing the payment of witness fees, \u00a7 52-260 (a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> identifies the purpose of the fees as payment for the costs of attendance and travel. At the trial court hearing, the customers identified no other reason for the payment of such fees, and did not contest the court\u2019s conclusion that the notice served on the customers did not require their attendance at, or travel to, any designated hearing site. They have not further elaborated on their claim in their appellate brief. We conclude, therefore, that the customers have established neither a factual nor a legal predicate for their claimed entitlement to witness fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The customers claim, in the alternative, that the subpoenas should be quashed because the commissioner attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to induce the banks to disclose the customers\u2019 financial records prematurely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>and thus to undermine the customers\u2019 statutory rights under \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>to a ten day period to contest the legitimacy of the disclosures. The factual source of this claim is the commissioner\u2019s inclusion, in his covering letter to the various banks, of a sentence stating: \u201cIf the documents and records described in the subpoena are delivered to this department prior to the date specified in the subpoena, [the bank] will be advised subsequent to such production if a personal appearance to testify is required.\u201d This sentence in the commissioner\u2019s letter is the basis for the customers\u2019 claims that the commissioner had committed a misdemeanor under \u00a7 36-9n (b) and that such a criminal offense furnished good cause for quashing the subpoenas he had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Like the trial court, we are unpersuaded that the commissioner\u2019s letter had the draconian consequences that the customers attribute to it. The trial court was entitled to determine, in light of the circumstances before it, that the significant papers served on the banks were the subpoenas themselves and not the covering letters. In each case the subpoenas, although dated and served on April 24,1990, postponed the date for production of the documents sought by the commissioner until May 30,1990, well after the expiration of the ten day waiting period mandated by \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>(a). Viewing the record as a whole and noting that the disputed records had not yet been disclosed, the trial court did not find that the commissioner had engaged in wilful subversion of the customers\u2019 rights to nondisclosure of their financial records. In the absence of such a finding, the customers have not established any basis for quashing the subpoenas issued by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The judgments are reversed and the cases are remanded with direction to dismiss the applications to quash the four administrative subpoenas issued by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b225-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 <em>36-91 </em>provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Except as provided in section 36-9m, a financial institution shall disclose financial records pursuant to a lawful subpoena, summons, warrant or court order served upon it if the party seeking the records causes such subpoena, summons, warrant or court order or a certified copy thereof to be served upon the customer whose records are being sought, at least ten days prior to the date on which the records are to be disclosed, provided a court of competent jurisdiction, for good cause, may waive service of such subpoena, summons, warrant or court order, or certified copy thereof, upon such customer. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">\u201c(b) A customer of a financial institution shall have standing to challenge a subpoena of his financial records, by filing an application or motion to quash in a court of competent jurisdiction within the ten-day notice period required by subsection (a) of this section.
