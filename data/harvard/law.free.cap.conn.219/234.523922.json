After his first trial in 1984 before Judge Quinn, the jury found the defendant guilty as charged, but a new trial was ordered on the ground of juror misconduct. The defendant\u2019s second trial in 1986 before Judge Kline resulted in a deadlocked jury and ended in a mistrial. His third trial in 1988 before Judge Kaplan concluded in a guilty verdict and a sentence of sixty years imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">On appeal, the defendant challenges several of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. He claims that the court should have: (1) suppressed Anthony Pasquarelli\u2019s allegedly hypnotically refreshed testimony describing and identifying the defendant; (2) suppressed Anthony Pasquarelli\u2019s testimony on the alternative ground that the defendant was prejudiced by the state\u2019s failure to disclose statements made by Anthony to the police before the hypnosis session; (3) excluded Detective Charles Miller\u2019s testimony recounting statements made by the defendant during the search of his apartment because Miller was incompetent to testify, and Miller\u2019s testimony was irrelevant, or alternatively, more prejudicial than probative; (4) excluded Daniel Pasquarelli\u2019s testimony describing the defendant\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d after Daniel accused him, while incarcerated, of committing the crime; and (5) admitted evidence offered by the defendant to rebut the inference of consciousness of guilt arising from certain evidence favorable to the state. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On July 17, 1981, between 5:26 and 5:55 p.m., the defendant made three emergency \u201c911\u201d telephone calls to the Bristol police department under an assumed name. He informed the police that a girl in need of medical attention was in the woods near a path along the railroad tracks by the Pequabuck River in the For<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>estville section of Bristol. Considering these to be crank calls, the police conducted a cursory search of the area and found nothing. At approximately 3:15 the next morning, however, Michael Mattei notified the police that his fifteen year old daughter, Diane Mattei, the victim, was missing. The police again searched the woods and discovered the victim\u2019s body. She was lying on her back, unclothed from the waist up, and her face was unrecognizable. The chief medical examiner testified that the victim had died of a fractured skull with subdural hemorrhage resulting from contusions of the brain and/or blunt force injuries to the head and neck. The time of death was placed between 2 and 6 p.m. on July 17, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">At trial, the defendant stipulated that he had made the 911 calls. He defended against the charge of murder, without testifying, by presenting thirty-three witnesses to establish that he was a concerned citizen who had merely reported his discovery of the injured victim, and that the crime was more likely to have been committed by one of a number of persons who had been suspects in the case. The state presented circumstantial evidence to the contrary through the testimony of thirty-four witnesses and numerous exhibits. Several witnesses, including Anthony and Daniel Pasquarelli, testified that they had seen the defendant alone with the victim in the immediate area of the woods between 2:30 and 3:45 p.m. on the date of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The defendant first claims that the court should have suppressed as the unreliable product of hypnosis all testimony by Anthony Pasquarelli describing or identifying him. The state counters that the trial court properly determined that Anthony had not been hypnotized. We provide the following facts to place the defendant\u2019s specific claims in their proper context.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>On July 21, 1981, at an interview with Detective Thomas Killiany of the Bristol police department, Anthony revealed that while walking along the tracks with his brother, Daniel Pasquarelli, at approximately 3:15 p.m. on the date of the crime, he had observed and conversed with a man accompanied by the victim. He described the man, signed a written statement incorporating the description and assisted in the making of a composite drawing of the man\u2019s face. Although the police eventually lost this statement, Anthony testified that he had described the man as follows: dark hair, dark eyes, approximately 5\u20198\u201d tall, one hundred sixty pounds, wearing blue jeans and a tee-shirt with a pocket. Anthony gave an \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201cfairly identical\u201d description to the police on July 22, 1981, which also was reduced to writing and thereafter lost. On one or both of the above occasions, Anthony told the police that he had recognized the man but could not remember his name. He later testified, however, that he had remembered the man\u2019s name as that of the defendant on July 21 or 22, 1981, but had deliberately withheld it on those dates and at subsequent interviews because he had been displeased with his treatment by the police. It was not until August 11, 1981, that Anthony disclosed the defendant's name to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">In the meantime, at Killiany\u2019s request, Anthony had agreed to submit to hypnosis as an aid to recall the name. John Haksteen, a psychologist and practicing hypnotist, conducted the hypnosis session on July 23, 1981.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Haksteen testified that in his opinion, Anthony at some point had gone into a \u201chypnotic trance,\u201d during which time he had disclosed the following information that Haksteen had later compiled in a report: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Young man of his age (twenty), dark hair, dark eyes, two days growth of beard, black or navy blue polo shirt, blue jeans, brown leather belt with tarnished oval buckle, a little taller than he, with a French name that was very hard to pronounce. Haksteen also testified, however, that although he had regarded Anthony\u2019s behavior during the session as consistent with that of a hypnotized person, he had not been trained to \u201cspot malingerers\u201d or subjects who might be intentionally feigning hypnosis. Haksteen admitted that Anthony \u201ccould have faked it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Immediately after the session, Anthony again described the man to the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Killiany testified that \u201cthe only thing that was new\u201d in the July 23, 1981 description was the \u201cbrass buckle on the belt of the person he had seen.\u201d Similarly, Anthony testified that \u201c[t]he statements] that I gave before I saw the hypnotist and after I saw the hypnotist are the same,\u201d \u201cexcept for I might have . . . said . . . different words or described maybe something that they didn\u2019t press on the day before or the day before that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Contrary to Haksteen\u2019s perception that Anthony had achieved a hypnotic state, Anthony testified that at \u201cno time\u201d during the hypnosis session had he been unaware of \u201cwhat was going on.\u201d He described the tests Haksteen had performed in detail that matched Haksteen\u2019s testimony, and stated that he had told Haksteen \u201cpretty much exactly what I told the police the first time I talked to them.\u201d Anthony also testified that he had known the man\u2019s name as the defendant\u2019s name before the session, but when Haksteen \u201cgot to the part about who I saw ... I would always come back with the same answer ... I would just keep telling him I saw faces.\u201d Eventually, Anthony had given Haksteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number><em>\u201ca </em>different name\u201d that he had made up, and he stated that \u201cit was a French name and I was trying to think of French names when I was sitting there.\u201d Anthony explained that he had withheld the name at and after the session \u201c[because] of the attitude problem we were having with the police department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">On these facts, the court ruled that Anthony had not been hypnotized and denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The court thus declined to consider the effect of any alleged \u201chypnosis\u201d on the reliability of Anthony\u2019s subsequent descriptions and identification of the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Following this ruling, the state called Anthony as a witness and he testified to his recollections in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The defendant argues that the court incorrectly admitted Anthony\u2019s testimony for several reasons. He claimed in his brief that the \u201cmajority American rule\u201d \u201cpresumes that anyone who has undergone hypnosis has in fact been hypnotized,\u201d and only in \u201cthe rare case\u201d can this presumption \u201cbe overcome by expert opinion to the contrary.\u201d At oral argument, the defendant contended that the question of whether a witness has in fact been hypnotized is \u201cnot a proper inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>for the court\u201d because \u201cthe court cannot tell whether the [witness] has been affected or not by hypnosis.\u201d He further asserted at argument that \u201cthe last person who is competent to testify as to whether he was influenced by the hypnosis session is the person who was subjected to the procedure,\u201d and that in the absence of expert testimony that the witness had not been hypnotized, \u201cthe court has no discretion to bypass the state\u2019s burden of showing that [the witness\u2019] testimony was recalled and related prior to the hypnosis process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Initially, we note that while the defendant refers us to a number of cases that purportedly follow a \u201cmajority rule\u201d of presumptive hypnosis, only one of those cases involves a situation where the occurrence of hypnosis was disputed. Where no one disputes that hypnosis occurred, a court might reasonably presume that hypnosis in fact occurred and go on to consider whether the proffered hypnotically refreshed testimony accurately reflects the witness\u2019 true memory, or rather, the distorted and unreliable product of hypnotic suggestion, confabulation, or memory hardening. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>205 Conn. 61, 78-81, 530 A.2d 155 (1987); see also <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 59-61, 107 S. Ct. 2704, 97 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1987). In this case, however, the state argued and the court decided that hypnosis had not occurred. Our review of that decision is not directly aided, much less controlled, by cases that do not confront this distinct issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">The single apposite case on which the defendant relies undermines, rather than supports, his position. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>47 Cal. 3d 1194, 1232-33, 767 P.2d 1047, 255 Cal. Rptr. 569 (1989), the California Supreme Court did not disapprove of the trial court\u2019s inquiry into whether a witness had achieved a hypnotic state as alleged by the defendant in that case. The court instead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly relied on the opinion of an expert who had not participated in the hypnosis session in reaching its decision that the witness had not in fact been hypnotized. The court\u2019s disposition of that claim, moreover, expressly condoned the trial court\u2019s consideration of the witness\u2019 testimony that he had not been hypnotized in determining whether hypnosis had occurred. Id. Furthermore, the court implicitly sanctioned the trial court\u2019s authority to reject the testimony of the hypnotist who had conducted the hypnosis session and who had been \u201cof the opinion that [the witness] had been hypnotized.\u201d Id., 1232.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The defendant also points out that authorities on hypnotism caution that \u201cvery often hyponotic subjects have refused to believe they actually went into a trance. Some claim they were wide awake during the whole experience, others that nothing unusual happened, still others that they were only pretending to be hypnotized.\u201d B. Diamond, \u201cInherent Problems in the Use of Pretrial Hypnosis on a Prospective Witness,\u201d 68 Cal. L. Rev. 313, 334 (1980). Such authorities nonetheless acknowledge that \u201ceven the best experts cannot consistently distinguish between actual and pretended hypnosis\u201d and that \u201cno reliable and truly objective criteria [for detecting] the state of hypnosis have yet been discovered\u201d; B. Diamond, supra, 337. Despite the pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>sibility of conflicting evidence of an alleged hypnotic state, we do not agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the weighing of such evidence is a prospect so formidable that our courts should be divested of authority to decide whether hypnosis has in fact occurred. Neither do we agree that that decision, as the defendant essentially argues, should be placed in the hands of experts who cannot consistently distinguish between an actual and feigned hypnotic state. The law traditionally recognizes the trial court as a tribunal equipped to resolve disputed evidentiary issues, and as the \u201cfinal judge of credibility.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Haggard, </em>141 Conn. 668, 674,109 A.2d 358 (1954). Moreover, as we have often noted, the fact that a witness testifies as an expert does not compel the acceptance of his or her testimony as true. See, e.g., <em>Aspiazu v. Orgera, </em>205 Conn. 623, 634, 535 A.2d 338 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We conclude, rather, that the determination of whether a witness has in fact been hypnotized is appropriately committed to the sound discretion of the trial court. In resolving this issue, the court may be aided, but is not bound, by expert opinion. Id. Such testimony must be \u201cconsidered, weighed and tested like any other evidence\u201d; id.; and assessed \u201c \u2018in relation to the other circumstances in evidence bearing on the question in issue\u2019 \u201d; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>207 Conn. 217, 225, 541 A.2d 1201 (1988); including, if offered, the testimony of the allegedly hypnotized witness. The trial court \u201c \u2018is <em>privileged </em>to adopt whatever testimony [it] reasonably believes to be <em>credible\u2019 </em>\u201d; (emphasis in original) <em>Eichman v.J&amp;J Building Co., </em>216 Conn. 443, 451-52, 582 A.2d 182 (1990); and expert testimony may be rejected in favor of other evidence found more persuasive. <em>Transportation Plaza Associates </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>203 Conn. 364, 377, 525 A.2d 68 (1987). The trial court\u2019s preliminary determination of whether a witness has in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>been hypnotized will not be disturbed on appeal except for an abuse of discretion. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>215 Conn. 1, 6, 574 A.2d 188 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stange, </em>212 Conn. 612, 617, 563 A.2d 681 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In the present case, the record discloses that Anthony had described the events at the hypnosis session in a manner that diverged little from Haksteen\u2019s description, thereby substantiating Anthony\u2019s claim of awareness during the session. His explanation of a conscious attempt to supply Haksteen with French names further suggests that he was in sufficient control of his faculties to feign hypnosis if he so desired. In addition, Anthony had a plausible motive for refusing to cooperate with Haksteen. He had expressed displeasure with his treatment by the police, and the circumstances surrounding his dealings with the police suggested, as the trial court surmised, that he had been \u201ctrying to position himself and maybe cut a deal for himself on unrelated charges . . . .\u201d Notwithstanding Haksteen\u2019s opinion that Anthony had appeared cooperative, Anthony\u2019s refusal to cooperate with Haksteen, whom he had visited at the behest of the police, was consistent with his refusal to cooperate fully with the police for reasons of his own. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the court was well within its discretion in finding Anthony\u2019s testimony the more credible and in determining that he had not, in fact, been hypnotized. Anthony\u2019s testimony was therefore properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court should have suppressed Anthony\u2019s testimony because he was prejudiced by the nondisclosure of Anthony's July 21 and 22, 1981 statements to the police.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As discussed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>in Part I above, these statements contained Anthony\u2019s descriptions, before the hypnosis session, of the man he claimed to have seen on the tracks. The defendant moved to suppress Anthony\u2019s testimony after learning that the police could not locate the statements and that the state consequently could not produce them pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 752.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">After hearing the defendant\u2019s motion, the court found the loss of the statements attributable to \u201csome form of negligence as opposed to some intentional act.\u201d The court also determined that the defendant had not been unduly prejudiced by the nondisclosure in light of his access to Anthony\u2019s July 23 and August 11,1981 statements, Anthony\u2019s prior testimony \u201cwith all his discrepancies,\u201d Killiany\u2019s testimony regarding the content of the statements and Haksteen\u2019s testimony recounting the details of the hypnosis session. Accordingly, the court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The defendant attacks this ruling as \u201cclearly incorrect.\u201d He argues that the nondisclosure of the statements severely prejudiced his ability to: (1) demonstrate which portions of Anthony\u2019s testimony should have been excluded as the unreliable product of hypnosis; (2) impeach Anthony\u2019s credibility; (3) establish dissimilarities between Anthony\u2019s descriptions and his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>appearance; and (4) establish similarities between Anthony\u2019s descriptions and the appearances of other suspects in the case. The defendant imputes particu-. lar significance to the statements for impeachment purposes because, in his view, Anthony was a \u201ccritical\u201d witness whose testimony was \u201cconfirmed\u201d by hypnosis and thus \u201cmay well have had special effect.\u201d For these reasons, the defendant maintains that he is \u201centitled to a new trial at which [Anthony\u2019s] testimony is stricken.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The record amply supports the court\u2019s finding that the loss of the statements resulted from negligence rather than \u201ca deliberate act done with intent to deprive the defense of information.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>212 Conn. 6, 16, 562 A.2d 470 (1989). Since the state was negligent in the nondisclosure, it was the defendant\u2019s burden to demonstrate that he was so prejudiced by lack of access to the statements that Anthony\u2019s testimony should be suppressed notwithstanding the state\u2019s minimal culpability. Id., 18; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>208 Conn. 365, 383-84, 545 A.2d 1048 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>206 Conn. 40, 59, 536 A.2d 936 (1988); see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sommer, </em>815 F.2d 15, 17 (2d Cir. 1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>526 F.2d 1319, 1328 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 821, 97 S. Ct. 69, 50 L. Ed. 2d 82 (1976). The trial court, in turn, was vested with broad discretion in balancing the prejudice accruing to the defendant against the state\u2019s culpability; <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 268, 576 A.2d 139 (1990); and in realistically appraising the significance of the statements in view of their nature, their bearing upon critical issues in the case, and the strength of the state\u2019s untainted proof. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra, 23; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grammatikos, </em>633 F.2d 1013, 1019-20 (2d Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The primary source of prejudice identified by the defendant was his inability to use the statements to pin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>point discrepancies between Anthony\u2019s recollections before and after the hypnosis session, and thus to demonstrate which portions of his testimony should be excluded as unreliably rooted in his \u201cposthypnotic\u201d memory. As we concluded in Part I above, however, the trial court reasonably determined that Anthony had not in fact been hypnotized. It was reasonable, therefore, for the trial court to reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the statements given prior to the hypnosis attempt would illuminate the alleged unreliability of the witness\u2019 \u201cposthypnotic\u201d statements. Similarly unavailing is the defendant\u2019s contention that Anthony\u2019s testimony, \u201cconfirmed\u201d by hypnosis, was so critical to the state\u2019s case that he suffered great prejudice from his inability to impeach Anthony with the statements. Four witnesses besides Anthony placed the defendant in the vicinity of the crime scene on the date of the victim\u2019s death;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> see <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 174, 571 A.2d 79 (1990); compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>supra; and, by eliciting the fact of the hypnosis session on cross-examination, the defendant was responsible for any resulting \u201cconfirmation\u201d of Anthony\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Moreover, the impeachment materials available to the defendant were ample in supply. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 175; <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>193 Conn. 457, 469, 479 A.2d 199 (1984). Anthony\u2019s July 23 and August 11,1981 statements to the police as well as his former testimony were riddled with inconsistencies that defense counsel effectively explored on cross-examination, eliciting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Anthony\u2019s express admission that he had repeatedly and deliberately lied to the police about the details of his observations as well as the name of the man he had seen. Also in evidence was the composite drawing made with Anthony\u2019s assistance contemporaneously with the July 21, 1981 statement, as well as the list of \u201cfoils\u201d that Anthony had chosen as consistent with the man\u2019s features and that had been used in the creation of the drawing. Accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 588, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987). The defendant could have used the composite and the foils to identify distinctions, if any, between his own features and those depicted in the drawing, and to point out any similarities to the features of other suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The nondisclosure of Anthony\u2019s July 21 and 22,1981 statements, therefore, hardly left the defendant bereft of means to attack Anthony\u2019s credibility respecting the matters he claimed to have observed and recalled both before and after the hypnosis session. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sommer, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>supra, 384. In light of the minimal prejudice resulting from the nondisclosure, we conclude that the trial court properly admitted Anthony\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The defendant\u2019s next claim is in two parts, each challenging the court\u2019s ruling admitting the testimony of Detective Charles Miller as to his recollection, refreshed by his police report, of certain unsolicited statements made by the defendant in his presence during the execution of a search and seizure warrant at the defendant\u2019s apartment on July 31, 1981.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant maintains that Miller\u2019s testimony should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>have been excluded because: (1) Miller was incompetent to testify as to the defendant\u2019s statements; and (2) Miller\u2019s testimony was irrelevant, or in the alternative, more prejudicial than probative.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although the defendant invokes the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions in support of his claims, they are properly viewed as evidentiary in nature. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 496-97, 590 A.2d 901 (1991). The standard for review of his claim is therefore a determination of whether the court abused its discretion in admitting Miller\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The defendant first argues that Miller was not competent to testify regarding his statements because Miller was unqualified to determine whether they had been rationally made, and could give no reason for his professed belief that they related to the case other than his \u201cpolice instincts.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">In asserting this claim, the defendant appears to have mixed his trials. Miller testified at the defendant\u2019s <em>second trial </em>that the statements were rational and relevant, but Miller gave no such testimony at his third trial that is the subject of this appeal. At the defendant\u2019s third trial, Miller confined his testimony to an account of his role in the search and a recitation of his recollection, as refreshed by his report, of the defendant\u2019s statements during the search. The defendant has not explained why Miller lacked sufficient powers of observation, recollection, narration and truthfulness simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>to recite the statements before the jury, without offering his personal opinion as to their significance or the defendant\u2019s capacity. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 244, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 430,112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990). Consequently, he has not demonstrated that Miller\u2019s testimony failed to meet the threshold requirement of \u201cminimum credibility\u201d that would have warranted its exclusion as incompetent. Id., 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The defendant next argues that Miller\u2019s testimony should have been excluded as irrelevant, or alternatively, as more prejudicial than probative. He asserts that Miller\u2019s testimony was irrelevant because the defendant\u2019s statements were \u201cpsychotic babblings\u201d that the jury could not interpret or logically link to the case except by resort to \u201cspeculation\u201d and \u201cconjecture\u201d that they referred to the victim. The defendant contends that Miller\u2019s testimony, if relevant, should nonetheless have been excluded due to its \u201cexplosively prejudicial\u201d effect. He maintains, in particular, that \u201c[ljittle else could be as damaging as an open admission of guilt, combined with sneering disrespect for a fifteen year old girl\u2019s death.\u201d We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u201c Tn a criminal trial, it is relevant to show the conduct of an accused, as well as any statement made by him subsequent to the alleged criminal act, which may fairly be inferred to have been influenced by the criminal act.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 655, 480 A.2d 463 (1984). The probative value of such statements stems from \u201c \u2018our knowledge of the human mind and its workings, [for] we expect, with almost positive certainty, that when it is the sole repository of so dreadful a secret it will affect the conduct and sayings of the person.\u2019 \u201d 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>1979) \u00a7 273. \u201cNo one doubts that the state of mind which we call \u2018guilty consciousness\u2019 is perhaps the strongest evidence . . . that the person is indeed the guilty doer . . . .\u201d Id., \u00a7 273 (1); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>164 Conn. 560, 596, 325 A.2d 199, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 291, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Given the circumstances under which the defendant made the statements as well as their content, the trial court could quite properly have concluded that the statements were relevant manifestations of his consciousness of guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Maturo, </em>188 Conn. 591, 598, 452 A.2d 642 (1982). The police had previously interviewed the defendant with regard to his whereabouts on the date of the crime, and, prior to the defendant\u2019s making of the statements, they had announced the purpose of the search in his presence and subjected him to a body search. At the time of the statements, therefore, the defendant was aware that the investigation of the victim\u2019s death at that time was focused upon him, and he had reason to anticipate that he was to be accused of the crime. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moynahan, </em>supra, 596-97; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>64 Conn. 293, 305, 29 A. 536 (1894) (\u201cmanner in which [defendant] conducted himself when accounts by others in respect to the subject were made in his hearing, may always be shown\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The content of the statements further demonstrates their relevance. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s words betrayed his belief that a female had died, deservedly so, and his description of that female\u2019s anatomical features was consistent with those of a female of the victim\u2019s age. The jury could fairly have inferred that he had indeed spoken of the victim of the crime under investigation, thereby circumstantially corroborating the testimony of witnesses who had observed the defendant with the victim on the date of her death; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. 301, 309, 579 A.2d 515 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982); and making it more probable that he was responsible for her death. <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>214 Conn. 616, 628, 573 A.2d 716 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, neither his failure to identify the female subject of his statements as the victim nor his alleged psychotic state renders Miller\u2019s testimony irrelevant. Evidence need not be conclusive to be relevant; <em>State </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>209 Conn. 458, 478, 551 A.2d 1231 (1988); and \u201c[t]he fact that evidence is susceptible of different explanations or would support various inferences does not affect its admissibility, although it obviously bears upon its weight. So long as the evidence may reasonably be construed in such a manner that it would be relevant, it is admissible.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>supra, 656 n.12; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 508, 498 A.2d 76 (1985). A reasonable construction of the statements, for the reasons previously stated, would support an inference that the defendant had been referring to the victim. The defendant has not claimed that he was precluded from presenting evidence or argument suggesting that his statements were the product of an irrational mind and hence could not have referred to the victim.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that Miller\u2019s testimony was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Nonetheless, \u201c \u2018[tjhere are situations where the potential prejudicial effect of relevant evidence would suggest its exclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holliman, </em>214 Conn. 38, 51, 570 A.2d 680 (1990). One of those situations is where the evidence offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions or hostility; id.; thereby unduly tending to suggest a decision on an improper, emotional basis. D. Louisell &amp; C. Mueller, Federal Evidence \u00a7 403. Evidence is not prejudicial in this sense, however, merely because it tends to incriminate a defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>supra, 702-703; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Figueroa, </em>618 F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. 1980). The prejudicial effect that the rules of evidence are designed to alleviate is that which \u201cresults from an aspect of the evidence other than its tendency to make the existence of a material fact more or less probable, e.g., that aspect of the evidence which makes conviction more likely because it provokes an emotional response in the jury or otherwise tends to affect adversely the jury\u2019s attitude toward the defendant wholly apart from its judgment as to his guilt or innocence of the crime charged.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bailleaux, </em>685 F.2d 1105, 1111 (9th Cir. 1982); see <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>supra, 703. The trial court\u2019s discretionary determination that the probative value of evidence is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect will not be disturbed on appeal unless a clear abuse of discretion is shown. <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>216 Conn. 585, 603, 583 A.2d 896 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The defendant correctly points out that Miller\u2019s testimony would have been \u201cdamaging\u201d if the jury had believed that his statements referred to the victim. This aspect of Miller\u2019s testimony, however, is precisely what infused it with considerable probative value. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>other hand, the nonprobative and prejudicial aspects of Miller\u2019s testimony included the remorseless tenor of the defendant\u2019s statements and his use of expletives and sexually explicit language. These aspects of Miller\u2019s testimony unquestionably had the tendency adversely to affect the jury\u2019s attitude toward the defendant, and were we sitting as the trial court in this case, we might well have concluded that the testimony was too prejudicial for admission. Nevertheless, broad discretion is reposed in the trial court in conducting the inherently difficult process of balancing prejudicial effect against probative value. Id. We cannot say that the court abused its discretion in reaching the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court should not have permitted the state to introduce certain testimony by Daniel Pasquarelli in its case-in-chief. In connection with the state\u2019s offer of proof, Daniel testified on voir dire that while he and the defendant had been incarcerated in the same facility before the defendant\u2019s second trial, he had asked the defendant: (1) \u201cif he would deny to my face. I was there, he was there, my brother was there, [the victim] was there. Deny to my face when me and my brother left you didn\u2019t do it,\u201d to which the defendant responded \u201cno, I\u2019m not going to\u201d; and (2) \u201cwhy [the defendant] did it. I said between me and you, we know we were there, why?\u201d to which the defendant did not respond, and then responded that \u201che was on drugs that day. He was doing a lot of drugs.\u201d Defense counsel objected to Daniel\u2019s testimony due to his uncertainty whether the defendant\u2019s response concerning drugs was a \u201cdirect response\u201d to Daniel\u2019s second question or whether \u201cmore questioning\u201d occurred between the question and response. Find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>ing the defendant\u2019s second response a \u201cdirect response\u201d after a \u201cmomentary lapse,\u201d the court admitted Daniel\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">On the witness stand, however, Daniel gave a somewhat different account of his conversation with the defendant. At one point, he described the defendant\u2019s response to his first question in the same manner as on voir dire. He then testified, however, that the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t answer\u201d the first question, he had asked it again, and the defendant \u201cwaited a couple seconds and then said he was doing drugs. A lot of drugs.\u201d As for the second question, Daniel testified that he had asked it a \u201ccouple times\u201d before the defendant had responded that \u201che was doing a lot of drugs.\u201d The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objections to this testimony. No immediate curative instruction was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Relying on <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976), the defendant contends that the admission of Daniel\u2019s testimony violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>He argues that his refusals and hesitation to respond to Daniel\u2019s inquiries constituted an invocation of his right to remain silent in reliance upon the \u201cimplicit assurance\u201d that he would not be penalized for remaining silent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He also contends that his ultimate responses to Daniel\u2019s questions were no less insolubly ambiguous than absolute silence, and thus were equivalent to silence and/or affirmative assertions of his right to remain silent. Consequently, he maintains that by introducing Daniel\u2019s testimony, the state indulged in a \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d use of his silence against him in contravention of the implicit assurance that his \u201csilence\u201d would not be so used.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The factual predicate of a claimed <em>Doyle </em>violation is the use by the state of a defendant\u2019s postarrest and <em>postMiranda </em>silence either for impeachment or as affirmative proof of his guilt. In this case, however, the defendant did not remain silent, nor were his statements so fraught with ambiguity that they could be equated with silence. Despite his initial disinclination, the defendant made unequivocal statements about his \u201cinvolvement in the crime.\u201d <em>Anderson </em>v. Charles, 447 U.S. 404, 407, 100 S. Ct. 2180, 65 L. Ed. 2d 222, reh. denied, 448 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 27, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1173 (1980).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, he stated without evident com-</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>pulsion that he would not deny \u201cit,\u201d that is, having committed the crime. While this statement, standing alone, might be considered ambiguous, the defendant\u2019s second explanatory statement regarding his use of drugs both refers to his \u201cinvolvement in the crime\u201d and exposes the first statement as a reluctant acknowledgement rather than a rebuff. \u201c[A] defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings has not been induced to remain silent. As to the subject matter of his statements, the defendant has not remained silent at all.\u201d Id., 408; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 295-96, 497 A.2d 35 (1985); compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>197 Conn. 507, 534-38, 498 A.2d 76 (1985). Rather than relying on the implicit assurance that silence would carry no penalty, therefore, the defendant failed to heed the warning that \u201canything said can and will be used against [him] in court.\u201d <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 469, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Furthermore, the state offered Daniel\u2019s testimony for the permissible purpose of presenting the defendant\u2019s statements, not his refusals to speak, as evidence of his guilt. Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Traitz, </em>871 F.2d 368, 401 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 821, 110 S. Ct. 78, 107 L. Ed. 2d 44 (1989) (prosecutor did not \u201cmanifestly intend\u201d to comment on defendant\u2019s silence). When Daniel unexpectedly deviated from his voir dire testimony, moreover, the court\u2019s overruling of the defendant\u2019s objections did not permit the state to inquire as to his silence, but rather, allowed the state to inquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>as to the statements previously related by Daniel. The state\u2019s questions <em>to </em>Daniel on the stand, similarly, were designed to elicit the statements and not to draw meaning from his refusals to respond. See <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>supra, 409; <em>State </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>201 Conn. 174, 185, 513 A.2d 1183 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Consistent with this purpose, the state thereafter focused its closing remarks upon the statements, without mentioning the refusals to respond, as circumstantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. The court did not refer to the defendant\u2019s refusals in its charge; <em>Greer </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 765, 107 S. Ct. 3102, 97 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1987); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Shashaty, </em>205 Conn. 39, 50 n.4, 529 A.2d 1308 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1027, 108 S. Ct. 753, 98 L. Ed. 2d 766 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>supra; and, significantly, the defendant\u2019s sole request to charge regarding Daniel\u2019s testimony pertained to the relationship between the fact that he had been \u201con drugs\u201d to the state\u2019s burden of proving specific intent. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ivey, </em>546 F.2d 139, 144-45 (5th Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Taglione </em>v. <em>United States, </em>431 U.S. 943, 97 S. Ct. 2662, 53 L. Ed. 2d 263 (1977); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Silano, </em>204 Conn. 769, 782, 529 A.2d 1283 (1987). We conclude, accordingly, that the admission of Daniel\u2019s testimony did not impair the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Finally, the defendant claims that he was deprived of his federal constitutional right to present a defense by the court\u2019s refusal to allow him to introduce circumstantial evidence of a beating that he allegedly had suffered at the hands of the Bristol police following his arrest for an unrelated incident in 1978.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>proffered by the defendant consisted of a photograph, the testimony of two witnesses primarily describing the defendant\u2019s appearance and behavior after the alleged beating, and the testimony of one witness corroborating that the defendant had commenced a civil suit against the city of Bristol and certain members of the Bristol police department in connection with the alleged beating.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> According to the defendant, the purpose of this evidence was to rebut the state\u2019s argument that his lies to the police about his identity and location during the 911 calls, and his nervousness when questioned by the police one week after the crime occurred, evinced his consciousness of guilt. The court excluded the evidence, in part, because it would open the door to distracting evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s arrest and the alleged beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The defendant argues that his evidence should have been admitted because it could logically be inferred from the fact of the beating that he had feared the police \u201cstrongly enough to conceal his identity to them,\u201d which in turn could support a logical inference that his concealment and nervousness were consistent with innocence rather than consciousness of guilt. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>contends that \u201c[wjhile the trial judge was not persuaded that the beating itself created a sufficient motive for the defendant to conceal his identity from the Bristol police . . . the fact remains that as a purely logical matter, it would not have been unreasonable or irrational for a juror to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In response, the state argues that the court properly concluded that an excursion into the facts and circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s arrest and the alleged beating would have unnecessarily complicated the case and unduly distracted the jury\u2019s attention from the principal issues before them. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument in favor of the logical relevance of his evidence assumes that the fact of the beating was undisputed. Had the beating occurred, it would doubtless have provided a sufficient predicate for the logical chain of inferences that the defendant sought to draw. It is not logical relevance alone, however, that secures the admission of evidence. Logically relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>evidence must also be \u201clegally relevant\u201d; see <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Steve Snyder Enterprises, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 134, 145 n.8, 491 A.2d 389 (1985); that is, not subject to exclusion for any one of the following prejudicial effects: \u201c(1) where the facts offered may unduly arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy, (2) where the proof and answering evidence it provokes may create a side issue that will unduly distract the jury from the main issues, (3) where the evidence offered and the counterproof will consume an undue amount of time, and (4) where the defendant, having no reasonable ground to anticipate the evidence, is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it. McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 185, pp. 439-40.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMatteo, </em>186 Conn. 696, 702-703, 443 A.2d 915 (1982); see <em>Hamling </em>v. <em>United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 127, 94 S. Ct. 2887, 41 L. Ed. 2d 590, reh. denied, 419 U.S. 885, 95 S. Ct. 157, 42 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1974). Where the prejudicial effect of logically relevant evidence outweighs its probative value, the trial court has wide latitude to exclude the evidence as legally irrelevant, and its decision will not be disturbed absent manifest abuse. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>204 Conn. 156, 169, 527 A.2d 1157 (1987); <em>Farrell </em>v. <em>St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, </em>203 Conn. 554, 563, 566, 525 A.2d 954 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>81 Conn. 1, 4, 69 A. 1054 (1908); see also <em>Hamling </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra. No such abuse occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In view of the critical importance of the beating as the factual foundation for the defendant\u2019s proposed chain of inferences, the court would have been hard pressed to allow him to present unchallenged circumstantial evidence of the beating. The court would have been obliged, in fairness, to permit the state to dispute the defendant\u2019s evidence of the beating by probing the circumstances attendant to his arrest and his injuries and by presenting counterproof. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>96 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Conn. 238, 247-48, 113 A. 458 (1921); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 501 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 921, 101 S. Ct. 321, 66 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1980). Due to the prejudicial tendency of the defendant\u2019s evidence to divert the trial from its primary course and provoke a barrage of distracting counterproof, we conclude that the trial court acted well within its discretion in excluding the evidence notwithstanding its logical relevance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>supra, 169-70; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 517, 400 A.2d 276 (1978); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>supra, 284-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-11\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1981)] Sec. 53a-54a. murder defined.

I think he was playing games, trying to position himself and maybe cut a deal for himself on unrelated charges and this was his way of doing it.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> Other pertinent decisions similarly endorse the discretionary authority of a trial court to decide whether a proposed witness was in fact hypnotized based on the evidence before it, including the testimony of the witness, and to reject an unpersuasive expert opinion. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Caro, </em>46 Cal. 3d 1035, 1048-49, 761 P.2d 680, 251 Cal. Rptr. 757 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1040, 109 S. Ct. 1944, 104 L.

Sup. 432, 465-66 (D.N.J. 1990), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 924 F.2d 491 (3d Cir. 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> The state argues that the record is inadequate to review this claim because the court did not expressly find that these statements had ever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>existed. We note, however, that when the defendant requested that the court make such a finding at trial, the state urged that it was \u201cnot necessary.\u201d Furthermore, our examination of the record discloses sufficient evidence to support a finding that the statements had existed. Under these circumstances, we treat the court\u2019s finding that if the statements had existed, the defendant was not prejudiced by their nondisclosure, as implicitly finding that the statements had in fact existed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b265-14\"> \u201c[Practice Book] Sec. 752.--production following testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">\u201cAfter a witness called by the state has testified on direct examination at trial, the judicial authority shall, on motion of the defendant, order the state to produce any statement of the witness in the possession of the state or its agents, including state and local law enforcement officers, which statement relates to the subject matter about which the witness has testified.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> Joseph Skorupski testified that he had seen the defendant and the victim embracing on a path in the woods at approximately 2:30 p.m. on the date of her death; Anita Taylor testified that she had observed the defendant near the scene at about 2:50 p.m.; Daniel Pasquarelli testified that the defendant had been in the woods and on the tracks with the victim between 2:15 and 3:25 p.m.; and Anna Dutil testified that she had observed the defendant and the victim heading toward the woods at approximately 3:45 p.m.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b268-9\"> Miller testified that the defendant had stated: \u201cThey\u2019ll never put tits on me. She had nice tits. She had a nice ass. The bitch deserved to die. . . . She should burn. . . . bitch.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\"> In his reply brief, the defendant claims that Miller\u2019s testimony was inadmissible hearsay. He did not address this specific claim in his original brief, nor did he or the state make reference to it at oral argument. Without the assistance of full briefing and argument by both parties, we will not consider this belatedly briefed evidentiary issue. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 395 n.10, 556 A.2d 112 (1985), cert, denied, 493 U.S. 933,110 S. Ct. 322, 107 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b272-7\"> For example, the defendant could have attacked the weight of Miller\u2019s testimony by eliciting the remainder of the statements that he characterizes as \u201ca psychotic\u2019s indecipherable \u2018word salad\u2019 \u201d on cross-examination of Miller, or by seeking admission of Miller\u2019s report. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Castonguay, </em>218 Conn. 486, 496, 590 A.2d 901 (1991). In fact, the record indicates that the state expressly consented to the admission of the remaining statements. The defendant also could have sought to introduce evidence of his psychological history, as he did at his first and second trials. We note, however, that no credible expert testimony presented at either of the defendant\u2019s prior trials established that he had been mentally incompetent at the time of the statements. Even if it had, our recent approach to competency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>issues follows the modern trend that the mental incapacity of a witness primarily affects the weight of his or her testimony, and rarely its admissibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 241-45, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, U.S. , 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\"> While the defendant also asserts that the admission of Daniel\u2019s testimony impugned his federal and state constitutional privileges against self-incrimination, the right underlying his claim stems from the due process guarantee of fundamental fairness. See <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 285, 291 n.7, 293 n.10, 106 S. Ct. 634, 88 L. Ed. 2d 623 (1986); see also <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Weir, </em>455 U.S. 603, 605-606, 102 S. Ct. 1309, 71 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1982); <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 240 n.6, 100 S. Ct. 2124, 65 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1980). We treat his federal and state due process claims together.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The defendant further claims that because his attorney was not present when Daniel questioned him, Daniel\u2019s testimony should have been excluded as violative of his federal and state constitutional rights to counsel. Since the record is wholly devoid of any evidence that Daniel questioned the defendant at the behest of the police or the prosecution, this claim is without merit. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>800 F.2d 1012, 1016 (10th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 838, 108 S. Ct. 123, 98 L. Ed. 2d 81 (1987); compare <em>United States </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 270, 100 S. Ct. 2183, 65 L. Ed. 2d 115 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\"> The record indicates that the defendant had received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\"> We note again that the record is devoid of evidence that Daniel Pasquarelli was acting as an agent of the police or the prosecutor when he confronted the defendant with his questions in jail. Whether a <em>Doyle </em>violation could be found in the absence of any state action is a question not readily answered by federal precedents. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976). We need not address that question, however, in light of our conclusion that the prosecution did not attempt to use the defendant\u2019s <em>silence </em>against him, but rather introduced through Daniel\u2019s testimony the defendant\u2019s voluntary <em>statements </em>to an individual who was not acting as an agent of the state.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\"> Although this case, unlike <em>Anderson, </em>does not involve impeachment of a testifying criminal defendant with inconsistent statements, \u201c[tjhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>is no indication that the Court limited its holding to situations involving prior inconsistent statements. What <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>[447 U.S. 404, 100 S. Ct. 2180, 65 L. Ed. 2d 222, reh. denied, 448 U.S. 912, 101 S. Ct. 27, 65 L. Ed. 2d 1173 (1980),] teaches is that the <em>Doyle </em>[v. <em>Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S. Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976)] rule has no application unless the defendant has remained silent and could be considered to have done so in reliance on the implied assurances of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Crowder, </em>719 F.2d 166,172 (6th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 974, 104 S. Ct. 2352, 80 L. Ed. 2d 825 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b278-9\"> While the defendant invokes the state constitution in support of this claim, we limit our analysis to the federal guarantee in light of his failure independently to analyze the state constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b279-7\"> Attorney Neil Murphy would have testified for the defense that in the spring of 1978, the defendant\u2019s mother had telephoned him and requested his representation in connection with the defendant\u2019s arrest by the Bristol police. He would have stated that upon his arrival at the police station, he had observed that the defendant exhibited signs of physical injury. Shelly Francini would have testified that the Bristol police had beaten the defendant in 1978, and he had been nervous in the presence of the police since the beating. She would have described the defendant\u2019s injuries that she had observed subsequent to the alleged beating. Attorney Richard Seguljic would have testified that his law firm had represented the defendant in a suit against the city of Bristol and two Bristol police officers, in which the defendant had alleged that the officers had used excessive force against him. Each of these witnesses would have authenticated a photograph that depicted scrapes and welts upon the defendant\u2019s back. None of them had personal knowledge of the beating.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> Relying on <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973), the defendant argues that since his evidence was \u201creasonably trustworthy,\u201d \u201creasonably relevant\u201d and \u201cuniquely capable of raising a reasonable doubt not otherwise present on the record,\u201d and because \u201cthe failure to permit its introduction [rendered him] powerless to rebut a presumably rebuttable inference of guilt,\u201d \u201cthe \u2018discretion\u2019 of the trial court not to admit such evidence no longer exist[ed] . . . .\u201d Without adopting the defendant\u2019s characterization of his evidence, we note that in <em>Chambers, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that a criminal defendant\u2019s due process right to present a defense \u201cmay, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process.\u201d Id., 295. \u201cSuch interests are implicit in a trial court\u2019s accepted right, indeed, duty, to exclude . . . evidence which, if admitted, would have a greater prejudicial than probative effect.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mastropetre, </em>175 Conn. 512, 521, 400 A.2d 276 (1978). Indeed, subsequent to <em>Chambers, </em>the United States Supreme Court expressly approved of a trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude a criminal defendant\u2019s \u201cclearly relevant\u201d evidence that \u201cwould tend to create more confusion than enlightenment in the minds of the jury . . . <em>Hamling v. United, States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 127, 94 S. Ct. 2887, 41 L. Ed. 2d 590, reh. denied, 419 U.S. 885, 95 S. Ct. 157, 42 L. Ed. 2d 129 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b282-12\"> We further note that the court\u2019s ruling did not entirely preclude the defendant from providing the jury with a factual basis for an inference that his concealment and nervousness were consistent with innocence. A police officer testified that the defendant had told him that he had been falsely accused, arrested and beaten in jail. In addition, Shelly Francini testified that whenever the police were around the defendant, he had acted \u201cnervous, scared,\u201d and he had behaved in that manner for \u201cyears. A few years.\u201d Francini further testified that the defendant\u2019s reaction to the questioning session by the police had been: \u201cThe same, nervous and tense, scared.\u201d As for the defendant\u2019s civil suit against the police, three police officers testified to their knowledge that it had been instituted, and one officer stated that he knew that the defendant did not have a \u201cparticularly fond relationship\u201d with the Bristol police. Defense counsel referred to much of this evidence during his closing argument, and urged the jury to infer that the defendant\u2019s lies and nervousness were susceptible of an innocent explanation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
