See <em>Blaker </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>212 Conn. 471, 562 A.2d 1093 (1989) <em>(Blaker I). </em>Baker-Firestone claims that the trial court, <em>Dean, J., </em>exceeded the scope of our remand order, and, moreover, substituted its own judgment for the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ment of the defendant planning and zoning commission of the town of Fairfield (commission), by determining that a protest petition filed by the plaintiffs was valid. We disagree with both contentions, and affirm the judgment sustaining the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The underlying facts of this case are set out fully in our earlier opinion, but we summarize them briefly. See <em>Blaker I, </em>supra, 473-76. Baker-Firestone applied for a zone amendment in order to build multifamily condominiums in Fairfield. The plaintiffs, fifteen local property owners,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a protest petition with the commission on the second of three days of public hearings. After the conclusion of the public hearings, Baker-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Firestone sent an ex parte letter to the commission setting forth its contention, never previously raised, that the petition did not meet the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, the commission at an executive session approved Baker-Firestone\u2019s application after a four to two vote, simply noting: \u201c[T]he staff reported that a valid protest petition was filed.\u201d The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court, claiming, inter alia, that \u201c(1) a protest petition sufficient to trigger the majority vote (two-thirds) provisions of C.G.S. \u00a7 8-3 (b) was filed; (2) the Commission failed to meet that requisite majority when it approved Baker\u2019s application.\u201d The court, <em>Stodolirik, J., </em>never explicitly decided these issues, but focused instead on the plaintiffs\u2019 further claim that the commission improperly considered the ex parte communication submitted by Baker-Firestone after the close of public hearings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court, in dismissing the appeal, concluded that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>munication was not improper and that the plaintiffs had the burden of proving prejudice, which they had not sustained. From that judgment, on the grant of certification, the plaintiffs appealed. This court vacated the judgment in part, holding that the ex parte communication was improper and that the burden of proving lack of prejudice rested on the defendants. <em>Blaker I, </em>supra, 476-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In our decision in <em>Blaker I, </em>we, like the trial court, focused on the issue of the ex parte communication.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We were aware that \u201cthe principal ground upon which the administrative appeal was based was the claim that a valid protest petition had been filed\u201d; id., 477 n.3; because it was undisputed that \u201cif a valid protest petition had been filed, then a four to two vote would have been insufficient in this case to approve the zoning change.\u201d Id., 476-77; <em>see Steiner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>149 Conn. 74, 175 A.2d 559 (1961). When a sufficient protest petition has been filed, \u00a7 8-3 (b) provides that a zone change \u201cshall not be adopted except by a vote of <em>two-thirds of all the members of the commission. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) We expressly declined to rule on the validity of the petition, however, because \u201c[t]he trial court made no finding upon the factual issue of the validity of the petition . . . [and] [a]s an appellate court, we obviously cannot resolve suoh a disputed issue.\u201d <em>Blaker I, </em>supra, 480. Instead, we declared that \u201cthe factual issue of the validity of the petition was adjudicated improperly because of the court\u2019s legal error in allocating the burden of proof on that issue to Jennings.\u201d We held that the trial court\u2019s conclusion, that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the commission\u2019s implicit rejection of the petition\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>validity had been procured through the submission of improper ex parte evidence, was tainted by its erroneous allocation to Jennings of the burden of proof with respect to prejudice. Thus, while we recognized that the petition\u2019s validity-remained the key issue in the case, we assumed, as did all parties, that the commission\u2019s implicit rejection of its validity was based upon its consideration of the Baker-Firestone communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Accordingly, we ordered: \u201cA further hearing must be held to permit the defendants to demonstrate that Baker-Firestone\u2019s ex parte submission was not prejudicial. At that time the defendants may submit evidence to show that the ex parte communication did not prejudice Jennings, because the petition did not bear the required signatures or because of some other reason, and Jennings will have the opportunity to refute that evidence.\u201d Id., 480. Then, after rejecting Jennings\u2019 other claims that the commission\u2019s approval was contrary to law, we concluded: \u201cThere is error in part, the judgment is set aside <em>with respect to the ex parte communication </em>and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">According to Baker-Firestone, the only issue on remand was the prejudicial impact of the ex parte communication. Thus, once Baker-Firestone had vindicated Judge Stodolink\u2019s decision by demonstrating that the letter had no prejudicial effect, the judgment dismissing the appeal would be effectively reinstated. We disagree with this interpretation of our remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">It is manifest that the central issue remaining after Judge Stodolink\u2019s decision was the validity of the petition, for, if the petition <em>was </em>valid, the vote was inadequate, the approval ineffective, and the appeal\u2019s success assured. Jennings\u2019 purpose in challenging the ex parte <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>communication was to remove any basis for the commission\u2019s implicit finding that the protest petition was invalid. If the plaintiffs had never raised the issue of the ex parte communication they would still have been entitled to challenge the adequacy of the vote by asserting the validity of the petition. It is absurd to suggest that we would foreclose the plaintiffs from pursuing a major issue simply because a trial court error led them to pursue a successful appeal on a related subordinate issue. On the contrary, we invited Baker-Firestone to present evidence with respect to the petition\u2019s validity so that the validity of the petition could be determined on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">At the remand hearing, Baker-Firestone steadfastly refused to address the petition\u2019s validity. Instead, it offered testimony by each living member of the commission who had voted. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each commission member testified that he had never seen, heard of, or been aware of the ex parte letter. Thus, Baker-Firestone insisted that it had adequately proved an absence of prejudice and that Judge Stodolink\u2019s judgment should be reinstated. It stood by its interpretation of the scope of the remand order even when the trial court, <em>Dean, J., </em>permitted the plaintiffs to cross-examine the members of the commission with regard to their own views of the petition\u2019s validity and their recollections of what transpired at the executive session.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Cross-examination revealed that the commission had never determined explicitly the petition\u2019s validity. Instead, the commission had decided to take a vote on the zone change, because a sufficient vote would have made it unnecessary to consider that issue. When the vote was four to two, the commission members, believing that such a vote was adequate for approval even if the petition was valid,* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> approved the application and did not investigate further the issue of its validity, although they were informed two days later by the town counsel that five votes were necessary to pass the application in the face of a valid petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">An administrative appeal \u201cshall be confined to the record.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (i); see <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Board of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>211 Conn. 508, 529-30, 560 A.2d 403 (1989). The only exception is that when \u201calleged irregularities in procedure before the agency are not shown in the record or if facts necessary to establish aggrievement are not shown in the record, proof limited thereto may be taken in the court.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (i). Thus, the court was entitled to take evidence with respect to the prejudicial effect of the ex parte submission, a \u201cprocedural irregularity.\u201d <em>See Martone </em>v. <em>Lensink, </em>215 Conn. 49, 51-52, 574 A.2d 803 (1990). Accordingly, our remand was intended to provide the defendants with an oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>tunity to show that the ex parte communication had not been prejudicial with respect to the determination that the protest petition was invalid, which we assumed the commission had made on the basis of Baker-Firestone\u2019s letter. We suggested that such lack of prejudice might be demonstrated by proving that the petition did not contain a sufficient number of signatures by property owners as required by \u00a7 8-3 (b), but also stated that \u201csome other reason\u201d might be shown to counteract the presumption of prejudice arising from the ex parte letter. The defendants chose to present no evidence concerning the validity of the petition, but limited their presentation to proof of another ground for lack of prejudice, the assertions of the commission members that they were not aware of the Baker-Firestone letter. Thus, they relinquished the opportunity afforded to contest the validity of the petition. They could have pursued such an attack in addition to the ground they did present.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The trial court properly recognized that \u201c[a] substantial injustice would occur if the remand were limited to the ex parte communication in that the [plaintiffs] . . . would be barred from having their claim concerning the vote reviewed\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is inconceivable that the Supreme Court intended that result.\u201d We had set aside the judgment upholding the commission\u2019s approval of the zone change, leaving the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal unresolved. Before a judgment disposing of the appeal could be rendered, it was essential first to resolve the central issue of the validity of the petition. Our remand \u201cfor further proceedings in accordance with this opinion\u201d was never intended to authorize the dismissal of the appeal without a determination of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The trial court was authorized to determine the issue of the validity of the petition, provided that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>before it was sufficient for that purpose. In this case, it was undisputed that the only evidence before the commission upon which it could have evaluated the petition\u2019s validity was a document prepared by the town planner, James Wendt, and Wendt\u2019s own testimony that he and the staff believed the petition to be valid. There was no evidence in the record contradicting the subordinate facts that formed the basis of Wendt\u2019s opinion. Without contradictory evidence in the record to support a finding of invalidity, the commission, and therefore the court, could have reached only one reasonable conclusion: that the petition was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Baker-Firestone complains that the trial court in effect shifted to it the burden of proving the petition\u2019s invalidity, in essence creating a presumption of validity in any petition purporting to qualify as a protest petition under \u00a7 8-3 (b). The plaintiffs contend that the trial court found as a fact that the commission had validated the petition, and that therefore the burden was properly upon Baker-Firestone to challenge the commission\u2019s determination with respect to the petition\u2019s validity. We disagree with both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The opinion of the trial court, <em>Dean, J., </em>may be read to suggest that the court was finding, as a fact, that the commission had actually decided the petition was valid. Such a conclusion, however, would not have adequate support in the record of the remand hearing. We construe the opinion to state, rather, that because there was no contradictory evidence in the record, the commission would have had no choice but to recognize the petition\u2019s validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">A protest petition is not presumptively valid. A commission may conclude either that such a petition is valid or that it is invalid. Since its conclusion that a petition is invalid is immaterial unless the commission goes on to rule in favor of the application that the petition con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>tested, that conclusion will usually be challenged in the context of a challenge to the commission\u2019s ruling in favor of the application. The party challenging an administrative decision always bears the burden of demonstrating that the decision was erroneous or improperly made. General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (j); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>172 Conn. 163, 171, 374 A.2d 168 (1976) (presumption of accuracy in factfinding of governmental officials); <em>Murach </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>196 Conn. 192, 205, 491 A.2d 1058 (1985) (presumption of regularity in administrative proceedings). Thus, one who appeals a favorable ruling by claiming that the petition was valid must bear the burden of proving its validity and, therefore, that the commission acted improperly because the petition was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Even when one party has the burden of proof with respect to an issue, however, that party must prevail if the only evidence presented<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with respect to that issue is favorable to his position and if that evidence is not contradicted. One who presents no countervailing evidence bears the risk that the plaintiff\u2019s proof will be persuasive. The commission was not required to believe Wendt any more than any factfinder is obligated to believe any expert. But it could not <em>reasonably </em>have rejected Wendt\u2019s opinion and factual statements <em>in the absence </em>of any contradictory evidence with respect to the petition\u2019s validity. The trial court was also entitled to infer, from Baker-Firestone\u2019s failure at the remand hearing to produce any evidence with respect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>petition\u2019s validity, that no evidence favorable to Baker-Firestone existed. Cf. <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Baker-Firestone claims that our decision denies it its day in court. It maintains that it was denied an opportunity to challenge the petition because it could not submit evidence to the executive session of the committee and because the petition was filed towards the end of the three day public hearing, too late to permit a full investigation into the sufficiency of the petition\u2019s signatures. The record indicates, however, that the petition was filed on the second day of the public hearing, at least three weeks before the last day of the hearing, and that seven more days intervened between the public hearing and the executive session.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Baker-Firestone never presented any evidence at the public hearing on the issue of the petition\u2019s validity and never sought to reopen the hearing on that issue, although the ex parte letter indicates that it was aware that the zoning commission\u2019s staff believed the petition to be valid. It never demanded that the parties be permitted to present evidence with respect to the petition\u2019s validity, but took it upon itself to send an ex parte letter to the commission which was received by Wendt on the very day of the executive session. At the remand hearing, Baker-Firestone had another opportunity to present evidence demonstrating the petition\u2019s invalidity, but, as a matter of strategy, chose not to do so. The trial court\u2019s decision to determine the validity of the petition on the evidence before it was an appropriate interpretation of the remand order and did not deprive Baker-Firestone of its right to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\"> The zoning appeal was filed by fifteen property owners, Richard H. Blaker, Edward A. Jennings, Dennis R. Andrasi, Gerard A. and Sharon Etzel, Sally P. Jennings, Karen P. Maloney, Judith A. and Robert J. Pustell, Robert L. Richards, Roberta G. and Thomas L. Springall, Charles R. Sprowl, Jr., and Gwendolyn L. and Alfred N. Nolan. The trial court, <em>Bums, J., </em>and, in a second order, <em>Gerety, J., </em>dismissed the appeals of all the plaintiffs except Edward Jennings. See <em>Blaker </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>212 Conn. 471, 472, 562 A.2d 1093 (1989) <em>(Blaker I). </em>The other property owners reserved the right to appeal after Jennings\u2019 claim was decided. When the trial court, <em>Stodolink, J., </em>decided against Jennings\u2019 appeal on the merits, all parties appealed to the Supreme Court; in their appeals, the other parties contested, as well as the final decision on the merits, the earlier decisions to dismiss their zoning appeals. Id., 476. We reversed the decision with respect to Jennings\u2019 appeal on the merits, and never reached the issue of the propriety of the court\u2019s dismissal of the other property owners\u2019 claims. Id. Apparently, however, counsel for all the original plaintiffs, including counsel for the dismissed property owners, participated without objection at the remand hearing, and all parties, including the dismissed property owners, have filed briefs and argued as appellees in the present appeal brought by Baker-Firestone now before this court. This time, however, the dismissed property owners have not challenged the dismissal of their zoning appeals. Because their actions were dismissed, and they do not now appeal those dismissals, their arguments on the merits of this case are legally irrelevant. In any event, their arguments are similar to those advanced by Jennings. Even had they cross appealed their dismissals, however, we would have no need to reach the issue of the propriety of the dismissals, since we are' affirming the judgment rendered by the trial court, <em>Dean, J., </em>which grants the dismissed property owners, as well as Jennings, all the relief they sought.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-5\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1985) \u00a7 8-3 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cestablishment AND CHANGING OF ZONING REGULATIONS AND DISTRICTS.

Instead, a favorable vote of two thirds of the members, present or not (i.e., five favorable votes), would have been required to approve the application. See <em>Blaker I, </em>supra, 477; <em>Steiner, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>149 Conn. 74, 175 A.2d 559 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\"> The plaintiffs themselves never presented any evidence to the commission.

Baker-Firestone appears to contend that unless petitioners file maps, certified copies of deeds and the like in support of their petition\u2019s validity, the petition should always be rejected as invalid under \u00a7 8-3 (b).
