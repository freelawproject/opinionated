Nonetheless, at the time of sentencing, County Court permitted defense counsel to present certain alleged mitigating circumstances in support of defendant\u2019s claim that youthful offender status was warranted. Upon considering the relevant factors, County Court declined defendant\u2019s request for youthful offender treatment and sentenced her to the agreed-upon prison term. Defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">We affirm. Given that defendant\u2019s guilty plea also included a waiver of her right to appeal, which the record reveals was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently entered, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>has failed to preserve her present contention that County Court abused its discretion in failing to adjudicate her a youthful offender (see, <em>People v Allen, </em>259 AD2d 835; <em>People v Fletcher, </em>245 AD2d 978, 979). In any event, were we to consider defendant\u2019s argument, we would reject it as lacking in merit. Notwithstanding defendant\u2019s lack of a prior criminal history and her limited participation in the crime charged, given the serious nature of the crime, which involved the robbery and assault of three elderly sisters in their home, and defendant\u2019s understanding that she would not be adjudicated a youthful offender as part of the plea agreement <em>(see, People v Martin, </em>254 AD2d 629; <em>People v Lloyd, </em>249 AD2d 623), we find no abuse of discretion in County Court\u2019s denial of youthful offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\">Cardona, P. J., Carpinello, Graffeo and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
