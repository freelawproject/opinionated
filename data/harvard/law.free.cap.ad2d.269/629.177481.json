Omaro, Petitioner, v Glenn S. Goord, as Commissioner of the New York State Department of Correctional Services, Respondent.</parties>\n<citation id=\"ANmm\">[701 NYS2d 923]</citation>\n\n\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"Ar1\">\u2014Proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 (transferred to this Court by order of the Supreme Court, entered in Albany County) to review a determination of respondent which found petitioner guilty of violating certain prison disciplinary rules.</p><p id=\"b689-8\">Following a tier III hearing, petitioner, a prison inmate, was found guilty of violating prison disciplinary rules prohibiting the solicitation of a sexual offense, threats, harassment and impersonation. Thereafter, petitioner commenced this CPLR article <em>78 </em>proceeding alleging certain procedural defects with respect to the hearing and the absence of substantial evidence to support respondent\u2019s determination of guilt.</p><p id=\"b689-9\">Contrary to petitioner\u2019s argument, the detailed misbehavior report, the testimony of the correction officers involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>incident and the letters sent to one of the correction counselors provided substantial evidence of petitioner\u2019s misconduct <em>(see, Matter of Sheppard v Goord, </em>264 AD2d 916).</p><p id=\"b690-3\">We have examined petitioner\u2019s allegations of Hearing Officer bias and, in light of the hearing transcript which demonstrates that the Hearing Officer informed petitioner of his rights and conducted a fair and impartial hearing, petitioner has failed to show that the outcome of the hearing was the result of any alleged bias <em>(see, Matter of McCorkle v Selsky, </em>264 AD2d 890). Any gaps in the hearing transcript were not so significant as to preclude meaningful review <em>(see, Matter of Miller v Goord, </em>262 AD2d 906). Petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments have been reviewed and are also found to be lacking in merit.</p><p id=\"b690-4\">Cardona, P. J., Crew III, Spain, Graffeo and Mugglin, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is confirmed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
