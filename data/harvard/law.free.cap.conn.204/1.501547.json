See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (11).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, Gregory Howard, was charged by substitute information with the crimes of burglary in the second degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102, and kidnapping in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was tried before a jury with a codefendant, Mark Jenkins, who was charged with the same crimes. The jury found the defendant guilty as charged on July 17, 1984. On August 20, 1984, the trial court, <em>Testo, J., </em>sentenced the defendant to concurrent terms of imprisonment for two years on the burglary count and ten years on the kidnapping count. After resentencing by the trial court, <em>Kinney, J., </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>same concurrent terms,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant has appealed to this court from the judgment of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-6\">This appeal is governed by our recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 580-81, 500 A.2d 539 (1985). In this case, as in <em>Sinclair, </em>the trial court properly instructed the jury that the state had the burden of proving the element of intent required for the commission of the crime, but did not include the statutory definition of intent in its instruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As in this case, the defendant in <em>Sinclair </em>also failed to take exception to the portion of the charge that he now challenges as erroneous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b17-7\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair </em>addressed both the procedural and the substantive aspects of the claimed error in the instruction on specific intent. We first determined that such a claim of error was reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 69-71, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), because a \u201cfailure adequately to instruct the jury on each essential element of the crime charged, including intent, might result in a due process violation implicating the fairness of [the] trial . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>supra, 580. Thereafter we concluded, upon reviewing the trial court\u2019s charge in its entirety, that, notwith<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>standing the omission of the statutory definition, the trial court had adequately instructed the jury on the requisite element of intent. \u201cJury instructions are calculated to give the jurors a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and to afford them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present. ... As long as the charge as given achieves these goals, it is constitutionally adequate.\u201d Id., 581.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">The defendant argues that <em>Sinclair </em>is distinguishable because in <em>Sinclair, </em>unlike this case, the trial court explained the ordinary meaning of intent to the jury and equated intent with criminal purpose. We disagree. The trial court\u2019s instructions in this case made it clear to the jury that proof of criminal intent was a necessary element of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree, and that it was the state\u2019s burden to prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt. We conclude that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s failure specifically to define intent, at least in the absence of a request or exception by the defendant, was not reversible error because it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled as to its meaning.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b16-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-3. definitions.

In that case, we concluded that the trial court, <em>Testo, J., </em>had improperly refused to exercise his discretion to consider imposing a lesser sentence on the kidnapping charge. Accordingly, we set aside the judgment and remanded the case for resentencing. As a result of the <em>Jenkins </em>decision, the judgment against this defendant was also set aside and the case remanded for resentencing. On August 15,1986, the trial court, <em>Kinney, J., </em>imposed a new sentence on the defendant identical to the one originally imposed by Judge Testo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b17-9\"> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 500 A.2d 539 (1985), the defendant was charged with and convicted of burglary in the second degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102.
