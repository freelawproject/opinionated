The petitioner, Donald Galland,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was convicted after a trial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>a jury of two counts of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4). The petitioner directly appealed to this court from the judgment of guilty, raising issues that principally related to his election to represent himself at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 480 A.2d 435 (1984).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following the release of this court's decision upholding the judgment below, the petitioner filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging that his confinement was illegal because a conviction of two counts of robbery cannot arise from a single bank robbery. Although the state, in its motion to quash, alleged that the petitioner properly should have raised this issue in his direct appeal, the trial court denied the petition on its merits. Because we find error in the court\u2019s failure to hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether the petitioner deliberately bypassed our appellate procedure with respect to the claim he now raises collaterally, we do not address the merits of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The crimes of which the defendant was found guilty arose out of an armed robbery of a New Haven bank on October 1, 1980. The defendant was charged with two counts of robbery in the first degree \u201cby virtue of having robbed two bank tellers at the same bank.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>supra, 537. In his appeal from the conviction, the defendant wrote his main brief, but received assistance in writing his reply brief from his standby appellate counsel. Both he and his standby counsel participated in the oral argument before this court. Id., 527 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">On September 26,1984, approximately three months after this court had released its decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>the petitioner filed his pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging \u201ctwo counts of robbery out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of one bank robbery is illegal.\u201d In his habeas brief, the petitioner, through counsel, contended that such a conviction violates the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. In response to question 3b on the petition form, \u201cDid you appeal the issue you claim in this petition and if not, why?\u201d the petitioner stated, \u201cNo, I just discovered it.\u201d In his brief, the respondent asserts that the \u201cpetitioner\u2019s real reason for subsequently raising this issue by writ of habeas corpus related to the decision of the sentence review panel which noted that the petitioner\u2019s exposure at the time of sentencing was twenty to forty years; an apparent factor in their affirming his sentence. Not only was the panel\u2019s decision affixed to appellant\u2019s petition and his pro se brief to the habeas court, but petitioner made numerous references to it during discussions with the habeas court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In this appeal from the denial of the petition,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the petitioner claims that the trial court erred in (1) not holding an evidentiary hearing on the merits of his double jeopardy claim, and (2) concluding that a person may be convicted of two counts of robbery where he has taken the bank\u2019s money from two tellers. Anticipating the necessity for this court to address the jurisdictional issue of deliberate bypass, the petitioner further asserts that his failure to raise his claim in the direct appeal was not deliberate but resulted from his self-representation, and that, in any event, the issue cannot be resolved without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Because the issue of deliberate bypass is jurisdictional in nature, we must consider whether this appeal is properly before us. See <em>Morin </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>192 Conn. 576, 579-80, 472 A.2d 1278 (1984); <em>Cajigas </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>179 Conn. 78, 81, 425 A.2d 571 (1979). Jurisdictional issues must be resolved before a decision on the merits may be rendered. See <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 238, 502 A.2d 410 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Malkowski, </em>189 Conn. 101, 104-105, 454 A.2d 275 (1983). Thus, the decision of the trial court not to address the deliberate bypass issue, which the state had raised in its motion to quash, was erroneous. Cf. <em>Pepe </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>203 Conn. 281, 287-88, 524 A.2d 629 (1987); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4056. Nevertheless, if this court can properly decide the jurisdictional issue on the record before us, we can then proceed to review the decision of the trial court on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">It is well established that habeas corpus cannot be used as an alternative to a direct appeal. <em>Cajigas </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra; <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>173 Conn. 360, 369, 377 A.2d 1108 (1977); <em>Vena </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>154 Conn. 363, 365, 225 A.2d 802 (1966). A petitioner may raise federal constitutional claims in a collateral proceeding, however, if he first alleges and establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not deliberately bypass the orderly procedure of direct appeal. <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 439, 83 S. Ct. 822, 9 L. Ed. 2d 837 (1963); <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 333, 337, 476 A.2d 1057 (1984); <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>193 Conn. 144, 146-47, 476 A.2d 543 (1984). \u201cThe deliberate bypass rule serves two important functions: (1) it encourages a litigant to have all constitutional claims resolved in a single proceeding economizing the time and resources of all concerned parties and bringing the case to a conclusion; and (2) it prevents a prisoner from deliberately deferring his claims of unlawful confinement until a time when a new trial, if required as a result of the col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>lateral proceeding, would be, for all practical purposes, impossible.\u201d <em>Paulsen </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 337-38; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>196 Conn. 567, 571, 494 A.2d 570 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">We have noted that the apparent harshness of the deliberate bypass rule has been softened somewhat by \u201crequiring that the record before us . . . disclose some reasonable basis for concluding that a convicted person has intelligently, understandingly and voluntarily waived his statutory right to appeal.\u201d <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra; see <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>201 Conn. 103, 108, 513 A.2d 132 (1986). Thus, it has been held that a finding of deliberate bypass cannot be made \u201cunless there is an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or a privilege.\u201d <em>Stubbs </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>533 F.2d 64, 69 (2d Cir. 1976); see also <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>supra; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S. Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938). The question of whether a petitioner has deliberately bypassed the orderly process of an appeal depends upon the varying facts in each case. See <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em>supra, 440; <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>183 Conn. 418, 429, 439 A.2d 430 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>157 Conn. 398, 402, 254 A.2d 570 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Special considerations ordinarily obtain when a petitioner has proceeded pro se. It has been stated that, in such a case, \u201ccourts should review habeas petitions with a lenient eye, allowing borderline cases to proceed. . . . The justification for this policy is apparent. If the writ of habeas corpus is to continue to have meaningful purpose, it must be accessible not only to those with a strong legal background or the financial means to retain counsel, but also to the mass of uneducated, unrepresented prisoners.\u201d <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Kullman, </em>722 F.2d 1048, 1050 (2d Cir. 1983); cf. <em>Meade </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>184 Conn. 597, 599, 440 A.2d 246 (1981); see generally note, \u201cDevelopments in the Law\u2014Federal Habeas Corpus,\u201d 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038, 1173-78 (1970). On the other hand, it is true that the right of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>self-representation provides no attendant license not to comply with relevant rules of procedural and substantive law. <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 834-35 n.46, 95 S. Ct. 2525, 45 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1975). In the context of the present case, the circumstances surrounding the petitioner\u2019s election to represent himself in the direct appeal, while not dispositive, should weigh in the determination of whether he deliberately refrained from raising his double jeopardy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Because the trial court held no evidentiary hearing on the issue of deliberate bypass, the record before us is inadequate to support a disposition of that issue at this time. The respondent asserts that \u201c[a]t all stages of the proceedings petitioner believed he could not be tried for two counts of robbery arising out of the one bank robbery.\u201d We cannot assume, however, that the petitioner acquired no new or additional information subsequent to his direct appeal that suggested to him the possible merit of a claim of error on double jeopardy grounds.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cIf called upon, petitioner may be able to present adequate reasons for not making the allegation earlier, reasons which make it fair and just for the trial court to overlook the delay.\u201d <em>Price </em>v. <em>John</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>ston, </em>334 U.S. 266, 291, 68 S. Ct. 1049, 92 L. Ed. 1356 (1948); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-470; Practice Book \u00a7 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the case must be remanded to the habeas court for an evidentiary hearing on the deliberate bypass issue. Until the jurisdictional issue is resolved, we refrain from determining whether the trial court was correct in its ruling on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded to the habeas court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-14\"> The petitioner was named in the substitute information as David Gethers a/k/a Don Galland. Apparently since that time, the petitioner\u2019s name has been legally changed to Donald Galland. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 527 n.1, 480 A.2d 435 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-8\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>197 Conn. 369, 370, 497 A.2d 408 (1985), a related case, involved the petitioner\u2019s appeal from his conviction of tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"> The trial court filed its memorandum of decision on March 5, 1985, before having received the petitioner\u2019s habeas brief. In that memorandum, the court ruled that \u201cmultiple counts, arising out of a single incident, [are] proper.\u201d Accordingly, ruled the court, \u201c[t]he petition is denied.\u201d Subsequently, the court granted the petitioner\u2019s oral motion to open the case. After receiving the petitioner\u2019s brief on the merits, the court, on June 6, 1985, issued a further memorandum of decision concluding that it would \u201cstand by its previous Memorandum of Decision and dismiss this petition for Habeas Corpus.\u201d We note that, because the trial court\u2019s determination was based upon the merits, we regard its disposition as a denial of the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b349-7\"> In making his contention, the respondent relies upon the following passage from our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>193 Conn. 526, 535, 480 A.2d 435 (1984): \u201cThat the defendant possessed \u2018the intelligence and capacity to appreciate the consequences of the decision to represent himself is apparent from even a casual reading of the transcript. Both in the trial court and before us he has appeared to be highly articulate, perceptive and quite capable of protecting his interests. It was he and not his counsel who first objected to the state\u2019s filing of a substitute information which contained a second robbery count. At the next court session he renewed this objection, pointing out its inconsistency with a written statement of the state\u2019s witness which he had examined.\u201d From this language it cannot be assumed, however, that the petitioner\u2019s objection at trial was not based wholly upon a factual, rather than a legal, ground. The final sentence of the quoted passage, for instance, suggests that the issue may have been whether one or two bank tellers had been robbed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
