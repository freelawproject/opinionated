Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akc\">The primary issue in this appeal and cross appeal is whether the trial court erred in ordering that the case be remanded to the defendant, the commissioner of the department of income maintenance, for a \u201cnew full hearing\u201d on the plaintiff Meta Harrison\u2019s application for assistance under the title XIX medical assistance program (Medicaid). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-134a et seq. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. On August 3, 1984, the plaintiff applied to the defendant for benefits pursuant to Medicaid. Prior to filing the application, the plaintiff, on September 30, 1983, had made gifts of $10,000 to each of her two daughters, retaining for herself assets of approximately $29,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of the transfers, the plaintiff had been living alone, had been confined to a \u201cbed/chair situation\u201d and had required the assistance of home health care professionals to meet her needs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On October 26, 1983, less than one month after she had made the transfers to her daughters, the plaintiff was admitted to the Ham-den Health Care Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">On December 4,1984, the defendant\u2019s district office issued a ruling on the plaintiffs application for Medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>caid benefits. The defendant denied the application on the ground that the plaintiff had transferred $20,000 in assets within two years of applying for assistance and had failed to demonstrate that these assets had been transferred exclusively for some purpose other than qualifying for assistance. The projected date of eligibility, barring any unforeseen expenses, was determined to be September 1, 1985.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">On December 21,1984, the plaintiff, alleging that she had been aggrieved by the denial of her application for Medicaid benefits, requested a fair hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17-2a. After a hearing had been held, the hearing officer, on March 13,1985, affirmed the district office\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s application, concluding that \u201c[w]hile it is probable [that] the [plaintiff] had in mind some other purpose than qualifying for assistance when she transferred the assets in question, the fact remains that in so doing she left herself unable to provide for her reasonably foreseeable needs for the next 24 months. When this is the case, the intent to bring about this result <em>must </em>be inferred and the individual is ineligible for assistance.\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">On April 3, 1985, the plaintiff filed a timely appeal in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 et seq. The Superior Court, on March 4,1986, issued an order remanding the matter for a \u201cnew full hearing before a departmental hearing officer . . . .\u201d In its memorandum of decision, the court confirmed the factual findings of the hearing officer noting also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>that \u201c[t]he remaining $29,183.00 in and of itself was sufficient to disqualify the [plaintiff] for Title XIX [Medicaid] assistance . . . .\u201d Although the court concluded that the department hearing officer had not acted arbitrarily, illegally or in an abuse of his discretion, the court remanded the matter for a \u201cnew full hearing\u201d presumably because it had found that the plaintiff <em>\u201cmay not have failed to show </em>that the $20,000.00 transfer of assets was done exclusively for some other purpose, other than qualifying for assistance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">On March 26, 1986, the defendant filed an appeal from the judgment of the trial court in the Appellate Court, and on April 3, 1986, the plaintiff filed a cross appeal. On February 18, 1987, this court transferred the appeal and cross appeal to itself. Practice Book \u00a7 4023.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On the appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court, after having concluded that the department hearing officer had not acted arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of his discretion in denying the plaintiffs application, erred in remanding the matter to the department for a new full hearing. On the cross appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in (1) \u201cremanding the case for further proceedings when the plaintiff had met her burden of proof\u201d that the transfer was done for some purpose other than qualifying for assistance and \u201cthe hearing officer had so found,\u201d and (2) finding that the actions of the defendant were not illegal, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In order properly to address the merits of the claims raised by the parties, we must first set out the relevant statutory framework for determining eligibility for title XIX assistance. The relevant statutes are found in General Statutes \u00a7 17-134a et seq. and 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\u00a7 1382 etseq.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 17-134b (a) provides in part: \u201cMedical assistance shall be provided for any otherwise eligible person ... if such person has not made, within twenty-four months prior to the date of application for such assistance, an assignment or transfer or other disposition of property for less than fair market value for the purpose of establishing eligibility for benefits or assistance under this section. Any such disposition shall be presumed to have been made for the purpose of establishing eligibility for benefits or assistance unless such person furnishes <em>convincing evidence </em>to establish that the transaction was exclusively for some other purpose.\u201d See also Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 17-2-180.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 1396p (c) (1) of title 42 of the United States Code provides in part: \u201cIf the State plan provides for the denial of such [medical] assistance by reason of [a disposal of resources for less than fair market value within the 24 months preceding the date of application], the State plan shall specify a procedure for implementing such denial which ... is not more restrictive than the procedure specified in [42 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1382b (c) . . . . \u201d Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>1382b (c) (2) provides: \u201cAny [such] transaction . . . shall be presumed to have been made for the purpose of establishing eligibility for benefits or assistance under this chapter unless such individual . . . furnishes <em>convincing evidence </em>to establish that the transaction was exclusively for some other purpose.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1246 (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">To aid in determining whether a transfer has been made exclusively for some purpose other than establishing eligibility, the defendant has included a provision in the department policy manual, which the plaintiff refers to as the \u201cforeseeability test,\u201d that provides that if an applicant has failed to retain sufficient assets to meet his reasonably foreseeable needs for twenty-four months after the transfer, <em>\u201cit must be inferred\u201d </em>that that transfer was not made exclusively for some other purpose and that the applicant, except in circumstances not applicable to this case, <em>\u201cmust </em>be found ineligible for assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>is apparent from the memorandum of decision issued by the hearing officer that, in denying the plaintiff\u2019s application, this provision of the department policy manual was relied upon by the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">It will be helpful if we address first the claims raised by the plaintiff in her cross appeal. The plaintiff\u2019s first claim is that the trial court erred in \u201cremanding the case for further proceedings when the plaintiff had met her burden of proof and the hearing officer had so found.\u201d In making this claim, the plaintiff focuses on the following language of the hearing officer: \u201cWhile it is probable the [plaintiff had in mind some other purpose than qualifying for assistance when she transferred [the assets in question], the fact remains that in so doing she left herself unable to provide for her reasonably foreseeable needs for the next 24 months.\u201d She also relies on the following conclusion of the trial court: \u201cLooking at this case in its totality, and in view of the fact that [the plaintiff] retained $29,188 and interest on that sum, more than enough to render [the plaintiff] ineligible for Title XIX aid, this writer believes that the [plaintiff] may not have failed to show that the $20,000 transfer of assets was done exclusively for some other purpose, other than qualifying for assistance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The plaintiff argues that from the language quoted above, it is clear that the hearing officer found that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>had met her burden of proof but denied eligibility because of a mechanical application of the \u201cforeseeability test as set out in the department policy manual.\u201d The plaintiff interprets the trial court\u2019s ruling quoted above as \u201cproperly ignoring the illegal foreseeability test,\u201d which requires a mandatory presumption with only limited exceptions. The plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s remand for a new hearing is unnecessary because the hearing officer did find \u201cessentially that the statutory burden had been met.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The quoted passage of the hearing officer, that it is \u201cprobable\u201d that the plaintiff may have had in mind \u201csome other purpose,\u201d falls far short of the finding necessary to rebut successfully the presumption established by state and federal law, namely, that the applicant \u201cestablish that the transaction was <em>exclusively </em>for some other purpose.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382b (c) (2). To say that some purpose was \u201cprobable\u201d is not the same as <em>finding </em>that it was the <em>exclusive </em>purpose motivating the transfer. A new hearing is therefore necessary to determine the purpose of the transfer. At all times, the burden of establishing eligibility is on the applicant. <em>Lavine </em>v. <em>Milne, </em>424 U.S. 577, 583-84, 96 S. Ct. 1010, 47 L. Ed. 2d 249 (1976). The trial court did not err in remanding the case for a \u201cnew full hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s second claim is that the trial court erred in concluding that the hearing officer did not act arbitrarily, unreasonably, or in abuse of discretion. It is the plaintiff\u2019s position that the standard set forth in the department policy manual, as applied by the hearing officer, is not permissible under state and federal law and, therefore, the hearing officer\u2019s application of that standard was unreasonable and an abuse of discretion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>We are aware that \u201c[i]n reviewing the action of an administrative agency the trial court must accept the evidence presented to such agency uncoated by any judicial gloss. \u2018Conclusions reached by an administrative body must be upheld by the court if they are supported by the evidence that was before the administrative body. <em>Balch Pontiac-Buick, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>165 Conn. 559, 563, 345 A.2d 520 [1973]. ... It is not the function of the court to retry the case. The question is not whether the trial court would have reached the same conclusion but whether the record before the commission supports the action taken. <em>Conley </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>143 Conn. 488, 492, 123 A.2d 747 [1956].\u2019 <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>175 Conn. 409, 414, 399 A.2d 834 (1978).\u201d <em>Hospital of St. Raphael </em>v. <em>Commission on Hospitals &amp; Health Care, </em>182 Conn. 314, 318, 438 A.2d 103 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">The grant of authority allowing judicial review of agency action includes the authority to review the propriety of the standards relied upon by the defendant in effecting its delegated duties. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 336, 348, 362 A.2d 505 (1975). It is fundamental that an agency must act within its statutory mandate and that it has no authority to modify, abridge or otherwise change the statutory provisions under which it acquires authority. <em>Phelps Dodge Copper Products Co. </em>v. <em>Groppo, </em>204 Conn. 122, 128, 527 A.2d 672 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">It is clear from what we have set out that the pertinent provision of the department policy manual, as applied by the hearing officer, is inconsistent with the federal and state statutes, as well as the federal and state regulations, in that the department policy manual sets forth a stricter standard for overcoming the presumption of purpose. The statutes and the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tions provide that regardless of the fact that a transfer has been made in the previous twenty-four months, a person can establish eligibility if that person furnishes <em>convincing evidence </em>to establish that the transaction was made exclusively for some purpose other than qualifying for assistance. The department policy manual, however, provides that if, after the transfer, \u201cthe individual has left himself unable to provide for his own support for twenty-four months ... an intent to bring about this result <em>must be inferred . . . . </em>\u201d (Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 1 Conn. Dept, of Income Maintenance Manual, c. III, Index 326 (L). Indeed, the hearing officer actually concluded that the plaintiffs intent to render herself eligible for assistance <em>\"must </em>be inferred.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Because this inference, as applied by the hearing officer, was mandatory and thus without regard to whether the plaintiff presented \u201cconvincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for some other purpose\u201d than qualifying for assistance, the department policy was not applied consistently with the federal and state statutes or the applicable regulations. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382b (c) (2); see <em>Buckner </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>424 F. Sup. 366, 373 (D. Conn. 1976), aff'd, 434 U.S. 898, 98 S. Ct. 290, 54 L. Ed. 2d 184 (1977); <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>White, </em>supra, 348-49. The hearing officer\u2019s application of this presumption was therefore erroneous and an abuse of discretion. A new hearing is required. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-183 (g). The purpose of the hearing is to establish the intent of the plaintiff; that is, to determine whether the plaintiff has furnished \u201cconvincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for some other purpose\u201d than qualifying for assistance. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382b (c) (2); General Statutes \u00a7 17-134b.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">On the appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court erred in remanding the case for a new hearing after it had found that the agency had not acted illegally, arbitrarily, or in abuse of discretion in denying the plaintiffs application. The defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s finding is \u201cincompatible and, indeed, inconsistent with a remand.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> While we agree that, absent a finding that the hearing officer acted arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion, a remand order is improper, we disagree with the finding by the trial court that the hearing officer did not act arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of discretion. As we have concluded in part II above, the hearing officer acted erroneously by applying the standard set forth in the department policy manual to the plaintiff\u2019s application. Thus, the decision of the hearing officer cannot stand. A new hearing is necessary to determine whether the plaintiff acted exclusively for some purpose other than to qualify for assistance in transferring the $10,000 gifts to her daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-8\"> Pursuant to the standard set forth in <em>Schieffelin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>202 Conn. 405, 409-11, 521 A.2d 566 (1987), the judgment of the trial court ordering further administrative proceedings is an appealable final judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b687-9\"> At this time, the plaintiff also had a monthly income of $624.86 in railroad retirement benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b687-10\"> The hearing officer found that one of the plaintiffs daughters, Lois Lincoln, paid, on behalf of her mother, approximately $1450 for these services from 1978 through the spring of 1983 and that there had not been a written or oral agreement that the plaintiff would repay her daughter for these expenditures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\"> The district office found that the plaintiffs monthly pension and the retained assets would pay for the cost of the plaintiffs care through September 18, 1984. The document denying eligibility projected the date of eligibility to be September 1, 1985. Thus, the period of ineligibility due to the transfers, which is in dispute in this case, is approximately eleven and one-half months. The plaintiff was, in fact, granted eligibility for Medicaid benefits on September 1, 1985, the date projected in the December 4, 1984 denial. This appeal, therefore, concerns only the plaintiffs eligibility for assistance from the date of her application until September 1, 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b690-5\"> The purpose of the medical assistance program is to allow a state, as far as practicable, to furnish medical assistance to individuals \u201cwhose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396. By enacting certain \u201ctransfer of assets\u201d provisions, state and federal law have attempted to prevent the government from having to subsidize the care of individuals who are in a position to pay the cost of such care out of their own income or resources.
