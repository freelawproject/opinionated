He was found guilty as charged by the jury and was subsequently sentenced by the trial court to a term of ten years imprisonment. The defendant has appealed claiming that the trial court erred by: (1) failing to suppress both in-court and out-of-court identifications; (2) admitting into evidence his prior misconduct, his conviction for harassment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his violation of probation; and (3) commenting unfairly on the evidence in its instructions to the jury. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-4\">The <em>jury </em>could reasonably have found the following facts: On October 17,1984, at approximately 11 p.m., brothers Steve and Kenneth Dacunha noticed a fire in the rear yard at 41 Woodmere Road in West Hartford, across the street from Kenneth\u2019s home. The two men ran to the scene and observed flames about two feet in height, confined to a strip of ground approximately 18 inches wide and 20 to 30 feet in length. Kenneth smothered the flames with his jacket and called the West Hartford fire department. While awaiting the arrival of the firemen, the two inspected the area of the blaze by flashlight. They smelled an odor of gasoline and saw a strip of liquid extending from a burned area of ground across the driveway to an exterior wooden porch at the rear of the house. They also observed that the rear porch was totally saturated with gasoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">Shortly thereafter, police and fire officials arrived at the scene. They roused the occupants of the house, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Olive Crompton and her daughter, Denise, and conducted an investigation. Deputy Chief Matteo Pascarelli of the fire department suspected arson. He testified that he had observed a \u201ctrailer\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of gasoline extending across the driveway to the back porch and that the back porch was \u201cpretty well covered\u201d with gasoline. He opined that had the fire reached the back porch it would have ignited the house and developed into a \u201cmajor working fire\u201d within ten minutes. He also testified that if the fire had reached the house it would have blocked access from the second floor to the first floor and prevented escape by way of the rear door. Deputy Chief Fire Marshall Richard Kane confirmed the fact that the fire had been deliberately set.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-6\">The occupants of the house, the Cromptons, were tenants. The house was owned by Lee Rice and was for sale. Prior to renting the house to the Cromptons, Rice, who had been romantically involved with the defendant since 1980, had lived there with him for approximately one year. The defendant was familiar with the house and had made various repairs to it, including repairs to the rear porch. After Rice had rented the house to the Cromptons, she and the defendant had moved to Rowe Avenue in Hartford where they continued to live together until early in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">On February 12,1984, Rice terminated her relationship with the defendant because he had misappropriated $609 of her money, which she had earmarked for a mortgage payment on her West Hartford house. The defendant, who was upset and angry that Rice had ended their affair, moved out of the Rowe Avenue house the next day. Thereafter, the defendant harassed Rice in a misguided effort to revive their romantic relationship. On October 18, 1984, the day following the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>fire the defendant telephoned Rice and, laughing, said, \u201ctry and sell that house now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">As a result of an investigation, during which the defendant was identified as having purchased gasoline in a container at a Hartford gasoline service station on the night of either October 16 or 17, 1984, he was arrested and charged with arson in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">The defendant first claims that the trial court erred by failing to suppress both in-court and out-of-court identifications by two witnesses, Patricia Parrott and Tammey Arnett. He contends that their identifications of him resulted from an unnecessarily suggestive procedure and were unreliable, and that the admission of their testimony violated his federal and state constitutional rights to due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">The following testimony was elicited relating to the issue of the identification of the defendant by Parrott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and Arnett: In October, 1984, Parrott was employed as a cashier at the self-service island of an Exxon service station located at the corner of Park Street and Prospect Avenue in Hartford. Arnett was a friend of Parrott\u2019s, often visiting Parrott and keeping her company in the cashier\u2019s booth during the evening hours. On October 23, 1984, while conducting a canvass of area service stations in connection with the investigation of the fire at 41 Woodmere Road, Detective Joseph Benequisto of the West Hartford police department interviewed Parrott and Arnett. During the course of the interview, he showed them a single police \u201cmug shot\u201d which was a front and side view of the defendant. He then inquired whether the man depicted in the police photograph had purchased gasoline in a container at the station during the previous week. At that time neither Parrott nor Arnett was able to identify the person shown in the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Two days later, however, on October 25,1984, when the defendant drove into the same Exxon station to purchase gasoline for his automobile, both Parrott and Arnett immediately recognized him as the man who had purchased gasoline in a container late in the evening on either October 16 or 17, 1984. Parrott and Arnett both testified that when they saw the defendant the second time, they recognized and remembered him because of his distinctive appearance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the defendant left the service station on October 25,1984, Parrott wrote down the number of the temporary registration marker on his automobile and called the West Hartford police.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">Later Parrott and Arnett gave statements to the police identifying the driver of the automobile on October 25,1984, as the same man who had purchased gaso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>line in a container at the Exxon station the previous week. Subsequently, at trial, both Parrott and Arnett positively identified the defendant as the driver of the automobile on October 25,1984, and as the person who had purchased gasoline in a container on October 16 or 17, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u201cIn determining whether identification procedures violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights, the required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, and second, if it is found to be so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on an examination of the \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>182 Conn. 366, 371-72, 438 A.2d 432 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>203 Conn. 81, 93, 523 A.2d 495 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>199 Conn. 308, 310, 507 A.2d 99 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>196 Conn. 289, 292-93, 493 A.2d 836 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">In this case, the trial court found that the display of a single photograph of the defendant by Benequisto, coupled with his inquiry, was unnecessarily suggestive. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>200 Conn. 350, 355-56, 511 A.2d 1006 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>supra. The state does not, on appeal, dispute that finding. We must, therefore, consider whether, based on an examination of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d the identifications were nevertheless reliable. <em>State </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>195 Conn. 496, 499, 488 A.2d 1250 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">The factors to be considered in determining the reliability of an identification subsequent to a suggestive identification procedure \u201cinclude the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>between the crime and the confrontation. Against these factors is to be weighed the corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S. Ct. 2243, 53 L. Ed. 2d 140 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cubano, </em>supra, 95; <em>State </em>v. <em>Collette, </em>supra, 311 n.3; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 295-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Since neither Parrott nor Arnett was a victim of the arson in question or a witness to its actual occurrence, an analysis of the circumstances of their identifications of the defendant does not fit neatly into the <em>Manson </em>matrix of factors normally considered in determining reliability. The factors considered in <em>Manson, </em>however, are not required to be present seriatim for an identification to be found reliable. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Merkt, </em>794 F.2d 950, 958 (5th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 946, 107 S. Ct. 1603, 94 L. Ed. 2d 789 (1987); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woolery, </em>740 F.2d 359, 360-61 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1208, 105 S. Ct. 1172, 84 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1985). We must examine the circumstances that did exist and determine on the whole whether any suggestiveness in the identification procedure created a very substantial risk of misidentification. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Merkt, </em>supra; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Woolery, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fullwood, </em>193 Conn. 238, 245, 476 A.2d 550 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">In this instance we think that it did not. Although neither Parrott nor Arnett recognized the person in the photograph when it was displayed to them by Detective Benequisto on October 23, 1984, both indicated, at that time, that the subject of the photograph looked familiar, and both expressed the thought that they had previously seen the man depicted. Parrott also recalled, when interviewed by the detective, that someone had recently purchased gasoline in a container, but she could not be sure whether he was the man shown in the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">At trial, however, both Parrott and Arnett were positive of their in-court identifications of the defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>They testified that on seeing him for a second time on October 25,1984, their memories were triggered and they recalled his initial visit to the station during the middle of the previous week. Both said they were able to remember the defendant clearly because of his distinctive appearance and because both thought it strange that anyone would purchase gasoline in a container late at night in October. While they also realized that the defendant was the person shown in the police photograph, both clearly possessed a stronger, independent recollection of the defendant from the viewing of his person on the night of their first encounter. The trial court found corroboration for these independent recollections on the part of the witnesses in the fact that there was a \u201clack of similarity\u201d between the defendant\u2019s appearance in the photograph displayed and his corporeal appearance. The trial court noted that the photograph shown to the witnesses did not reveal the \u201chighlights of the defendant\u2019s skin coloring, nor show the whiteness of [his] hair.\u201d See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 474, 522 A.2d 249 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Further, it appears from the record that the witnesses\u2019 recollection of the defendant\u2019s appearance was not based on fleeting glances. On both occasions when Parrott and Arnett observed him, he was in close proximity for some minutes and they \u201c[got] a good look at him\u201d in the well lighted self-service area. While he was not the subject of close scrutiny on the first occasion, Parrott and Arnett testified that their attention was drawn to him to a certain extent because business was slow at the time and because his purchase was somewhat unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">We conclude, therefore, that although \u201cwe examine the legal question of reliability with exceptionally close scrutiny and defer less than we normally do to the related factfinding of the trial court\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>185 Conn. 402, 416, 441 A.2d 119 (1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 989, 102 S. Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982); the trial court in this instance could reasonably have found that the corrupting influence of the photograph was minimal and that the identification procedure did not result in a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, and that the identifications were sufficiently reliable to be considered by the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u201cThe exclusion of evidence from the jury is, however, a drastic sanction, one that is limited to identification testimony which is manifestly suspect.\u201d <em>Harker </em>v. Maryland, 800 F.2d 437, 443 (4th Cir. 1986). Absent a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, \u201c[w]e are content to rely upon the good sense and judgment of American juries, for evidence with some element of untrustworthiness is customary grist for the jury mill. Juries are not so susceptible that they cannot measure intelligently the weight of identification testimony that has some questionable feature.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra, 116. There was no error in the admission of Parrott\u2019s and Arnett\u2019s identification testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The defendant next complains that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior misconduct and his convictions of harassment and violation of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">At trial, the state was allowed to introduce evidence, through the testimony of Rice and several other witnesses, that the defendant had been harassing Rice since she had terminated her relationship with him. The testimony revealed that at various times over a period of months the defendant had slashed the tires on Rice\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>automobile, put sugar in the gas tank, and caused it damage by deliberately ramming it with his automobile. He had also, among other things, stolen her mail, threatened her, followed her, and annoyed her with constant telephone calls, both at home and at her place of employment. Further, he had made disturbing telephone calls to Rice\u2019s mother, sister, friends and associates. He had admitted his conduct to Rice and to other witnesses who had testified to it at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The trial court instructed the jury, during the course of the trial and again in its final charge, that testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s misconduct prior to the date of the fire was not admitted into evidence to show that the defendant was possessed of a bad character, or to demonstrate that he had a propensity to commit crimes or to behave poorly. The trial court made it abundantly clear that the only purpose for which the evidence was admitted, and the only purpose for which it could be utilized, was to prove the defendant\u2019s state of mind in regard to Rice on October 17,1984, as evidence of his possible intent to damage or destroy her property and his motive for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">Intent is an element of the crime charged and as such was required to be proved by the prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 361, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1970); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pellegrino, </em>194 Conn. 279, 294, 480 A.2d 537 (1984). \u201cMotive is not an element of the crime charged, and the state is under no obligation to show a motive for the accused to commit the crime charged.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Annunziato, </em>169 Conn. 517, 530, 363 A.2d 1011 (1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rathbun, </em>74 Conn. 524, 529, 51 A. 540 (1902). Such evidence is, however, important. <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>182 Conn. 220, 224, 438 A.2d 38 (1980). \u201cIt strengthens the state\u2019s case when an adequate motive can be shown.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>As a general rule, evidence of guilt of other crimes or misconduct is inadmissible to prove that a defendant is guilty of the crimes charged against him. <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>200 Conn. 268, 273, 511 A.2d 321 (1986); C. McCormick, Evidence (3d Ed. 1984) \u00a7 190; 1 F. Wharton, Criminal Evidence (13th Ed. 1972) \u00a7 170. Because of its prejudicial impact, it is well settled that evidence of prior acts of misconduct is inadmissible merely to show a defendant\u2019s bad character or tendency to commit criminal acts. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>190 Conn. 541, 548, 461 A.2d 981 (1983). \u201cEvidence of other misconduct, however, \u2018may be allowed for the purpose of proving many different things, such as <em>intent, </em>identity, malice, <em>motive </em>or a system of criminal activity.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ibraimov, </em>[187 Conn. 348, 352, 446 A.2d 382 (1982)].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Braman, </em>191 Conn. 670, 675-76, 469 A.2d 760 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Such evidence is admissible if the trial court, in the exercise of its sound discretion, determines that its probative value, for one or more of the purposes for which it is admissible, outweighs its prejudicial impact on the accused. <em>State </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>supra, 274; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 23-24, 444 A.2d 213 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>182 Conn. 335, 338, 438 A.2d 107 (1980). \u201cBecause of the difficulties inherent in this balancing process, the trial court\u2019s decision will be reversed only where abuse of discretion is manifest or where an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 548-49. On appellate review by this court we must give every reasonable presumption in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Barlow, </em>177 Conn. 391, 394, 418 A.2d 46 (1979). The crime in this case was a seemingly inexplicable act of destruction. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior misconduct directed toward the owner of the house, which was the target of the arson, provided probative evidence of the defendant\u2019s intent and motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>in starting the fire. We cannot say that the trial court erred in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">The defendant also mentions in his statement of issues and in his brief a claim that the trial court erred when it allowed the state to produce evidence of his guilty plea to harassment and his subsequent arrest for and his admission to a violation of his probation. The defendant has, however, failed to brief either of these issues. His brief is limited to a discussion of the admissibility of testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s behavior, which the court allowed as evidence of prior misconduct. Issues not briefed are considered abandoned. \u201c \u2018Assignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court. . . .\u2019 \u201d Hayes v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 66 n.12, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Strasburger, </em>168 Conn. 135, 142, 357 A.2d 905 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Even if we were to consider these issues, it would not affect the result. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea to a charge of harassment and his subsequent admission to violation of the conditions of his probation were, under the circumstances, admissions of prior misconduct which were properly admitted into evidence. See <em>Grosso </em>v. <em>Frattolillo, </em>111 Conn. 209, 212, 149 A. 838 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">The defendant finally complains that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury by commenting on the evidence in a manifestly unjust, unfair and prejudicial manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">The defendant took no relevant exceptions to the court\u2019s charge, nor as far as can be determined from the record, did he file any requests to charge. On this appeal, however, he has launched a wholesale attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>on the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. He claims that the trial court in its charge overemphasized the evidence elicited in support of the state\u2019s case, but failed to comment on evidence favorable to the defendant or detrimental to the state. He contends that, as a result, he was deprived of a fair trial and, consequently, his constitutional right to due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We need not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the jury charge because he has failed to comply with the mandatory procedures of this court. <em>Weintraub </em>v. <em>Richard Dahn, Inc., </em>188 Conn. 570, 571, 452 A.2d 117 (1982). When claiming error in the charge to the jury, a party must include in its brief a <em>verbatim </em>statement of all relevant portions of the court\u2019s charge and the exceptions thereto. Practice Book \u00a7 4065 (d) (2) (formerly \u00a7 3060F [c] [2]). Also, evidence relevant to the error must be printed in <em>narrative form </em>with appropriate references to the transcript. Practice Book \u00a7 4065. Because the defendant\u2019s brief does not comply with these provisions of the Practice Book, and our perusal of the record discloses no reason to depart from them, we decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim further. <em>Weintraub </em>v. <em>Richard Dahn, Inc., </em>supra, 572; <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>187 Conn. 94, 98, 444 A.2d 907 (1982); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Levy, </em>183 Conn. 517, 518, 441 A.2d 10 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b19-16\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-lll. arson in the first degree: class a felony, (a) A person is guilty of arson in the first degree when, with intent to destroy or damage a building, as defined in section 53a-100, he starts a fire or causes an explosion, and (1) the building is inhabited or occupied or the person has reason to believe the building may be inhabited or occupied; or (2) any other person is injured, either directly or indirectly; or (3) such fire or explosion was caused for the purpose of collecting insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>anee proceeds for the resultant loss; or (4) at the scene of such fire or explosion a peace officer or firefighter is subjected to a substantial risk of bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b20-7\"> \u201c{General Statutes] Sec. 53a-183. harassment: class c misdemeanor.
