The defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The trial court, in its oral memorandum of decision, found the following facts: The defendant, at all relevant times, owned a three story apartment building at 901 North Main Street in Waterbury. During the late evening hours of November 10, 1984, or the early morning hours of November 11, 1984, a fire broke out in the second floor apartment. The fire, which started in a living room chair, was caused by some sort of \u201cdiscarded smoking materials,\u201d and smoldered before igniting. The fire was not discovered until approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>1:30 a.m. when David Thompson, an occupant of the second floor apartment, awoke, coughing because of the smoke. By the time Thompson had discovered the fire, it was well past the smoldering phase, and the heat and flames were so intense that he could not enter the kitchen. Thompson attempted to arouse the rest of the occupants of the apartment and stated that had he been aware of the fire earlier, he would have been able to lead other members of the apartment to safety. Of the nine occupants living in the second floor apartment, five perished in the fire, the cause of death for each being asphyxia due to smoke inhalation.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Anna Mitchell, an occupant of the third floor apartment, became aware of the fire when she heard scuffling on the second floor and someone yelling \u201cFire!\u201d Mitchell opened the front hallway door of her apartment, but was confronted with black smoke, heat and flames. She then went to the back hallway door, but was again faced with smoke, heat and fire. Although Mitchell escaped, three of the seven occupants of the third floor apartment died from asphyxia due to smoke inhalation. Mitchell also testified that had she been alerted to the fire earlier, she would have had the opportunity to lead the other occupants of the apartment to safety. The apartment building was not equipped with smoke detectors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The trial court found that smoke detectors are designed to detect fires before persons become aware of them, and consequently, provide an early warning system for the detection of fires. Because smoldering fires take longer to reach intense proportions than fires of an explosive nature, the court concluded that had there been smoke detectors in the second and third floor apartments, the occupants would have been warned of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the fire before it reached the level of intensity when first discovered by Thompson and Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The court also found that the defendant knew or should have known that smoke detectors were required by the state fire safety code because he had received notice from the Waterbury health department regarding other properties he had owned, informing him that smoke detectors were required in those buildings. The court then determined that by not installing smoke detectors in the building located on 901 North Main Street, the defendant had violated Connecticut State Fire Safety Code \u00a7 11-1.8.1. Accordingly, the court found the defendant guilty of failing to provide smoke detectors in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 29-292 and 29-295 and in violation of Connecticut State Fire Safety Code \u00a7 11-1.8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The trial court also found the defendant guilty on all eight counts of criminally negligent homicide in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-58. Initially, the court reasoned that the defendant had both a statutory duty, imposed by the state fire safety code, and a common law duty to install smoke detectors in his apartment building, and had breached those duties by failing to do so. The court further ^reasoned that the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s negligence rose to the level of criminal negligence. Citing the conditions of the building, the inexpensive cost and relative ease of installing smoke detectors, and the increased chance of death from fire in buildings which do not have smoke detectors, the court concluded that the defendant had failed to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death and that such a failure was a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the same situation. Additionally, the court held that the defendant\u2019s failure to install the detectors was the proximate cause of the victims\u2019 deaths. Accordingly, the court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>that the defendant was criminally negligent as defined by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (14).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, claiming, inter alia, that the state fire safety code\u2019s enabling act was unconstitutionally vague and that the state could not prove, as a matter of law, that the defendant was guilty of criminally negligent homicide for failing to install smoke detectors. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion in its entirety. At the close of the state\u2019s case, the defendant unsuccessfully moved for a judgment of acquittal, claiming that the state had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had caused the victims\u2019 deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The defendant now appeals claiming that: (1) the pertinent statutes defining criminal culpability for violations of the state fire safety code are unconstitutionally vague and in violation of his right to due process;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) the state fire safety code and General Statutes \u00a7 29-292 do not require that smoke detectors be installed in the defendant\u2019s building because no building permit was issued for the building on or after Octo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ber 1, 1976; (3) statutorily mandated inspections and notice of code violations must precede the enforcement of the fire safety code and its underlying criminal sanctions; (4) the trial court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal because he did not grossly deviate from the standard of care of a reasonably prudent person; (5) the court erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal because the defendant\u2019s conduct was not the proximate cause of the deaths of the victims; and (6) the court failed to disqualify itself after ruling on the defendant\u2019s pretrial motions to dismiss.

White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 528 A.2d 811 (1987), we find error.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">There is error, the judgment of the trial court is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-14\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-58. criminally negligent homicide: class A misdemeanor, (a) A person is guilty of criminally negligent homicide when, with criminal negligence, he causes the death of another person, except where the defendant caused such death by a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"ANjZ\">\u201c(b) Criminally negligent homicide is a class A misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1985)] Sec. 29-292.
