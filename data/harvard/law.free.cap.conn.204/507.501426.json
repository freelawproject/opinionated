Volck, appealed to the Superior Court from the suspension of his motor vehicle operator\u2019s license by the defendant commissioner pursuant to our implied consent statute, General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The suspension followed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s refusal to submit to a blood, breath or urine test for the purpose of determining whether he had been operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. The court dismissed his appeal despite its finding that the provisions of the statute pertaining to the refusal to submit to such a test had not been satisfied in two respects: (1) the plaintiff s refusal had occurred before he was placed under arrest; and (2) the police officer\u2019s written report of such refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>had not been endorsed by a third person as a witness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff has appealed from this decision, maintaining that either of these findings precludes his license suspension and also challenging a finding that the officer had properly informed him of the consequences of refusing to submit to the proffered tests. We affirm the judgment dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">At the license suspension hearing, the adjudicator assigned by the commissioner relied upon reports of the Groton police department containing the following facts. On June 9, 1984, at 1:45 a.m., a Groton police officer, David Bailey, observed the plaintiff in his automobile on Broad Street in the town of Groton. The car interior dome light was on, the key was in the ignition, the motor was running and the plaintiff occupied the driver\u2019s seat. After approaching the vehicle, the officer detected a strong odor of alcohol on the plaintiff\u2019s breath and requested him to step out of the car. When the plaintiff emerged from his automobile he fell against the officer and could not stand without support. Bailey reported that the plaintiff had \u201crefused all tests offered and was subsequently placed under arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The plaintiff, who was not represented by an attorney at the license suspension hearing, although he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>advised of his right to counsel,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> raised no objection to any of the police documents presented at the hearing. Although informed of his right to remain silent, he chose to testify. He said that he had been parked at the time the officer appeared and that, because of the heat, he had wanted to use the car air conditioning system. He was \u201cdebating\u201d whether to drive because he knew he had had a few drinks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He remembered having refused a breath test, but did not remember any offer of a blood test. He claimed that he would have taken the test requested if he had been told his license would be suspended for failure to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Subsections (b) and (c) of \u00a7 14-227b use mandatory language in specifying the procedures to be followed by the police prior to suspension of a motor vehicle operator\u2019s license for refusal to submit to the statutory tests for ascertaining a driver\u2019s level of intoxication. Subsection (d) nevertheless provides that the license suspension hearing \u201cshall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such test or analysis; and (4) was such person operating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>motor vehicle.\u201d The department of motor vehicles adjudicator found affirmatively upon each of these four issues, and the plaintiff does not challenge those findings. <em>In Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 7, 509 A.2d 489 (1986), this court declared that \u201c[t]he hearing is expressly limited to the four issues enumerated above\u201d and that \u201cthe limited issue before the trial court was whether the adjudicator properly applied the statute <em>as written </em>to the facts of the case.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The plaintiff attempts to distinguish <em>Buckley </em>on the ground that there the police had followed the procedures specified in \u00a7 14-227b, but, nevertheless, the trial court had found that the presumably intoxicated driver did not comprehend the consequences of a refusal to submit to chemical testing after having been properly so advised by the arresting officer. Id., 7-8. Although we agree that, unlike the present case, the circumstances in <em>Buckley </em>did not include a finding of noncompliance with any express statutory requirement, we continue to adhere to our declaration that a license suspension hearing must be limited to the four issues set forth in \u00a7 14-227b (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">The trial court found that \u201cthe plaintiff refused all tests before he was arrested,\u201d concluding that subsection (b) of \u00a7 14-227b \u201crequires that he be placed under arrest before he may be requested to submit to tests.\u201d This construction is in accord with the language of \u00a7 14-227b (b) referring to an operator who \u201c[has] been placed under arrest for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . and thereafter . . . refuses to submit to the designated test . . . . \u201d Subsection (b) expressly provides that such a person must be advised not only that his refusal to be tested will result in a license suspension but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>that \u201cevidence of such refusal shall be admissible in accordance with subsection (f) of section 14-227a and may be used against him in any criminal prosecution . . . . \u201d The referenced provision, General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (f), allows, in any criminal prosecution for operating under the influence or with impaired driving ability in violation of subsections (a) or (b) of \u00a7 14-227a, the introduction of \u201cevidence that the defendant refused to submit to a blood, breath or urine test requested in accordance with section 14-227b . . . provided the requirements of subsection (b) of said section have been satisfied.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>Thus it appears that the legislature has attached certain consequences to departures from the procedures specified in \u00a7 14-227b (b) and has provided a substantial incentive for the police to comply with those procedures. It is only by strictly following the statutory requirements that an operator\u2019s refusal of chemical testing can be used in a criminal prosecution against him for operating under the influence or with impaired ability. On the other hand, the restriction of a license suspension hearing to the four issues specified in subsection (d) of \u00a7 14-227b is indicative of the legislative view that the failure to comply precisely with the requirements of subsection (b) should not prevent suspension of the license of a person, arrested with probable cause for believing he was operating under the influence or with impaired ability as a result of intoxicating liquor, who has refused to submit to the prescribed tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The legislative genealogy of our implied consent statute supports our interpretation of \u00a7 14-227b (d) not to permit a failure of the police to comply with all the requirements of subsection (b) of that statute to vitiate the license suspension of an operator who has refused chemical testing. The first version of the statute was enacted in 1963 and provided that, if a person arrested for operating under the influence \u201crefuses to submit to either a breath or blood test, at the option of such person the test shall not be given, but if the court or jury, upon request, finds that such person was operating such motor vehicle, the motor vehicles com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>missioner shall suspend or revoke his license . . . .\u201d Public Acts 1963, No. 616, \u00a7 2. In 1967 the statute was amended to provide that, at the conclusion of the trial on a charge of operating under the influence, the court or a jury, \u201cupon request of the prosecuting attorney made immediately upon disposition of the case, shall make a finding concerning the following: (1) Whether or not there was probable cause for the arrest of such person; (2) whether or not the refusal to submit to the test was made knowingly and wilfully; and (3) whether such person was operating such motor vehicle.\u201d Public Acts 1967, No. 721. Both the 1963 and 1967 enactments indicate the intent of the legislature to make the issue of license suspension for refusal to submit to tests independent of the outcome of the trial of the charge of operating under the influence, although the same factfinder was used to determine both matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The link between the criminal proceeding and suspension of an operator\u2019s license was further attenuated in 1980 when the statute was amended to remove a provision inserted in 1967 that had made the license suspension provisions of \u00a7 14-227b inapplicable \u201cif the charge for which such person was arrested is nolled or changed.\u201d Public Acts 1980, No. 80-438, \u00a7 4. The amendment expressly allowed a prosecutor to request a determination of the issues relevant to license suspension even after the charge of operating under the influence had been nolled or changed. Public Acts 1980, No. 80-483, \u00a7 4. In 1981 another amendment wholly removed the initial resolution of the license suspension issues from the judicial system and created the present administrative procedure of the department of motor vehicles for determination of whether a license shall be suspended for refusing a blood, breath or urine test. Public Acts 1981, No. 81-446, \u00a7 3. This amendment imposed the restriction, now contained in subsection (d) of \u00a7 14-227b, limiting the scope of the license sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>pension hearing to the four issues of probable cause, arrest, refusal of testing, and operation of a motor vehicle. Public Acts 1981, No. 81-446, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In 1983, both \u00a7 14-227a and \u00a7 14-227b were amended to provide for the admission of evidence of an operator\u2019s refusal of testing in a criminal proceeding provided that the requirements of subsection (b) of \u00a7 14-227b in regard to such a refusal have been satisfied. Public Acts 1983, No. 83-534, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2. Subsection (d) of \u00a7 14-227b, however, was not significantly modified, and continued to limit a license suspension hearing to the four issues specified. Thus, the legislature has manifested its intention that noncompliance with subsection (b), not involving one of the four issues to be determined pursuant to subsection (d), does not preclude the suspension of the license of a driver who refuses to submit to a blood, breath or urine test.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The second deviation from \u00a7 14-227b (b) found by the trial court relates to the provision of subsection (c) that, \u201c[i]f the person arrested refuses to submit to such test or analysis, the police officer shall . . . prepare a written report of such refusal\u201d and that \u201c[s]uch written report shall be endorsed by a third person who witnessed the refusal.\u201d The report prepared by Officer Bailey bears only his signature and has not been \u201cendorsed by a third person\u201d in accordance with this provision. The trial court, nevertheless, concluded that the nonconformity was of no avail to the plaintiff in attacking the suspension of his license because it did not negate the findings of the adjudicator upon the four issues specified in subsection (d) of \u00a7 14-227b that are determinative of whether a suspension is to be ordered for failure to submit to the prescribed tests. The plaintiff does not claim that the absence of the signature of a witness on the report falls within the issues to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>determined pursuant to subsection (d) but maintains, nevertheless, that this deviation from the dictates of subsection (c) defeats the jurisdiction of the commissioner to order his license to be suspended.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Subsection (c) was added to \u00a7 14-227b in 1981 when the issues related to license suspension were removed from the criminal setting and transferred by subsection (d) to the department of motor vehicles for administrative determination. Public Acts 1981, No. 81-466, \u00a7 3. The restriction of the license suspension hearing to the four issues contained in subsection (d) indicates that compliance with subsection (c) was not intended to be a prerequisite for a suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Subsection (c) of \u00a7 14-227b prescribes not only that the \u201creport of such refusal\u201d bear the signature of a witness to the refusal but also that it be sworn to \u201cby the police officer before whom such refusal was made,\u201d that it set forth the grounds for probable cause to make the arrest and that it state that the arrested motor vehi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>cle operator had refused the officer\u2019s request to submit to a prescribed test. Its evident purpose is to provide sufficient indicia of reliability so that the report can be introduced in evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule, especially in license suspension proceedings, without the necessity of producing the arresting officer. Subsection (c) is analogous to other statutes that provide for the admissibility of documents certified by a proper official. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-165 (records of corporations and public officers), \u00a7 52-166 (orders and regulations of state officials), \u00a7 52-167 (corporation certificates attested by the secretary of state).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The absence of the endorsement of a third person who witnessed the arrested operator\u2019s refusal of testing would have rendered Officer Bailey\u2019s report inadmissible if the plaintiff had objected thereto. No objection was raised, however, to its use at the license suspension hearing. When hearsay statements have come into a case without objection they may be relied upon by the trier, \u201cin proof of the matters stated therein, for whatever they were worth on their face.\u201d <em>Sears </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>147 Conn. 311, 317, 160 A.2d 742 (1960); <em>Danahy </em>v. <em>Cuneo, </em>130 Conn. 213, 217, 33 A.2d 132 (1943). The finding of the department of motor vehicles adjudicator on the four issues set forth in \u00a7 14-227b (d) as determinative of whether an operator\u2019s license is to be suspended for a refusal of testing, therefore, is not flawed by his reliance upon the unwitnessed report of the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">' We conclude that neither the failure to arrest the plaintiff before his refusal to submit to the prescribed tests, as subsection (b) directs, nor the failure to have a witness endorse the report of refusal, as subsection (c) provides, is a sufficient ground for overturning the determination of the adjudicator that the plaintiff\u2019s motor vehicle operator\u2019s license should be suspended pursuant to subsection (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The plaintiff challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding that he refused to submit to a blood, breath or urine test, one of the four findings that subsection (d) of \u00a7 14-227b makes essential for a license suspension pursuant to our implied consent statute. The plaintiff focuses upon a finding of the trial court that \u201cthe officer did read the form warning on the \u2018Report of Refusal to Submit to Chemical Tests\u2019 and that the plaintiff acknowledged that this was read to him, but did not recall the part about suspension of license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The commissioner contends that this finding is immaterial because subsection (d) does not include a warning of the consequences of a refusal to submit to testing as one of the issues to be determined at the license suspension hearing. The commissioner relies upon a quotation from our opinion in <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>supra, 8, that \u201c\u00a7 14-227b does not provide a judicial or administrative remedy for the failure of an arresting officer to inform the motorist of the consequences of a refusal to submit to chemical testing.\u201d The requirement of a warning that such a refusal will result in a suspension of license is contained in subsection (b). Our analysis in part IA of this opinion plainly requires a modification of this acknowledged obiter dictum<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in respect to the judicial remedy, since any nonconformity with that subsection renders evidence of a refusal of testing inadmissible in a criminal prosecution for operating under the influence or with impaired driving ability.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>With respect to a license suspension hearing, however, whether an operator was warned of the consequences of refusing to submit to chemical tests is not made one of the issues to be adjudicated pursuant to subsection (d). Although one of the four issues to be determined is whether a driver has refused to submit to chemical testing, his knowledge of the consequences is not an essential factor in deciding whether such a refusal has occurred. The 1967 amendment to \u00a7 14-227b required, for a license suspension because of a driver\u2019s refusal of testing, a finding that \u201cthe refusal to submit to the test was made knowingly and wilfully.\u201d Public Acts 1967, No. 721. The \u201cand wilfully\u201d provision was removed by amendment in 1980. Public Acts 1980, No. 80-438, \u00a7 4. In 1981, when the license suspension issues were transferred to the department of motor vehicles for determination, the word \u201cknowingly\u201d was also deleted, leaving only the present requirement of a finding that a driver \u201c[d]id . . . refuse to submit to such test or analysis.\u201d Public Acts 1981, No. 81-446, \u00a7 3. The evolution of the present phraseology of \u00a7 14-227b (d) (3), from which the former \u201cknowingly and wilfully\u201d qualification has now been removed, indicates that actual knowledge of the consequences of a refusal to be tested is not an essential ingredient of the requisite finding of such a refusal for the purpose of a license suspension. That finding, for similar reasons, does not encompass the related question of whether the driver has been warned that such a refusal will result in a suspension of his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Subsection (a) of \u00a7 14-227b provides that \u201c[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle in this state shall be deemed to have given his consent to a chemical analysis of his blood, breath or urine . . . .\u201d When a driver refuses a test to which he is deemed by the statute to have consented, that refusal need not be attended by the kind of warning required in criminal proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>for a waiver of significant legal rights. The legislature, by limiting the issue at the license suspension hearing to whether a refusal has occurred, has chosen to rely on the presumption that everybody knows the law, including the consequences of breaking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">We conclude, as did the trial court, that a failure to warn the plaintiff of the consequences of his refusal of testing would not constitute a ground for setting aside the order of suspension. Accordingly, we need not resolve the claim of the plaintiff that the trial court\u2019s finding that the warning was properly given was not adequately supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-12\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b currently provides: \u201cimplied consent to TEST.

In support of this claim, as well as the claim based upon the nonconformity with the requirement that the report of refusal be witnessed as provided in subsection (c) of that statute, he relies upon several cases from other jurisdictions with implied consent statutes. See <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>354 F. Sup. 196 (D.S.D. 1973); <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Billings, </em>200 Kan. 654, 438 P.2d 108 (1968); <em>Neely v. State Department of Public Safety, </em>308 So. 2d 880 (La. App. 1975); <em>Schutt </em>v. <em>MacDuff, </em>205 Misc. 43, 127 N. Y.S.2d 116 (1954); <em>Dotson </em>v. <em>Motor Vehicles Division, </em>25 Or. App. 393, 549 P.2d 1143 (1976); <em>Metcalf </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>11 Wash. App. 819, 525 P.2d 819 (1974). None of these cases involves a provision similar to \u00a7 14-277b (d) restricting the issues at the license suspension hearing to those prescribed. The plaintiff also relies upon <em>State </em>v. <em>Towry, </em>26 Conn. Sup. 35, 41, 210 A.2d 455 (1965), a decision questioning the constitutionality of allowing a police officer to request a blood sample from a driver before having arrested him. That case also was decided prior to the advent in 1981 of the restriction contained in \u00a7 14-277b (d) limiting the license suspension hearing to the four issues specified. Public Acts 1981, No. 81-446, \u00a7 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b533-6\"> \u201cGeneral Statutes \u00a7 14-227b does not provide a judicial or administrative remedy for the failure of an arresting officer to inform the motorist of the consequences of a refusal to submit to chemical testing. On the facts of this case, however, that issue was not before the trial court and it is not before us. We hold only that General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (d) means what it says and accordingly, that the commissioner, before suspending the plaintiffs license, was not required to find that she understood the consequences of a refusal to submit to chemical testing.\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Muzio, </em>200 Conn. 1, 8, 509 A.2d 489 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
