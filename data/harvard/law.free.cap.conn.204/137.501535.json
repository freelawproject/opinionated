Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP0\">This is an appeal from the judgment of the trial court sustaining the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from a determination of the defendant, the commissioner of revenue services (commissioner), uphold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ing the assessment against the plaintiff, Kimberly-Clark Corporation, for Connecticut sales and use taxes in the amount of $137,366.66, of which $103,397.65, plus interest, is in dispute. The commissioner raises three issues on this appeal: (1) whether the trial court should have accepted the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact unless they were clearly erroneous; (2) whether the commissioner\u2019s declaratory ruling estopped him from making a lawful assessment pursuant to chapter 219 of the General Statutes;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence before it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The facts found by the trial court include the following: The plaintiff is a large national manufacturer of paper and related products. It has several plants throughout the country, including one located in New Milford, which employs approximately 1400 people. In 1978, the plaintiff decided to make substantial changes to its New Milford plant. The changes included installing a new production line at an estimated cost of $17 million and dismantling, expanding and modernizing an existing production line at an estimated cost of $7 million. These production lines are each over 100 yards long and are \u201ccompletely integrated and automated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">On August 31, 1978, the plaintiff wrote to the commissioner \u201cto request a ruling, with respect to the Connecticut sales and use tax exemption on manufacturing machinery and equipment\u201d for the two lines it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>intended to install. The letter stated: \u201c[A]ll the machinery for the new production line has been designed by [the plaintiff] and cannot be purchased from a single supplier. The machinery will be fabricated by [the plaintiff]. Components for such machine fabrication will be purchased from several suppliers.\u201d The letter then itemized the specific units of processes, systems, sections and controls of the new and the modernized production lines, and ended by requesting \u201cthat all the above described processes and machinery be ruled exempt from sales and use taxation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">A conference on the plaintiffs request for a ruling was held on September 5,1978. Present at the conference were Nick D. Hansen, the plaintiffs vice president and tax counsel; David L. Hansell, the plaintiffs administrative manager for the expansion of products; Ralph Madden, the plaintiffs project engineer; Terence J. O\u2019Neil, the commissioner\u2019s division chief, legal/technical division; and Solomon J. Karam, the commissioner\u2019s director of legal division, public relations and research. At this conference, Madden explained the design and operation of the two production lines. Most of the conference, however, was spent going over the itemized list of specific units of the two lines which had been included in the plaintiff\u2019s request for a ruling. The commissioner\u2019s representatives marked the specific items with an \u201cE\u201d indicating tax exempt, a \u201cT\u201d indicating taxable, and a \u201c?\u201d indicating that they were not sure whether the item was exempt and they needed more information to make such a determination. In the course of the discussions, the plaintiff raised the issue of whether, as a condition of sales tax exemption, the plaintiff had to have the two production lines fabricated by its Wisconsin subsidiary \u201cKim-Tech.\u201d The commissioner\u2019s representatives indicated that \u201cthat would not be necessary and [that] it would only hurt Connecticut by forcing construction out of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>On September 11, 1978, O\u2019Neil wrote to the plaintiff on behalf of the commissioner, stating that he was \u201creturning a copy of the list [which the plaintiff had] submitted with [its] letter of August 31,1978, indicating [the commissioner\u2019s] decision as to taxability.\u201d \u201cItems on the list were marked \u2018E,\u2019 \u2018T,\u2019 and '?,\u2019 with only two comments: as to machine platforms and guards\u2014\u2018E if purchased as part of a complete unit,\u2019 and as to stock preparation equipment\u2014\u2018E if purchased in conjunction with a machine.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The plaintiff supplied additional information as to the questionable items and eventually all the items on the plaintiff\u2019s list included in its letter of August 31, 1978, were ruled upon by the commissioner. Of the thirty-seven individual units of the new production line, thirty-five were given tax exempt status, and of the thirteen individual units of the modernized production line, eleven were given tax exempt status. The commissioner allowed an exemption for machine controls on the new production line but denied an exemption for the same controls on the modernized line, on the ground that the latter would not be purchased \u201cin conjunction with new machinery\u201d but instead \u201cat a later date to update existing machinery.'\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Having obtained what the plaintiff believed to be a favorable ruling of tax exemption based on its letter request of August 31,1978, the plaintiff proceeded to construct the two production lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Following the construction of the two production lines, the commissioner audited the plaintiff as to sales and use tax for the period December 1,1976, through April 30, 1980. As a result of the audit, the commissioner determined that the plaintiff owed taxes in the amount of $137,366.66 of which $103,397.65, plus interest, is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The items found by the defendant to be taxable (the disputed devices) were in the nature of switch gears, valves, cables, controllers, bearings, and the like, installed in the plaintiffs new and rebuilt production lines. As to the disputed devices, the trial court noted that the parties stipulated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201c1. All of the disputed devices are used \u2018directly in a manufacturing production process,\u2019 as such phrase is used in [General Statutes] Sec. 12-412 (34).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">\u201c2. None of the disputed devices, by themselves, constitute^] a \u2018basic machine itself,\u2019 as such phrase is used in Sec. 12-412 (34).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201c3. All of the disputed devices are \u2018component parts and contrivances, such as belts, pulleys, shafts, moving parts, operating structures,\u2019 or \u2018equipment or devices used or required to control, regulate or operate the machinery,\u2019 as such terms are used in Sec. 12-412 (34).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">\u201c4. All of the disputed devices were purchased separately from any portion of the production lines that may constitute a basic machine itself, as defined in Sec. 12-412 (34).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">\u201c5. All of the disputed devices were purchased at the time of installation of the two production lines, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>necessary for the initial operation of those lines and are not repair or replacement parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">\u201c6. The production lines each constitute a \u2018basic machine itself,\u2019 as that phrase is used in Sec. 12-412 (34).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">\u201c7. All the disputed devices were included in plaintiff\u2019s letter of August 31,1978 in categories later designated as exempt by the [Commissioner\u2019s] ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The plaintiff, asserting that it had been \u201caggrieved by the action of the commissioner ... in fixing the amount of such tax,\u201d requested an administrative hearing, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-421. After a hearing, the deputy commissioner of revenue services rendered a decision upholding the assessment. The plaintiff, thereafter, took a timely appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-422.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">At trial, the commissioner essentially attempted to establish that the exemption for the disputed devices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>granted by the commissioner\u2019s letter ruling was conditional upon the fact that the production lines were to be fabricated by an out-of-state subsidiary of the plaintiff. The commissioner argued that to have ruled any other way would have been contrary to his interpretation of \u00a7 12-412 (34) that \u201ccomponent parts and contrivances, such as belts, pulleys, shafts . . . and devices used ... to control . . . machinery\u201d were exempt only if purchased from the vendor of the basic machine and at the same time. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-426-11 (A).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Holding that the commissioner\u2019s \u201cexemption rulings are binding on him and enure to the plaintiff\u2019s benefit on grounds of statute, estoppel and elemental fairness,\u201d the trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. The court ordered the commissioner to return to the plaintiff any payment of the assessment and interest thereon already made by the plaintiff. On January 26,1986, the commissioner appealed to the Appellate Court. On May 14,1986, this court transferred the appeal to itself. See Practice Book \u00a7 4023 (formerly \u00a7 3004A).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The commissioner\u2019s first claim of error is that the trial court erred in conducting the appeal de novo. The commissioner argues that under the appropriate standard of review the trial court should have accepted his findings of facts unless they were clearly erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>The plaintiff argues that under General Statutes \u00a7 12-422, the trial court was empowered to conduct the appeal de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">The plaintiffs appeal to the trial court was taken, not under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, which excludes tax appeals; General Statutes \u00a7 4-186;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but instead under \u00a7 12-422. Although this court has never specifically held that \u00a7 12-422 empowers a trial court to hear an appeal de novo, the language of that statute is similar to the language used in other Connecticut tax appeal statutes which have been interpreted to require a de novo review by the trial court. For example, appeals taken pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-237, which concerns the Connecticut corporation business tax, and General Statutes \u00a7 12-597, which concerns the quarterly tax on gross earnings from the sale of petroleum products, are conducted de novo. See, e.g., <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>202 Conn. 583, 588, 522 A.2d 771 (1987); <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>202 Conn. 412, 421, 521 A.2d 569 (1987). Similarly, property tax appeals taken pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-118 are conducted de novo. See, e.g., <em>Xerox Corporations. Board of Tax Review, </em>175 Conn. 301, 303, 397 A.2d 1367 (1978); <em>Yale University v. New Haven, </em>169 Conn. 454, 464, 363 A.2d 1108 (1975); <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>169 Conn. 129, 130-31, 362 A.2d 914 (1975); <em>New Haven Water Co. v. Board of Tax Review, </em>166 Conn. 232, 239-40, 348 A.2d 641 (1974). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>In addition, Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 257 (d) and 4095 (formerly \u00a7 3088) imply that tax appeals receive a de novo review in the Superior Court. See also <em>Greenman\u2019s Trucking, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue Services, </em>6 Conn. App. 261, 262 n.1, 504 A.2d 568 (1986) (parties agreed that an appeal taken pursuant to \u00a7 12-422 is an appeal de novo). We note also that in <em>H. B. Sanson, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>187 Conn. 581, 586, 447 A.2d 12 (1982), which involved an appeal taken pursuant to \u00a7 12-422, this court looked to a finding made by the trial court, not the commissioner, and noted that \u201cthe trial court was not bound to limit its reasoning to that utilized by the tax commissioner . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">In arguing that the trial court erred in conducting an appeal de novo, the commissioner places great emphasis on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Jaffe </em>v. <em>State Department of Health, </em>135 Conn. 339, 353-55, 64 A.2d 330 (1949). <em>Jaffe, </em>which is a pre-Uniform Administrative Procedure Act decision, does not avail the commissioner because the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act now expressly excludes tax appeals. As noted, our cases provide that a party appealing from an adverse ruling of the commissioner of revenue services is \u201centitled to a plenary review of its challenge of its tax assessment, and is not limited to an administrative appeal under the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d <em>Texaco Refining &amp; Marketing Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>supra; see also <em>George P. Gustin Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>203 Conn. 198, 202-203, 524 A.2d 603 (1987), citing <em>Schlumberger Technology Corporation </em>v. <em>Dubno, </em>supra. The trial court did not err in conducting this appeal de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The commissioner\u2019s second claim is that the declaratory ruling which he gave to the plaintiff did not estop him from making a lawful assessment of tax pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>to chapter 219 of the General Statutes. The commissioner\u2019s first argument is that, as an agent of the state, he is not subject to estoppel. His second argument is that, assuming he is subject to estoppel, the requisite elements have not been established in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Citing <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>153 Conn. 691, 694, 220 A.2d 284 (1966), the commissioner argues that he is not subject to estoppel. Specifically, he maintains that \u201che cannot waive the rights of the state, nor can he, by any act of his, estop the state from asserting its rights . . . .\u201d See also <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>199 Conn. 133, 142 n.10, 506 A.2d 93 (1986). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Administrator, </em>supra, and in <em>State </em>v. <em>Metrusky, </em>140 Conn. 26, 30, 97 A.2d 574 (1953), a case cited in <em>McGowan, </em>we held that a claim for estoppel could not be based on the particular actions of the unemployment compensation administrator and the commissioner of welfare, respectively. In those cases, we recognized that the particular state agents had acted outside of their authority. <em>McGowan </em>and <em>Metrusky </em>are inapposite to this case. In this case, the commissioner had express statutory authorization to give the declaratory rulings, which are the subject of this appeal. See General Statutes \u00a7 4-176.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Although this court has not had occasion to determine specifically whether the conduct of the department of revenue services gives rise to estoppel, this court has said that, in certain limited circumstances, estoppel may be invoked against a municipality. See, e.g., <em>Zoning Commmission </em>v. <em>Lescynski, </em>188 Conn. 724, 731, 453 A.2d 1144 (1982), and cases cited therein. In <em>Lescynski, </em>we recognized that as a general rule, estoppel may not be invoked against a public agency in the exercise of its governmental functions. <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Lescynski, </em>supra; see also <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Sub</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>marine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 344, 353, 365 A.2d 1093 (1976); <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. 548, 556, 254 A.2d 898 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stonybrook, Inc., </em>149 Conn. 492, 501, 181 A.2d 601, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 185, 83 S. Ct. 265, 9 L. Ed. 2d 227 (1962). Nevertheless, we noted that an exception to this general rule is made where the party claiming estoppel would be subjected to a substantial loss if the public agency were permitted to negate the acts of its agents. <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Lescynski, </em>supra; <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>supra, 354. We perceive no reason why this limited exception should not apply in an appropriate case to estop the department of revenue services, especially in view of its statutory authority to render declaratory rulings. See <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 243, 423 A.2d 883 (1979) (this court dismissed the plaintiffs claim of estoppel not because the commissioner of revenue services is not subject to estoppel but because the elements of estoppel had not been established); see also <em>George W. Davis &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Askew, </em>343 So. 2d 1329, 1332 (Fla. 1977); <em>Mountain States Advertising, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bureau of Revenue, </em>89 N.M. 331, 332, 552 P.2d 233 (1976); <em>Advance Pipe &amp; Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Department of Revenue, </em>128 Wis. 2d 431, 439-40, 383 N.W.2d 502 (1986); <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Family Hospital, </em>105 Wis. 2d 250, 253-54, 313 N.W.2d 828 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The commissioner claims that, assuming he is subject to estoppel, the requisite elements of an estoppel are missing in this case. The commissioner\u2019s argument as to this claim is twofold. The commissioner argues that he never ruled that the machinery in question was exempt and that if he did so rule, it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to have relied on that ruling, in light of General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34) and \u00a7 12-426-11 (A) of the regulations of Connecticut state agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201cUnder our well-established law, any claim of estoppel is predicated on proof of two essential elements: the party against whom estoppel is claimed must do or say something calculated or intended to induce another party to believe that certain facts exist and to act on that belief; and the other party must change its position in reliance on those facts, thereby incurring some injury. <em>Bozzi </em>v. <em>Bozzi, </em>177 Conn. 232, 242, 413 A.2d 834 (1979); <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>[supra]; <em>Pet Car Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>150 Conn. 42, 53-54, 184 A.2d 797 (1962).\u201d <em>Zoning Commission </em>v. <em>Lescynski, </em>supra. In addition, estoppel against a public agency is limited and may be invoked: (1) only with great caution; (2) only when the action in question has been induced by an agent having authority in such matters; and (3) only when special circumstances make it highly inequitable or oppressive not to estop the agency. Id.; <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>supra, 354. As noted, this exception applies where the party claiming estoppel would be subjected to substantial loss if the public agency were permitted to negate the acts of its agents. \u201c \u2018[I]t is the burden of the person claiming the estoppel to show that he exercised due diligence to ascertain the truth and that he not only lacked knowledge of the true state of things but had no convenient means of acquiring that knowledge.\u2019 <em>Pet Car Products, Inc. </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>[supra]; <em>Linahan </em>v. <em>Linahan, </em>131 Conn. 307, 327, 39 A.2d 895 [1944].\u201d <em>Reinke </em>v. <em>Greenwich Hospital Assn., </em>175 Conn. 24, 28-29, 392 A.2d 966 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The commissioner claims that he never ruled the disputed devices \u201cexempt.\u201d We disagree.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>commissioner expressly stipulated that \u201c[a]ll the disputed devices were included in the plaintiffs letter of August 31, 1978, in categories later designated as exempt by [the] Commissioner\u2019s ruling.\u201d The commissioner argued at trial that this exemption ruling was conditioned on a requirement that the disputed devices be purchased from the vendor of a basic machine and at the same time. The trial court found that the commissioner never made this condition \u201cclear in [his] rulings,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f the [Commissioner] meant to condition his rulings of exemption . . . he had the obligation expressly to say so.\u201d As we will discuss in part III of this opinion, this finding of the trial court was supported by the evidence. We, therefore, are unpersuaded by the commissioner\u2019s argument that he should not be estopped from assessing the tax because he never exempted the disputed devices in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">The commissioner also argues that he should not be estopped because it was unreasonable for the plaintiff to rely on his rulings. It is clear that the commissioner had the authority to issue the ruling requested by the plaintiff. General Statutes \u00a7 4-176<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> grants this authority and authorizes the commissioner to provide by regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>lation the procedure for the filing and prompt disposition of petitions seeking such rulings. According to the statute, these declaratory rulings \u201chave the same status as agency decisions or orders in contested cases.\u201d At trial, Karam and O\u2019Neil testified that the departmental regulations which set forth the procedure for a taxpayer requesting a declaratory ruling, such as that issued by the commissioner to the plaintiff, had not been violated. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 12-2-4.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Karam testified that when the commissioner gives declaratory rulings, he \u201cintends\u201d that such rulings \u201cshall be relied upon\u201d by taxpayers and \u201cexpects\u201d that he will be bound by the ruling. The court found that, in reliance on the \u201cfavorable ruling,\u201d the plaintiff proceeded to construct the two production lines. This finding is supported by the testimony of both Hansen and Hansell who indicated that the favorable ruling was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>basis for going forward with the construction of the production lines. For example, Hansell said: \u201cI had no recollection that it was even a consideration to use Kim-Tech when we left that meeting. You know, if there had been that consideration I would have had to [go] to the project manager and pursued that further.\u201d Given the express statutory authority for the ruling and the testimony of Karam that the commissioner intends for taxpayers to rely on such rulings, we cannot say that the plaintiffs reliance on the ruling was unreasonable. To the contrary, the plaintiff\u2019s conduct in writing to the commissioner requesting a letter ruling and its subsequent reliance on that ruling was completely reasonable. Rather than construct the production lines and then await a decision of the commissioner as to the taxability of its actions, the plaintiff took advantage of a provision in our statutes which allowed it to determine ahead of time the tax consequences of its proposed business decision. Despite the commissioner\u2019s argument to the contrary, the plaintiff justifiably relied on the ruling given to it by the commissioner. The trial court did not err in concluding that the commissioner is subject to estoppel and that the requisite elements of estoppel had been established in this case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The commissioner\u2019s final claim is that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s decision is dependent upon certain factual findings not supported by the record.\u201d As to this claim, the commissioner takes issue with the following findings: \u201c(1) the \u2018commissioner\u2019s people\u2019 never made clear their position that machine component parts purchased separately from basic machines were not exempt; (2) [the] plaintiff never orally at the conference changed the basic fact that \u2018all the machinery would be fabricated by the plaintiff and components for such machinery would be purchased from several suppliers\u2019; and (3) \u2018[n]or did [the] commissioner make his rulings of exemptions conditioned on different facts.\u2019 \u201d The commissioner also takes issue with the court\u2019s finding that when the question of whether it was absolutely necessary to use a subsidiary was raised by the plaintiff, the \u201ccommissioner\u2019s people said that it would not be necessary and it would only hurt Connecticut by forcing construction out of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The commissioner argues that \u201c[i]n fact, the testimony by three of the four witnesses is uncontroverted that the [commissioner\u2019s] personnel told the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>personnel that machine component parts purchased separately from basic machines were not tax exempt.\u201d The commissioner also points out that Hansen stated at the meeting that \u201cthe plaintiff had a subsidiary, Kim-Tech, which could fabricate the machines out-of-state and sell them to the plaintiff,\u201d and that the commissioner\u2019s representatives stated that the sale of completed machines to the plaintiff by its subsidiary, Kim-Tech, would be tax exempt. Based on this testimony, the commissioner argues that the court could reach \u201cno conclusion other than that the [commissioner\u2019s] rulings were conditioned upon facts represented to its personnel which differed from what [the] plaintiff initially proposed to do . . . .\u201d The commissioner argues that \u201c[therefore, the decision of the trial court should be set aside . . . .\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u201c \u2018On appeal, it is the function of this court to determine whether the decision of the trial court is clearly erroneous. See Practice Book [\u00a7 4061]. This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision; where the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are <em>clearly erroneous.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis <em>added.)

Initially, we note that both Karam and O\u2019Neil admitted during their testimony that in all of the written communication between the parties there was absolutely no mention that the exemption was conditioned on the fact that a subsidiary of the plaintiff would fabricate the production lines. Our review of those exhibits confirms that no such condition is included therein. At trial, Hanson testified that after the conference he was under the impression that the plaintiff received a favorable ruling from the commissioner which in his mind did not include the use of Kim-Tech or any other subsidiary. In fact, he recollected that during the conference very little time was spent discussing the possibility of using an out-of-state subsidiary to fabricate the machine. As to the commissioner\u2019s response to the possibility of using an out-of-state subsidiary, it was Hanson\u2019s impression that it was not required. In fact, \u201cone of the things [Hanson was] trying to come away from the meeting with, was a decision as to whether or not [the plaintiff] had to go through [with that] formalitfy].\u201d Hanson testified that they were never told orally that the exemption was conditional on the use of an out-of-state subsidiary and that the first time that he was aware of that condition was after the audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The testimony of Hansell also adds support for the trial court\u2019s findings. Hansell testified that in his mind the rulings were not \u201cin any way conditioned upon Kimberly-Clark using Kim-Tech or any other subsidiary to do the [fabrication].\u201d When he left the meeting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>he had \u201cno recollection that it was even a consideration to use Kim-Tech . . . .\u201d Hansell also testified that he believed that it was Karam who made the statement that it was not the intention of the Connecticut tax rules to force construction out of state.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The trial court\u2019s rulings also find some support in the testimony of Karam. Karam testified that although the principal reason for the meeting of September 4th, 1978, was to discuss the role of the subsidiary, they only discussed that fact for a few minutes. In response to the court\u2019s statement that it was difficult to believe that the declaratory ruling was based on an oral condition, Karam stated that \u201cwe weren\u2019t articulate enough, and that\u2019s our problem.\u201d Karam recognized that \u201cperhaps [they] should have repeated the statement to [the plaintiff], but [that they] didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Although both O\u2019Neil and Karam testified that it was their \u201cunderstanding that they [had] agreed that the [machine] would be fabricated out of state by a subsidiary,\u201d the trial court was not required to credit that testimony. From our review of the entire record, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s findings are amply supported by the evidence and are not \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d and its conclusions based on those findings are \u201clegally and logically correct.\u201d See <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra. The trial court was entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>find, inter alia, that the plaintiff never orally changed the basic fact that all the machinery would be fabricated by the plaintiff and component parts for such machinery would be purchased from several suppliers, that the commissioner did not make his ruling conditioned on different facts, and that the commissioner\u2019s representatives said that it would not be necessary to use an out-of-state subsidiary and it would only hurt Connecticut by forcing construction out of state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\"> Chapter 219 of the General Statutes is entitled \u201cSales and Use Tax\u201d and provides, inter alia, for the imposition of the sales and use tax as well as the exemptions from that tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b152-8\"> As an alternative ground upon which the judgment may be affirmed, the plaintiff presents the following issue: \u201cMust an item of machinery constitute a machine in and of itself or be purchased in conjunction with a machine in order to be exempt from the Connecticut sales and use tax pursuant to Section 12-412 (34) of the Connecticut General Statutes?\u201d Because of our disposition of the commissioner\u2019s claims on appeal, we need not reach the merits of this alternative basis for affirming the judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b155-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-412 (34) provides: \u201cEXEMPTIONS.
