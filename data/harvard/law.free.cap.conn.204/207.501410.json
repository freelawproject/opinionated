The defendant, Matthew Robinson, was charged by amended information with murder, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assault in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (l),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and assault in the second degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following trial, a jury found him guilty of murder and assault in the first degree. The defendant was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of forty-five years. He appeals to this court from the judgment of his conviction. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The charges against the defendant arose from a shooting that occurred at a Norwalk nightclub early in the morning of February 20, 1984. Three people were injured, one fatally, as a result of the shooting. Two eyewitnesses, testifying for the prosecution, identified the defendant as the person who had fired the shots. Two other prosecution witnesses testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>they had seen the defendant outside the nightclub directly following the shooting. Another prosecution witness, a neighbor of the defendant, testified that the defendant had telephoned her about an hour after the shooting and told her that he had \u201cjust killed\u201d one of the victims. The defendant presented no evidence on his behalf. On cross-examination and in his closing argument to the jury, however, he attempted to discredit the state\u2019s witnesses. In particular, he sought to expose flaws in the eyewitnesses\u2019 ability to observe the perpetrator of the shooting, and alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of various witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the state\u2019s burden of proof relative to circumstantial evidence. The trial court instructed the jury that it could draw inferences from circumstantial evidence provided that: (1) \u201cthe fact from which you are asked to draw the inference has itself been proven beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe inference asked to be drawn is not only logical and reasonable but is strong enough so that you can find that it is <em>more probable than not </em>that the fact to be inferred is true.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant claims that this instruction diluted the state\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, denying him his constitutional right to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim of error is governed, both procedurally and substantively, by our recent decisions in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullings, </em>202 Conn. 1, 12-14, 519 A.2d 58 (1987), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 755-58, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), both of which involved instructions on circumstantial evidence substantially identical to the one given in this case. In <em>Whelan, </em>as in this case, the defendant failed to take exception to the challenged portion of the court\u2019s charge. As in <em>Whelan, </em>however, we review the defendant\u2019s claim of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), because it \u201cimplicates the fundamental constitutional right that the state establish [the defendant\u2019s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 756.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Turning to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we first determine the appropriate standard of review. Where the principal factual issue at trial is intent, which is typically proven by circumstantial evidence, \u201cwe will closely scrutinize the court\u2019s instructions\u201d on circumstantial evidence, in isolation from the remainder of the charge, to determine whether the court misled the jury as to the state\u2019s burden of proof. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullings, </em>supra, 12; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 757; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>198 Conn. 53, 59, 502 A.2d 360 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>7 Conn. App. 149, 155, 508 A.2d 49, cert. denied, 200 Conn. 805, 512 A.2d 229 (1986). In this case, however, the defendant concedes, and the record reveals, that the principal factual issue at trial was not intent, but the identity of the perpetrator of the crimes. Identity, unlike intent, is not typically proven by circumstantial evidence. Accordingly, we review the court\u2019s instruction not in isolation, but in the context of the charge as a whole, to determine whether it is \u201c \u2018reasonably possible that the jury was misled\u2019 \u201d by an erroneous explanation regarding the use of circumstantial evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 756; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullings, </em>supra, 12; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>197 Conn. 115, 132, 496 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>A.2d 466 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1067, 106 S. Ct. 822, 88 L. Ed. 2d 795 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>supra, 155-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We agree with the defendant that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could infer facts from circumstantial evidence if it was \u201cmore probable than not\u201d that the inferred facts were true. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>supra, 57. Upon review of the charge in its entirety, however, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by this single erroneous description of the state\u2019s burden of proof. The trial court correctly instructed the jury on several occasions that the defendant was presumed to be innocent and that the state had the burden of proving each element of the crimes charged<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, with regard to each count, the trial court specifically instructed the jury that the state was required to prove the defendant\u2019s identity as the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt. We hold, therefore, that \u201cit was not reasonably possible that the isolated use of the phrase 'more probable than not\u2019 confused or misled the jury with regard to the state\u2019s heavy burden of proof.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Mullings, </em>supra, 14; <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>9 Conn. App. 373, 376-77, 519 A.2d 83 (1986), cert. denied, 202 Conn. 805, 520 A.2d 1286 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Farrar, </em>supra, 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 53a-54a. murder defined, affirmative DEFENSES.
