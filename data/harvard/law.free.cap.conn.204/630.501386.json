The respondent, a minor, admitted in court that he had intentionally aided another person in the commission of the robbery. On April 25,1986, the respondent was adjudicated a delinquent child for being an accessory to a robbery in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-135 and 53a-8. The respondent filed a motion on May 19,1986, seeking an order of the court barring his adjudication as a \u201cserious juvenile offender\u201d as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>On July 1,1986, the court granted the motion and the respondent was sentenced and committed to the department of children and youth services (DCYS) for placement at the Long Lane School as a delinquent child for a maximum period not to exceed two years. This appeal was filed by the state in the Appellate Court on July 18, 1986, and on August 12, 1986, this court transferred the appeal to itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Initially, both parties to this action concede that there are distinct and substantial differences between being adjudicated a \u201cdelinquent\u201d as compared to being adjudicated a \u201cserious juvenile offender.\u201d The consequences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>of the more serious designation are delineated in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-141,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 46b-140,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 46b-126,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>46b-140 (e) (2).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, in view of the substantial differences of the potential penalties, the state is pursuing this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The state in its appeal, claims that the defendant should have been charged and prosecuted as a \u201cserious juvenile offender\u201d because the respondent had intentionally aided another who had committed a \u201cserious juvenile offense,\u201d as defined in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120. It claims that under the mandate of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the respondent should be \u201ccriminally liable for such conduct\u201d and should be prosecuted and punished \u201cas if he were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The respondent, to the contrary, contends that since General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 specifies the offenses that constitute \u201cserious juvenile offenses\u201d without mentioning \u201caiding and abetting\u201d as defined by \u00a7 53a-8, the respondent cannot be charged as a \u201cserious juvenile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>offender.\u201d He further claims that since statutes defining juvenile delinquency, such as \u00a7 46b-120, set standards governing the deprivation of a child\u2019s liberty, they are penal in nature and thus are to be strictly construed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>183 Conn. 520, 522, 441 A.2d 41 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tedesco, </em>175 Conn. 279, 291, 397 A.2d 1352 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Although the state concedes that \u00a7 46b-120 is penal in nature, and, as such, must be strictly construed, it argues that the entire scheme of the statutes must be considered as a whole, and that one who aids another in the commission of a \u201cserious juvenile offense\u201d may be adjudicated a \u201cserious juvenile offender.\u201d Strict construction does not mean that a statute must be read in isolation. \u201c Tn construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roque, </em>190 Conn. 143, 151, 460 A.2d 26 (1983), citing <em>Stoni </em>v. <em>Wasicki, </em>179 Conn. 372, 376-77, 426 A.2d 774 (1979). \u201c \u2018The rule of strict construction does not require that the narrowest technical meaning be given to the words employed in a criminal statute in disregard of their context and in frustration of the obvious legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Faro, </em>118 Conn. 267, 274, 171 A. 660 (1934), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>215 U.S. 233, 242, 30 S. Ct. 81, 54 L. Ed. 173 (1909); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>197 Conn. 436, 445, 497 A.2d 974 (1985); cf. <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 489, 400 A.2d 726 (1978); <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>168 Conn. 26, 31, 357 A.2d 498 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The state claims that the respondent should be charged as a serious juvenile offender because he was an accessory to robbery. Being an accessory is not a crime in and of itself, but is only another way of committing a crime. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person, acting with the mental state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>required for the commission of an offense, who . . . intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct . . . as if he were the principal offender.\u201d Here, the respondent admitted in court that he had intentionally aided another person in the commission of the crime of robbery in the second degree. That crime is listed as one of the \u201cserious juvenile offense[s]\u201d that may, under \u00a7 46b-120, result in classification of a juvenile as a \u201cserious juvenile offender.\u201d Despite the omission of accessory status under \u00a7 53a-8 in the litany of crimes listed in \u00a7 46b-120, a list that specifically includes reference to \u201cattempt\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 and \u201cconspiracy\u201d under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48, the state maintains that our penal code, read as a whole, does not exclude an accessory from being charged as a \u201cserious juvenile offender.\u201d We find the respondent\u2019s argument that he cannot be adjudicated as a \u201cserious juvenile offender\u201d because \u00a7 46b-120 sets forth attempt and conspiracy as \u201cserious juvenile offense[s]\u201d while it fails to set forth accessorial liability as such an offense to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We have recently addressed the differences between the crimes of attempt and conspiracy, and accessorial liability. <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>202 Conn. 520, 522 A.2d 277 (1987). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, 527-28, we stated that \u201c[ajttempt and conspiratorial liability differ substantially from the liablity imposed on an accessory. . . . [B]oth attempt and conspiracy are offenses in and of themselves, while accessorial liability is not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Attempt is a distinct, inchoate offense and a defendant may be punished for attempting to commit a substantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>offense without actually committing the crime. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49, 53a-51; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Trent, </em>182 Conn. 595, 600, 438 A.2d 796 (1981). Likewise, conspiracy has been recognized as being a crime distinct from the commission of the substantive offense. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48. \u2018We have repeatedly held that conspiracy is a common-law crime and punishable as such under the statutes relating to the punishment of high crimes and misdemeanors. The commission of the substantive offense and a conspiracy to commit it are separate and distinct crimes. . . . The crime of conspiracy is dependent on clear principles, and has characteristics and ingredients which separate it from all other crimes.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>162 Conn. 215, 218-19, 292 A.2d 903 (1972); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Crump, </em>[201 Conn. 489, 497, 518 A.2d 378 (1986)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>195 Conn. 598, 608, 489 A.2d 1041 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">\u201cThere is, however, no such crime as \u2018being an accessory.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>201 Conn. 125, 130, 513 A.2d 669 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>198 Conn. 158, 163, 502 A.2d 880 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra. The defendant is charged with committing one substantive offense; \u2018[t]he accessory statute merely provides alternate means by which a substantive crime may be committed.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra, 131.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\u201cMoreover, because accessorial liability is not a distinct crime, but only an alternative means by which a substantive crime may be committed, it would be illogical to impose liability on the perpetrator of the crime, while precluding liability for an accessory, even though both possess the mental state required for the commission of the crime. Connecticut \u2018long ago adopted the rule that there is no practical significance in being labeled an \u201caccessory\u201d or a \u201cprincipal\u201d for the purpose of determining criminal responsibility. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gargano, </em>99 Conn. 103, 109, 121 A. 657 (1923); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>47 Conn. 95, 118 (1879); General Statutes (1875 Rev.) p. 545. The modern approach \u201cis to abandon completely the old common law terminology and simply provide that a person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when he is an accomplice of the other person in the commission of the crime. Such is the view taken in the Model Penal Code, which provides that a person is an accomplice of another person in the commission of an offense if, with the purpose of promoting or facilitating the commission of the offense, he solicits the other person to commit it, or aids or agrees or attempts to aid the other person in planning or committing it, or (having a legal duty to prevent the crime) failed to make the proper effort to prevent it.\u201d LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law (1972) \u00a7 63, p. 501; see also Model Penal Code (1985) \u00a7 2.06, comment 6. Connecticut has taken the same approach through General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>supra.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>supra.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>supra, 532-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Since \u00a7 53a-8 does not define a separate distinct crime, but only describes an alternative means by which a substantive crime may be committed, the respondent may be considered a serious juvenile offender for the purposes of \u00a7 46b-120 by having intentionally aided another in the commission of a \u201cserious juvenile offense\u201d as defined by that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-120.
