Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7h\">The dispositive issue on this appeal is whether the plaintiffs, the Concerned Citizens of Sterling et al., were required to exhaust their administrative remedies before filing their action for injunctive relief in the Superior Court. The named plaintiff is a nonprofit citizens\u2019 organization composed of citizens, taxpayers and residents of the town of Ster<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ling.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant, the town of Sterling, is a Connecticut municipality that owns an industrial park, known as the Town of Sterling Industrial Park.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The background facts are not in dispute. In late January, 1986, town officials announced that a company known as Oxford Energy, Inc., wanted to purchase twenty acres of land in the Town of Sterling Industrial Park for the purpose of building a tire-to-energy plant. The plaintiffs petitioned for a referendum on that question pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>February 22, 1986, a referendum was held and the voters of Sterling rejected the proposed sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Thereafter, certain residents of Sterling filed an application with the town selectmen, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-1,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> requesting that a special town meeting be held for the purpose of reconsidering the proposed sale. On March 13,1986, the board of selectmen published notice of a town meeting on March 20, 1986, and indicated that the board had voted to remove the proposed sale from the meeting agenda and submit it to a referendum vote to be held on March 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>1986. At the March 27 referendum, the voters approved the sale of land to Oxford Energy, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">On April 3, 1986, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking permanently to enjoin the defendant from \u201ctaking any action to effectuate the sale of land in the Sterling Industrial Park.\u201d The plaintiffs claimed that the March 27 referendum was illegal for the following reasons: (1) the earlier referendum vote on February 22, 1986, had not been rescinded in the same manner as voted, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 7-7; (2) the municipal clerk had failed to issue a warning or a notice of the referendum held on March 27, 1986, as required under General Statutes \u00a7 7-9c;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) the town of Sterling\u2019s conduct between the first and second referendum improperly had exerted undue influence upon the privilege of free suffrage of the citizens of Sterling in violation of article sixth, \u00a7 4, of the Connecticut constitution. The improper conduct alleged by the plaintiffs is that the town, during the period of February 23,1986, through March 27,1986, had prepared and distributed informational materials and explanatory texts which advocated the approval of the referendum question. The plaintiffs also alleged that town funds, facilities and materials had been used to prepare and distribute this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>The plaintiffs, claiming irreparable harm and no adequate remedy at law, requested that the town be enjoined from taking any action to effectuate the sale of the land to Oxford Energy, Inc., and also requested \u201c[s]uch other and further relief as [the trial] court deem[ed] just and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The defendant filed a motion to dismiss on May 21, 1986, asserting that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to interfere with a legislative action of the town and because the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge such legislative action. The defendant also argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust the administrative remedies provided by General Statutes \u00a7 9-7b. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to maintain the action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">On September 30,1986, the plaintiffs appealed claiming, inter alia, that the trial court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs lacked standing. At oral argument in this court, the plaintiffs conceded that as of the date this action was filed in the trial court, they had not yet filed a complaint with the state elections enforcement commission (the commission).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We note that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tiffs did file a complaint with the commission twenty-six days after this action had been initiated in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\u201c \u2018It is a settled principle of administrative law that, if an adequate administrative remedy exists, it must be exhausted before the Superior Court will obtain jurisdiction to act in the matter. <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>173 Conn. 352, 358-59, 377 A.2d 1099 (1977); <em>State ex rel. Golembeske </em>v. <em>White, </em>168 Conn. 278, 282, 362 A.2d 1354 (1975); see 3 Davis, Administrative Law \u00a7 20.01; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-175, 4-183.\u2019 <em>Connecticut Mobile Home Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Jensen\u2019s, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 586, 588, 424 A.2d 285 (1979).\u201d <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>204 Conn. 67, 75, 527 A.2d 1230 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Because the exhaustion doctrine implicates subject matter jurisdiction, we must decide as a threshold matter whether that doctrine requires dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The issue of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time including on appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201cOnce brought to the attention of the court, regardless of the form of the motion, it must be acted upon.\u201d <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>198 Conn. 229, 238, 502 A.2d 410 (1985) <em>(Cahill II); East Side Civic Assn. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>161 Conn. 558, 559, 290 A.2d 348 (1971); <em>Carten </em>v. <em>Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 610, 219 A.2d 711 (1966). \u201cMoreover, \u2018 \u201cwhenever a court discovers that it has no jurisdiction, it is bound to dismiss the case, without regard to its previous rulings.\u201d \u2019 <em>Chzrislonk </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>101 Conn. 356, 358, 125 A. 874 (1924).\u201d <em>Cahill II, </em>supra. If the trial court had no jurisdiction because the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, the action must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The doctrine of exhaustion is grounded in a policy of fostering an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review in which a reviewing court will have the benefit of the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions. <em>Connecticut Life &amp; Health Ins. Guaranty Assn. </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 358-59. \u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion \u2018furthers the salutary goals of relieving the courts of the burden of deciding questions entrusted to an agency ... in advance of possible judicial review.\u2019 <em>Watergate II Apartments </em>v. <em>Buffalo Sewer Authority, </em>46 N.Y.2d 52, 57, 385 N.E.2d 560, 412 N.Y.S.2d 821 (1978).\u201d <em>Cahill II, </em>supra, 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The plaintiffs argue that their request for injunctive relief was properly before the trial court because a party is not required to exhaust an administrative remedy that is inadequate. Specifically, the plaintiffs maintain that the available administrative remedy, initiated by filing a complaint with the state elections enforcement commission, is inadequate because under General Statutes \u00a7 9-7b (8),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the commission has no obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>to refer the matter to the attorney general for injunctive relief and, even if the matter is referred to the attorney general, the attorney general has no <em>obligation </em>to seek the injunctive relief requested. The plaintiffs argue that because the commission itself has no power to seek an injunction, the administrative remedy necessarily is inadequate to redress their complaint. Although we agree that a party is not required to exhaust an inadequate administrative remedy, we disagree with the plaintiffs\u2019 characterization of their administrative remedy in this case as inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The administrative process that the plaintiffs claim is inadequate is set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 9-7b. This lengthy statute outlines the powers and duties of the commission. Under the statute, the commission has considerable power to make investigations, including the ability to hear witnesses, to review written documents, and to use subpoena power. The commission is authorized, inter alia, to levy civil penalties for various violations, to order repayment of funds spent improperly, to refer to the chief state\u2019s attorney evidence of various election law violations for possible criminal prosecutions, and to refer to the attorney general any \u201cevidence\u201d of violations requiring injunctive or other ancillary equitable relief. General Statutes \u00a7 9-7b (1), (2), (3), (7) and (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Although, under the statute, the commission itself does not have the power to seek injunctive relief, it does have the power and duly \u201c[t]o refer to the attorney general evidence for injunctive relief . . . . \u201d General Statutes \u00a7 9-7b (8). The legislative history of that provision indicates clearly that the procedure of referring to the attorney general a request for injunctive relief was set up as a mechanism to avoid creating a legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>staff solely for the commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The procedure envisioned by the legislature is that in any case where the commission has evidence indicating a violation of state election laws, it has the power and the duty, in appropriate cases, to refer this evidence to the attorney general who is authorized to seek injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In arguing that the administrative remedy is inadequate, one scenario presumably envisioned by the plaintiffs is that the commission would find serious error in an election process, but the attorney general would refuse, for one reason or another, to seek the injunctive relief requested. Another situation is that the commission itself would refuse to turn over evidence to the attorney general even though it had found an obvious violation of the election laws. First of all, these scenarios are not in accord with the facts as pleaded in this case. Moreover, by bypassing the administrative remedy, the plaintiff has not only \u201cdeprived [the administrative body] of the opportunity to hear, analyze and review a matter within its responsibility and expertise, but [has] also deprived [itself] of the opportunity to put on [its] case and to make a proper record on which to seek judicial relief . . . <em>Cahill, II, </em>supra, 241-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Although we do not require a party to pursue an administrative remedy that is futile, we have never held that the mere possibility that an administrative agency may deny a party the specific relief requested is a ground for an exception to the exhaustion requirement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Id., 243. In our cases, we have held that futility is more than a mere allegation that the administrative agency might not grant the relief requested. In most instances, we have held that the failure to exhaust an administrative remedy is permissible only when the administrative remedy would be useless. For example, in <em>Cahill II, </em>supra, we held that a mere claim of probable bias was insufficient to avoid the exhaustion doctrine. Id., 242. By contrast, in <em>Dukes </em>v. <em>Durante, </em>192 Conn. 207, 223-24, 471 A.2d 1368 (1984), the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief based on the defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate housing. We concluded that, in light of the statute limiting the agency\u2019s power to determinations of \u201celigibility for relocation payments,\u201d resort to the agency would have been futile.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>187 Conn. 94, 444 A.2d 907 (1982) <em>(Cahill I), </em>we held that an appeal from a decision by the defendant board was not necessary because the administrative agency had no power whatsoever to deal with the dispute in question. Id., 103-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This case does not present the situation sometimes found in zoning cases where we have permitted an exception to the exhaustion requirement. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number><em>Soffer, </em>183 Conn. 67, 71-72, 438 A.2d 1163 (1981); <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Lisbon Leasing Corporation, </em>173 Conn. 175, 180, 377 A.2d 280 (1977). This exception requires that a plaintiff make allegations that a zoning violation has resulted in special damage to an individual. <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>supra, 77-78. The type of harm alleged here is not analogous to the specific harm suffered by a violation of a zoning ordinance where injunctive relief from a court may be a more appropriate remedy. The type of harm alleged by the plaintiffs in this case is a generalized injury suffered by all the voters and taxpayers of the town. This is precisely the type of harm that the commission was designed to combat. Although this harm is suffered generally by all voters in a particular election, no voter is denied a right to contest the election since the written complaint of only one person is enough to trigger the agency\u2019s investigatory powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">At oral argument, the plaintiffs relied heavily on <em>Brainard </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>140 Conn. 631, 103 A.2d 135 (1954), where we held that an appeal to a public authority that was not bound to redress private grievances was an inadequate remedy. The crucial distinction there was that the private complainant was appealing to a board that was authorized only to act in the interests of the public convenience and welfare. In this case, the plaintiffs are not asserting a private grievance, but public grievances relating to election improprieties that the commission has a duty to investigate and redress. Furthermore, the commission is authorized to act on behalf of precisely this class of complainants to further the interests of the public in properly conducted elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The purpose of the administrative remedy embodied in this statutory scheme is to guarantee that all elections, primaries and referenda in Connecticut are held according to law. The ability of only one person to trigger the commission\u2019s action ensures that any illegal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ity or unfairness in the process cannot be overlooked even when the margin of victory is overwhelming. The broad investigatory powers of the commission in General Statutes \u00a7 9-7b (1) guarantee the commission access to the pertinent evidence that will enable it to make an informed decision. The sanctions that the commission is empowered to impose and its ability to refer \u201cevidence\u201d to state officials, including the attorney general, for further action gives the commission the power to fulfill the legislative intent to guarantee that elections be conducted according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">A final factor in our analysis is the practical notion of judicial economy that is involved. See <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Tripp, </em>supra, 79. Election law complaints are better suited to the commission than the courts at the outset. Rather than forcing an aggrieved voter to hire counsel to make a claim, the administrative process permits an appropriate inquiry to be commenced upon the mere filing of a written complaint with the commission. The expertise of the commission in the area of elections makes it well suited to hear the case initially. Notions of judicial economy lead us to conclude that the proper procedure for alleging a violation of an election law is to file a complaint with the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The fact that the plaintiffs have also alleged a violation of the free suffrage provision of the Connecticut constitution, article sixth, \u00a7 4, does not change our conclusion. \u201c[D]irect judicial adjudication even of constitutional claims is not warranted when the relief sought by a litigant \u2018might conceivably have been obtained through an alternative [statutory] procedure . . . which [the litigant] has chosen to ignore.\u2019 <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>State, </em>[189 Conn. 550, 559, 457 A.2d 304 (1983)].\u201d <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>199 Conn. 70, 87, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986). Although the plaintiffs have alleged a constitutional violation, the administrative remedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>provided in the statute could conceivably provide all the relief requested by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The plaintiffs in this case filed a complaint with the commission twenty-six days <em>after </em>the action was initiated in Superior Court. Because the remedy available through the state elections enforcement commission might well have afforded the plaintiffs an adequate administrative remedy, the Superior Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this matter. The Superior Court should have dismissed the case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-6\"> Two individual members of the Concerned Citizens of Sterling, Frank Bauer and Glenn Shiffer, were also original plaintiffs in this action. The Concerned Citizens of Sterling and Glenn Shiffer have filed this appeal.

In <em>Dukes, </em>the administrative remedy provided under General Statutes \u00a7 8-278 was limited to determinations of \u201celigibility for relocation payments.\u201d The plaintiffs in that case sought injunctive relief because the defendants had failed to provide decent, safe and adequate housing. We concluded that because the commission was authorized to determine eligibility for relocation payments only, any claim made to that agency for injunctive relief would have been futile and thus excused the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to seek relief from the administrative agency. In this case, however, unlike <em>Dukes, </em>the available administrative procedure does provide the plaintiffs with a mechanism for attaining the remedy that they seek.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
