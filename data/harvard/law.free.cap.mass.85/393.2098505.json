The first count was for a malicious prosecution, alleging that the defendants had maliciously caused the female plaintiff, Mary Kidder, to be indicted and prosecuted for peijury, and that on her trial she was acquitted. The second and third counts were for a libel. The alleged libel was a complaint to the grand jury, signed by the two defendants and ten other persons, stating their belief that Mrs. Kidder had committed perjury-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-9\">At the trial in this court, before Chapman, J., the plaintiffs introduced evidence tending to prove the following facts: Martha B. Kidder commenced an action of tort against the inhabitants of Dunstable, to recover for personal injuries sustained by reason of a defective highway, which was tried in this court in April 1856, her mother, Mary Kidder, being a witness for her therein, and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, which was set aside on exceptions, (7 Gray, 104,) and the case was tried again in April 1857, and another verdict returned for the plaintiff, on which, after the exceptions taken had been overruled, judgment was entered in October 1858. By votes of the inhabitants of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Dunstable, it was left with a committee to settle or defend the suit, and both of the defendants were members of the committee, Parkhurst having become a member thereof in November 1856. In June 1856 a complaint, drawn up by the partner of the district attorney, and signed by the two defendants and ten other persons, to some of whom the defendant Parkhurst exhibited it and asked them if they wished to sign it, was presented to the grand jury, setting forth the judicial proceedings in the trial of the action above referred to, and stating that in that trial it became a material question how long Martha B. Kidder was confined to her house in consequence of the injuries received by her, and that Mary Kidder testified as a witness that she was so confined from the 3d of February 1854 until the second week in March following, \u201c which declaration of said Mary Kidder your complainants believe to be false, and therefore said complainants say that said Mary Kidder at said court holden as aforesaid did, as they believe, commit the crime of wilful and corrupt perjury.\u201d One of these persons did not read the paper before signing it, but signed it supposing it to be \u201c an instrument against Mrs. Kidder,\u201d and had made up his mind from what he heard from others than the defendants that Mrs. Kidder\u2019s testimony was false. Another person read it, and upon information which he had received from others than the defendants believed the charge to be true. This complaint was heard before the grand jury, the defendant Cummings being one of the witnesses before them, and no indictment was found. A new grand jury was summoned the next year, before whom the matter was brought, in February 1857, both defendants being called as witnesses, and other witnesses being summoned by the defendant Parkhurst in the night, and an indictment was found, on which Mrs. Kidder was tried and acquitted. There was also evidence tending to show that the testimony of Mrs. Kidder as to the length of time that Martha B. Kidder was confined to the house after receiving the injury was not quite so definite as the statement of it contained in the complaint to the grand jury; and that Martha B. Kidder went out to a dance during the time covered by Mrs. Kidder\u2019s testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>The above is all the evidence which at the argument was relied on as material; and, the plaintiffs having rested their case upon it, <em>Chapman, </em>J. was of opinion that it was insufficient to sustain the action, and reserved the question, by consent of the parties, for the consideration of the whole court, for them to grant a new trial or render judgment for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-5\">D. <em>S.

Probable cause is such a state of facts as would reasonably persuade an impartial, reasonable and cautious person not merely to suspect or conjecture but to believe the plaintiff guilty. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>12 Conn. 230. <em>Munns </em>v. <em>Dupont, </em>3 Wash.

Want of probable cause is established by proof that the evidence given at the trial was different from that on which the perjury was assigned. <em>Incledon </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>cited in 1 Camp. 204, note, ruling of Le Blanc, J. If the indictment was intended to operate upon the civil action in case of a new trial, it was express malice, making the complaint a libel and the prosecution malicious. <em>Bodwell </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>3 Pick. 379. There was a <em>prima facie </em>case made out, and the defendants should have been called upon to answer it, and the case should have been submitted to the jury. The question of good faith in making the statements contained in the complaint to the grand jury was a matter of fact for the jury. <em>Gassett </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>6 Gray, 94.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-6\"><em>J.

Whether there was probable cause is a question of law on the evidence. When the evidence is contradictory, the court will submit the question to the jury, under instructions adapted to the facts which they shall find to be proved. <em>Cloon </em>v. <em>Gerry, </em>13 Gray, 201. <em>Blachford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>v. <em>Dod, 2 </em>B. &amp; Ad. 184. <em>Hinton </em>v. <em>Heather, </em>14 M. &amp; W. 134. In the present case, there was no contradictory evidence that required the action of a jury; but the evidence was such as, in our judgment, showed probable cause for the prosecution complained of in the first count in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. It was believed by several persons that the charge was true on which the plaintiff was prosecuted; and there seems to have been sufficient reason for believing that she had not testified correctly, in all particulars, at the trial of her daughter\u2019s action against the town of Dunstable. And though, upon her own trial, the accusation of perjury was found to be groundless, yet this finding did not negative the existence of probable cause for making the accusation. That was to' be judged of, not upon the actual state of the case, but upon the honest and reasonable belief of the party prosecuting. <em>Bacon </em>v. <em>Toune, </em>4 Cush. 238, 239. And want of probable cause cannot be inferred from the malice of the prosecutor. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Farley, </em>10 Cush. 281. 2 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 454, 455. It has always been held that actions of this kind are not to be favored. And \u201c the <em>onus probandi </em>is upon the plaintiff to prove affirmatively, by circumstances or otherwise, that the defendants had no ground for commencing the prosecution.\u201d By <em>Morton, </em>J., in the case of <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>24 Pick. 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The second and third counts in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration are for a libel on her in a complaint made by the defendants \u00e1gainst her for perjury. The bill of exceptions shows that this complaint was made to the grand jury. It therefore appears to have been made in the regular course of justice. And the decisions, ancient and modern, are uniform, that no proceeding in a regular course of justice is to be deemed an actionable libel. <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em>4 Co. 14 <em>b.

In <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Miles, </em>9 N. H. 14, it was said by Parker, C. J that \u201c an action for a libel cannot be sustained for a proceeding before a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, if the process was instituted under a probable belief that the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>alleged was true, and with the intention of pursuing it according to the course of the court, even if the matter turns out to be wholly false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ad7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
