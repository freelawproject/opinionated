He then, after making a provision for his widow, which includes two slaves, proceeds, \u201c the residue of my real estate to be sold upon a credit, one third in hand, and the other two thirds in two equal annual payments, secured by a deed of trust upon the land ; the balance of my slaves to be equally divided among my children, with those slaves which I have heretofore lent to my children, or their value ; the remaining part of my personal estate to be sold, and equally divided among my several children, charging my daughter <em>Ann Fishback </em>for advancements with 450 dollars, my daughter <em>Kitty Combs </em>with 600 dollars, and my son <em>Sylvester Welch </em>with 600 dollars, as a balance for the land I sold him, for which he has a deed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-5\">At the death of <em>Sylvester Welch </em>he left one son, <em>Sylvester Welch, jun. </em>who he appointed his executor, and six daughters, all of whom but one, either was then, or had been married. Of these, <em>Ann </em>was married to <em>Fish-back </em>in 1814, when she received from her father a negro girl named <em>Sookey, </em>and in 1816, she received from him a negro boy named <em>Jesse, </em>both of whom continued in the possession of <em>Fishback </em>until his death in 1824, when they went into the hands of his representatives, and continued therein ever after. The evidence seems to be clear that as to <em>Sookey, Sylvester Welch </em>never set up any claim to her, but repeatedly admitted that he had given her to <em>Mrs. Fishback, </em>and although he set up a claim to <em>Jesse </em>when he was about to be appraised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>as a part of the estate of <em>Fishbaclc, </em>in 1824, that claim was denied by <em>Fishbaclc\u2019s </em>representative, and he acquiesced from that time until his death. He also put slaves into the possession of his other children, who were married, by some of whom it appears to have been admitted that the slaves thus put into their possession, were only loaned to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-3\">In 1834, <em>Sylvester Welch jnn\u2019r </em>the executor instituted this suit in the county court of <em>Fauquier, </em>against the other legatees of his father, in which he stated the difficulty of ascertaining the principles upon which a division of the estate should be made among the legatees, and asked that his administration account might be settled, and a division of the estate be made. The legatees answered, concurring in the prayer for a division, but <em>Mrs. Fishbaclc </em>insisted, that the slaves <em>Sookey </em>and <em>Jesse </em>had been given to her by her father, and that she, therefore, was not to account for the present value of them and their increase, but only for the value when given. The question whether the children, who had received slaves from their father, should account for their value at the time of receiving them, or for the present value of the slaves and their increase, or the proceeds of such as were sold by them, was in fact the only disputed question in the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-4\">The court referred the executor\u2019s accounts to a commissioner, to be se+tled, and also appointed commissioners to divide the slaves, and on the coming in of their reports, made a decree, by which it was adjudged, that the children should each be charged with the value of the slaves at the time they were received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-5\">During the pendency of the cause in the county court, the appellant <em>James Kean </em>intermarried with <em>Jemima, </em>the only daughter of <em>Sylvester Welch, </em>who had not been married in his lifetime, and he and his wife, and <em>Shank </em>and his wife, who was another daughter, took an appeal from the decree of the county court to the circuit supe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>rior court of law and chancery for the county of <em>Fauquier, </em>where the decree of the county court was affirmed, and then <em>Kean </em>and wife applied for and obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-6\"><em>R.

That, by his will, all his slaves, (except the two given to his widow,) as well those in his own possession, as those he had placed in possession of his children, were to be equally divided among his children in like manner as the residue of his personal estate was directed, to be divided. That by the expression in the will, \u201c or their value,\u201d he did not intend to treat the slaves as advancements, the value of which was to be accounted for as at the time when they were advanced, but to give the loanees the privilege of retaining the slaves previously lent, upon their accounting for their value as at the time of the division. The court is further of opinion, that if any of said slaves so lent had died in possession of the loanee, the loss falls on the estate, and not on the loanee. And if, prior to such division, any of the slaves loaned or their increase have been sold by or passed out of the possession of the loanees, so that they cannot be produced for division in kind, such loanee should be charged with the value of such slaves and their increase as at the time of division, if it can be ascertained, if not the value at the time of the sale or when possession was parted with or lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The court is, therefore, of opinion, that the decree of the circuit superior court of law and chancery, affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>the decree of the county court of <em>Fauquier, </em>is erro<em>neous; </em>therefore the same is reversed with costs in favour of the appellants: and this court, proceeding to make such decree as said court ought to have made, is of opinion, that the county court erred in decreeing that the slaves received by the parties from the testator in his lifetime, ought to be valued at the time when they respectively came to their possession. Therefore, the decree of the county court is reversed with costs to the appellants in the prosecution of their appeal in said circuit court expended; and the cause is remanded to be finally proceeded, in according to the principles of this opinion and decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b431-3\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AK2\">dissented from the opinion of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
