It appears from the will, that the testator had one child, <em>Mrs. Whooston, </em>who was living at the date of his will, and that he had had another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>child who was then dead, neither of whom is mentioned in the bequest above quoted. He made a distinct provision for <em>Mrs. Whooston; </em>and as to the property given her, he provided, that \u201c if she should die without <em>a living heir, </em>it should return to his estate.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-3\">The county court and the chancellor both held, that the residue of the testator\u2019s slaves should be divided into <em>six </em>parts, or shares, and one share allotted to the seven children of <em>William Crow </em>deceased, among them, one to each of the testator\u2019s sons, <em>Thomas, Moses </em>and <em>John Crow, </em>one to the children of <em>Mrs. Jones, </em>and one to the children of <em>Mrs. Crane. </em>The children of <em>William Crow </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b87-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzJ\">said, that under the first part \u00a9f the bequest, to the seven children of <em>William Crow </em>by name, to the three sons of the testator by name, and to the children of <em>Mrs. Jones </em>and to those of <em>Mrs. Crane </em>by description, had it not been qualified by subsequent words, all the persons named and all the persons described, would have taken equal shares <em>per capita; </em>and the subsequent words, providing that the children of <em>Mrs. Jones </em>and those of <em>Mrs. Crane </em>should take <em>per stirpes, </em>leave the seven children of <em>William Crow, </em>who are particularly named, to take <em>per capita ; </em>nay, manifest a clear intent that they should so take. The testator, in directing the subject to be equally divided between <em>his children, </em>to wit, the heirs of <em>William Crow, </em>namely, <em>William, </em>ike. (children of his son William), <em>Thomas, </em>Sic. (his own sons) and the children of his daughters, <em>Mrs. Jones </em>and <em>Mrs. Crane, </em>in effect, describes and adopts his grand-children by his son <em>William </em>as <em>his children, </em>while his grand-children by his two daughters are described not as <em>his </em>but as <em>their </em>children. And when the testator said, that the children of <em>Mrs. Jones </em>and <em>Mrs. Crane, </em>respectively, should take only such part as their mothers would have taken if alive, that is to say, <em>a child\u2019s part, </em>he meant that part which would be a child\u2019s part according to the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>of division prescribed in the clause itself, not a child\u2019s pari ^ in the general sense of the phrase; for he left a living child not mentioned in the bequest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-7\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMD\">observed, that if <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>construction prevailed, the children of the testator\u2019s son <em>William </em>would take more than half the whole subject, namely, seven-twelfths, and the other five branches of his family only one-twelfth, each; a construction so contrary to the natural bounty which dictated the provision, that it ought not to be allowed, unless it was unavoidable. The words of the will import no such extraordinary and unreasonable disposition. The declared design was, that the subject should be <em>equally divided </em>among the <em>testator\u2019s children; </em>and this design would be defeated, if his grand-children by his son <em>William </em>take <em>per capita </em>with the testator\u2019s <em>own </em>sons, and his grand-chil- _ dren by his daughters take <em>per stirpes. </em>The children, of <em>William, </em>though named, are yet described as his <em>heirs; </em>' which is <em>nomen collectivum. </em>The provision with respect to the children of the two deceased daughters, that they shall each take the share which their mothers if alive <em>would take, </em>that is, <em>a child\u2019s part, </em>evinced an intent, that the shares should be ascertained by reference to the testator\u2019s <em>own children </em>named in the clause.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-9\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Amp\">The sole question presented to the court, is, Whether, under the words of the will, the children of <em>William Crow </em>deceased, will take per <em>capita, </em>equal shares with <em>Thomas, Moses </em>and <em>John, </em>the children of the testator, or <em>per stirpes, </em>the share of their father, as the children of <em>Mrs. Jones </em>and <em>Mrs. Crane </em>take ?</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">In the construction of wills, I think it very often happens, that we, in the first place, make- up an opinion as to what the testator ought in justice to have done; that is, what we would in such a case have done; and then endeavour to find out reasons shewing that what he ought to have done, he has done. It was by this process (I rather think) that, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the argument of this cause, l took up a pretty strong ini- . . . .. r i \u2022 , pression against the appellants. It seemed to me not right, that the grand-children by one son, should receive more than the other grand-children, and equal shares with the children of the testator; and, therefore, I concluded, that such was not the meaning of the will. But this is surely a very erroneous process; for the testator having a perfect right to the property, his will is the sole law: we are to inquire what that will <em>is: </em>and in this inquiry, what we think it <em>ought </em>to be, should not have the least influence. The reasons, the calculations, the feelings, the whims even, which may have influenced the testator are inscrutable to us: his words are the only safe guides to conduct us to his meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">In the case before us, it seems to me, that the plain natural meaning of the words, and the rules drawn from the cases, lead us to the same conclusion. The cases all lay it down, that where a legacy is to several, whatever may be their relations to each other, or however the statute of distributions might operate upon such relations, equality shall be the rule, unless the testator has established a different one. Thus, to <em>A. </em>and <em>It. </em>and the children of <em>C. </em>all take <em>per capita: </em>lo <em>A. B. </em>and <em>C. </em>and their children; all living at the testator\u2019s death take equally. So, to the descendants of <em>A. </em>and <em>B., </em>all their descendants, children, grand-children &amp;c. take <em>per capita. Richardson </em>v. <em>Spraag, </em>1 P. Wms. 434. <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>2 P. Wms. 383. <em>Eccard </em>v. Brooke, 2 Cox, 213. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>3 Bro. C.

C\u2019s </em>children), <em>Thomas, Moses, John Crow </em>(children of testator), and the children of my deceased daughter <em>Massey Jones, </em>and the children of my deceased daughter <em>Sarah Crane.\u201d </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Now, suppose the testator had stopped here: could there' be any doubt, that each of his children and grand-childr\u00e9n, named or described, would take equally, <em>per capital </em>He first establishes <em>equality </em>as the rule of partition; and then enumerates, as the takers, ten persons by name, seven of whom he calls the heirs of <em>William, Crow, </em>three his own children; and then he describes, as takers, the children of his two deceased daughters. It does not seem possible to raise a doubt, that if the testator had stopped here, all the children and grand-children, who were the objects of his bounty, must have taken equally. And of this he himself was well aware; for he adds, \u201c <em>but </em>the children of my daughter <em>Massey Jones, </em>are to take only such part as then-mother would take, if she were still alive, that is to say, a child\u2019s part; and in like manner, the children of my daughter <em>Sarah Crane, </em>are to take only such part as their mother would take, if she were still alive, that is to say, a child\u2019s part.\u201d Now, this is a clear and distinct exception: and it shews two things: 1. that the testator knew, that under the former part of the clause, <em>all </em>the objects of it would take <em>per capita: 2. </em>that he did not intend, that <em>all </em>should so take. He, therefore, excepts from its operation, those who were to take by a different rule, <em>namely, per stirpes; </em>and these were the children of his two daughters. This seems to me to give tenfold strength to the claim of <em>William, Crow\u2019s </em>children to take in their own right, <em>per capita. However </em>clearly in favour of that claim the first part of that clause may be, it might, (but for the exception) have been doubted, whether the testator so understood it: but that is impossible now: he has given his own explanation. Knowing, then, that by the operation of the first words, his daughters\u2019 children (whom he had only <em>described generally </em>as children) would take equally, and <em>a fortiori, </em>that <em>William Crow\u2019s </em>children (each of whom he had <em>individually </em>named) would so take; when he excepts the children of his daughters, and leaves the children of <em>William </em>to the unrestrained operation <em>of </em>the clause, the conclusion, that these last were intended to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>equally, is precisely as strong as that the others were to take by a different rule.</p>\n<p id=\"A1T\">Nor is this conclusion at all weakened, in my mind, by the testator\u2019s calling them <em>William Crow\u2019s heirs. </em>He knew nothing of the technical distinction between children and heirs. He shews that he uses them in the same sense: for he says, <em>\u201c </em>the <em>heirs </em>of <em>William Crow namely, William </em>&amp;c. meaning his children.\u201d And in another part of the will, speaking of his daughter <em>Whooston, </em>he says, that what he has given to her shall return to his estate &amp;c. if she shall die without <em>a living heir.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">But it was said, the words <em>\u201ca child\u2019s part,\u201d </em>used in this clause, are strong to shew, that the testator meant, that this <em>residuum </em>should be divided into six parts, and consequently, that <em>William\u2019s </em>children should come in <em>per stirpes </em>only. I cannot see it in that light. By \u201c <em>a child\u2019s part,\u201d </em>did the testator mean a part to be ascertained, by taking the whole number of his children, living and dead, as the divisor ? This would seem the natural sense. But this would give <em>eight </em>as the divisor; for he had had four sons and four daughters: but this is not contended for. Did he mean all his <em>living </em>children ? No! for one of them is confessedly excluded from this legacy, and the children of three deceased children included. The truth is, that by <em>child\u2019s part, </em>he did not mean at all to designate the number of portions, or the manner of taking: for the general purpose of the clause, he had already done this; and the whole purpose of this part of the clause, was to except the children of his daughters, and establish for them a mode of taking, different from that of his three sons and the children of <em>William. </em>In doing this, he says, they are to take only such part, as their mother would take, if she was still alive, that is to say, a child\u2019s part; meaning, simply, to place them in the shoes of their mother, that they should take whatever part she as a child would have taken, without intending to designate either the amount of that part, or its proportion to the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"AHx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>I am of opinion, that appellants take <em>per capita; </em>that the personalty subject to this clause, should be divided into twelve parts, of which the appellants should take seven, one each; the three sons, one each'; the children of <em>Mrs. Jones </em>one, and the children of <em>Mrs. Crane </em>one.</p>\n<author id=\"b92-4\">Green, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ak0\">said, that he inclined very strongly to the opinion, that the decree of the courts below was right, but the opinion of the other judges to the contrary was so clear and decided, that he surrendered his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The other judges, concurring with Carr, <em>J. </em>the decree was reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
