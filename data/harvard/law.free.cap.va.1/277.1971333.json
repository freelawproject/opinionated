The declaration states, that the defendants, having inspected and passed three hogsheads of tobacco, the property of the plaintiff, they refused to deliver him the usual notes, or receipts for them, as by law, and the duty of their office, they were bound to do; but had delivered the notes and the tobacco to other persons, having no authority from the plaintiff to receive the same, contrary to law, and the duties of their office. Plea, <em>Not Guilty. </em>Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, from which the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-9\">The defendants filed a bill of exceptions at the trial, stating, that the plaintiff gave in evidence that <em>John </em>Finch, by direction of the plaintiff, applied to the defendants in the year 1784, for the tobacco in question. That the defendants shewed him the warehouse books, by which it appeared that the defendants had received, and inspected the three hogsheads of tobacco in the declaration mentioned, as the property of the plaintiff, and that the same had been shipped; the defendants alleging, that they had issued notes for it, in obedience to a written order to do so, in the name of the plaintiff, which they shewed to <em>John Finch, </em>who is certain it was not the hand-writing of the plaintiff, of which he informed the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-10\">That the plaintiff afterwards gave a written order, directing the inspectors to deliver the notes for the tobacco to the said <em>John Finch, </em>who presented the same, and demanded the notes, but the defendants refused to deliver the notes, or tobacco, for the reasons before given; but that no proof was made of a personal demand, by the plaintiff himself. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>fendants alleging, that the evidence was not sufficient to maintain the issue on the part of the plaintiff, moved for a nonsuit, which was over-ruled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b299-3\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-4\">The first objection to be made to this judgment, respects the imperfections of the declaration. Though it states that the defendants were inspectors at <em>Bolling\u2019s </em>warehouse, it does not charge them to be <em>public </em>inspectors of a <em>warehouse established by law; </em>and unless this were the case, the action could not be sustained. <em>Robert Bolling </em>might have owned a private warehouse, and the appellants might have been inspectors at it, for any thing that this Court can judicially know. The contrary is not to be presumed.\u2014The appellants could not with propriety traverse this material fact, as it was not charged in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-5\">The declaration is also liable to objection, on account of its being double, and thereby forbidding an issue upon a single point, or at least tending to produce confusion in the trial, and to conceal from the defendants^ view the point intended to be controverted. It charges, 1st, A refusal to deliver the notes to the plaintiff; and 2dly, A delivery of them to a third person, unauthorised to receive them. If the plaintiff may bring two distinct charges into discussion, in one count, he may multiply them without end.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-6\">As to the bill of exceptions, I think it shews that the appellee ought not to have recovered upon the evidence produced by him. It appears, that no demand was made by the <em>appellee himself, </em>and the Act of Assembly does not authorise inspectors to deliver the notes to the <em>order </em>of the owner, but to the owner himself. If the appellants were chargeable in this case, it would place inspectors in this dangerous dilemma : if they deliver the tobacco to the forged order of a person, whose hand-writing they never saw, they subject themselves to an action, and to a penalty also: if they do not deliver it, and the order shall be genuine, they will still be liable to an action. The law authorises the delivery of the notes, to the person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>brings the tobacco, and from any thing appearing in this record, the notes might have been delivered to the overseer of the appellee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-7\">Marshall, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-8\">What weight there might be in the objections to the declaration, if they had been made at a proper time, it is unnecessary now to decide, because, after a general verdict, the Court will presume that those things were proved to the jury, without which they ought not to have found as they have done. The Court, after verdict, will not, for the purpose of destroying it, hunt after objections, or inquire whether there might not be a possible case, in which this action would not lie. It is notorious, that there are no private warehouses for the inspection of tobacco in this country. The declaration pursues the words of the law. The Act of Assembly which establishes tobacco warehouses, is a public one, and the Court will, therefore, take notice that <em>Bolling\u2019s warehouse </em>is one created by this law. But there may be enough collected from the declaration to defeat this objection, for it charges, that the defendants refused to deliver the <em>usual </em>notes, contrary to their <em>office of inspector. </em>Another objection to the declaration is, that it is double. But if there be two Acts, either of which will sustain an action, it cannot be error to state them both by way of aggra vating the damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b300-9\">The point made in the bill of exceptions, having been before decided in this Court, it will be unnecessary to take notice of it. It is settled, that the Court cannot direct a nonsuit in any case, and that if they do, the plaintiff may refuse to submit to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-10\"><em>Call, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACf\">As to the power of the Court te direct a nonsuit, I admit that the point has been settled as Mr. <em>Marshall </em>has stated. But certainly, if a bill of exceptions exhibits the <em>whole </em>evidence, and shews, that the plaintiff had no cause of action, judgment may be rendered against him, as well in such a case, as if it had appeared in the form of a demurrer to evidence\u00bb</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b301-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The President</author>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">Upon a motion for a nonsuit, the Court may give their opinion, that the plaintiff has no cause of action, and may direct him to be called. But he may, nevertheless, appear and refuse to be nonsuited, nor can the Court compel him against his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">So, on the other band, the Court may declare that the action is maintainable\u2014-or may refuse to give any opinion to the jury, and so leave the whole question with them ; if they do instruct, still the jury may find against the opinion of the Court, who have no remedy left but to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">So, if the party file a demurrer to the evidence, the Court may, if the evidence be clear, refuse to compel the other party to join in demurrer, leaving the jury at liberty to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">But if, in either of these cases, the Superior Court should be satisfied that the plaintiff had no cause of action, they will reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">This bill of exceptions exhibits a very different case. The whole question was, whether the order on which the notes and tobacco were delivered, was genuine or counterfeit. This was a mere matter of fact, proper only for the inquiry and determination of the jury. As to the hardship, which it was contended inspectors would be subjected to, it is no greater than that to which they might be exposed by delivering tobacco on counterfeit notes, in which case, they would clearly be liable to the holder of the real notes. It is a common and known risk of office contemplated when, undertaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">We are next to consider the objections to the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">The first is, that the warehouse is not stated to be a <em>public </em>one. If it were possible to suppose a <em>private </em>warehouse at <em>Robert Rolling9s\u2014Inspectors </em>there, to <em>view </em>and <em>pass </em>fo\u00f3am;\u2014compelled by <em>law </em>and the <em>duty of their </em>office, to give notes obligatory upon them to deliver the tobacco on demand\u2014-if, I say, we could suppose all this, and consider this as a <em>mere private </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>contract, it would even then be diflicult to support \u00bbhe objections to the action upon principles of common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">But such a case is altogether visionary. The record and the public laws upon the subject warrant the Court in saying, that the warehouse and the inspectors are such as the law has established.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The second objection is, that the declaration is <em>multifarious.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">The Act of Assembly requires, 1st. That the notes should be delivered to the owner of the tobacco, but inflicts no penalty for refusing to do it. 2d. It imposes a penalty upon the inspectors for delivering the notes to any but to the proprietor of the tobacco, without a written order from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">This action is brought, not for delivering the notes to a third person, unauthorised to receive them, but for not delivering them, when demanded, to the owner.\u2014The former offence, though charged, is merely by way of special damage, and intended to show the remedy complete for the whole value of the tobacco, since the defendants had put it out of their power ever to deliver it.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b302-13\"> <em>Martin et. al. </em>v. <em>Stover, </em>2 Call. 514. <em>Dunbar </em>v. <em>Beale, </em>5 Munf. 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
