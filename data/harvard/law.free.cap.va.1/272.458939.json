January.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b284-4\">In a plea of <em>alien </em>enemy, it is necessary for the defendant to negative or affirm all the facts\u00bb that are required to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b284-5\">Therefore, in such a plea, it is necessary for the defendant to state, not only that the plaintiff was an <em>alien </em>enemy, but also <em>that he had not the license of the government to remain in the country.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b284-6\">It is further necessary, during the war of 1812, for the plea to affirm that the plaintiff had been ordered off by the executive of the United States ; as, by virtue of an act of Congress, an alien enemy is permitted to remain in the - country, until he is ordered to depart by the executive.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">This was an action of assault anti battery brought in the county court of Accomack, by George Babe against Charles Bagwell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-8\">The declaration is in the usual form. The defendant filed two pleas: First, \u201c that he, the said George, at the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-9\">\u201c time of issuing the original writ of him, the said George, <em>\u201c </em>in this cause, was a subject of the King of Great Bri- \u201c tain, then waging and carrying on war against this \u201c state, and the citizens thereof; and this, he the said \u201c Charles is ready to verify.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-10\">The second plea is, that as to the coming with force and arms, and also as to the battery and wounding aforesaid of him the said George, the said Charles is <em>not guil~ ty </em>; and as to the residue of the trespass, assault and imprisonment, that he the said Charles was dufy commissioned lieutenant colonel commandant of the 99th regiment of militia in the county of Accomack ; and the said George Babe being a subject of the King of Great Britain, then at war with the United States, and the said George Babe not having become a citizen of the United States, \u201c and being a suspicious man, who the said Charles Bag<em>se </em>well judged would have carried information of the mi- \u201c litary strength of his regiment to the enemy, at that <em>\u201c </em>time hovering on and near to the limits of the said 99th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>a </em>regiment, the said Charles, by virtue of his authority 44 as commanding the said regiment, <em>genlly laid Ids hands </em>44 <em>upon the said </em>George, and arrested him, and took his 44 body in custody and detained him in execution, until he 44 was discharged; which is the residue of the trespass, 44 assault, and imprisonment aforesaid, &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">The plaintiff demurred to the first plea, and concludes his demurrer by saying 44 and for cause of demurring in \u201c law to the said plea, the said George Babe sheweth to 44 the court here the cause following, to wit: that long be-44 fore the declaration of the present war between the 44 United States of America, and the Kingdom of Great \u201c Britain, viz : in the year , he the said George, 44 migrated from the Kingdom of Great Britain aforesaid, 44 to the United States of America; and has constantly 44 resided in the United States of America since that time 44 to the present day; and this he is ready to verify.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-8\">As to the second plea, the plaintiff replied, that the said Charles did not arrest and imprison the said George, for the cause and in the manner, as he in pleading hath above alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-9\">The defendant joined in demurrer to the first plea, and joined issue on the replication to tbe second plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-10\">On the trial of the issue in fact, the jury found a verdict for g 225 damages ; and the court sustained the demurrer to the plea of <em>alien enemy. </em>The court gave judgment accordingly for the plaintiff, and the defendant appealed to the superior court of law for the county of Accomack.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-11\">The superior court affirmed the judgment of the county court; and the defendant appealed to this court,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-12\"><em>Nicholas, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b285-13\"><em>Leigh </em>and <em>Upshur, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>it was contended for the appellant, that the court erred m* in sustaining the demurrer. TLIie plea of <em>alien enemy </em>is a good and valid defence. The demurrer is a <em>general </em>one, and therefore no exception can be taken to the <em>form </em>of the plea. But the demurrer itself is irregular, because it brings forward a new <em>matter of fact, </em>viz : that the plaintiff was commorant in this country before the war; which is wholly incompatible with the idea of a demurrer. But, even if this fact were regularly pleaded, it could afford no protection to the plaintiff, from arrest. As an alien enemy he is liable to arrest, unless he is protected by a <em>safe conduct,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and without it, he will not be protected.<footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>When a plaintiff, by his replication, means to rely on a <em>special license </em>to remain in the country, he ought to allege that fact <em>specially.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He ought to have replied that fact, instead of demurring.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">The counsel for the appellee admitted that the plea of <em>alien enemy </em>applies to all sorts of actions, whether real, personal, or mixed <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hut, an alien enemy coming into the commonwealth under a safe conduct, may maintain a personal action; or, if he come hither by license of government, and live under its protection, and war afterwards break out, he may maintain such action ; otherwise, if he be commorant in his own <em>country.</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By <em>license, </em>is not meant an <em>express </em>license in each individual case; but <em>general permission.</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If this be not doubted in England, much less can it be doubted here, where our laws, state, and federal, give aliens in time of peace, not only permission to come to our country, but an invitation to come, and promise them the utmost favor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">It was formerly a question, whether the plaintiff must set forth, in his replication to the plea of <em>alien enemy, </em>the facts which entitled him, though an alien enemy born, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>sue $ or whether the defendant must, in his plea, set forth all the facts which negative the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue. But it is now settled, that in such case, the defendant must plead all the facts that negative, and the plaintiff is not driven to reply the facts that sustain his right of su~ <em>ing.</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u00ab The plea\u201d (says Lord Kenyon,) \u00ab must nega- \u00ab tive every presumption, that can arise in favor of the \u00ab plaintiff\u2019s right to sue; as, that he came without a safe \u00abconduct, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-4\">The coming without <em>safe </em>conduct, is put for illustration ? the plea, for the same reason, should state that the alien came, and remains <em>without license </em>or permission; and so the approved form of pleading alien enemy, is, that the plaintiff came into the country, and still remains, without letters of safe conduct, <em>and without license or </em>permission; or, that he is living out of the commonwealth, in his own country, adhering to the <em>enemy.</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">The plea in this case, therefore, is clearly naught. It only states, that the plaintiff was a subject of the King of Great Britain, and an alien enemy, that nation being then at war with <em>our\u2019s; </em>without stating, that he came and re* mained here without a safe conduct, and without license or permission, or that he was commorant in his own country, adhering to our enemy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">The demurrer to the plea is general, though it affect to set forth a special cause; which, however, exactly indicates the defect of the plea.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\"><em> </em>1 Bac.

Since the consequences of war have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>been greatly mitigated, especially as to non-combatants, the decisions of courts against alien enemies, have been less rigid. In the case of <em>Clarke </em>vs. <em>Morey,</em><footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the cases have been well reviewed. The plea in the case before the court, does not negative nor affirm all the facts, that were necessary to bar the plaintiff\u2019s action. It does not negative the license of the plaintiff to remain in the country, by virtue of the act of Congress, entitled, an act respecting alien enemies j nor does it affirm, that he had been ordered off by the executive of the United States, in pursuance of that act. Until such order, the act gives permission to the alien to remain, though his sovereign be at war with us. The other issues being found for the plaintiff, the judgment is to be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(i)\">\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><em> </em>10 Johns. Bep.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
