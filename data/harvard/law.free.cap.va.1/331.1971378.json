Samuel Cocke executor of Henry Cocke.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-8\">Declaration upon a bond given to the plaintiff <em>of the County of S., on account of Messrs. P. fy G., Merchants in Glasgow. </em>The omission in the declaration to state the County, or for whose use the debt was contracted, is not a material variance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b351-9\">Declaration upon a bond given by the defendant, and by <em>J. S. </em>deceased, whom the defendant survived ; breach, not the defendant had not paid. <em>Queere. </em>If it should not also have averred non-payment by <em>J. S. </em>?</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-10\">This was an action of debt, brought in the District Court of <em>Williamsburg </em>by the appellant, upon a bond given to him <em>for and on account of Messrs. Glen and </em>Peter, merchants in <em>Glasgow. </em>The declaration states the debt as due to the plaintiff, without mentioning for whose use.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-11\">The defendant, without craving oyer, put in the following pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-12\">1st. Payment. 2d. That the debt was originally due to a British subject, and was acknowledged by the testator to the plaintiff, on account of <em>Glen </em>&amp;? Peter, merchants in Glasgow, who were <em>British </em>subjects ; and was contracted before the 1st of <em>May, </em>1782, and was not transferred to a citizen of this State, nor to any person capable of maintaining an action in this Commonwealth, at any time before the 1st of <em>Maijy </em>1775, for a valuable consideration. There are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>many other pleas, all unimportant to the decision. At \u201cie tr*\u2019ab an objection was made by the defendant to the admission of the bond in evidence; because the bond stated in the declaration, was given to <em>Walter </em>Peter, and the one offered in evidence, is to <em>Walter Peter, ofthe County of </em>Surrey, <em>on account of Messrs. Glen &amp; </em>Peter, <em>merchants in Glasgow. </em>This objection being sustained by the Court, the plaintiff filed an exception to the opinion; and a verdict and judgment being given for the defendant, the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-5\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-6\">It was necessary that this suit should be brought in / the name of <em>Walter Peter, </em>the trustee, as he alone had a right to recover at law. The use to which the money was to be applied, when recovered, was unimportant to the debtor; it was stated in the bond merely as a memorandum for the obligee, and would have been very unnecessarily set forth in the declaration. It is not usual to set out the bond at large in the declaration, provided the material parts of it are stated so as to apprise the defendant of the true ground of the action. It might as well be contended, that the title, or place of residence, of the parties, if mentioned in the bond, should be carefully recited also in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-7\">Lyons, J.\u2014There appears to be a defect in the declaration, which has not been noticed. It charges, that the said <em>Henry Cocke, </em>and a certain <em>Richard Cocke, </em>deceased, whom the said <em>Henry Cocke </em>survived, gave the bond in question. And the breach laid is, that <em>\u201c </em>neither the said <em>Henry, </em>nor the defendant, hath paid,\u201d without averring non-payment by <em>Richard, </em>the other obligor.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-8\"><em>Copeland, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-9\">It is a rule, that the plaintiff need not aver a matter which it would be unnecessary for him to prove, if averred; and if, in the present case, the declaration had charged non-payment by the other obligor, the plaintiff could not have been required to prove it. The defendant pleads payment, and there can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>question but that, under the Act of Assembly permitting him to prove all the discounts in his power, he might have availed himself of any payments made by the other obligor. The case of <em>BusHer </em>v. Philips, <em>Bull. Ni. Pri. </em>163, seems to be in point. That was an action of debt, on a bail bond, against C. and the declaration stated that the defendant and two others became jointly and severally bound; the breach was, that the defendant had not paid. The plaintiff had judgment, although the defendant demurred specially, and stated as a cause, that the declaration did not aver non-payment by the other obligors.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\"> See the case of <em>Arscott </em>v. <em>Heale, Cro. </em>Car. 6, debt against three obligors, one pleads <em>solvit ad </em>diem.

It was unnecessary to state in the declaration, the use or consideration for which the bond was given ; and if it had been stated, it would have been mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">But we do not feel satisfied upon the objection to the declaration stated from the bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The cause must be sent back for a new trial, with directions to admit the bond as evidence, but reserving to the appellee, by the consent of the appellant, the liberty of availing himself of any other legal exception to the proceedings already had, as if this judgment had not been rendered, or any appeal granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Judgment reversed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b353-14\"> <em>Lewis </em>v.
