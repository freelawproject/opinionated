This warrant was located in 1775, and the survey was returned in 1776; long subsequent to the settlement of the plaintiff, as asserted in their bill. <em>Tomlinsons </em>right of settlement having been affirmed by the Commissioners in the year 1780, <em>Williams </em>alone entered a <em>caveat </em>against the emanation of a grant to <em>Rodgers&gt; </em>but by an accident attending the transmission of subpoenas for his witnesses, the <em>caveat </em>was dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-3\"><em>Jacobs </em>and wife by their answer insist, that <em>Rodgers </em>had a right of settlement prior to that of the plaintiff, and amongst other things disclosed, that they had sold to the appellant <em>Jones.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-4\">Depositions were taken, which prove the prior settlement of the plaintiff. After this, a new bill was filed by the plaintiffs, making <em>Jones </em>a party defendant, who appeared, and put in an answer, in which amongst other things, he asserts a right in <em>Rodgers </em>by settlement, prior to that of the plaintiffs. No replication was put in to this answer, but the caus\u00e9 coming on to be heard upon the bill, answers, exhibits and <em>exarni nations of </em>witnesses, the Court decreed in favor of the plaintiffs, from which decree, the defendant <em>Jones </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-5\">Marshall, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-6\">This cause, as to the appellant, is to be considered as having come on, upon bill and answer\": for the depositions having been all taken, before he was a party to the suit, and an entirely new claim being made, and new matter brought before the Court, the evidence could not with any propriety be used against him. It would be most unreasonable, if claims not put in issue by the former bill, could be supported by the evidence taken on that bill. In 1 <em>Harr. Cha. Prac. </em>108, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>taid down that at any time before hearing, upon cause shewn, the plaintiff may obtain an order to add parties to his bill; but in this case, the cause is to be heard as to such new defendant, upon bill and answer. In the same book, p. 150, it is also said, that when a supplemental bill is filed, after publication, the Court never gjves ]eave to examine that which was in issue in the former cause, and it is irregular to examine witnesses, to a matter that was in issue, and not proved in the original cause, and such proof is not to be read. So, if there be no proof of the new matter in the supplemental bill, it must be dismissed, unless such matter be admitted by the defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\">If, then, the cause is to be heard on the bill and answer, the state of the case will be simply this. The answer positively denies the plaintiff\u2019s title ; states a completely equitable right in the defehdant, under a prior settlement by Rodgers, and that converted into a legal title by being carried into grant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-6\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AKC\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The depositions are clearly inadmissible. The first answer is filed in 1789, disclosing the sale to Jones, but at what time does not appear. If it had been <em>pendente </em>lite, the depositions might perhaps have been read. The bill against Jones, is neither supplemental nor amended, for it contains new matter entirely, without noticing the former bill. The cause must, therefore, be heard upon the bill, answer, and exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">It appears, that under the Act of Assembly passed in 1779, <em>Rodgers </em>was entituled to a grant on a militarv survey, returned in 1776. This, however, was subject to a caveat, upon the trial of which, the merits might have been heard and decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">A <em>caveat </em>was entered by <em>Williams, </em>and, in consequence of an accident, was dismissed. We shall, therefore, consider the case as the General Court would have done, on a hearing of the <em>caveat.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">As to a right by settlement, <em>Rodgers </em>appears te <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>have had the best; but no right whatever could be acquired in this way, in lands formerly belonging to the Crown, until the Act passed in May, 1779\u2014be-fore that time, those lands might have been entered, 1 % o . 1*****7 and patented by any person, notwithstanding prior settlements by others : and even this act, which considers settlers as entitled to some compensation for the risk they had run, allows them only a preference to such settlements, as at that time were <em>waste and </em>unappropriated. As to priority of settlement, it might still remain a question between persons, both of whom claim under the same sort of title; but the law of 1779, does not set up rights of this sort, so as to defeat those legally acquired under warrantsj it applies to controversies between mere settlers.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The land in question, therefore, was not <em>waste and unappropriated </em>in 1779, not subject to the claim of a settler, however just it might be, because <em>Rodgers </em>was then entitled to a patent for it</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Decree reversed with costs, and bill dismissed, each party paying his ow,n costs in the High Court of Chancery.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b317-10\"> <em>Depen </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>1 Munf. 301. <em>Norvel </em>v. <em>Camm, </em>2 Munf. 257. <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>4 Munf. 168. 172. 177.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
