He then devised as follows, <em>viz : </em>\u201c I give to my wife my dwelling plantation, and tract of land, (being the land in question,) during her widowhood, and after her death, or widowhood, I give the same to my eldest son <em>William, </em>to him and his heirs, on this condition, that my said son shall, as soon as he arrives to the age of twenty-one years, join in, and make sufficient deeds for conveying to the purchaser or purchasers of my said land in the county of <em>Fairfax, </em>an absolute estate in fee simple, and shall also join in the sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the aforesaid negroes, as my said executors may sell for the payment of my debts, and suffer the remainder of the said slaves to be enjoyed, and go for ever as I have before bequeathed them;

The estate is not to vest, until his arrival al the age of twenty-one years; immediately after which, he is to join in a conveyance of the slaves. It fe necessary therefore that <em>William Keene, </em>or those claiming under him, should shew that he had strictly performed the condition; since no obstacles, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>however great, could excuse him from the performanee. The declaration made in 1775, agreeing perform the conditions in the will, cannot be said to amount to a performance, because this is a thing merely executory, whereas the thing to be done, should have been executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-5\">The cause of forfeiture which I have just considered, is in the omission of the devisee to convey the slaves. But the conveyance of those slaves to trustees, for the use of the family of the devisee, is a more active and deliberate breach of the condition, and has for ever put it out of his power to perform it, although all other obstacles should be removed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b331-6\"><em>Warden </em>and Washington, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-7\">There is certainly a material difference between a condition precedent, and subsequent, both in their nature and effects; if the former, the condition must be strictly performed, before the estate can vest; but if the latter, the estate is immediately vested, and the; continuance of it depends upon the performance. As to the former, it is admitted that nothing, not even the act of God, or of the law, can dispense with a strict performance. In the latter, if the performance be prevented by any such cause, the estate becomes absolute in the possessor ; for conditions which go to <em>defeat </em>estates, are odious, and to be taken strictlv. <em>Shep. Touch. </em>129, 130.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-9\">The condition in question is most certainly subsequent. Immediately after the death of <em>JYewton </em>Keene, the remainder vested in his son <em>William </em>in interest ; and upon the death of the widow of the testator, it vested in <em>possession. </em>But the condition was not to be performed until <em>William </em>came of age, which must have been subsequent to the vesting of the estate ; and therefore, if the performance was prevented by the act of law, the estate is absolute in him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-10\">Let it be here premised, that as to the negroes, the condition is nugatory in itself; because they being devised to the executor, with a power to sell, it was entirely unnecessary to require that <em>William </em>should join <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>in the conveyance, and therefore, if he had really refused to do so, though it might have prevented an estate from <em>vesting, </em>it would not have <em>divested </em>an estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-8\">But suppose the act required to be done was material ; it is denied that a forfeiture has taken place, either by <em>omission, </em>or by any act of <em>commission.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aeq\">As to the first, the charge is, that <em>William </em>has not joined in a conveyance of the slaves mentioned in his father\u2019s will. But before this is relied upon, it should appear, first that the executors had found a purchaser for the slaves, and secondly, that they had produced a conveyance of them, requesting him to join. For <em>William Keene </em>is not authorized to <em>sell, </em>but is required <em>to join in conveying to the persons </em>to whom the <em>executors </em>had previously sold. But again : Neither <em>William Keene, </em>nor the executors, could convey the negroes, until they were reduced into possession.-Such a conveyance would have been <em>ipso facto </em>void, besides exposing the parties to a severe penalty. A condition to do a thing which amounts to maintenance is void. <em>Shep. Touch. </em>129. 1 <em>Hawk. Pl. Cr. </em>255. <em>Roll. </em>Ab. 417. If then this be a condition subsequent, the performance of it is forbidden by the law, and therefore, no forfeiture can have incurred. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-10\">2dly. What act has <em>William Keene </em>done, to disable himself from performing the condition ? Let it not be forgotten, that so soon as he arrived to full age, he bound himself by a declaration sufficient to restrain him from any active breach of the condition. But if not so, the deed of 1789, was not a breach. It is found, that at that time, the negroes were in the adverse possession of another; the deed therefore was void, both at Common Law, and by the Act of Assembly against the selling of pretended titles. If so, it could produce no disability whatever in <em>William Keene, </em>if the negroes should ever afterwards be recovered, and reduced to possession. If a <em>feoffee, </em>upon condition to <em>re-enfeoff, </em>be dissiesed, and then he take wife, and enter into a statute, &amp;c., yet before his entry, this is no breach of the condition, for till then, the charge doth not bind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>die land. <em>Shep. Touch. </em>143. <em>Co. Litt. </em>222, 2 <em>a. Rep. 59, b. </em>Suppose then, that the negroes in question should hereafter be recovered, and admit that the trustees in the deed of 1789, could recover damages, un-. der an idea, that this deed, though not valid as a conveyance, amounted to a covenant to convey when the negroes should be recovered, still such a recovery would produce no disability, and most certainly, a Court of Equity, would never decree, in the very teeth of the Statute, a specific execution of such an agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-3\"><em>William, Keene </em>then cannot properly be charged with a breach of the condition, until, having it in his power, legally to perform it, and being requested to do so, he refuses. Besides the deed of 1789, is not only voluntary, but fraudulent as to the appellee, who had purchased and paid a valuable consideration for the land ten years before this deed of trust was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-4\">But if all these points are against the appellee, he is most clearly entitled to the 240 acres, which were entailed upon <em>William, </em>the second, by the will of his father, and therefore descended upon <em>William </em>the third, unclogged with the condition in <em>Newton Keeners </em>will.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b333-5\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A-t\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">There can be no dispute about the 240 acres, which being entailed by <em>William Keene, </em>the first, descended upon <em>William, </em>the third, free from the conditions in the father\u2019s will, and being converted into a fee simple estate in 1776, he was enabled to convey to the lessor of the plaintiff, a complete and absolute estate in this parcel of land, by the deed of 1779.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">But as judgment is given for all the lands mentioned in the declaration, without distinguishing this part from the other, it must be reversed, unless the plaintiff\u2019s title to the whole can be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The condition annexed to this devise in the will of <em>Newton Keene, </em>is active, so far as it requires the son, when of age. to join with the executors in a convey<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>anee of the slaves to those, who might purchase from ; or passive, as it injoins him, to suffer this property to be enjoyed by the devisees, in case they were not sold. The condition was certainly nugatory, since the devise to the executors to sell, or to the legatees, was perfect, and would have included the heir, without any act on his part. It was added, probably from abundant caution, to remove any doubts of the title from the minds of purchasers. But though it was unnecessarily required, the devisee was not therefore excused from the obligation of performance, since he took the estate subject to that condition. This then brings us to the question, whether it has been sufficiently performed, or not ?</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">In <em>January </em>1775, the devisee executed a writing under seal, reciting, that in the preceeding month he had attained full age, stating the condition on which the land was devised to him, which he had considered, and declaring, that he would abide by the directions, devises, and conditions of the will, and join in any sale of the lands and slaves, according to the will.</p>\n<p id=\"ADxl\">It is objected, that this is not a conveyance, but merely an executory declaration. As to the lands, this is true ; the title to them cannot pass at law, but by a regular conveyance; yet a Court of Equity would have compelled him to release to the person who might purchase from the executors. But it is unnecessary to consider the extent of the obligation which this declaration imposed upon <em>William Keene, </em>as to the land, since it is found that he joined the executors in a conveyance of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">As to the slaves, the declaration under consideration is important. This species of property may pass from one to another without a deed or <em>written </em>contract, if a valuable consideration be given. And if <em>William Keene </em>had instituted a suit for the recovery of these slaves, the writing in question would have been such an evidence of a contract, as to have created a bar to his recovery ; not by way of estoppel, but as passing his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">But it was contended, that he ought, as soon as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>came of age, to have conveyed his right in the slaves to the executors. This would have been doing more than the testator required. He is only enjoined, (in case of a sale made by the executors,) to <em>unite with them in a conveyance to the purchaser, </em>and this he was not bound to do, unless <em>required </em>by the executors. If no sale were made by them, he was then bound to suffer this property to be enjoyed by the devisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">It is objected, that the deed of trust made in 1789, has disabled <em>William Keene </em>from conveying to a purchaser when required, and has also deprived him of the power of permitting the enjoyment of the property by the devisees, within the meaning of the testator. To this, there are two sufficient answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">1st. That the settlement is merely voluntary, and, therefore, fraudulent as to creditors and purchasers, and, indeed, as to all the world, except the grantor himself. It is, therefore, void as to the appellee, who claims under a prior title from <em>William </em>Keene. Besides, the declaration made in 1775, and recorded, had passed away his interest in the slaves, to the uses mentioned in his father's will, and, therefore, the deed of 1789, could not operate to defeat it.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">2d. If it could be admitted, that this deed produced a forfeiture, still the remainder man could not lawfully enter in 1788, before this deed was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Upon the whole, we are of opinion that the conditions in the will of <em>Newton Keene </em>haye been perform - ed, and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
