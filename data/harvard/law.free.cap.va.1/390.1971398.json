The jury, by consent, found a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the following case, viz: that no <em>assumpsit </em>was proved after the 27th of March, 1786, and that the writ in this suit issued the 23d of August, 1791; that to avoid the Act of Limitations, the plaintiff produced a writ, which issued for the same cause of action, from the <em>Court of Hustings </em>of Williamsburg, dated the 24th of October, 1786, and which was not served upon <em>Brown </em>: but in <em>November </em>following, it abated, and was dismissed as to him, he being returned, <em>no inhabitant: </em>That the same writ was. served upon <em>Eaton, </em>another defendant, and abated by his death, in <em>August </em>1787. The verdict to stand, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>law be for the plaintiff, otherwise to be set aside, and judgment entered for the defendant. The judgment of the District Court was in favour of the plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-3\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-4\">It appears, that for four years no suit was depending. The clause in the Act of Limitations, which allows the plaintiff one year to re-commence his action, after the reversal of his judgment, &amp;c. is, I acknowledge, extended, by an equitable construction, to all cases where the plaintiff \u00bfre\u00eds <em>out of Court; </em>but a person coming within the benefit of this liberal construction of the law, must recommence his action within the same time, after the abatement or dismission, as he must have done in cases coming within the letter of the act. He cited <em>Wilcocks </em>v. Huggins, 2 <em>Str. </em>907.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b411-6\">Marshall, for the appellee, submitted the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b411-7\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"AtT\">The plaintiff, according to the decision in the case of <em>Wilcocks </em>v. Huggins, would have been entitled to the benefit of the proviso in the Act of Limitations, under the equity thereof, if he had recommenced his suit w\u00fcthin a year after the former suit was abated. But as four years had nearly elapsed between the abatement of that suit, and the bringing of the present, he cannot avail himself of the proviso, but is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The judgment must be reversed, and entered for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
