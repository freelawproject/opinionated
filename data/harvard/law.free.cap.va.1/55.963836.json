The testator appointed his wife executrix, and one of the sons executor. The son qualified as executor a few months after the testator\u2019s death, and the widow died about two years afterwards. The husband of one of the daughters purchased the right of another daughter, and the three other daughters sold their rights to the son who was executor. In 1816, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>bill was filed in the name of the husband and wife, to compel the executor to execute the trust by selling the land and distributing the proceeds. In 1827, a supplemental bill was filed, setting forth that in 1817 a sale was made, but the executor had taken no further step towards the execution of the <em>trust; </em>and praying that the plaintiffs might have a decree for their proportion of the proceeds of sale. The executor answered, that he had always been ready to purchase land in the western country for the complainants. Held, 1. That as the trustee has improperly delayed the execution of the trust, until a great change has taken place in the situation of the western country and the circumstances of the parties, the beneficiaries ought not now to be compelled to take lands in the western country, but should be allowed to take their just proportion of the money arising from the sale of the <em>Frederick </em>lands; and that the principle of equality in the division of the said money is in this case just and proper. 2. That the female complainant\u2019s portion of the money arising from the sale of the lands should be so secured and protected, as to prevent its being subjected to the control or debts of the husband to a greater extent than if it were land, unless the wife should consent that the money be paid to the husband absolutely ; as to which she ought to be privily examined, separately and apart from her husband, in the same manner as in the conveyance of her real estate.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b84-3\">A decree being reversed in consequence of an error committed against one of the appellees,-costs decreed to be paid by the appellant to the appellees, as the parties substantially prevailing.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-4\"><em>Lewis </em>Ashby, of <em>Frederick </em>county, made his will on the 20th of March 1806, whereby he devised as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">\u201c First, The tract of land I now live on, on <em>Shenandoah </em>river, together with the tract whereon my mill is situated, I desire may be sold at such time and upon such terms, by my executors, as they in their judgment may think will be most to the advantage of my heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">\u201c Secondly, The money so arising from the sale of the above land, it is my will and desire may be applied to the purchasing other lands upon the most advantageous terms, either in the state of <em>Kentucky, </em>or some other part of the western country that my exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>cutors may think will be most to the general interest <em>r </em>, \u2022 ot my heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APP\">\u201c Thirdly, It is my will and desire that the lands so purchased shall be divided amongst my daughters and my two sons <em>Alfred </em>and <em>John, </em>in the following manner; that each of my daughters to have four hundred acres, and the residue to be equally divided among my two sons <em>Alfred </em>and <em>John; </em>all of which divisions shall bear an equal proportion to each other in respect to quality of land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">By the fourth clause the testator devised a tract of land in <em>Kentucky, </em>derived by him from his father, to his youngest sons <em>Buckner </em>and <em>Lewis. </em>Fifthly, he stated that he had already given his two daughters, <em>Lucy Lewis Catlett </em>and <em>Kitty Morehead, </em>as much of his personal property as was intended for them. He bequeathed, sixthly, a negro girl to his daughter <em>Judy; </em>and seventhly, a negro boy to his son <em>Buckner. </em>By the eighth clause he gave the remainder of his property to his children of the following names, viz. <em>Judy, Alfred, Mildred, Jenny, John, Buckner, Sidney </em>and <em>Lewis. </em>And lastly he appointed his wife <em>Ijeannah </em>executrix, and his son <em>Alfred D. </em>executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">On the 1st of September 1806, the will was admitted to record, and the widow in open court renounced the provision made for her. <em>Alfred D.

All the testator\u2019s children, being ten in number, are named in the will. His daughter <em>Mildred </em>married <em>Lewis A. Smith.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-9\">By a deed of the 5th of February 1813, <em>William Catlett </em>and <em>Lucy </em>his wife conveyed their rights under the said devises, to <em>'.Lewis A. Smith. </em>On the 18th of November 1815, <em>Joel Morehead </em>and <em>Kitty </em>his wife conveyed their rights under the said devises, to <em>Alfred D.

Ashhy, </em>in his own right, and as executor and trustee. There were other defendants, amongst whom were <em>John Ashhy </em>and <em>Sidney Ashhy, </em>the only persons, besides the plaintiffs and <em>Alfred D. Ashhy, </em>now interested under the devise of <em>the </em>lands in <em>Frederick </em>county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">The bill, besides seeking an account of <em>Alfred D. Ashby's </em>transactions as executor and trustee, asked that he might be compelled to execute the trust reposed in him, by selling the land in <em>Frederick </em>county and distributing the proceeds, or that the parties interested might elect to hold their proportions of the said land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">. A supplemental bill, filed in June 1827, set forth, that pending the suit, to wit, on the 5th of November 1817, the defendant <em>Alfred D. Ashby </em>had sold the lands devised by his father to be sold-; that they were sold to the defendant <em>John Ashby, </em>for 10244 dollars, two thirds payable in cash, and the balance in two annual payments <em>; </em>and that since the sale, <em>Afred D. Ashby </em>had taken no farther step towards the execution of the trust confided to him for the benefit of his sisters. The bill prayed that the plaintiffs might have a decree for their proportion of the rents and profits before the sale, and \u2022of the proceeds of said sale, with interest thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\"><em>Alfred D. Ashby </em>answered, that he had always been ready to purchase 400 acres of good land, such as his testator intended, in the western country for complainants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-9\">The death of <em>John Ashby </em>was suggested on the 3d of December 1828; and on the 5th of that month, by consent of <em>Buckner Ashby </em>executor and devisee of <em>John, </em>the suit was revived against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-10\">Numerous depositions were taken in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On the 6th of July 1S32, the circuit court pronounced the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-4\">\u201c The court is of opinion that the will of the testator ought now to be construed as if it read thus : \u2018 The proceeds of the <em>Frederick </em>lands to be invested in unseated lands in <em>Kentucky, </em>or some other part of the western country. The land to be selected with a view to the interest of <em>all </em>those of my children between whom it is divided. Of the lands so purchased, each of my daughters shall have 400 acres of an average quality, and my two sons <em>Alfred </em>and <em>John </em>the residue.\u2019 Before the testator could have determined on any particular number of acres for his daughters, he must have formed some estimate in his own mind of the relative value of the land to be sold and that to be purchased. What that estimate was, he has not informed us. As <em>Kentucky </em>lands seem to have been uppermost in his mind, it is probable that the price at that time of good unseated lands in that state wras in his view. What was the value which he placed upon his own lands might be ascertained with some probability by taking the opinions of his neighbours. Thus, if the trust had been executed immediately, or within a reasonable time, some approximation might have been made to such a division as the testator intended ; but it is obvious that it would have been but an approximation. The difficulty existing at the death of the testator,\u2014one which could not have been surmounted but by the exercise of a large discretion by the trustees, is now insurmountable. One of the trustees to whom this large discretion was confided (his widow, and the mother of the devisees) died about two years after him. He never could have intended to confide such a trust to his son alone, who was so deeply interested in abusing it. His scheme was to settle his children (most of whom were then young) in some of the new and growdng states; to provide for his daughters and two of his sons, by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>sale of bis <em>Virginia </em>lands, and the investment of the proceeds in western lands, which were to be divided by some rule of which he himself could have had but a faint idea, and which we can only guess at. It is evident, however, that he meant to provide for them all; that they all had <em>equal </em>claim upon his bounty: and we have no right to presume that he meant to make any <em>great </em>departure from equality, if he meant to depart from it at all. In this state of uncertainty,\u2014nay, when it is impossible to say in what proportion the testator intended that his children should share his bounty, the court must apply its own rule,\u2014equality. The son who was one of the trustees having sold the land, and the plaintiffs having elected to affirm the sale, the court will confirm it. The proceeds, principal and interest, must therefore be divided equally between the daughters, or those entitled to their shares by purchase, and the two sons <em>Alfred </em>and <em>John.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-4\">Whereupon the court proceeded to decree to the plaintiff <em>Lems A. Smith, </em>as well the share of his wife, as the share to which he was entitled by purchase from <em>Catlett </em>and wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">On the petition of <em>Alfred I). Ashby, </em>an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-6\">The cause was argued by <em>C. </em>and <em>G. N. Johnson </em>for the appellant, and by <em>Cooke </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b88-7\">Cabell, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AC8\">delivered the following as the resolution of the court.\u2014If <em>Alfred T). Ashby, </em>executor and trustee of and under the will of <em>Lewis Ashby </em>deceased, had, in a reasonable time after the death of the testator, sold the <em>Frederick </em>lands, and vested the proceeds thereof in good lands, situated in the state of <em>Kentucky, </em>or any other part of the western country most conducive to the general interest of the beneficiaries under the will, and had assigned to eac.h of the daughters 400 acres there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of, of the average value of the whole tract, this court is of opinion, considering the latitude of discretion confided to the trustee, that the daughters would have had no right to complain of such investment and assignment, although it might have resulted in leaving to the two sons of <em>Lewis Ashby </em>a greater quantity than 400 acres each. But as the trustee has improperly delayed the execution of the trust until a great change has taken place in the situation of the western country and in the circumstances of the parties, the court is of opinion that the beneficiaries ought not now to be compelled to take lands in the western country, but should be allowed to elect to take their just proportion of the money arising from the sale of the <em>Frederick </em>lands, in lieu thereof: and as there is nothing in the will which clearly indicates an intention in the testator to give a preference to his sons over his daughters in relation to this fund, or, if a preference was intended, to indicate the extent of that preference, the court is of opinion that the principle of equality of right is the only just one applicable to this case. This court therefore approves of the decree of the chancellor in establishing the right of the beneficiaries to elect to take money instead of land, and in directing an equal division of the fund among the parties. But the decree is defective in not having so secured and protected mrs. <em>Smith's </em>portion of the money arising from the sale of the <em>Frederick </em>lands, as to prevent its being subjected to the control or debts of the husband to a greater extent than if it were land; in which case, the husband would be only entitled to the profits during the coverture, or for his own life as tenant by the curtesy, in case he survived the wife, having had a child by her, born alive; for this money, being in lieu of land to which the wife was entitled, ought to be regarded as land, and treated accordingly, unless indeed the wife should consent that the money should be paid to the husband absolutely, as to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>she ought to be privily examined, separately and apart from her husband, in the same manner as in the conveyance of her real estate.</p>\n<p id=\"AH-\">The decree is therefore reversed so far as it is in opposition to the principles declared above, and is affirmed as to the residue : and the cause is remanded, to be proceeded in to a final decree accordingly. But as this reversal is in consequence of error committed against one of the appellees, it is to be at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n<author id=\"b90-4\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ADT\">said, that as the decree of the circuit court required the appellant to make payment to the plaintiff <em>Lewis A. Smith, </em>of money which it was erroneous to require him so to pay, and which he could not, even with the authority of that decree, safely have paid; and as this court, by its decree, corrected the error of the circuit court, and provided for the appellant\u2019s paying in a way which would be safe, it seemed to him that the appellant ought not to be decreed to pay costs : and he therefore dissented from so much of the decree of this court as related to the costs. In all other respects, he concurred in that decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
