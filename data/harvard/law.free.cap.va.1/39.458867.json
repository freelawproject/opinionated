January*</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b51-6\">Where a juror, after he is sworn in an action of slander, expresses a wish to withdraw, because he himself had a similar suit depending in the same court, in which the slander was the same 5 but the counsel not consenting to withdraw him, the trial proceeds and a verdict is rendered; the court ought not to grant a new trial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-7\">This was an appeal from the superior court of law for Shenandoah county. Bell brought an action of slander in that court, against Shobe. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and assessed his damages at 8 450. After the verdict, the counsel for the defendant moved the court for a new trial on four grounds : 1. Because the verdict was contrary to evidence. 2. Because the damages were excessive. 3. Because Watson was an improper juror. 4. Because the jury divided by 12, and three of them yielded their verdict from an improper influence. The court rejected the motion and entered judgment for the plaintiff. A bill of exceptions was filed setting forth the fads at large on which the motion was founded, and an appeal taken to this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-9\">As the two first grounds for a new trial above stated depend entirely upen evidence, it is unnecessary to state tlin facts in this place. The only questions of law are presented by the two last exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-10\">In relation to the admission of Watson the juror, it is staled in the bill of exceptions, that \u201c after the jury were \u201c sworn, one of the jurors named Watson, when lie heard \u201c the charge of slander read, observed that he was placed <em>\u201c </em>in a delicate situation, because he had a suit of slander \u201c depending in this superior court wherein he was plaintiff, \u201c and the charge of slander was the same ,* but the <em>plaintiff\u2019s (i </em>counsel not consenting to withdraw him, the trial went \u00ab on.\u201d On the last objection it is stated that, \u201c it appeared <em>\u201c </em>by the affidavits of four of the jury that it was proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>\u201c </em>in the jury room that each man should put down a sum, \u201cadd up the whole and divide by 12. They did so, and. \u201c the sum came out \u00a7487. This sum they did not agree to, <em>\u201c </em>and the plan of dividing by 12 was abandoned. Nine \u201c of the jury, after some consultation, agreed on \u00a7450 <em>; </em>\u201cthe other three thought the sum too high, and one of- \u201c them said, if it had been left to him alone, he would only \u201c have given, from \u00a730 to \u00a750 j but finding a large majo- \u201c rity against them, and despairing of getting the verdict <em>\u201c </em>lower, or as they wished, and that they would be des&lt; tained on the jury until all agreed, yielded to the opin- \u201c ion of the majority, and assented to bring the verdict for \u201c \u00a7 450.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-4\"><em>Tucker, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-5\"><em>Gilmer, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-6\">The counsel for the appellant relied on two points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AS\">1. That Watson was an improper juror. 2. That the verdict rendered was not the verdict of the whol\u00e9 jury, but of a part only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-7\">As to the first point. If the objection to Watson had been known before he was sworn, he would have been set aside; for, though a juror is not related to either party nor has shewn any marks of partiality, yet if there be sufficient reason to suspect that he <em>may </em>be more favourable to one side than the other, he ought not to be impannelled. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That Watson\u2019s situation rendered him an improper juror, is manifest. Where from <em>any </em>cause, a juror leans in favor of one party on <em>any </em>point in the case, he is an unfit juror. Now, in a case for words, one of the most material points is the <em>quantum </em>of damages $ and Watson would naturally incline to extend to the utmost limit the damages of the plaintiff Bell. He himself felt the influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>eace of these considerations, and even obiected to himself. The Plaintiff\u2019s counsel refused to permit him to be withdrawn; a strong evidence of his conviction of the opera-lion of these motives on Watson\u2019s mind. To test the principle, let us suppose <em>the whole twelve </em>had been in Watson\u2019s situation. Could it have been reasonably expected that Shobe would have had justice ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-5\">In actions of this sort, a scrupulous attention to the impartiality of the jury is peculiarly necessary. The jury are the proper judges of the damages, and the court will rarely interfci e for excess of damages. It is therefore all important, that the jury which is invested with such high power should be above all suspicion of partiality or excitement. In causes of another description, some standard or measure is furnished by which to judge whether they are right or wrong. Mere there is no standard. New trials ought in such cases to be more freely indulged, because they can do the plaintiff no harm and may contribute to justice. In 1 Strange, 672, the court assigned as their only reason for granting a new trial that \u201c it was \u201cfit the defendant should try another jury, before he \u201c should be finally charged with such heavy damages.\u201d The evidence did not maintain the charge, and the damages were disproportionate to the offence. But the jury, not being \u201c above all suspicion,\u201d inclined to tire worst interpretation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-8\">2. The verdict is not the verdict of the whole jury, but of* part only. This is in fact clearly proved by the testimony of four of the jury. They first formed an aggregate of the different sums and then divided by 12. This gave 8487. They then fixed on 8450, either for round numbers or to veil the transaction. This is a mockery &lt;/ justice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-9\">But the verdict was rendered by three of the jurors, under an impression that they must yield to the majority, one of them having been only for 830 or 8 50, and yet rendering the verdict for 8450. Here was no assent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>the mind.. </em>The cases in 1 Term Rep. 11, and 1 Wash. ' * <em>76* </em>be cited. But the iattercase is in our favor; for, there a new trial was granted, even in chancery. Here there is no tampering will) the jury. The information was received when the jury returned with the verdict. In <em>Cochran </em>vs. <em>Street, </em>there had been time for tampering. So where a.motion for a new trial is made in England in Westminster Hall, time for tampering is afforded between the trial and the term which follows it. Here there was none, and no reasonable objection can be offered to the juror\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ax\"><em>For- the appellee </em>it was said, that it was no disqualification of Watson that he liad an action of slander pending, unless it had been with one of the parties in this suit. The doctrine as laid down in Co. <em>Litt.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is, that if a juror has a part of <em>the </em>land depending on the same <em>title </em>with the land in controversy, it will be a good cause of challenge ; but surely not that he has an action in ejectment with other parties. It is also said in Co. Litt.<footnotemark>(<em>c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that no challenge can be received after a juror is sworn, except for matter <em>arising </em>after he is sworn ,* not for matter, only <em>discovered </em>afterwards. The candid manner in which he disclosed his situation, proves him to have been upright and conscientious.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-8\">As to the objection that the jury divided hy 12, it is expressly disproved that they did so divide. Besides, in actions like the present, where no certain standard exists for fixing the damages, it would be difficult for juries ever to agree, unless they adopted some such principle of accommodation. As to the danger which seems to be approhended as resulting from this mode of decision, it ought not to be anticipated that men of good character, and without interest, would resort to such unworthy arts to carry a point of mere opinion, by which they are not to derive any benefit. But, as they rejected this mode of de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>eision, and finally agreed on a less sum, it is plain that 7 1/0 * they consulted their ideas of propriety, and rendered a verdict as nearly satisfactory to all, as can ever be attained in a case of this sort. With regard to the motive which, it is said, influenced three of the jurors, i would be highly dangerous to enter into such a nice scrutiny of the <em>motives </em>of jurors, when they do not amount to gross mistakes of law, or breach of duty. It is highly improper to meddle with verdicts ori such grounds, and Lord Mansfield refused to hear evidence of it in <em>Vaise </em>vs. <em>Delaval </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The case of <em>Cochran </em>vs. Street, was an actual mistake of four jurors, who thought the opinion of the majority absolutely imperative on them. In Price\u2019s ex. vs. <em>Warren</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>a new trial was refused on the affidavit of two jurors that the verdict was rendered on the statement of one of the jury, not upon oath, because it was deemed dangerous to meddle with verdicts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-5\">Tucker, replied.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b52-13\"> 3 Bac.
