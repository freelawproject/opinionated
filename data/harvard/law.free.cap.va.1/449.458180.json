The action was brought on an arbitration bond, executed by the said Beale and Brockenbrough to the said Richards. The condition of this bond recites, that a certain difference having taken place between l\u00edenle and Richards, the parties agree to abide by tlie determination and award of George I*hill Young, and John Gresham, so that it be made under their band <em>hy the first day of January, </em>1810 <em>; </em>but if the said arbitrators do not agree, then they shall clioose a third person, whose decision shall be binding on the parties. The condition concludes <em>$ \u201c </em>now if the above bound <em>44 </em>John H. Beale and Newman Brockenbrough, do and <em>44 </em>shall well and truly stand to the award, final end and <em>41 </em>determination, <em>of George Phill Young and </em>John Gre- '\u25a0\u00ab sham, or, if they do not agree in opinion, then, in that 44 case, the decision of the person that they may name or \u201c elect, then the above obligation to be void, or else to <em>re- </em>\u00ab main in full force and virtue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AR0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>The arbitrators not agreeing in opinion, made choice of Thomas Evans as <em>umpire; </em>who, <em>on the 30th day of </em>December, 1809, made and published his umpirage. This decision requires John H.

The case of <em>Taylor </em>vs. <em>Nicolson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>proves, that the critical nicety of the old books, does not prevail in modern times. An umpire may make his umpirage within the time limited for making the <em>award.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It may be said, that the award was against <em>Brockenbrough, </em>as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Beale, and that Brockenbrongh was not a party to the award. The answer to this is, that the condition of the bond requires Brockenbrougb and Beale to perform the award, and therefore, the award is in strict conformity to the submission. But, even if this part of the award is erroneous, it must, be considered as mere surplusage, and may be rejected without affecting the rest of the award.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-4\">On the other side it was said, that the authorities were contradictory on this subject. Bacon\u2019s <em>Abridgment,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which contains the original authority from which the doctrines of the other books are drawn, affirms the principle, that <em>the </em>arbitrators cannot even <em>choose an 'umpire </em>within the time limited for rendering the <em>award; </em>while in 2nd Term Reports,<footnotemark>(<em>d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is said, that the umpire may be chosen before entering into an examination of the matters referred to them. Thus the arbitrators may choose the umpire <em>before </em>they make the award, and yet their power ceases from the time of choosing the umpire. The true principle is, that the umpire has no power to act until <em>after </em>the time limited for making the award. This doctrine is confirmed by the case of <em>Beck </em>vs. <em>Serjeant.</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-5\">The award is also erroneous in making Brockenbrougb jointly liable to pay <em>Beale\u2019s </em>debt. It is no sufficient answer to say, that this is mere surplusage ; because an action will lie as well on the <em>award </em>as on the <em>bond,</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in that case, would make Brockenbrough <em>primarily </em>responsible for a debt, for which lie was only a <em>surety.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-6\">The award is unjust and absurd as to the crop. By the award, Richards gets more than his moiety, and may even get the whole, if Beale\u2019s moiety should not amount <em>to more than </em>the quantity which Richards is directed to retain.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b462-11\"><em>\u0430) 1 H. &amp; M. </em>67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\"><em> </em>Kyd on Awards, 56.

Beale and the said Newman Brockenbrough, for the performance of an award or umpirage to be made of matters in difference between Beale and Richards.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\">The condition of the bond required the arbitrators to make their award by the 1st day of January, 1810 <em>; </em>but, if they could not agree, they were then to choose a third person, whose decision was to be binding on the parties. No time is limited, within which the umpire was to make his umpirage. The condition of the bond concludes with declaring, that the bond is to be void, \u201c if the above bound John H. Beale and Newman Brockenbrough\u201d shall well and truly stand to the award of the arbitrators, or the umpirage of the umpire.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The arbitrators, not agreeing, chose, on the 29th December, 1809, Thomas Evans as umpire, who, on the 30th day of the same month, rendered an award under his hand and seal. The award, after reciting the arbitration bond, the disagreement of the arbitrators, and their appointment of the umpire, directs, that John H. Beale and Newman Brockenbrough shall pay to John Richards, 146l. 3s. 2d., with interest thereon from the 13th day of Nov. 1807. It farther declares, that Richards is entitled to one half of the crop of corn and shucks made upon the said Beale\u2019s land, cultivated by <em>them; </em>and that Beale is entitled to the other half of the crop of corn and shucks ; but, <em>that Richards shall retain to himself, out of the said Beale\u2019s half of the crop of corn, fifty </em>barrels, one bushel and one peck, for and on account of corn sold and made use of by the said Beale, which was of the said crop, as well as for and on account of certain articles furnished the said Beale for the use of bis family. Newman Brockenbrough having died, the suit was revived against his administrator, Austin Brockenbrough, the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The declaration recites the condition of the arbitration <em>bond; </em>states the disagreement of the <em>arbitrators; </em>their failure to make any award before the first day of January, <em>1810; </em>their appointment of the umpire, and the substance of the award as above set forth ; and then assigns as the breach of the condition of the bond, the non-payment of the above sum of 146l <em>3s. 2d., </em>with interest as aforesaid. To this declaration the defendant pleaded \u201c <em>nit debet,\u201d </em>with liberty to give in evidence any special matter, which, if pleaded specially, would bar the plaintiff\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The jury, reciting the award <em>in hoec verba, </em>find for the plaintiff the debt in the declaration mentioned, to be discharged by the payment of 146l <em>3s. 2d., </em>with interest from 13th November, 1807, if, in the opinion of the court, the award be good in <em>law; </em>otherwise, they find for the defendant. The court decided, that the law was for the defendant, and gave judgment <em>accordingly; </em>from which judgment, an appeal was taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The objection to this award, mainly relied on by the counsel for the appellee, is, that it was made by the umpire before the expiration of the time within which the arbitrators themselves might, according to the terms of the original submission, have made an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">We find in the books a vast variety of questions, and much contrariety of opinion, concerning the appointment and duty of umpires. Distinctions are taken between those cases where the umpire is named by the parties, in the submission, and those cases where the appointment is referred to the discretion of the <em>arbitrators; </em>and also, between those cases in which the umpire is directed to make his umpirage within the same period which is limited for the award of <em>the </em>arbitrators, and those in which a farther time is allowed to tiie umpire.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The case, now before us, arises on a submission, by which the appointment of the umpire was referred to the arbitrators, and by which the time limited for the umpirage of the umpire extends beyond that limited for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>award of the arbitrators ; and to prevent a confusion of ideas, it may be well to premise that the remarks we may hereafter make, although they may be applicable to other cases also, are to be considered as referring only to cases S,'0W\u2018nS\u2019 out of such a submission, unless it may be otherwise declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">It was formerly held, that if arbitrators chose an umpire before the time allowed for their award was expired, such nomination was <em>ipso facto </em>void. So long as this opinion prevailed, it was impossible that any question could be made as to the power of the <em>umpire; </em>for, there could be no umpirage without an umpire. The desire, however, to favour these domestic tribunals, at length induced the courts to support such a nomination, for the purpose of establishing an umpirage made <em>after </em>the time when the arbitrators were to have made their <em>award.</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This case has been followed by a great many others, confirming the awards of umpires who were <em>appointed </em>before, but did not <em>act </em>till <em>after </em>the time when the arbitrators might have made their award. And such has long been the settled law. In many of the cases alluded to, <em>the </em>judges <em>said, </em>that the umpire could not interfere <em>if ore </em>the time allowed the arbitrators had <em>expired.</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But, we have not seen any case, in which the point has been directly brought in issue before the English courts. In the absence of decided cases, we must be governed by principles. It becomes, therefore, important, to ascertain the grounds on which the courts have supported umpirages, made after the time allowed to the arbitrators; and, if these grounds are applicable to umpirages made before they also ought to be supported. These grounds have not always been the same. The ground assigned in <em>Watson </em>vs. <em>Clement, </em>Rol. p. <em>5, and in Mitchel </em>vs. <em>Harris, </em>above referred to, and also, in the case of <em>Daws </em>vs. <em>Moncey, </em>8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Geo. II,<footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is, that by the nomination of an umpire, the authority of the arbitrators is at an end. And Sergeant Williams, the learned and accurate annotator of Saunders\u2019s Reports, is of the opinion, <footnotemark><em>(j)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that that is now the settled law. If this be the true ground of decision, there is certainly as much reason for supporting an umpirage made <em>before, </em>as for supporting one made <em>after </em>the time limited, by the submission, for the arbitrators to make their award. In both cases the power of the arbitrators is at an end. In the last case it expired by efflux of time $ in the first, by the act of the arbitrators themselves. But, in some of the cases, the reason assigned for supporting such an umpirage is, that although the arbitrators might, notwithstanding their nomination of the umpire, have proceeded themselves to make an <em>award; </em>yet, as in fact they made no award within the time, the umpirage shall be <em>good.</em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This reason, also, applies with equal force to umpirages before and after the time allowed to the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We find, also, that where the time within which the umpirage is to he made, is the same with that limited to the arbitrators, if the umpire is appointed by the arbitrators, and makes his umpirage before the expiration of the time, such an umpirage will be <em>supported.</em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We see no reason for supporting an umpirage in such a case that does not apply to that now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Where there is the same reason, there is the same law.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We are, therefore, of opinion, that tiie first objection made to the award, is not entitled to any weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Nor are we inclined to allow any force to the objection, that <em>Brockenbrough </em>was directed to pay the money awarded, jointly with <em>Beale. </em>The award itself shews, that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>other matters were considered, but those between Richards and Beale. That direction was evidently, therefore, made in adherence to the informality of expression in the condition of the bond, which requires <em>\u201c </em>the said John H. Beale and the said Newman Brockenbrough\u201d <em>to stand to </em>the award. It can only be regarded as surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\">Nor is there any thing in the objection to that part of the award which states, that Richards shall retain to himself a portion of Beale\u2019s share of the corn. Every thing is to be presumed in favour of an award. We are not told how much of the corn had been used by Beale, nor how many articles had been furnished for the use of his family, by Richards. There is nothing to shew, that Richards was directed to retain more of Beale\u2019s share of the corn than he ought to have retained.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">Perceiving no ground to impeach this award, we are of opinion, that the judgment is erroneous. It must, therefore, be reversed, and judgment entered for the appellant, pursuant to the verdict.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(g)\">\n<p id=\"b466-5\"><em> </em>Watson <em>vs. </em>Clement, Rol. p. 5.
