The bills were negotiated by T, who intermarried with the annuitant, upon which an action was brought and judgment obtained against the executors of B, upon which an execution was issued, and returned <em>nulla bona. </em>T, by his will, devised to the plaintiff all the debts due to him from the estate of B. To recover the amount of the aforesaid bond, bills, and residue of annuity, a bill in Equity was filed against the issue in tail, under the will of A. Decided, that whether the annuity was extinguished or not at Law, by the bond and bills it was so in Equity, and that the plaintiff had mistaken his right as well as his remedy.</headnotes>\n<summary id=\"b198-8\">This was a suit in Equity, instituted originally by the appellants against the appellee in the County Court of <em>Spottsylvania. </em>The material facts in the case are as follow, viz:</summary>\n<summary id=\"b198-9\"><em>A. Spotswood, </em>the grandfather of the appellee, on liis marriage settled an annuity of 500/. on his wife, payable quarterly, and charged his <em>Mine </em>tract of land therewith, with power of distress, and <em>nomine pcence. </em>By his will, he devised all his estate to his son <em>John, </em>the father of the appellee, in tail. After the death of the grandfather, <em>John </em>entered upon the estate devised <em>to </em>him <em>; </em>and his mother, by deed, released to him onp half of her annuity, and then intermarried with Mr, <em>Thompson, </em>the father of Mrs. <em>Gray, </em>and the testator of the other appellant. <em>John Spotszvood, </em>previous to his death, gave to Mr. <em>Thompson </em>two bonds, and drew two several bills of exchange in his favour, for the amount of the arrears of the annuity then due, and shortly after died. The bills were negotiated by Thompson, and finally came by assignment into the hands of a Mr. Walker, who commenced suits thereon against the executors of <em>John Spotswood, </em>and having obtained judgments, took out executions, which were returned \u201c <em>nulla </em>bona.\u201d\u2014It does not appear in whose possession those bills are ;\u2014the plaintiffs have them not. Mr. Thompson, having by his will de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>vised to the appellant, Mrs. Gray, <em>all the debts due </em>to him from the <em>estate of John Spotsxvood, </em>also departed this life. The appellee is the eldest son and issue in tail of <em>John Spoisxoood.</em></summary>\n\n<summary id=\"b199-4\"><em>John Spotsxvood, </em>the father, by his will, devised all his estate (not intailed) to his son <em>John.</em></summary>\n\n<attorneys id=\"b199-6\"><em>Warden </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b200-9\"><em>Washington </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The Court ivas unanimously of opinion, that the appellant\u2019s remedy, if any he had, was at Law. That whether th e annuity was extinguished or not, at Law, it was so in Equity, under all the circumstances of this ease, and that, of course, the appellants had mistaken their right as well as their remedy.</p>\n\n<opinion><p id=\"b199-3\">The County Court decreed to the appellants <em>Gray </em>and wife, the full amount of the bills of exchange, with ten per cent, damages ; also the amount of the two bonds, and nearly one years annuity, which became due after the bills and notes were given, (deducting therefrom a sum due from <em>Thompson, </em>for land of the appellees sold to him by <em>John </em>Spotsxvood, the father,) with interest thereon : and the <em>Mine </em>tract was decreed to be sold to satisfy this decree, unless discharged by the appellee within a limited time.</p><p id=\"b199-5\">The decree of the County Court was upon appeal to the High Court of Chancery reversed, from which the present appellants appealed to the Court of Ap.peals ; and a majority of that Court not choosing to sit in the cause, a special Court was summoned.</p><p id=\"AxQ0\">There are two questions to be considered.\u20141st. Whether the <em>Mine </em>tract is liable to satisfy the appellant\u2019s demand.\u2014And 2dly. Whether a Court of Chancery has jurisdiction of the case.</p><p id=\"b199-7\">The first point is dependent upon another, to wit,, whether the annuity be extinguished or not by the bills and bonds ? I am to contend that they are not The annuity, being of as high dignity as a bond, and higher than a bill of exchange, cannot be extinguished by them at Law, nor in Equity: they are only additional securities. If the annuity exist at Law, surely a Court of Equity will not assist to take away the security, so long as the debt continues unpaid.</p><p id=\"b199-8\">Upon the second point; it is the peculiar province of a Court of Equity to assist in cases where there is not a complete remedy at Law. This is to be presumed in the present case, as the' defendant, in his answer, hath not set forth that there was property ora <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the premises subject to distress, sufficient to satisfy the annuity.</p><p id=\"AvV\">A Court of Equity has not jurisdiction in this case, whether the annuity be extinguished or not. If the latter, then the executor by the <em>32 Hen. </em>8, might have distrained on the land, in the possession of any person, claiming by, or from the grand-father; or, he might have maintained an action of debt at common law against the executors of <em>John Spotswood </em>for the rent accruing in his life-time. <em>Co. Litt. </em>162 <em>b. </em>5 <em>Rep. </em>118. <em>Ognel\u2019s </em>Case, <em>4 Rep. </em>48. <em>Fairfax </em>v. <em>Lord </em>Derby, <em>2 Vern. </em>612, .which last case is in point as to jurisdiction. A Court of Equity will never interfere in cases of this sort, unless the remedy be lost at Law by fraud in the tenant, as by depasturing the land, &amp;c. 1 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. 32.</em></p><p id=\"b200-10\">If the annuity be extinguished, then it is too clear to be argued, that the remedy was only at Law against the executors of <em>John Spotswood. </em>But if the appellants do come into a Court of Equity, then I contend, that though the annuity might not be extinguished at Law, yet it will be considered as being so in thatCourt, and of course, the remedy could only be against the executors, and not against the <em>issue in tail. </em>After so long an acquiescence on the part of Thompson, his absolutely negociating the bills, and of course receiving the amount of them long ago, this Court will presume an agreement between the parties, that the bonds and bills should be accepted as a discharge of the annuity, and as an exchange of the security. In any point of view, then, the decree of the County Court against the issue in tail was erroneous.</p><p id=\"b200-11\">But this is not the only error. The decree is for the amount of the bills of exchange, in favour of the legatee, although neither the legatee, nor the executors of Thompson, are in possession of the bills, nor entitled to the benefit of the judgments recovered upon them, by assignment from Walker, or otherwise; and although <em>Thompson </em>has once received the value of them from the person to whom he endorsed them, (as is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>be presumed,) and neither he nor his executors have been called upon by <em>Walker </em>to pay them, and probably never mair be called upon.</p><p id=\"b201-4\">The most which the appellants could ask for, would be security to indemnify them in case the amount of those bills should be hereafter recovered of them, and even this could not with propriety be required of the <em>heir.</em></p><p id=\"b201-5\">But if the appellee be liable to pay the amount of these bills, Mrs. <em>Gray </em>has no right to it, since this is <em>not a debt due to Thompson from Spotswood^s estate3 </em>and therefore is not included in the devise of Mrs. <em>Gray.</em></p><p id=\"b201-7\">The decree of the High Court of Chancery wa\u00ab affirmed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
