Poythress.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b167-7\">If a debtor in execution obtain an injunction, the Sheriff is bound to discharge him from custody. <em>Quaere, </em>if an injunction be obtained after seisure of property, under a <em>fieri facias, </em>the officer may restore the property.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-9\">This was an action of debt brought by the appelpellant in the District Court of <em>Petersburg, </em>upon a prison- hounds-bond- the breach assigned in the de~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>claration, is nearly in the words of the condition of the bond, with an averment, that the prisoner did depart and escape from the bounds, without being discharged by due course of law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-3\">Pleas, 1st. Conditions performed. 2. That the bond was given to the Sheriff for and concerning a matter relating to his office, whilst the defendant was in pustody of the said Sheriff, contrary to the act entitled \u201c an act prescribing the method of appointing Sheriffs, and for limiting the time of their continuance in office; and directing their duty therein.\u201d'\u2014Issue was taken upon the first plea, and liberty reserved to the plaintiff to file his demurrer to the second plea, at the next Court, if he please.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-4\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff: but if, in the opinion of the Court, a <em>subpoena of injunction </em>issued from the High Court of Chancery, and delivered to the Sheriff having the prisoner in custody, and served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, whereby the judgment, on which an execution had issued, under which the defendant was confined, was injoined, was a sufficient authority to the Sheriff to discharge him from custody under that execution, then they found for the defendant. No notice was taken of the second plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">Judgment for the defendant upon the special verdict in the District Court, and appeal to this.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-6\"><em>Monoid, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-7\">Until a final decree was rendered for the plaintiff in equity, the injunction granted by the Chancellor could not operate so as to deprive the plaintiff at law of a right already vested in him. The lands of a defendant are actually bound from the time a judgment is rendered against him ; as are also his chattels from the time a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>is <em>delivered </em>to the Sheriff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-8\">It would be highly unreasonable to give to an injunction an effect so extensive as that which must be contended for. The principal, as well as his sureties, might remove, or become insolvent, pending the injunction. The estate seised by the Sheriff on a writ <em>of fieri facias, </em>might, during that time, perish, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ilius might the plaintiff at law lose entirely the effect of his judgment. Injunctions are not authorised, or in any manner regulated by the laws of this country, and, therefore, we must resort to the rule observed in the Courts of <em>England. </em>There, the money is always brought into Court by the party obtaining the injunction, unless, in special cases, it is dispensed with. 2 <em>Harr. Ch. Prac. </em>224. 226. So if goods are taken on execution, or money levied, or paid in execution, and in the Sheriff\u2019s hands, the process of injunction will <em>stay them there. 2 Harr. Ch. Prac. </em>225. Upon the same principle it is that .a bill of review does not prevent the execution of the decree impeached; but obedience is actually to be paid to the decree, as far as it can, without prejudice to the right of the party preferring the bill. 1 Harr. Ch. <em>Prac. </em>171. Neither does a <em>supersedeas </em>set aside the execution or stop the sale of the property seised under it. <em>Dalt. Sheriff, </em>225. 534. A <em>capias, </em>not executed, is arrested by a <em>supersedeas ; </em>but if executed, the body must be returned with the <em>supersedeas. </em>Neither will an action for false imprisonment lie, if the body be taken on a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>without notice of the writ of error. If, then, we are to take as our guide the rules and principles of the <em>English </em>law, (and we have none other to follow,) we find, that an execution once served, is not interrupted by an injunction, or other proceedings subsequent to the judgment, until the debt is levied or received by the officer, and is then only stopped in his hands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-7\">The old Chancery law, passed in the year 1777, <em>Ch. </em>15, sec. 31, seems to give to injunctions merely the power of <em>staying </em>executions. It neither authorises the discharge of the person or property already taken in execution, nor does such an effect follow as a necessary or reasonable consequence from the order.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-8\">If the whole effect of the execution be done away by the granting of the injunction, I am at a loss to know what return the Sheriff can make upon the execution, or in what manner the plaintiff is to proceed tspon the dissolution of the injunction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-8\">The cases read by Mr. <em>Ronald, </em>only prove that there are certain rules observed by the Chancellor in <em>England, </em>which neither are, nor ought to be, guides for us; and this necessary departure from those rules results from the very nature of our situation, compared with that country. In that, much of the wealth of the nation consists in money; it is easily procured by those who can secure the re-payment of it; therefore, no inconvenience can follow from requiring a deposit of the debt recovered at law, as the condition of granting an injunction. So, too, nothing can stop the progress of an execution once served. Yet even there, we find that, in some instances, this rigid rule is dispensed with, as the cases referred to by Mr. <em>Ronold </em>prove. In this country, the wealth of the people consists principally in real property\u2014there is so much of that, and so little money at market, that the latter cannot be procured on loan, with any security. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-9\">The difference will furnish a strong argument why the rule in <em>England, </em>even in cases of executions against the property, should not prevail here; and the argument is fortified considerably, if we view the case by analogy to forthcoming and replevy bonds, which are unknown in that country, yet, induced by necessity, are authorised in this. In these cases, the lien is entirely gone, and a compensation for it is provided in the security given by the debtor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-10\">So, too, in <em>England, </em>if goods be taken by way of distress, and replevied, the distrainor loses his lien on the goods, and is left to his remedy on the replevy bond. <em>Bro. C. C. </em>427; so that the loss of the lien upon property once seised, is not unknown even in <em>England, </em>much less in this country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-11\">But the case of an execution against the body, is much stronger than if it were against the property. For if the body might still be kept in confinement, the injunction would be an idle and vain thing; since the plaintiff, if entitled to equity, might receive the same benefit from an original bill, as he could by obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u25a0\u00bfhe injunction. The plaintiff at law cannot complain with reason, since his security is certain!' bettered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-4\"><em>Mr, Monoid, in </em>reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab2\">The act of 1791 <em>Ch, 3, </em>\u00a7&gt; 3, though it was made subsequent to this transaction, shews, from the manner in which it is expressed, the sense of the Legislature upon this subject, by directing that the Sheriff\", having received money under an execution, shall, upon an injunction being granted, <em>repay </em>the money to the plaintiff in equity. But this was unnecessary, if, before the law was made, an injunction produced the extensive effect now contended for.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b171-6\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"Ake\">We shall give no positive opinion as to the effect of an injunction obtained upon an execution against the <em>goods and </em>chattels\u201e after seisure, as that case is not before us : probably it would be considered as settled by the act of 1791, which directing a restitution of the money levied, would seem to include inferior cases, and to extend, by an equitable construction, to the restitution of goods seised in execution, and not sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The reason is much stronger in the case of an execution against the body, where the injunction would 'have no effect at all, if it did not operate to discharge the body from confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
