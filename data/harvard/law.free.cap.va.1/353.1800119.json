And <em>Lewis, </em>having indorsed on the warrant an assignment thereof from <em>Billips </em>to himself, on the 1st October 1794, made an entry thereon in his own name as assignee, for 1437 acres of land in <em>Kanawha </em>county, which was surveyed on the 1st October 1798, and on this survey a grant of the land was issued to <em>Lewis, </em>on the 26th January 1801. But <em>Le\u00edais </em>acted throughout for the benefit of <em>Billips, </em>the owner of the warrant, and always declared, (hat the land was his property. Accordingly, <em>Billips </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>those claiming under him had held the possession of a part of the tract. The whole of the land, however, was now claimed by the defendants, under grants thereof, issued to <em>William Morris, Harman, Teas </em>and <em>Neely ; </em>and these patents were older than that granted to <em>Lewis; </em>and the surveys and entries on which they were founded were also older than the survey and entry on which the patent to <em>Lewis </em>was founded; yet the right of <em>JBillips </em>under Lewis, was preferable in equity to the right of the defendants claiming under <em>Morris, Harman, Teas </em>and <em>Neely, </em>because <em>their entries </em>were not special and certain, because their <em>entries </em>in truth did not at all interfere with <em>Lewis\u2019s entry, </em>and because their <em>surveys, </em>which did interfere with <em>Lewis\u2019s survey, </em>were not conformable with their <em>entries. </em>The bill, therefore, prayed that <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>devisees might be decreed to convey his right in the land to <em>Billips; </em>that he and the other plaintiffs holding under him, might be quieted in the enjoyment thereof, against the other defendants claiming under the patents of <em>Morris, Harman, Teas </em>and <em>Neely, </em>and that these defendants might be decreed to convey the legal estate derived to them from the elder patents, to <em>Billips; </em>and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-4\">One of the devisees of <em>Lewis </em>answered the bill, and contested the equitable right asserted by the plaintiffs as well as the rights of the defendants claiming under the conflicting patents, and claimed the land for himself and his co-devisees. -As against the other devisees, the bill was taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b366-5\">Several of the defendants claiming under the elder patents, filed their answers, wherein they stated, that <em>Morris and Harman, </em>on the 15th April 1786, duly <em>entered </em>2000 acres of land in <em>Teas\u2019s Valley </em>in <em>Kanawha; </em>and, at the same time, <em>Moms, Harman, Teas </em>and <em>Neely </em>duly <em>entered </em>4000 acres adjoining the other entry; but owing to the hostility of the indians, and the unsettled state of the country, these entries were not surveyed till February 1795, when the surveys were made apd sent to the land office: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>and grants were issued upon them, the 28th November and 2d December 1799. They insisted, that <em>their entries </em>were special and certain, the <em>surveys </em>conformable with the <em>entries, </em>and the patents regular : and that, on the other hand, <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>entry was not special and certain, and his survey was not conformable with his entry. Therefore, they had not only the elder grants and the legal title, but a preferable right in equity to the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-4\">The plaintiffs afterwards exhibited a supplemental bill (suggested, no doubt, by the decision of this court in <em>Noland v.

The beginning point of the <em>survey, </em>which was made on this entry the 1st October <em>1798, </em>and on which the grant to <em>Lewis </em>was founded, was at <em>two white-oaks, </em>on the <em>west </em>side of the <em>creek, </em>65 poles from the stream, and <em>a mile and eighty-four poles </em>from the tree D B. and the rock on the <em>east </em>side, called for in the entry.

If the phrase in the entry, \u201c to extend down for quantity,\u201d was to be interpreted <em>down Poplar Fork, </em>the survey, so far from conforming to the entry, departed from it at the very beginning and throughout. If that phrase was to be interpreted <em>down the general course of the country, </em>the survey conformed to the entry. To ascertain the sense and acceptation of this phrase, as used and understood in locations, a great many depositions were taken on both sides; and there was some contrariety in the evidence; but the evidence, that the phrase required the locators to extend their survey down the <em>Poplar Fork </em>for quantity, preponderated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-8\">The <em>surveys, </em>made the 20th and 21st February 1795, on the <em>second entry </em>(that, namely, of <em>Morris, Harman, Teas </em>and Neely) were not made so as to include the vacant land <em>on both sides </em>of <em>Morris and Harman\u2019s entry, </em>according to the call of this second entry, or indeed the land <em>on both sides </em>of <em>Morris and Harman\u2019s survey. </em>The surveys on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number><em>second entry </em>joined <em>Morris and Harman\u2019s survey, </em>on three short lines at the extreme southern point thereof, and extended southwardly from thence so as to include almost the whole of the land included in <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>survey. If <em>Morris and Harman\u2019s survey </em>did not conform with <em>their entry, </em>the <em>surveys </em>made on the <em>entry </em>of <em>Morris, Harman, Teas </em>and <em>Neely, </em>were not in any way conformable with the <em>entry.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArB\">The record of the <em>caveat </em>in the county court of <em>Kanawha, </em>prosecuted by <em>Morris and Harman\u2019s heir </em>against <em>Lewis, </em>was exhibited with the supplemental bill. The <em>caveat </em>was filed in February 1799, to prevent the grant of the 1437 acres of land to <em>Lewis, </em>upon his survey thereof of the 1st October 1798, suggesting for cause, that the same. was claimed by <em>Morris and Harman, by prior entry and survey. </em>It was tried in September 1799. The jury, sworn <em>to inquire of facts between the parties litigant, </em>found: 1. That <em>Morris and Harman\u2019s survey </em>of 2000 acres, did not conform with their <em>entry, </em>because they had not <em>run down </em>for quantity. 2. That their survey of 4000 acres did not conform with the entry thereof, as the survey was made of land for which there was in fact no entry. 3. That <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>survey of 1437 acres did conform with his entry. And the parties agreed the dates of their respective entries and surveys, and the extent of the interference of the surveys of the caveators with the survey of the caveatee. Upon this state of facts, so found and agreed, the county court gave judgment for <em>Leivis </em>the caveatee. From this judgment the caveators prayed an appeal, which the court allowed them, without requiring an appeal bond with surety, nor was any given during the term; and the appeal was, therefore, dismissed by the district court held at <em>The Sweet Springs, </em>in October 1800. But, meanwhile, <em>viz. </em>in November and December 1799, <em>Morris and his associates, </em>contrary to the judgment upon the <em>caveat, </em>took out their patents for the lands in controversy. <em>Lewis </em>did not apply for his patent, till January 1801, after the district court had dismissed the appeal from the judgment on the <em>caveat.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The late chancellor <em>Brown </em>was of opinion, that <em>Bill</em>ip<em>s </em>had shewn himself entitled, m equity, to the 1437 acres o\u00ed land granted to <em>Lewis, </em>as against <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>devisees; that, upon the facts proved in the cause, this equitable right of <em>Billips </em>was vested in him <em>before </em>the emanation of the patents to <em>Morris and others ; </em>and, considering the circumstances and the manner in which these patents were obtained, the priority of them would not avail the patentees : therefore, he decreed, that the defendants, respectively, should convey to <em>Billips, </em>all their right and title in the lands, or any part thereof, included withi.i <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>survey of 1437 acres; and that the defendants in possession of the lands should render accounts of rents and profits, Sic.

He insisted, that <em>Morris and Harman\u2019s </em>entry of 2000 acres, was sufficiently special and certain, and that the survey thereof conformed with the entry; and, by consequence, the entry of 4000 acres by <em>Morris, Harman, Teas </em>and <em>Neely, </em>was also special and certain enough, and the surrej of this too conformed with the entry, with as much precision as could reasonably be, or had ever been, required in such cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUxC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>This point presented the question, whether the call of <em>Morris and Harman\u2019s </em>entry of <em>2000 </em>acres, required the iocators t0 g0 from the <em>beginning </em>point on the head <em>waters </em>of <em>Poplar </em>Fork, <em>down that stream </em>for quantity, or justified them in leaving that stream altogether, and going <em>down the general course of the country, </em>for quantity? A question, which mainly depended on the evidence, as to the meaning of the language of the entry, as used and understood in locations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afd\">2dly. He contended that <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>location of 1437 acres was naught, not having been made, in the language of the land law, so specially and precisely, as that others might be enabled, with certainty, to locate other warrants on the adjacent <em>residuum </em>(1 Rev. Code, ch. 86. \u00a7 17. p. 325); and that, if the <em>entry </em>were good, the <em>survey </em>was fatally vitious, for not conforming with the <em>entry. 1. </em>The location was not special enough. The <em>entry </em>called for a beginning <em>one mile above a marked tree and a rock on Big-Hurricane, eight or nine miles above its mouth ; </em>without stating on which side of the creek those objects were; without stating, whether they were to be looked for, eight or nine miles from the mouth of the stream, measuring in a straight line, or By the meanders of the stream; and, above all, without stating, in what course or bearing from the designated objects, the beginning point should be looked for, thus leaving the locator at liberty to select any point he pleased, in an arc of ninety degrees of a circle whereof the radius was a mile, any such point being downward from the designated objects.The entry could be regarded as <em>special </em>enough, only by construing it to call for a beginning at a point on the stream, and on the same side of it with the designated objects, one mile below them. And then, 2. the survey far from conforming with the entry, was an intire departure from it; for the objects designated in the entry, were on the <em>west </em>side of the stream; and the beginning point of the <em>entry, was </em>on the <em>east </em>side, no less than 65 poles from the stream, and 84 poles more than a mile from the designated objects. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>verdict of the jury which tried the <em>caveat </em>in 1799, could not <em>conclude </em>any point in the present controversy, for only part of the parties here were parties to that <em>caveat, </em>and the record was so imperfect, that it was impossible to say, whether no, the judgment of the court was given upon the merits. Neither could that verdict be regarded <em>even as evidence, </em>either that <em>Morris and, Harman\u2019s </em>survey of 2000 acres did not conform with their entry, or that the survey of 4000 acres of <em>Morris and his associates </em>had no entry to support it, or that <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>survey conformed with his entry. For the record of the <em>caveat </em>was not exhibited as <em>evidence </em>touching those facts, or any facts in controversy in this case; it was only exhibited with the supplemental bill, as shewing an excuse for the neglect of <em>Lewis </em>or <em>Billips </em>to proceed by way of <em>caveat, </em>to prevent <em>Morris and others </em>from taking out their patents. And, as to the certainty and precision of <em>Lewis\u2019s entry, </em>the verdict on the <em>caveat </em>found nothing; and this was a main point in the present controversy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-6\"><em>Leigh </em>said, that if the <em>certainty and precision </em>of location, required by the land law, were to he taken in the strict sense of those words, very few locations had ever been, or in the nature of things could be, made specially and precisely enough. To minds not versed in the subject, most of the locations which had stood the test of examination, had an air of vagueness. The requisition of the law had always been understood according to the subject matter. Certainty and precision of location, according to the general understanding of locators, was all that was requisite: they know, better than we possibly could, whether an entry he special and precise, as well as whether a survey conform with or depart from the entry. It was enough, if <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>entry was <em>special and </em>precise, and if his survey conformed with it with sufficient exactness, in the understanding of surveyors and other persons residing in this new country, and versed in such subjects. A jury of the country, trying the points in dispute shortly after they arose, had found, that the surveys of <em>Morris </em>and his associates, were not founded on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>their entries, </em>and that <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>survey did conform with <em>his entry. </em>It could not be at all material, for what purpose pie record of the <em>caveat </em>was originally exhibited. It was now a document in the cause. And, surely, it was evidence, that, when a locator establishes his beginning point on the waters of a stream, and calls <em>to go down </em>for quantity, the acceptation of the phrase is, that he is to go <em>down the stream </em>for quantity, not from it, in quite another direction, <em>down the general course of the country; </em>evidence also, as to tire degree of certainty in a location sufficient, in general, to enable other <em>locators </em>to locate the adjacent land, and of the reasonable exactness with which a survey should conform with an entry.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-3\">III. <em>Johnson </em>said, that the case was not properly relievable in equity, because <em>Lewis </em>or <em>Billips </em>might, if he had right, have had remedy by <em>caveat; </em>nor did the <em>caveat </em>prosecuted by <em>Morris and Harman </em>against <em>Lewis, </em>furnish any reason why <em>Lewis </em>or <em>Billips </em>should not have resorted to a <em>caveat </em>against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-4\"><em>Leigh </em>adverted to the fact, that, after judgment given for <em>Lewis </em>against <em>Morris and Harman, </em>in September 1799, that <em>Lewis was, </em>and that <em>Morris and Harman </em>were <em>not, </em>entitled to a patent for the land comprised in <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>survey, and while <em>Lewis </em>had every reason to believe, that that controversy was carried to the district court by appeal, <em>Morris </em>and his associates had come to the land office, and taken out their patents. They had, at the time, actual notice of Lew\u00bb <em>is\u2019s </em>prior equity. And thus, he said, these patents were obtained by <em>surprise and fraud </em>upon <em>Lewis, </em>such as gave ample ground for the jurisdiction of the chancellor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b374-5\">In the argument, the former adjudications of this court, concerning this much litigated point, were cited; <em>particularly, </em>Nola<em>nd </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>4 Munf. 155. <em>M\u2019Clung </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>5 Rand. 453. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>M\u2019Gavock, </em>Id. 509.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b374-6\">Carr, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP2\">' I shall first consider the question, whether the appellee, having no good excuse for failing to <em>caveat </em>the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>pedants, is precluded, by the decisions of this court, from looking behind their patent? The appellee in his supplemental hill, has assigned, in excuse for this failure, that the appellants, having entered a <em>caveat </em>against <em>Lewis, </em>took their patents while it was pending. Our <em>caveat </em>law says, \u201c if any person shall obtain a survey of land, to which another hath by law a better right, the person having such better right, may enter a <em>caveat, </em>to prevent his obtaining a grant, <em>until the title can he determined, </em>such <em>caveat </em>expressing the nature of the right on which the plaintiff claims the land.\u201d 1 Rev. Code, ch. 86. \u00a7 38. p. 330. In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 Call, 267. this court said, \u201c It was foreseen by the legislature, that there would be interfering entries and surveys; and the <em>caveat </em>was the remedy for settling all those disputes prior to the patent, to avoid the inconvenience of that solemn instrument being involved in contests of that kind.\u201d Here, we see the nature and object of the <em>caveat. </em>In the case before us, <em>Morris and Harman </em>caveated <em>Lewis, </em>because \u201c they claimed the land by prior entry and survey.\u201d This brought directly before the <em>caveat </em>court, the title of the <em>caveator; </em>and the judgment upon that <em>caveat, </em>was for the defendant. It was said, indeed, that it did not appear that this was a trial upon the merits, and if not, the judgment did not bind the rights of the parties: but the jury found, that the 2000 acre survey did not 'follow the entry; that the 4000 acre survey was on land for which there was no entry; and that <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>survey was conformable with his entry. And, on this finding, the judgment is given; which, to my mind, is most clearly upon the merits. The caveators appealed, and thereby prevented the caveatee from getting his patent; and pending this appeal, took out their patents, and then abandoned their <em>caveat. </em>I consider this proceeding a fraud; and a fraud too of that sort, that furnished a good excuse to <em>Lewis, </em>for not proceeding to <em>caveat </em>the caveators. For, after a decision against their right, and an appeal indicating their intention to rest the contest on the <em>caveat, Lewis </em>had no rational ground to suspect the application for their patents. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>He, then, or (which is the same thing) <em>Billips </em>claiming under him, comes into equity, sanctioned by <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>even upon my understanding of that case, as explained in <em>M\u2019Clung </em>v. <em>Hughes. </em>And I consider this <em>caveat </em>such a notice to all, whose joint rights as associates with <em>Morris </em>were involved, as affected them with fraud in proceeding to take patents. The case, then, is properly in equity. And, without saying, that <em>the verdict </em>and judgment on the <em>caveat, </em>is decisive of the rights of the parties, I will say that it is, with me, most persuasive evidence. The trial was by a jury of the country, every man of whom was probably familiar with entries, surveys and patents: they had the advantage, too, of hearing the witnesses examined and cross-examined by counsel well acquainted with these subjects; and thus could have every thing which may puzzle us, explained to them, by men who had been upon the land, had traced the lines, and were well acquainted with all the localities. From a decision like this, I should dissent with great diffidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">But the examination I have given the entries, surveys and evidence, induces me strongly to believe, that the jury was right. The 2000 acre survey does not follow the calls of the entry. The beginning corner is proved to be on the waters of the <em>Poplar Fork; </em>and the call is, <em>down for quantity. </em>That stream runs a north-west course, and the first course of the survey is eastward, up and across the ridge, to get upon other waters of <em>Big-Hurricane </em>creek. Six witnesses (two or three of them, surveyors) state, that the survey is off the entry. The 4000 acre entry is dependent on this, calling for the vacant land on both sides of it; and the error in <em>this, </em>of course renders <em>that </em>wholly erroneous, and throws the surveys, as the jury said, on land for which there was no entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">With respect to the entry and survey of <em>Lewis, </em>though they might have been more precise and certain, I incline to think they ought to be supported, under the decisions both of this and the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>1 think, however, that the chancellor erred in decreeing a conveyance of <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>title, before compensation shall be made to his devisees, for his services and expenses, in entering, surveying and patenting the land for <em>Billips. </em>The decree should have directed an account of these, and made the payment thereof, a condition precedent to the conveyance of the legal title by <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>devisees to <em>Billips. </em>This, however, being an interlocutory order, the omission will not affect the costs. The decree should be corrected in this-particular, and affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<author id=\"b377-3\">Green, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AIIp\">The questions are, whether Billips, the <em>cestui que trust </em>of <em>Lewis, </em>has a better right to the land in controversy than <em>Morris </em>and his associates ? and whether he can assert that right in a court of equity ?</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Referring to <em>M\u2019Clung </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>for the outline of my opinions on questions of this sort, I consider that <em>Morris </em>and his associates taking out a patent for the land in controversy, after the decision in a regular proceeding, that they had no right to it as against <em>Lewis, </em>was such a fraud as might be corrected in a court of equity, upon its general principles; and that all his associates were affected by the notice of this better right than <em>Morris\u2019s, </em>although they might not have had such notice themselves. And, without deciding whether the proceedings in the <em>caveat, </em>were or were not binding upon the rights of the parties to this cause, I think, that, upon the evidence in this case, independently of the verdict and judgment on the <em>caveat, </em>the surveys of <em>Morris </em>and his associates did not conform to <em>their </em>entries; that <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>survey did conform to his, with sufficient certainty, inasmuch as it covered the main body of the land, which it would have covered if it had been surveyed in the strictest conformity to the entry; and that no more latitude has been taken by him, in this case, than might reasonably be allowed in general; especially, as he comes in competition with one, who was not misled by the trivial irregularity in his survey. The verdict of the jury on the <em>caveat, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>judgment of the court, which were more familiarly acquainted with subjects of that sort than I am, I confess, weigh strongly with me, to fortify this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"Axpo\">The decree is, however, erroneous, in decreeing a conveyance of <em>Lewis\u2019s </em>title, until his representatives be indemnified by Billips, for his expenses in procuring the title to tire land, with such a compensation for his services in that respect, as may be found reasonable. With this correction, the decree is right.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Coalter, <em>J. </em>said, he concurred in the opinion of judge <em>Green.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>said, generally, that he concurred in the proposed correction of the decree, and in the affirmance of it in all other respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b378-7\">Brooke, P.</author>\n<p id=\"AlxZ\">I concur in the affirmance of the decree, with the correction proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">I do not think the judgment in the <em>caveat </em>case, can be relied on as an estoppel by the plaintiffs. A court of equity will not set aside a judgment for fraud, unless the party asking it to do so, will do complete justice : nor will it enforce a judgment, unless the party seeking relief, will submit himself to the justice of the court. But this is not material in this case, because the findings of the jury, on which the judgment on the <em>caveat </em>was rendered, are, I think, convincing evidence, that the judgment was right. The excuse assigned for the failure to file a <em>cross caveat </em>by the caveatee (if one was necessary) is, I think, sufficient, under the correct understanding of the decision in <em>Noland </em>v. <em>Cromwell, </em>without extending the construction so far, as to substitute the opinion of the minority for the opinion of the majority of the court; which, I think, is the effect of the decision of <em>M\u2019Clung v</em>. <em>Hughes. </em>I deem the excuse, <em>here, </em>sufficient; for, though no fraud may have been intended by the caveator, in taking out his patent pending the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>appeal from the judgment against him on his <em>caveat, </em>especially, as the patent included other lands than those in controversy; yet it was a surprise on the caveatee, who could not have expected, that the caveator would take out his patent, pending the appeal, and before the controversy respecting a portion of the land included in it, was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">The decree was corrected in the particular mentioned by the judges, and affirmed in all other respects, with costs to the appellees, as the party substantially prevailing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
