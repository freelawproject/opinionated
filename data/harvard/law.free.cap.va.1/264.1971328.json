Upon the plea of <em>non </em>assumpsit, the jury found a special verdict, in substance, as follow's : That on the 31st <em>August, </em>1780, the defendant shipped at <em>Amsterdam, </em>on board of the <em>General Washington, </em>a <em>letter of marque, </em>bound for <em>Alexandria, </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>and owned by the plaintiffs, two parcela of goods, and paid the freight and primage on the small parcel before the ship sailed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-10\">That the captain signed two bills of lading, binding himself to deliver the goods to the defendant, or to his assigns, at <em>Alexandria, </em>the danger of the seas only excepted, the defendant paying 121 <em>per cent, </em>freight upon the nett proceeds, upon their delivery at <em>Alexandria, </em>and the captain\u2019s primage, at the rate of five <em>per cent.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-11\">That the ship was a merchantman employed in transporting goods for hire, provided with a <em>letter of marque, </em>and that, by the ships articles the captain was not to cruise or sail out of his way after the enemy, for the purpose of making prizes, or in pursuit of an enemy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-12\">That the captain, on his voyage, did change his course two or three points, and gave chase to a ship and brigantine belonging to the enemy, for three or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>four hours.

The appellee therefore ought unquestionably to pay for the carriage to <em>Dartmouth; </em>and if the non-delivery of the goods at the port of destination should be found to have been caused by himself, he will be answerable for full freight. I admit, that from the terms.of such engag\u00e9ments as the present, if the goods be not delivered at the port of destination, in consequence of a voluntary and faulty departure of the captain, he is not entitled to claim any part of the freight. This will lead to an enquiry into the conduct of the captain of the <em>General Washington. </em>It is found that he went out of his course a few points, for the purpose of at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>tacking, and this, I contend, he was justifiable in do?ng.

Thus far then the captain acted properly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">His next step was to put into <em>Dartmouth, </em>and this is found by the jury to have been dictated by prudence. Being there, the owners were entirely at liberty, cither to refit and complete the voyage, or to transport the goods to <em>Alexandria, </em>in some other vessel. It is a right of which the freighters cannot deprive the owners. Although the <em>General fPashington </em>was not intended to bring the goods to <em>Alexandria, </em>yet the owners might have sent them in some other ship, and in fact they did. so with respect to a part of the cargo, belonging to other persons. The defendants might have been also sent, if his agent had not taken them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">He ought not therefore to avail himself of this act of his own, to deprive the owners of full freight.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-7\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-8\">I admit that freight is a compensation for the carriage of goods from one place to another. It is bottomed upon some contract, either written or parol, and by the mercantile law, it is considered as being neither due nor demandable, until the service <em>is </em>performed. The performance of the service, then, must be first established, before the reward can be claimed, and in strictness, it cannot be demanded, if from any cause whatever, the goods are not carried to the port of delivery agreed upon. I must admit that in some instances the complete fulfilment of the contract may be dispensed with 5 and yet, freight <em>pro rata </em>allowed. But as this is merely a matter of excuse, it must be proved by the owners, and must appear to be such an one as fixes the blame upon them, or upon the captain. In this case the conduct of the captain is attempted to be justified, and authorities for that purpose are relied upon. But it is easy to discern, that the cases cited by Mr. <em>Lee </em>do not apply. They re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>late merely to disputes between the <em>assurer and </em>as<em>sured, </em>and not to the subject offreight, which involves quite different considerations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-9\">One party agrees to insure, provided the other conforms to certain rules, well established and known by both, and which are therefore calculated upon, in esti mating the rate of hazard.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-10\">If the captain be not permitted to cruize, or to act offensively, the risk is the less, and, of course, the premium diminished. A deviation, therefore, avoids the policy, and the cases cited define what is such a deviation as to produce this effect. But the freighter, knowing that the ship is by contract, (as in this case,} prohibited from chasing, and that his property is on that account more safe in her than in another vessel, is induced to give her a preference.\u2014-A violation of this contract is a plain fraud upon him, and consequently deprives the owners of an excuse, for not strictly complying with their engagement. Were it otherwise the captain would be thereby induced to chase every vessel of which there was a chance of making a prize, and thus, not only prolong the voyage, but endanger the cargo. Though the defendant was no party to that agreement, yet as it is natural that his enquiries would go to every circumstance relating to the risk, it is to be presumed that it was known to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-11\">As to the letter written by the appellee to Colonel \u00dc\u00c9nly, it appears to be very much misunderstood by the counsel who rely upon it. It is in the alternative; if the <em>Washington </em>should not bring the goods, or if the owners should not choose to send them in some other vessel, then, and not otherwise, his agent is directed to take possession of them. As it is not presumable that the owners would have delivered the goods to Henly, without an order from the appellee, it is plain that this letter was shewn to their agent. The goods being delivered, amounts to a declaration on the part of. the owner, that the <em>Washington </em>was not intended to come to Alexandria, and that they did not mean to send the goods in some other vessel. A different determination, afterwards formed, and executed, could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>not justify their prior conduct. Upon the whole, I think it clear, that the conduct of the captain in the first instance, and of the owners in the second, was such as to destroy all claim to freight, either upon principles of justice, or of law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-3\"><em>Lee, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3C\">I willingly admit, that the agreement between the owners and the captain should be considered as part of the case. The second article of it directs the mode of arming, and stipulates for a reward to the <em>mariner first discovering an </em>enemy, which proves, that it was intended to chase, and to act offensively. Nor is it difficult to reconcile this with the first clause, which was evidently meant to prohibit the captain from committing a deviation, which we find, from the cases cited, to mean <em>cruizing^ </em>and not going a few points out of the course <em>to chase. </em>In fact, it was intended to express, what would otherwise have been understood.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b289-4\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A9A\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The deviation, and putting into Dartmouth, being found by the jury, to have been prudent and unavoidable, in consequence of the action, no objection against the payment of freight, can on that account be made, if the conduct of the captain, in attacking the enemy, were justifiable. The general principle of law, that <em>&amp; </em>merchantman, having <em>letters of </em>marque, may <em>chase m </em>enemy in sight, but cannot <em>cruize </em>out of her course to look for one, is well established, and seems not to have been controverted at the bar. This is surely a very reasonable distinction; for since commerce is the principal object of such a vessel, it would be improper, that she should lose sight of this, and go in search of prizes.\u2014-On the other hand, as <em>letters of marque </em>are obtained at some expense, a vessel would have them to little purpose, if she could never act but on the de Tensive, and could not whilst pursuing her great and primary object, embrace a probable chance of making prizes, so as to procure a reimbursement. But to this, two objections are made by the counsel for the appel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>lee.\u20141st. That the doctrine, though applicable to cases of insurances, is not so, to those, where the question is about freight. The Court cannot discern any distinction between Them ; for if the insurer be supposed to know the principles and rules of insurance, and to calculate the rates of hazard accordingly, why is not the freighter to be presumed equally well informed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The second objection is, that the captain was restrained by the articles, from giving chase. But upon a view of those articles, it is evident, that the parties well understood the distinction between cruizing, and chasing an enemy in, or near the course, the former of which is alone intended to be prohibited. We are therefore of opinion, that the conduct of the captain has not deprived the owners of their claim to freight. We are equally clear, that the claim cannot go beyond a freight <em>pro rata. </em>The letter of the appellee did not prevent, or, in the most distant manner, intend to prevent the owners, from sending ibe goods to the port of delivery ; on the contrary, he appears to have preferred their doing so, and only requested the interference of his friend, in case they should not take that step. The delivery of the goods to <em>Colonel Henly, </em>was evidence enough, that the ownners had no intention of sending them, and that they had abandoned their claim to full freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">Judgment reversed, and entered forSOA</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
