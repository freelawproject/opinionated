November.</decisiondate>\n<parties data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"b310-13\">Appling <em>v. </em>Eades\u2019s <em>adm\u2019r &amp; als.</em></parties>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b310-14\">(Absent Brooke, J.)</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-15\">A person having made a will, which he had in his possession; and on his death, the will not being found; in the absence of all proof that he, or any other person, had destroyed it, it is to be presumed to have been destroyed by himself</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-16\">This is a bill filed by the appellant <em>Austin M. Appling, </em>against the administrator, heirs, and next of kin, of <em>Abraham Eades, </em>for the purpose of setting up the last will and testament of the said <em>Eades; </em>which it was alleged, had been duly executed in his lifetime ; and by which, after giving several legacies among his next of kin, he gave the residue of his estate, real and personal, to the appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-17\">There was proof that <em>Abraham Eades </em>had, some years before his death, written a will, which was attested by four witnesses; by which he had given legacies to his surviving brothers and sisters, and one of his nephews, and had left the residue of his estate to <em>Austin M. Appling. </em>There was also proof of declarations of <em>Eades, </em>up to a short period before his death, that he had a <em>will; </em>but there was no satisfactory proof that he had a will at the time of his death, or that it had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>destroyed previous to that time ; and therefore the case \u2022 turned upon the question, whether it was to he presumed that the will was destroyed by himself, or had been casually lost or mislaid, or destroyed by a third person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AiZ\">The court below, upon the hearing, dismissed the bill; and the plaintiff applied for, and obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AfU\"><em>C. </em>&amp; G. <em>N. </em>Johnson, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9F\">A subsisting will can only be revoked in the modes prescribed by the <em>statute; </em>and it being ascertained that there was a will, the law presumes that it is in existence, until it is shewn by satisfactory proof, that it has been lawfully revoked. <em>Jackson </em>v. Betts, 9 Cow. Rep. 208. It is said, indeed, by some of the authorities, that if the will is not found, it is presumed to be destroyed by the testator. 1 Williams on Ex\u2019ors 77. But these authorities are, obviously, looking to the presumption between the testator\u2019s having destroyed the will, and some other person\u2019s having fraudulently done it; and they leave out of view, entirely, the cases where the will is lost, or destroyed by accident. On this rule of presumption in the ecclesiastical courts, we refer the court to the case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>2 Adams\u2019s Rep. <em>206; </em>2 Eccl. Rep. 277, 279.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-14\">But whatever may be said of this rule of presumption in the ecclesiastical courts, the cases relied upon by the counsel on the other side, shew that the doctrine is not recognized in <em>Westminster Hall. </em>There, they are bound by the statute of <em>wills; </em>in the other courts they are not thus bound; and they will rely on slight circumstances to establish a revocation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-15\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiB\">The appellant is attempting to set up a will which, he alleges, once existed, but which has not been <em>found; </em>and the question is, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>has become of it ? The rule of law, and of common sense, is, that he whose will it was, must be presumed to have destroyed it. He only had a right to do it. In any other person, the act would have been a fraud, or a felony. The law upon this subject, is distinctly and satisfactorily stated in 2 Tuck. Com. 420; and the principles there announced, are fully sustained by the authorities cited in Williams on Ex\u2019ors vol. 1, p. 77, and the cases of <em>Colvin </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>4 Eccl. Rep. 113, 140; and <em>Moggridge </em>v. <em>Thackwell, 7 Ves. </em>Rep. 36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-4\">In this case, there is no proof of the existence of the will, for three years prior to the death of <em>Fades, </em>except his own declarations; and the above case of <em>Colvin </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>and the case of <em>Gibbens </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>2 Eccl. R. 377, shew that the declarations of the testator are not to be relied upon to rebut the presumption that the testator had destroyed the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-5\">As to the case cited from <em>Cowen, </em>the facts of that case did not render it necessary for the court to lay down the proposition there stated; there were strong facts leading to the conclusion that the testator had not destroyed the will; the proposition is not sustained by the authorities cited in its support; and a reference to the judgment of the court in the same case, as it is reported in 6 Cow. Rep. 377, will shew that it is not entitled to any weight, in the consideration of this question.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b312-6\">By the court.</author>\n<p id=\"ASd\">Affirm the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
