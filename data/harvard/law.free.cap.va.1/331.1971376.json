The declaration is upon the Act of Assembly. On the plea of <em>nil de</em>bet, the jury found a special verdict, \u201c that the bill, with three indorsements thereon, two of which were erased, was duly protested in London, on the 10th of September, 1787, and that notice thereof was given to the defendants on or about the latter end of June, 1788. If this be a reasonable notice, then they find for the plaintiffs, otherwise for the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-18\">The judgment of the County Court, which was in favour of the appellants, was reversed in the District Court, because the verdict was defective, in not find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Ing facts sufficient to enable the Court to judge of the reasonableness of the notice of the protest therein , mentioned. The verdict was set aside, and the cause, by consent of parties, retained for a new trial 5 from which judgment <em>Stott Donaldson </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-3\">Ronold, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-4\">There is but a single question in this cause, which arises upon the construction of the Act of Assembly, of the 22d <em>George </em>II. c. 27.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The first branch of the law would give the holder of a protested bill of exchange a right to recover interest at the' rate of ten <em>per cent. </em>per annum, for any unlimited time, if it were not restrained, by the second branch of the section, to eighteen months ; and from this it is evident, that the object of the Legislature' was merely to regulate the interest to be paid upon protested bills, and to fix it at ten <em>per cent, per annum, </em>for eighteen months, though notice be not given of the protest within that time; and yet it is contended, that, for the want of notice, during a period far short of that time, the holder is to forfeit both principal and interest. This construction seems to be repugnant to the plain meaning of the law, and involves a contradiction not fairly to be attributed to the Legislature. If the exposition, for which I contend, be right, then it follows, that the jury having expressly found that notice was given within eighteen months, the appellants ought to recover under this Act. But if notice short of that time be necessary, still the judgment of the District Court is erroneous, because, what is reasonable notice is a point of law, and is properly to be decided by the Court. This is-clearly settled by the modern decisions in <em>England,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>and from hence I draw an additional argument to prove, that the Act of Assembly was intended to change the law of merchants upon the subject of givjng notjce_ For, WOuld it not be absurd, that, in this country, it should be necessary to give notice of a protegt \u00a1-,y t\u00a1le following post, as the practice is in <em>England? </em>Such a regulation might be proper and convenient in that country, the communication from place to place being uniform and constant. But our situation, at the time when this law passed, and long after, and when, too, our commerce was confined to <em>England, </em>was very different. Our intercourse with that country was not only confined, in a great measure, to particular times of the year, but various accidents might happen to prevent so prompt a notice from being given, and the adoption of such a rule here, would have proved so mischievous, that it would have put an entire stop to the negotiation of bills of exchange, which the Legislature, (in the preamble to the law,) declare it was their intention to \u201c render equal to cash in the payment of debts.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-6\">Wickham, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-7\">We all agree as to the rule established by the law of merchants ; but is contended that the Act of Assembly was made to change that rule, and the necessity of that change is stated and relied upon to prove such an intention. On the contrary, I should conceive that the inconvenience which would result from such an innovation in the custom of merchants, would be sufficient to induce the Court to explode such a construction, unless the law be too clear and express to be got over. The drawer of a bill tacitly agrees to pay the bill, if dishonoured, provided he has timely notice of the protest, and the holder tacitly agrees to give him that notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyW\">The custom of merchants having established this principle, such an implied contract is always understood between the parties, as certainly, as if it were expressed. The inconvenience resulting from,a contrary principle, is as strongly exemplified in this case, as in any which could be thought of. The drawer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>lives in a State, where this rule prevails. If the plaintiffs in this cause can, without regarding that rule, recover against the indorser,\u2014the indorser, in an action against the drawer will be told, that for want of due notice, the drawer is discharged. Who would be mad enough to draw bills, if at any distance of time, they might be returned upon him protested, after all accounts were settled between him and the drawee, and after he had otherwise applied those funds, which, as a prudent man, he would retain so long as the fate of his bill was in suspense.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-4\">There is a great difference between <em>giving notice of the protest of a bill, </em>and <em>demanding payment. </em>The first is necessary by the <em>custom of merchants, to </em>entitle the holder to the <em>principal sum ; </em>the latter, to entitle him to the <em>extraordinary </em>interest, given by the Act of Assembly, which last (beyond eighteen months,) he loses, unless, by <em>presenting the bill protested to the drawer or indorser </em>within that time, he affords them an opportunity of taking it up. It may so happen, that the drawer may have <em>notice </em>of a protested bill circulating in some part of the world, and yet, if it be not shewn to him, so that he may pay it off, he will be excused the <em>ten per cent, </em>for a longer period than eighteen months. The object of the law was to fix the interest which the holder should receive, and to lay him under a certain condition to entitle him to that interest. That condition is, that within a certain time, he <em>present the bill protested to the </em>drawer. But as to <em>notice of protest </em>required by the custom of merchants, it is left unaffected by the Act of Assembly, which never could have intended to alter a general law prevailing in a country with which we principally traded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\">The rule in <em>England, </em>as to the time of giving notice, is not as Mr. <em>Ronold </em>has stated it; it is regulated by the circumstances of each particular case, and is a subject which the jury must decide. I admit, that a different rule prevails in cases of <em>inland </em>bills of exchange.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b451-6\"><em>Campbell, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-7\">I admit that in <em>England, </em>what is due notice in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>case of <em>inland </em>bills of exchange, is a point of law, because the certainty of communication from one place to another, and the uniform decisions of juries upon that point, have so fully ascertained and settled it, that the Judges are as competent as the jury to decide upon it. The adoption of a similar practice in this country would be unjust and preposterous even in the cases of inland bills.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b452-8\">As to the main question, there is one reason to be given for the custom of merchants, which has not been much relied upon, and which has always had considerable weight with me, independently of those stated in the books. It is this: a merchant who draws a bill, must, if he mean to be punctual, and to preserve his credit, keep unemployed such a portion of his capital, as will enable him to take it up, should it return protested. If he may be kept in suspense as to its fate, for any length of time, (even eighteen months) he must either retain that capital unemployed, during all that time, which would be very injurious to commerce, or he must part with it, and run the risk of being called upon unexpectedly to pay a protested bill, at a time when he may be unprepared to do so. It can hardly be believed, that the Legislature could have intended to fetter commerce by the establishment of a principle unknown in any trading country, and particularly in that, with which we were solely connected. The law requires a <em>presentation </em>of the bill to the drawer or indorser, not as being necessary to authorise the holder to recover the amount of the bill, but to entitle him to <em>ten per cent, per annum </em>beyond eighteen months. As to <em>notice of the </em>protest, the Act is entirely silent, leaving that subject as it stood under the general law of merchants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-9\"><em>Ronold, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArL\">The Legislature certainly intended to alter the custom of merchants upon this subject, and to adapt it to the situation of this country, by declaring that eighteen months should be considered as the time within which notice of protest should be given. Those persons whose recollection will carry them back to the period when this law was made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>will remember,-that protested bills passed from hand to hand as cash, and formed a circulating medium of commerce. The indorsements were never dated, and the bills sometimes remained in circulation here, for many months before they were remitted. This practice the Legislature meant to regulate, having a view to the interest of all parties, and to limit the damages to a certain amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-4\">Mr. <em>Wickham </em>submitted another question to the Court, which was, whether an action of debt upon this bill, (which was drawn out of this State) could be supported under the Act of Assembly ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">Mr. <em>Monoid </em>answered, that it might lie against the present appellees, who made the indorsement in this State, upon the principle, that every indorser is considered as a new drawer.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em> </em>The words of the law <em>are,tc </em>That, where any bill of exchange is or shall be drawn for the payment of any sum of money, in which the value is, or shall be expressed to be received, and such bill is or shall be protested for non-acceptance or non-payment, the same shall carry interest from the date thereof, after the rate often per cent, per annum, until the money therein drawn for shall be fully satisfied and paid 5 but lest any person having- such bill should, for the sake of the said interest, delay negotiating the same, or if, after it shall be protested, shall not demand payment of the drawer or endorser thereof, <em>it is hereby declared, </em>thal no person whatsoever shall pay more than eighteen months interest from the date of any bill to the time it <em>shall be presented protested to the drawer or indorse*' or indorsers thereof.n</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b453-6\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A-m\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Some general questions have been discussed at the bar, upon the law respecting protested bills of exchange, such as, whether the Act of Assembly has not done away the whole custom of merchants on the subject of notice, and whether the holder may not, upon notice at any time, however remote, recover his principal money, although he may lose his damages. With these points, the Court think it unnecessary to meddle, except so far as they may concern the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The Act of Assembly does not seem to interfere with the negociation of bills, but taking them up as negociated, and protested, proceeds to give the remedy for recovering their amount, leaving the point of their negociation to be decided upon the particular circumstances of each case. As to the diligence necessary to be used by the holder in giving notice of the protest, since that depended upon the situation of the parties, and of the countries between which the exchange was made, the Legislature, contemplating those circumstances, seem to have thought eighteen months a reasonable time for the whole negociation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>and for the giving of notice, by allowing full damages in case the notice be given within that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">There may be particular circumstances, which would render a departure from this <em>general rule </em>reasonable and proper; and when they occur, the general rule may not be adhered to; but no such circumstances are state.d in the present case. The bill is dated in Philadelphia, on the 15th of March, 1787\u2014indorsed in <em>Virginia, </em>but at what time does not appear. It was presented for acceptance about the 10th of <em>June, </em>and protested in <em>September </em>in the same year. Notice was given to the defendant in the latter end of <em>June </em>1788, all within fifteen months from the date of the bill, and the question submitted by the jury is, whether this be reasonable notice. No facts being stated to take this case out of the general rule before mentioned, and established by the Act of Assembly, we are of opinion that the notice is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">As to the opinion of the District Court, respecting the insufficiency of the finding, it is no objection to a verdict, that enough is not found to answer the purpose of one of the parties, provided what is found, be clearly stated, which is the case in the present verdict. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Judgment of the District Court reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
