Replication, that the defendants did assume. Verdict for the plaintiff, that the defendants did assume, as declared against. The defendants filed a bill of exceptions, stating specially, what each witness examined in the cause had deposed, and that not one of them established an assumpsit <em>within five years. </em>This appears from the bill of exceptions to have been the case; but it does not state, that the testimony therein set forth was the <em>whole evidence </em>given in the cause. The Court, upon the motion of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, instructed the jury that the evidence produced by the plaintiff was good and effectual in law to maintain the issue on his part. From this judgment the defendants below appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b278-11\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b278-12\">The jury having found a general verdict, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>iaking notice of the second plea, have left the quesiion arising upon that plea entirely undetermined, and the verdict is consequently inconclusive.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-3\">But I rely principally upon tills\u2014that the Court exceeded the due exercise of their powers, when they undertook to decide upon the <em>weight </em>of the testimony given to the jury. It was certa miy their duty to see that the evidence was proper\u00bb But in estimating its weight, the jury were exclusively the judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-4\">If the defendant had demurred to the evidence, as stated in the bill of exceptions, there is no doubt but that he must have succeeded. Yet this is merely formal, and since the bill of exceptions states all the evidence, the Court may with propriety decide, that the plaintiff, not supporting the issue on the second plea, ought not to have had judgment.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b279-5\"><em>By the </em>Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AfP\">The District Court most certainly) did wrong, in directing the jury, that the evidence <em>was sufficient </em>to maintain the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">was a the jury, and ought to have been left with them, without any such declaration, or. direction, unless the Court, (by a demurrer to the evidence having been filed,) had been compelled to decide upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">But the Court mistook even upon the point which they improperly undertook to determine, for there appears no proof whatever of the purchase of the sloop, by the appellants. The bill of exceptions states an offer of 1100/. by the appellant\u2014a demand by the appellee of 1200/.\u2014-but no agreement as to the price, There is no proof of any contract, but such as is de rived from the appellee himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial awarded.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b279-11\"> <em>Bogle &amp; Co. v.
