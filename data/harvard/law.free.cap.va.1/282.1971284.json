The <em>advertisement </em>was confined to <em>creditors </em>who should purchase, which the defendant was not.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">The appellant instituted an action of debt in the Dis* triet Court of <em>Richmond, </em>against the appellees, (styling herself, administratrix of <em>W B. Brown) </em>upon a bond taken to herself as administratrix. The declaration is in the <em>debet et </em>detinet\u2014Plea, payment. The defendant <em>Garland, </em>having given six months previous notice of offsets, offered as such at the trial, two bonds due front the intestate, and which had come to his hands, by assignment, since the institution of this suit\u2014-also two receipts signed by the plaintiff, the one for money, and the other for a bond due by the intestate, and assigned to the same defendant; all which off-sets had been acquired since the institution of this suit. They also produced in evidence an advertisement of the plaintiff\u2019s, offering for sale the property of the intestate at public auction, and agreeing to allow a discount of five <em>per cent, to </em>such of the creditors of the estate, as chose to purchase at the sale. They also offered at the trial to prove a sufficiency of assets to pay the debts, and tendered the costs of suit. All these facts appeared in a bill of exceptions, taken by the plaintiff to the opinion of the Court, admitting the testimony-verdict for the defendant and appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b303-7\"><em>Washington, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-8\">The defendant, at common law, could shew nothing in discharge of a bond, but something of equal dignity with itself, such as a release, &amp;c., offsets are permitted in <em>England </em>by a statute, which is not in force here. In like manner, the defendant is permitted by a statute in that country, as well as by the law of this, to plead payment. But there is no law of this State which authorises off-sets. If this were a question in <em>Westminster Hall, </em>it would be decided against the appellees under the <em>English </em>law; for the debt to be off-set must be in the same right as the debt demanded. Thus, in an action by the assignee of a bankrupt, a debt due from the bankrupt cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>be setoff, 1 <em>Wils. Rep. </em>155. So where, after the tesdeath, the defendant received rents which be\u00bb came due before, he was not permitted to set off against the claim of the executor for those rents, a debt due to him from the <em>testator.\u2014Shipman </em>v. <em>Thomson, Rep. </em>103. The reason is, that where there are mutual debts, there must be mutual remedies; and unless there are, the doctrine of off-sets cannot apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">So, a man cannot set off a debt due in right of his wife, against one due from himself. <em>Bull. N. P. </em>179, 180\u20143 <em>Atk. </em>691.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">Though the bond in question were actually given for property of the testator\u2019s sold to him, (which does not appear,) yet it became a debt due to the executrix \u2014she must sue in the <em>debet et detinet, </em>and is accountable for <em>the amount of the property so sold, </em>to the persons entitled to demand it. The remedies therefore are not mutual\u2014The debts are not mutual\u2014and consequently the off-sets are inadmissible. If they were, it might subject the appellant to a <em>devastavit, </em>in cases of debts of superior dignity, and an insufficiency of assets.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-9\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-10\">The Act of Assembly, <em>22 Geo. II., C. 27. </em>\u00a7 6, which permits the defendant to make <em>all the discounts hecan, </em>is more comprehensive than the statute relating to off-sets, and sufficiency so to embrace the present case. But I rely principally upon the advertisement, as imposing upon the appellant an obligation - to receive the bonds in question, in discharge of the debt for which the suit was instituted. He cited, 3 <em>Wils. </em>396. <em>2 Bur. </em>821\u20141229.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-11\"><em>Marshall, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akex\">The first question in this cause is, whether the discount offered was proper, under the Act of Assembly\u20142d!y, if not, what operation the advertisement will have upon the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-12\">1st. The words of the Act are very extensive; much more so than the Statute of off-sets. The adjudications in <em>England </em>therefore are not applicable, because the statute speaks of <em>mutual debts, </em>which our law does not. In the present case, the bond being given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>for property of the testator sold, the money, when reeeived, is to be administered as other assets, and may the&gt; cfore be properly subjected to the discount insisted upon at the trial.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-6\">Mercer J.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9pz\">Ought not the defendant to have pleaded this off-set? The plaintiff might then have replied, bo assets;\u2014that it was not given for property of the testator, or the like; in which case, the issue would have been upon the proper point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-7\">Marshall.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMjT\">The Act of Assembly does not require it to be pleaded, but declares that the discount, if proved, shall be allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-8\">But 2dly, the advertisement strengthens the case very much, because it creates an obligation on the appellant to admit the discount;\u2014is a tacit admission of assets;\u2014and of course does away the danger of producing a devastavit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-9\">Duval, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoyb\">Perhaps the appellee might have been induced to take the assignment of these bonds in consequence of the advertisement, and therefore the rejection of them as a discount would be a fraud upon him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b305-10\">Washington, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-T\">If the defendant, upon the plea of payment, can give in evidence off-sets of this sort, it is impossible for the plaintiff to know how to meet the plea at the trial.\u2014The bonds may be void, or paid off.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-11\">In the construction of the Act of Assembly, the question, what are proper discounts, is still left open for the Court to decide upon, and no better, or more just rule can be adopted, that that which prevails in cases of off-sets in <em>England. </em>By confining it to mutual debts, it prevents confusion at the trial, or the possibility of eventual injustice to any of the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-12\">The advertisement does not better the situation of the appellees, because neither of them were <em>purchasing creditors; </em>and to such only, are the benefits offered or intended. If the off-set were, in this case, permitted, the appellant might be subjected to this inconvenience\u2014a purchaser at the sale gives his bond, not claiming to be a creditor (for if he were he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>would be entitled to a discount of five per cent, and ought not to have given a bond at all), the debt belonging to the administratrix, and she being accountable for the amount to those entitled to distribution, she</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A50\">may have paid them, and afterwards, upon bringing suit upon the bond, the defendants obtain assignments of debts due from the intestate to destroy the command.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s offer to prove assets, it does not better the case, because it not being a point in issue, the plaintiff could not be prepared to meet such evidence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b306-7\">Carrington, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al3\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">The Court considers the motive of the advertisement, which was only to enhance the sales, by offering the inducement of five per cent, discount to the <em>purchasing creditors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">But <em>Garland </em>not being of that description, can claim no benefit under it. The advertisement therefore is out of the question: and without it, there is no doubt but that the admission of the bonds as off-sets was improper. Neither the advertisement, nor the bonds, ought to have been given in evidence to prove a payment, upon the plea and issue joined in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial awarded.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b306-13\"> <em>Dangerfield </em>v.
