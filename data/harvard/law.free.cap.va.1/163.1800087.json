Bradford </em>and their children, during the lives of my said daughterand <em>Major Bradford, </em>and the longest liver of them, and after their deaths to be equally divided among the children of my said daughter <em>Jane </em>by the said <em>Bradford.\" Charles Carter, </em>the executor of the will, and one of the trustees, in 1793, had the four slaves selected from his testator\u2019s estate ; and, he and <em>Thornton </em>both declining to act as trustees, he delivered them to <em>Mrs. Bradford, </em>her husband being then in <em>Europe, </em>whence he never returned. He died there. The trust slaves remained in <em>Mrs. Bradford's </em>possession during her widowhood, which continued four or five years: she married <em>John Verminet, </em>and thus the property passed into his possession. <em>Verminet, </em>in November 1798, sold to <em>Richard Rankin, </em>for <em>\u00a3 </em>190. all the trust slaves (then six in number) <em>for the life of his wife; </em>and she joined him in the bill of sale. After this, <em>Verminet </em>went to <em>New Orleans, </em>and there died about 1805 or G. <em>Rankin gave </em>some of the slaves to his sons-in-law, <em>J. A. Frayser </em>and <em>W. </em>Cr. <em>Dudley; </em>and he and they sold the absolute property of some of them to <em>Thomas Deverick </em>and <em>Thomas Johnson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">In 1819, <em>Mrs. Verminet </em>and her children by <em>Bradford, </em>brought this suit in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Staunton, </em>against <em>Rankin, Frayser, Dudley, Deverick </em>and <em>Johnson. </em>They set forth in their bill the facts as above stated, with this difference, that the bill alleges that the trust slaves were delivered by the executor of <em>Mr. Carter, to Major Bradford, </em>whereas they were in truth delivered to <em>Mrs. Bradford: </em>and they stated, that at the time of <em>Verminet's </em>sale to <em>Rankin, Mrs. Verminet </em>was under the disability of coverture, and her children under that of infancy, and so remained for many years afterwards; that <em>Rankin </em>was apprised of the trust and every other circumstance affecting the property; that he removed the slaves from the neighbourhood of <em>Fredericksburg </em>to the county of <em>Augusta, </em>and thus concealed the locality of the subject from the real own<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>ers of it; that <em>Deverick </em>and <em>Johnson </em>also purchased of <em>Rankin, </em>the slaves held by them, with notice of the true state of the title, and that <em>Rankin's </em>sons-in-law were mere volunleers. They prayed a discovery of the names, ages and residence of the slaves; and, suggesting that <em>Rankin </em>and his sons-in-law would probably remove the property out of roach, they asked an order to restrain them from doing so. And they demanded the slaves and their increase, and an account of profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\"><em>Rankin, </em>in his answer, admitted that he had bought the slaves of <em>Verminet, for the life of his wife; </em>and he exhibited the bill of sale. He admitted also, that at the time of his purchase, ho had notice that the slaves were held in right of the <em>wife; </em>but in what manner she acquired the right, he said, he had no information. He admitted, that he had removed the slaves to <em>Augusta, </em>but denied that he had taken any pains to conceal them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\"><em>Deverick </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>in their answers, stated, that they purchased of <em>Rankin </em>the absolute property of the slaves held by them, without notice of any trust affecting them, or other defect in the title, and paid him full prices: and they relied on the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-8\">As to <em>Frayser </em>and <em>Dudley, </em>the hill was taken for con<em>fessed.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-9\">The answers of <em>Deverick </em>and <em>Johnson </em>were fully supported <em>by </em>the proofs. The proofs also identified the slaves, and established all the material facts of the case, as above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-10\">The chancellor dismissed the bill as to <em>Deverick </em>and <em>Johnson; </em>but, being of opinion, that <em>Rankin </em>was not entitled to hold the <em>possession </em>of the trust slaves or any of them, and reserving the question how far <em>Verminet </em>could convey a good right to such portion of <em>the profits </em>of the subject as were by <em>Mr. Carter's </em>will properly applicable to the support of <em>Mrs. Verminet, </em>he decreed, that <em>Rankin, Frayser </em>and <em>Dudley, </em>should deliver all the trust slaves then held by them respectively, to the marshal of the court, to be hired out by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>him &amp;c. And that these defendants should render accounts of the values of the slaves by them respectively sold, and also of the profits, as well of those which had been sold, as of those which remained in their possession. From this decree, <em>Rankin </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-4\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHm\">The case presented by the record is not properly relievable in equity. The bill, indeed, prays a discovery of the names, ages and residence, of the slaves in question, and an order to restrain the defendants from carrying the slaves away: but, as it appears from the sequel, that no such discovery was in fact wanted, and as a demand of bail in an action of detinue, would have answered every purpose of the restraining order, it is apparent, that the prayer of the bill in these particulars, was only designed to give colour for the jurisdiction of the court. If the appellees have a rightful claim to the property, that claim is founded on a legal title. The legal estate must be in some one. It either abides in the executors of <em>Mr. Carter; </em>or, if by disavowing and declining the trust, as they did from the beginning, they divested themselves of the legal estate in the subject, that was done only by their transfer of the possession, and with it the legal estate, to <em>Mrs. Verminei, </em>during the life of her first husband <em>Bradford; </em>and the possession being thus vested in <em>Bradford, jure mariti, </em>time perfected the right in him, and he had a <em>complete legal title, </em>which yet remains in him or his representatives. And if <em>Bradford </em>held the subject cloathed with the trust created by <em>Mr. Carter\u2019s </em>will, still he held the <em>legal estate </em>in it. The holder of the legal estate (whoever it was) had complete remedy at law by action of detinue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-5\">But <em>Rankin </em>claimed and held adversely- to the legal estate, wheresoever it abided; and the statute of limitations affords him a complete protection against the claim of the appellees. There is no direct proof, that he knew these slaves were a trust subject, or had any notice of the <em>rights </em>of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>so as to charge him with the trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>and thus to deprive him of the protection of the statute. Nor can such notice be fairly inferred from the fact, that ho purchased <em>Mrs. Verminet's </em>life estate in the property; for it is a very common c\u00e1se for a married woman to have a life estate in slaves, not subject to any trust; as, for instance, slaves held as her thirds of a former husband\u2019s estate.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8R\">The property in question is a trust subject: the executors of <em>Mr. Carter </em>did not, and could not, by renouncing the <em>trust, </em>extinguish it: and there is nothing to take this trust, more than any other trust, from the cognizance of a court of equity. If there was any remedy for the <em>cestuis que trust </em>at law, it was an inadequate one; for the property is now not only <em>to be </em>restored <em>to them, </em>hut to <em>be </em>settled and disposed of to their use, according to the intention of the donor; and this a court of law could not do. But there was no remedy at law. When the executor of <em>Mr. Carter </em>assented to the legacy of the slaves in question, and delivered them to <em>Mrs. Bradford, </em>he divested himself of the legal title, as executor: when the trustees renounced the trust, they abandoned <em>their </em>legal title. The regular course would have been to apply to the court to substitute a trustee. As it was, the legal estate was and is wholly unrepresented. <em>Mrs. Bradford, </em>during the life of her first husband, during her widowhood, and after her marriage with <em>Ferminet, </em>held the mere possession; the trust' still subsisting, though a proper trustee was wanting. And if it can be supposed, that by the delivery of the property to <em>Mrs. Ferminet, </em>during the life of her first husband <em>Bradford, </em>the legal estate vested in him, so as to pass at his death to his representatives, it does not appear, that there was ever any personal representative of his estate, and it is almost certain, from the circumstances disclosed, that there was none.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-6\">Then, as to the statute of limitations. If <em>Rankin </em>purchased with notice of the trust, he became himself a trustee, and cannot avail himself of tin: statute. Now, he must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>charged with notice of the trust: he purchased only a quafffied interest in the subject, the life estate of a <em>feme </em>covert, and required her to join her husband in the bill of sale, or rather required her husband to procure her to join in it; and it is not to be imagined, that he did not inquire into, and inform himself of, every circumstance affecting the title. Indeed, tire very fact of a purchase of a qualified interest in such property, infers notice of the nature of the right, and the source from which it was derived to the vendor. Again; the trustees named in <em>Mr. Carter\u2019s </em>will having declined to act, and no trustee having been substituted in their stead, die legal estate was unrepresented: in which regard, the case is analogous to that of a decedent\u2019s estate remaining long unrepresented by any executor or administrator, which has been held to avoid the operation of the statute of limitations. Lastly, <em>Rankin </em>purchased this trust property, when all the beneficiaries were in a state of disability, <em>(Mrs. Verminet </em>under coverture, and all her children infants); and removed it to a distant part of the country, and thus kept them in ignorance of the locality of the properly, without a knowledge of which they could not assert their claim to it: and the case falls within that saving of the statute of limitations, which prevents persons, who by any indirect ways or means, defeat or obstruct actions that lie against, them, from pleading the statute in bar of such actions. 1 Rev. Code, c. 128. \u00a7 14. p. 491.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b175-11\"> He did not sit, because he was related to the appellees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-4\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AcO\">It seems to <em>me, </em>that the case is decidedly against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Several objections to the decree, were taken in the argument. It was first contended, that this was not a fit case for equity. The bill being for a stock of negroes, which in the lapse of twenty years had increased very much, and were much scattered, the plaintiffs averred, that they could not without the aid of a discovery, ascertain the names, sexes and residence, of the slaves, so as to pursue their legal remedy. They also stated, that the defendants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>about carrying them beyond the jurisdiction of the court. If this had been supposed by the defendants colourable merely, they should have pleaded to the jurisdiction of the court. This court has sustained the jurisdiction in several cases of this sort. These allegations certainly saved the bill from a <em>demurrer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">There seems to me, however, a much surer ground for the jurisdiction of equity. The bequest of these slaves, created a <em>trust </em>for the support and maintenance of a <em>feme covert </em>and her infant children: a trust, not to be discharged by a single act of the trustees, hut requiring their care and attention, during the lives of the husband and wife and the survivor. During all this time, the trustees were to apply the profits of the slaves to the support and maintenance of the testator\u2019s daughter, her husband and children 5 and then the slaves with thoir increase were to be divided among the children. To mark his anxiety to keep these negroes not only beyond the controul of the husband but the wife also, the legal title, and the whole management of them, are given to the trustees; and they are to apply the proceeds of their labour, at their discretion, to the support of the <em>cestuis que trust. </em>This appears to me a, case peculiarly proper for the protection and superintendence of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">On the death of the testator, his executor selected the slaves. But the trustees, from tho first, declined to have any concern with them, and they went into the hands of the <em>feme covert, </em>her husband being in <em>Europe. </em>Can it be doubted, that equity would instantly have interfered, if any one as next friend either of the wife or children, had filed a bill, stating the refusal of the trustees to act, and praying the court to set up the trust, and preserve the subject, either by compelling the trustees to act, or by substituting others ? Can there be a subject more appropriate to equity, than to. preserve to the <em>feme covert </em>and her infant children, the bounty of the testator, and cause it to flow in the channel he had marked out for it ? And if equity would have interfered at first, if called on, is not tho call equally imperative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>now ? The trust fund continues; the purposes for which . , the trust was raised continue. Nor, under the will, can the slaves be divided among the children, till the mother\u2019s death. If the names and places of abode of all the slaves and their descendants could be discovered, so as to enable the plaintiffs, in the names of the trustees, to bring actions of detinue, and recover at law, the court of law could go no further. It could not execute the trust, or make one of the arrangements necessary to preserve the property, or appropriate the profits to the purposes intended by the testator. In equity, one suit embraces the whole subject; a decree for the recovery of the slaves; an account for the hires and profits; and, finally, when these points are adjusted, the whole trust fund may be committed to new trustees, with such directions as may ensure the due execution of the testator\u2019s intention, and with leave to the parties interested to apply to tire court, in case any future negligence or abuse of the' trust should render it necessary. There is no force in the objection to the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AhU\">It was next contended, that the statute of limitations was a bar to the recovery. I think not. Of this statute I have heretofore had occasion to declare my opinion. I consider it a wise and salutary law, tending to the security of titles, the discouragement of litigation, the repose of fire community. I shall always be ready to give it a fair and full support : but to a case like this, I can never think that it does or ought to extend.</p>\n<p id=\"AN7\">Courts of equity, not being within the words of tire statute, apply it by analogy. In doing this, they must exercise a sound discretion. The <em>defendant Rankin </em>bought the slaves from <em>Verminet, </em>and bought them for the life of <em>Mrs. Verminet </em>only, as his bill of sale shews. He acknowledges too, in his answer, \u201c that he was informed, <em>at the time </em>of his purchase, that the slaves, were held by the said <em>Verminet, in right of his </em>wife:\" these are his words. Buying, then, with full knowledge, that <em>Verminet </em>had only a <em>partial, qualified interest </em>in the property, and this in <em>right of his </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>wife, </em>he is chargeable with notice of that right, and bought subject to it, whatever it might be. It is hardly possible to believe, that he did not inform himself of the actual state of she property: that were a course which no man of common sense would pursue in such a purchase. The conclusion is proper and necessary, that he did know the true state of <em>Verminet's </em>interest. And on this ground, the law implies notice, and charges him with all the consequences. Can the statute apply to protect such a purchaser, and enable him to bar the very right under which and subject to which he bought ? Can this be called adversary possession ? Does not the trust, which attached to the slaves the moment they were selected by the testator, follow them ? None will deny that it did, while <em>Verminet </em>held; and can a purchaser from him with notice, occupy higher ground ? Nor is this one of those constructive trusts, to which the statute of limitations is applied : <em>there, </em>the party takes possession in his own right and as owner, and is afterwards turned into a trustee, by matter of evidence and construction merely; <em>here, Rankin </em>took possession in subordination to <em>Mrs. Verminet's </em>right, and is as much bound <em>by </em>the trust, and as incapable of protection by the statute, as trustees the most directly and formally appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The removal of the slaves also to a distant part of the state, and the sale of some of them to persons residing at a still greater distance, rendered it difficult, to a woman and children especially, to discover the place of their abode, so as to sue for them sooner; and thus the case of the appellees is brought within the saving of the 14th section of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The chancellor has dismissed the bill as to the purchasers from <em>Rankin, </em>and directed an account to be taken of the values of the slaves sold to them, and of their <em>hires and </em>profits; intending, no doubt, to decree the full amount of their values and profits, at the final hearing. We think, that so much of this order, as directs the account to be taken of the <em>profits </em>of the slaves sold, <em>after </em>the sale of them to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>purchaser's, <em>is </em>wrong; the true mode being to decree the amount for which the property was sold, and <em>interest </em>thereon, from the date of the sale, and <em>profits </em>only <em>before </em>the sales were made. The decree must be corrected in this particular ; but the appellant must pay the costs, the appellees being the parties substantially prevailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The court gives no opinion on the point which the chancellor reserved for future consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The other judges concurred. The decree was corrected .in the particular mentioned by judge <em>Carr, </em>and as to all \u25a0 tilings else affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
