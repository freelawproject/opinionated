Of this sum, 400 dollars were to be paid in cash, 300 were to be secured to be paid on the 1st January 1820, and the other 300 on the 1st January 1821. The 400 dollars were paid accordingly, in cash, by the appellee; and <em>William Foushee </em>and <em>Andrew Stevenson, </em>as his friends, executed their joint notes or bonds to <em>Gibbon, </em>for the two sums of 300 dollars each, payable as aforesaid. But no deed <em>of </em>emancipation was executed by <em>Gibbon. </em>On the contrary, <em>Foushee </em>and <em>Stevenson </em>required, as a security for their indemnification, that <em>Gibbon </em>should convey the slave to them, by bill of sale in due form; which was done accordingly. The intention of the parties, however, was that the slave should be emancipated whenever he should pay to his former master, or to his sureties, <em>the amount of </em>the notes. He was thereupon permitted by <em>Foushee </em>and <em>Stevenson </em>to go at large and act as a freeman, for the purpose of raising the funds necessary for the completion of his right to freedom. It appears, that he paid to <em>Gibbon </em>at different times, in part of the first note, the sum of 166 dollars, which with the 400 paid at the commencement of the transaction, amounted to 566 dollars. He contended, that he also paid to <em>William Foushee </em>other sums, in the confidence that he would pay them over to his former master: but this was denied by <em>Foushee. </em>In January 1821, after both notes had become due, <em>Gibbon </em>insisted on imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>d\u00edate payment; and as the appellee was unable to pay the money, and <em>Foushee </em>and <em>Stevenson </em>were unwilling to advanee it for him, an arrangement was made with <em>Gibbon, </em>by which they re-conveyed the slave to him, in consideration of his delivering up their notes. <em>Gibbon </em>appears to have been still very willing to give freedom to the appellee, provided he could have got the balance of the money. The appellee commenced this suit, in <em>forma pauperis, </em>in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond </em>against <em>Foushee, Stevenson </em>and <em>Gibbon: </em>and that court decreed, that the appellee was free, and entitled to all the immunities of a free man of colour ; and that <em>Foushee </em>and <em>Stevenson </em>should pay to the administrators of <em>Gibbon </em>(who had died pending the suit) the money due on their notes, with interest thereon. From this decree <em>Stevenson </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b85-5\"><em>Leigh </em>for the appellant, and <em>Nicholas </em>assigned counsel for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVU\">submitted the case, without argument.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b85-6\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ABK\">delivered the opinion of the court. In the case of <em>Sawney </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>6 Rand. 173. this court refused, on great consideration, to enforce a promise by a master to emancipate his slave, where the conditions of the promise had been partly complied with by the slave. It is impossible to distinguish that case from this. The court proceeded on the principle, that it is not competent to a court of chancery to enforce a contract between master and slave, even although the contract should be fully complied with on the part of the slave. The decree of the chancellor must be reversed and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
