And we further find that assets more than sufficient <em>to pay the debt, </em>interest and costs came to the hands of the defendant to be administered.\u201d Whereupon the court gave judgment against the defendant, for the debt, interest and costs, to he levied <em>de bonis testatoris. </em>The defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-8\"><em>Allison, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AF8\">objected, that the verdict of the jury was insufficient to sustain the judgment; because it did not find assets in the hands of the administrator, <em>unadministered by him, </em>sufficient to pay the debt; but only that assets enough came to his hands; which might be true, and yet the administrator might have fully and duly administered all the assets.

All the cases decide, substantially, I think, that it must appear from the verdict, that at the institution of the action, there were in the hands of the representative, assets not bound by superiour claims, sufficient to discharge the debt due the plaintiff; or if not sufficient, that the amount of such assets must be found. Here it is found, that assets more than enough to pay the debt came to the defendant\u2019s hands: but whether he had them at the institution of this suit; whether before that he had not properly disbursed them; or whether, if he ' still held them, they were not bound by prior judgments fee. does not appear at all. There is, therefore, all that uncertainly and insufficiency, for which, in the other cases, the verdicts were set aside; and I think this must share the same fate.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">The other judges concurred, and the judgment was reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
