The residue of the tract he devised in the same manner to his other children, describing accurately the courses and distances of each parcel. That at the time of making the will, <em>Magdalena </em>had one daughter named <em>Prudence, </em>born in the year 1744. That she had also a son born about twenty months after the birth of <em>Prudence, </em>who lived only a few days. That <em>Prudence, </em>(who is still living,) did in the year 1769, convey the land in question, by deeds of lease and release, to <em>Jacob </em>Vandevier, the father of the lessor of the plaintiff\u20197</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4B\">The jury find a survey of the entire tract, as wel! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>as of the several parcels given to the respective devisees, with the boundaries of the whole, (except of the part bequeathed to the heirs of Magdalena,) particularly laid off and described, and corresponding with the courses and distances mention :n the will. The parcel devised to the heirs of <em>Magdalena, </em>is laid off in the plat referred to by the jury, in two ways, the one comprehending about thirty acres more than the other. The verdict then proceeds as follows : \u00a3\u00a3 If from the words of the will, the testator\u2019s intention can be legally construed so as to convey unto the heirs begotten on the body of the said <em>Magdalena, </em>the lands contained between the lines and letters <em>s t </em>and <em>K</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>then we find that the part of the land devised to the heirs lawfully begotten on the body of the said <em>Magdalena, </em>and which is the land in the declaration mentioned, is contained within the lines and letters, <em>m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, E, D, C, B, </em>and <em>m. </em>But if from the words of the will, the intention cannot be legally construed so as to convey the lands between the lines and letters <em>s, t, </em>and <em>E, </em>to the heirs begotten on the body of the said <em>Magdalena, </em>then we find that the part of the lands devised to the heirs lawfully begotten of the body of the said <em>Magdalena, </em>then we find that the part of the lands devised to the heirs lawfully begotten of the body of the said <em>Magdalena, </em>(which is in that case the land in the declaration mentioned,) is described in the plat aforesaid by the letters <em>m, </em>n, <em>o, p, q, r, s, E, D, C, B, </em>and <em>\u25a0mf </em>They further find that <em>Jacob Vanderoier, </em>the father of the plaintiff, being seised &amp;c., departed this life, having by his will devised the land in question to his son <em>James, the lessor of the plaintiff.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">To several of his children, he devises, (\u00a3\u00a3 after his wife\u2019s thirds of his moveable estate, and legacies are paid,) an equal proportional child\u2019s part arising therefrom, <em>as well of lands to be disposed of if any there be, </em>as of all things else.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, according to the lines which included the smallest quantity of land, from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Williams, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-8\">The first question is, whether <em>Prudence </em>took any estate at all or not ? 2dly, If she did, then what estate she did take ? 3dly. Whether the verdict be not so defective, as that no judgment can properly be rendered upon it ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-9\">1st. The rule of law is well established, that no person can take by the name of <em>heir </em>during the life of the ancestor, for <em>nemo est lucres viventis. </em>From this general rule, a departure is sometimes permitted, in the case of last wills in favour of intention ; but then the person who is intended to take by that name, must be almost as accurately described, as if he were named. The word heir, unconnected with some other description, is a word of limitation. <em>Cowp. Rep. </em>309. 313. In all the cases which form exceptions from this general rule, there will be found superadded words descriptive of the person intended to take; Thus, in <em>Long </em>v. Beaumont, 1 P. <em>Wms. </em>229, which was a devise to the heirs male of a person then living, there is not only a legacy given to the ancestor, by which the testator takes notice that he is alive, but legacies are also given to his three sons by name, who were of course known by the testator to be then living ; and, in that case it was resolved, that the eldest son should take <em>as heir thus described. </em>So in <em>Burchett </em>v. <em>Durdant, </em>2 <em>Vent. </em>311. The devise was to the heirs male of the body of <em>R. D. then living. </em>But in the case now under consideration, there are no words descriptive of the daughter of <em>Magdalena. </em>The testator takes no notice of her at all, nor does it appear that he knew she was in being ; for she was born only in 1744, the year before the testator\u2019s death. It is also to be observed, throughout the will, that when the testator gives any thing to <em>grandchildren, </em>he mentions them by name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-10\">2dly. If <em>Prudence </em>takes any thing, it cannot be a greater estate than for life, for the devise is to the heirs of the body of <em>Magdalena, </em>without words of limitation superadded, and the reference to the devise to <em>Abraham Vanmeter5s </em>heirs, does not enlarge the es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>\u00edri\u00ede : for the words in that clause are not, (as in this,) to the <em>heirs of </em>Abraham, but <em>to </em>Abraham, <em>and the </em>, <em>heirs of his body. </em>So that there is no such devise in the r\u00ab ill as that to which the reference is made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-3\">If, then; <em>Prudence </em>only took an estate for life, her conveyance, being by <em>lease and, release, </em>amounts to a forfeiture of her estate. I admit, that if this had been a conveyance operating under the Statute of Uses, it would have been otherwise ; but a lease and release like the present, is a Common Law conveyance. The consequence is, that the heir at law was the only person entitled to enter for the forfeiture.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-4\">3dly. It may be very seriously questioned, whether as <em>Jacobus, </em>the lessor of the plaintiff, must recover by deducing a clear title to himself, he can succeed opon this verdict, which finds that the devise from <em>Jacob Vandevier </em>was to his son <em>James.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-5\">As to the conclusion of the jury, it seems too vague for the Court to decide upon, since there is nothing but the will itself from which the intention of the testator can be discovered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-6\">Whether the testator, in describing the parcel of land in question meant to confine, or to extend its limits according to either of the two lines stated in the verdict, is a question which must depend entirely upon evidence. The courses mentioned in the will do, in ao respect, fit either of them, but might have been explained to the satisfaction of the jury, by a variety of circumstances of which they were, as I conceive, the only proper judges.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-7\"><em>Lee, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-8\">In this case, both parties may be considered as appellants. <em>Pendleton </em>complains because a judgment is rendered against him for any thing, and <em>Vandevier </em>contends that he is entitled to a judgment for the whole of the \u00a1and.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-9\">As to the first point, I shall admit the general rule, <em>nemo est hceres viventis. </em>But it is equally clear, that to favour the intention of a testator, the word <em>heir </em>nay be as descriptive of the person to take, as if he w ere particularly named. In this case, it is evident from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the mis-spelling, and from other inaccuracies in the will, that it was written by an illiterate man. The testator was about to divide a large tract of land between his children and grand-children, and intended to describe each parcel by certain metes and bounds. He then <em>gives all the residue of his estate </em>to be divided amongst several of his children, which proves that he did not intend to die intestate as to any part, or to leave any thing to descend to his heir at law. He takes notice that <em>Magdalena </em>is living, and, of course, that she could not have <em>heirs </em>in the legal sense of the word. <em>Prudence </em>is also found to have been born before the will was made, with which it is presumed he was acquainted, though she is not noticed in the will. All these circumstances are as strong as can occur in any case, to shew an intent in the testator to describe <em>Prudence </em>by the words which he used. The case of <em>Doe </em>v. Laming, 2 <em>Burr. </em>1100, was that of a present de-1 vise, unattended by any particular description of the persons meant to take as heirs, other than may be drawn from the manner in which they were directed to take. The case of <em>Brooking </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 <em>Blac. Rep. </em>1010, is a very strong and pointed authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-6\">As to the second point, it is immaterial whether <em>Prudence </em>took an estate for life, or intail, for as she is found to be still living, the conveyance to <em>Jacob Vandevier </em>is sufficient to enable the appellee to recover in this action, and the conveyance does nor produce a forfeiture, as is supposed. If it were necessary to contend that she took an estate of inheritance, the reference to the devise to <em>Abraham Vanmeter </em>might, without violence to the words, be construed to mean \u201c to <em>Abraham Vanmeter </em>and the heirs of his body,\u201d since the devise in that clause is not to <em>the heirs </em>of <em>Abraham Vanmeter, </em>&amp;c., but to \u201c <em>Abraham Vanmeter and the heirs of his bodyP</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-7\">The third objection does not seem to be much relied upon. The jury having found that the devise was to the <em>lessor of the plaintiff, </em>(whose name is <em>Jacobus,) </em>and the devise being to Jacobus, the Court will at once perceive that it is a mistake of the jury, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>will reject the word <em>Jacobus </em>in the verdict as surplusage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-3\">The last objection is, that the jury ought to have found the boundaries of the land in question, and not to have submitted that question to the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-4\">The Court being the proper tribunal to decide upon the construction of deeds and wills, and of the intention of the makers thereof, the jury did right in submitting to them the question respecting the disputed lines, as they depended entirely upon a comparison of the courses and distances mentioned in the will, with those laid down and described in the <em>plat </em>of the land found by the verdict. From that it appears, that the testator intended to parcel out one entire tract amongst thedifferent members of his family, according to certain metes and bounds. There is a perfect correspondence between the will, and the plat, as to every subdivision, except that in question. It is clear therefore, that he meant to devise the whole, and not to leave a remnant of thirty acres in a tract of 1700, undisposed of, which will be the case, if the judgment below be right. Now it is plain, that the testator had the plat found by the jury before him, at the time he was writing his will, and after pursuing the boundaries of this parcel of land to a particular point, by mistake he left out a course, and consequently, if the will be literally pursued, the lines of - the survey could never be made to unite. This would be absurd and repugnant. To effectuate the intention of the testator therefore, the Court will supply the line which was omitted, so as to produce a complete disposition of the whole tract. If then the Court is of opinion that the testator meant to dispose of the whole tract, the judgment below will be reversed, and entered for the whole ; if otherwise, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b519-5\">Washington, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-6\">The rule of law, as a general one, is truly stated by Mr. <em>Williams. </em>The doctrine formerly prevailed in all its rigor, but it has long since been mitigated, and it is now as well settled, as any principle whatever, that <em>heirs </em>in a will may take <em>eo nomine </em>by purchase, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Court be satisfied that such was the intention of the testator. The case of <em>Long </em>v. <em>Beaumont, </em>cited by Mr. <em>Williams, </em>proves it, and is much like the present. In this, as in that case, the heir was living when the will was made, and the testator took notice that the <em>ancestor also xvas living, </em>a circumstance much relied upon in that case. In this case, as in that of <em>Brooking </em>v. <em>White, </em>the testator has made a provision for his heir at law', w'hich proves that he could not intend to leave any thing to descend. But what renders this case still stronger, is, that there was an evident intention to make an equal division of this tract of land amongst the children, and to prevent the possibility of an intestacy as to any part, the <em>residuum </em>of the real estate is disposed of.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-8\"><em>Second </em>point\u2014Independent of the strong argument to be derived from' the reference to the devise to the heirs of <em>Abraham Vanmeter, </em>it is clear that the heirs of <em>Magdalena </em>took an estate tail. It is not true I conceive, that where <em>heirs ox issue </em>take by purchase, they take only an estate for life. If they be described by the former name, they take the absolute property and dominion ; if by the latter, a limited fee. <em>Trevor </em>v. <em>Trevor, </em>1 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>387.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-9\">But suppose only an estate for life passed, still that is sufficient to entitle the lessor of the plaintiff to recover. And in that case, the deed from <em>Prudence </em>to <em>Vandevier </em>could not produce a forfeiture as Mr. <em>Williams, </em>supposes, because the conveyance has its operation under the Statute of Uses. The lease is a deed of <em>bargain and sale, </em>which by the operation of the Statute, vests the possession, so as to enable the lessee to receive a release. The only difference between this mode of conveyance before, and since the Statute is, that in the one case, <em>actual entry </em>by the lessee was necessary for the release to operate upon ; in the other, the bargain and sale passes the use, and the Statute executes the possession, which enables the lessee to receive a release. Now the lease in question is made by a deed of <em>bargain and sale, </em>and recites the intent of it to be, <em>to put the lessee in possession, so as to enable </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>him by virtue of the Statute of Uses to receive a release,</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-3\">Marshall, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-4\">We do not contend, that <em>heirs </em>or <em>issue, </em>so named, are incapable of taking by purchase, but that the general rule as stated by us, and admitted on the other side, is never departed from, but in favor of a clear intention, plainly describing the <em>person </em>who by that name is to take. Is <em>Prudence </em>so described ? There is not a circumstance in the case to prove that she was meant. It does not appear that the testator knew that she existed; for if he had, it is probable he would have named her, in the same manner as he has done others of his grand-children ; and if he knew she was living, then it would seem that he rather meant to exclude her. The description is too vague for the Court to say who was intend ed, and therefore the devise is void for uncertainty. Suppose there had been a son who had lived ;\u2014could the Court say that <em>Prudence </em>should take in exclusion of that son ? Or is it not more probable, that the testator would prefer the male to the female issue ?\u2014-If the case supposed had happened, and the son would have been entitled, then it cannot be said that <em>Prudence was intended to be </em>describedThe argument that no person can be supposed to intend a partial intestacy, if admitted in the latitude contended for, would entirely defeat the general rule, because it would apply in all the cases which have been cited, where, the heir not being properly described, it has been determined, that he could not take as a purchaser. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Laming </em>is not like this case; the devise there is to <em>A. C., </em>and to her heirs <em>male </em>and <em>female </em>equally to be divided, as well those <em>begotten </em>as to be begotten. So that there was no uncertainty who was to take. In this case, it might mean a son, or a daughter. The case of <em>Brooking </em>v. <em>White </em>comes within the exception, as the testator took notice that the ancestor had children living. The devise in question is therefore void, being an <em>immediate one, </em>which could not take effect upon the death of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-5\">As to the nature of the estate given to <em>Prudence, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>(if she be entitled to any thing,) it cannot I conceive exceed an estate for life. I know of no case in which the heir takes by purchase, that he takes a greater estate than for life, unless words of inheritance are engrafted upon the devise, or a strong intention appears to pass a greater estate. As to the reference to the limitations to <em>Abraham Vanmeter\u2019s </em>heirs, the counsel ask too much when they call upon the Court to supply the words \u00a3\u00a3 to <em>Abraham Vanmeter </em>and his heirs,\u201d &amp;c., instead of those actually used by the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXH\">As to the last point, I, think it impossible for the Court to supply a whole course, without a single fact being stated by the jury. The testator may have blundered, but I cannot perceive upon what principle this Court can correct it. It would be to make, not to <em>interpret a will.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> This is a mistake, it should have been E, ns it is apparent from the pfc?.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b522-6\">Lyons J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUu\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The first question made in this cause is, whether the devise to the heirs of the body of <em>Magdalena </em>be void or not. The argument to prove it void is, that no person can be the heir of an ancestor whilst living, and therefore, as such, cannot take. But the Court are of opinion, that the word <em>heir </em>may mean <em>heir ap</em>parenty and that such was the intention in the present case. We are clear, that the testator meant to give the estate to the person <em>who should be the heir apparent of Magdalena at the time of the testator\u2019s </em>death, and that he has used proper words to convey such an intention. If the h\u00e9ir apparent at that period had been a son, he would certainly have taken, but being a daughter, she took as such by purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The second question was, what estate she took <em>? </em>It is unimportant for the Court to decide, whether she took an estate of inheritance, or not, since, as she is found to be still living, her grantee has a title to recover in this action, though she only took an estate for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">But it was contended, that if she took only an estate for life, the deeds of lease and release produced a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>forfeiture for it. We are of opinion that there is nothing in this objection. The conveyance has its operation under the Statute of Uses, and therefore the grantor could pass no greater estate than she might lawfully part with.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The next objection is, that the verdict finds the lands in question to have been devised to James, instead of Jacobus, who is the lessor. This is clearly a mistake in the jury, and ought not to be regarded, since the description of the devise is sufficiently plain when he is called <em>the lessor of the plaintiff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The last point is attended with more difficulty. It respects the boundaries of the land upon the special statements in the verdict. There is some inconsistency in the finding, which might be important, if the Court doubted about the true boundaries of the land intended to be devised. It is evident that the testator had surveyed this land, and marked down by specified boundaries, the part intended for each of the devisees, and that he must have had the plat before him when he made his will. The boundaries of the other devisees are right; when he comes to describe the parcel in question, he begins right and continues so, with little variation in course or distance, till he gets to <em>s; </em>then, by mistake in transcribing the courses from the plat into the will he appears to have overlooked one line, viz. <em>s, t, </em>which creates the difficulty. If it be omitted altogether, none of the subsequent lines are right; if it be supplied from the plat, then they are all right, and the disposition of the whole tract is complete. The Court has no hesitation in saying, that the testator\u2019s intention was to pursue the lines which comprehend the thirty acres not included in the judgment of the District Court, and, therefore, that their judgment, though right as to the plaintiff\u2019s title, is erroneous in not comprehending the land contained within the lines of the survey described by the letters <em>t, E, </em>and to <em>s </em>again.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">But as that error was in favour of the appellant, the costs of this Court ought to be paid by him to the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>pellee as the party prevailing, although the judgment be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-13\">The judgment must, therefore, be reversed and entered for the appellee, for the land contained within the survey taken in this cause, and described by the small letters <em>m, n, o,p, q, r, s, t, </em>and the large letters <em>E, </em>D, <em>C, D, </em>and to little together with his costs in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-14\">Judgment reversed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b524-15\"> <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 55. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Matthews et al. </em>ib. 176. <em>Tuberville v.
