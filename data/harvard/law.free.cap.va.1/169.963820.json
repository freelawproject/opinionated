This citizen having adopted a rule not to put his name on bank paper for any person, but being willing to accommodate the principal, applies to a friend to become bound on the paper, with an assurance that if the principal does not pay it off when it becomes due, he will pay it off for him. Under this assurance, that friend puts his name on the paper as a co-obligor with the other sureties, without their knowledge. And thereupon the paper is discounted by the bank. The principal makes default when the bill becomes due, and soon afterwards the citizen pays it off Held by two judges <em>(Brooke </em>and Stanard) that the citizen is to be considered one of the eight sureties, having become such in the name of his friend, and that he is entitled to contribution from all except that friend: <em>dissentients Cabell, </em>P.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b197-8\">The facts being as above stated, a suit in equity was brought by the nominal surety against the cosureties, one of whom was an absent defendant owning land in the commonwealth. The suit was resisted on the ground that no payment had been made by the plaintiff. Subsequently, by an amendment of the bill, the surety who paid was united in the suit as a coplaintiff In the interval between the commencement of the suit and the amendment of the bill, the absent defendant returned to the commonwealth, and conveyed the land to a purchaser for valuable consideration. Held, no lien is created upon the land in the hands of the purchaser by these proceedings; not by the proceedings in the name of the nominal surety, because, no payment having been made by him, no decree could be rendered in his favour <em>\u2022, </em>and not by the proceedings in the name of the surety who paid, because the conveyance to the purchaser was before those proceedings.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b197-9\">This suit was commenced in the superior court of chancery formerly holden at <em>Clarksburg. </em>The <em>subpoena </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>was issued the 23d of July 1822, returnable to August rules; at which time the bill was filed in the name of <em>William Vause. </em>It set forth, that <em>Jacob Heiskell </em>of <em>Harrison </em>county was indebted to the <em>Nortlmestern </em>bank of <em>Virginia </em>in the sum of 600 dollars, and by the request of <em>Heislcell </em>the following persons, to wit, <em>Jedediah W. Goff, David Newton, John Davisson, Christian Geigley, William Lake junior, Jacob Coplin, Absalom, Robinson </em>and the complainant, became the sureties of <em>Heislcell </em>for the payment of the debt at the end of 60 days, and joined him in executing a joint and several single bill for such payment: that payment not being made by any of the other obligors, and the complainant being called on by the officers of the bank; he, to save his credit, and to save himself from a suit, was forced to pay and did pay to the bank the said sum of 600 dollars, with a further sum of 19 dollars 20 cents for interest chargeable thereon : that <em>Heiskell </em>and <em>Newton are insolvent, </em>and <em>Robinson </em>resides without the commonwealth, and has no moneys, credits or personal property within the same, but is seized of a tract of land in the county of <em>Harrison, </em>which ought to be made liable for his share of the debt. <em>Heiskell </em>and the cosureties with the complainant were made defendants. And the prayer was, that such of them as were able might be compelled to pay their proportions, by dividing the loss arising from the insolvency of the others; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b198-5\">There was no endorsement on the <em>subpoena </em>explaining the object of the suit. Affidavit being made, at August rules 1822, of the nonresidence of <em>Robinson, </em>an order of publication was then entered, requiring him to appear on the first day of the following term ; which order was duly published. And <em>'Robinson </em>failing to appear at October term 1822, an order was then entered, stating that the court would proceed to take such proof in support of the bill as the plaintiff should offer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The other defendants answered the bill. <em>Heislcell </em>admitted that he executed the obligation, and received the amount from the bank; but he did not admit that the complainant paid the debt, and he called for proof thereof. He stated that he <em>(Heislcell) </em>had paid into the bank, on account of the obligation, 400 dollars, for which he ought to have credit. <em>Goff, Geigley, </em>and <em>Coplin </em>admitted the execution of the obligation, and that <em>they were </em>sureties therein, but stated that they did not know whether the same had been paid or not. <em>Newton, Davisson </em>and <em>Lake </em>admitted the execution by them of the obligation, but called for proof that the complainant had paid the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-4\">The obligation was filed as an exhibit with the bill, with an endorsement thereon in these words: \u201cN. W. Bank of Virg\u2019a. Received the amount of the within bond from <em>Noah Zane, Heiskell </em>having failed to pay it. <em>T. Woods </em>cash\u2019r.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-7\">On the 25th of October 1823, leave was given the plaintiff to amend his bill. An amended bill was filed in the names of <em>William Vause </em>and <em>Noah Zane, </em>stating <em>Zane </em>to be admitted a party complainant in the cause, and setting forth, that when the obligation became payable to the bank, <em>Zane, </em>who had agreed with <em>Vause </em>to stand in his shoes and situation in all respects as regarded said obligation, paid the full amount thereof <em>to </em>the bank, so as to prevent a suit thereon. And the complainants prayed that the money might be refunded to them for the benefit of <em>Zane. </em>Whether this amended bill was filed soon after the 25th of October 1823, or not until after the order of the 18th of May 1826, herein after mentioned, did not clearly appear from the transcript of the record sent to the court of appeals. It was copied immediately after the order of the 25th of October 1823. And yet, according to the entry of the 22d of May 1826, it would seem to have been filed at that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ati\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>On the 19th of October 1824, an order was entered, stating, that on the motion <em>of Benjamin </em>Stout, and by consent of parties, he was made a party defendant in the cause. And on the 22d of the same month, on the motion of the plaintiff, he had leave to amend his bill for the purpose of making <em>Stout </em>a party. At February rules 1825, <em>Stout </em>filed his answer, stating, that he had. purchased from <em>Robinson </em>the tract of land in the bill mentioned; that at- the time of his purchase, he had no knowledge of the alleged liability of <em>Robinson, </em>as the surety for <em>Heiskell, </em>to the plaintiff; and that, being a purchaser for valuable consideration, and having paid the purchase money, he conceives he ought not to be disturbed in his purchase. He alleges that <em>HeisJcell </em>procured <em>Zane </em>to make the payment for him, and contends that if the principal debtor, without the knowledge or consent of the sureties, has procured a third person to make payment, such third person cannot, either by an agreement with one surety, or by any other means, charge the other sureties, but the obligation is . as to them extinguished. The fact he states to be, \u201c that the complainant <em>Vause </em>has merely lent his name to the said <em>Zane, </em>in order to prosecute a suit by which \u2022it shall appear that the money was paid by a cosurety; and that any recovery that can be obtained is to be for the exclusive benefit of the said <em>Zane.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\">According to the record sent to the court of appeals, an entry was made on the 18th of May 1826, on motion of the plaintiff, giving him leave to amend his bill by making <em>Zane </em>a party plaintiff; and another entry \u2022was made the 22d of May 1826, of the filing cf such amended bill. By agreement of the parties, the answers previously filed were received as answers to the amended bill; and the following facts were also agreed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">\" <em>Isaac HeisJcell </em>wished to borrow money from the <em>Wheeling </em>bank. Bj the rule of the bank, an indorser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>in <em>Wheeling </em>was required from their borrowers. <em>Heis-Jcell </em>applied to <em>Noah Zane </em>to become such indorser. <em>Zane, </em>having adopted as a rule for his government in relation to the bank, not to become indorser for any person, but being willing to accommodate <em>Heiskell, </em>applied to the plaintiff <em>Vause to </em>become such indorser, with an assurance to the said <em>Vause, </em>that if the said <em>Heiskell </em>did not pay off the said note when it arrived at maturity, he <em>Zane </em>would pay it off for him. Under this assurance by <em>Zane, Vause </em>indorsed the note, and it was discounted by the bank. When the note became due, <em>Heiskell </em>failed to pay it off, and thereupon <em>Zane </em>paid it off. The foregoing arrangements were made without the knowledge or agreement of the other sureties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\">The note mentioned in this agreement of facts was the joint and several single bill before mentioned. Before the application to <em>Zane, </em>it had been executed by <em>Heiskell </em>and seven sureties as co-obligors, payable to the <em>Northwestern </em>bank. <em>Vause </em>became an additional obligor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">The cause coming on to be heard the 25th of October 1828, the chancellor was of opinion that the plaintiff <em>Zane </em>had, by an original arrangement with the plaintiff' <em>Vause, </em>who executed the single bill at his request, bound himself, if <em>Heiskell </em>did not pay off the same, to pay it for him ; and that <em>Zane </em>was invested with all the liability, and all the rights and indemnities, of <em>Vause: </em>and it being admitted that <em>Heiskell </em>was insolvent, and the death of <em>Goff </em>being suggested, the court decreed that the plaintiffs recover of each of the defendants <em>Newton, Davisson, Geigley, Lake, Coplin </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>the sum of 75 dollars with interest from the 21st of March 1822 until payment, and that the defendants pay to the plaintiffs their costs. And there being no personal fund of <em>Robinson </em>within the power or jurisdiction of the court, commissioners were appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to go upon the land mentioned in the bill as the property of <em>Robinson, </em>and now in the tenure of <em>Stout, </em>and value and appraise the same. And the cause was continued, with leave to the plaintiff <em>Zane, </em>in case any one or more of the defendants against whom the decree was rendered should prove to be insolvent, to apply to the court by petition for further contribution against such as should be solvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">The commissioners valued the tract of land, which was said to contain 480 acres, at 7 dollars per acre, making the total value of the tract 3360 dollars. Under the reservation in the decree, <em>Zane </em>filed a petition, setting forth, that executions had issued upon the decree, under which <em>Geigley, Lake </em>and <em>Coplin </em>had taken the oath of insolvency, and <em>Newton </em>and <em>Davisson </em>had been returned no inhabitants of the commonwealth; that previous to the decree, however, the two last named defendants had taken the oath of insolvency in other cases ,* and that <em>Goff </em>had, in his lifetime, taken the oath of insolvency, and died insolvent. The petition therefore prayed a decree against <em>Robinson </em>for one half the amount decreed against the other sureties, and that the land be decreed to be sold for the same. The facts stated in the petition were proved by depositions and exhibits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-5\"><em>Stout </em>filed a petition for a rehearing of the decree, for reasons set forth in a cross bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-6\">By the cross bill, and the evidence in support <em>thereof, </em>it appeared, that there were suits in equity against <em>Robinson </em>as an absent defendant, to subject the land, prior to that of <em>Vause; </em>that <em>Robinson </em>returned to <em>Virginia, </em>and requested <em>Stout </em>to become bis surety, to enable him to appear and defend those suits ; that <em>Stout </em>became such surety, upon <em>Robinson's </em>making a deed of trust on the land to indemnify and save him harmless on account of his suretyship, and also to secure a debt which <em>Robinson </em>owed <em>him; </em>that afterwards <em>Stout </em>agreed to pay the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>creditors of <em>Robinson, </em>other than <em>Vause </em>and <em>Zane; </em>and that <em>Robinson, </em>in consideration thereof, and of the previous debt which he owed <em>Stout, </em>conveyed the land absolutely to <em>Stout. </em>This conveyance bore date the 26th of February 1823, and was admitted to record in the office of <em>Harrison </em>county court on the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\">The cause was farther heard before the circuit court of <em>Harrison </em>county on the 17th of May 1832. The court denied the petition for a rehearing, and decreed against <em>Robinson </em>the further sum asked by <em>Zan\u00e9s </em>petition ; and there being no personal fund in the power of the court belonging to <em>Robinson, </em>and bond with security being filed by the complainant <em>Zane, </em>conditioned according to law, the court thereupon decreed a sale of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\">On the petition of <em>Stout, </em>an appeal was allowed. Among the errors assigned in the petition, were the following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">1. That no privity existing between <em>Zane </em>and the co-sureties, the payment by <em>Zane </em>ought to be regarded as having been made for <em>Heiskell, </em>and his recourse should be against <em>Heiskell </em>alone, and not against the sureties, who were discharged by the payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">2. That the proceedings of <em>Vause </em>created no lien upon the land in favour of <em>Zane, </em>the introduction of whom into the cause placed him upon the same footing merely as if he had then brought an original suit, after a dismission of the one improperly instituted by <em>Vause.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-9\"><em>G. N. Johnson </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATbb\">Neither <em>Zane </em>nor <em>Vause </em>became a party to the obligation at the same time with the other sureties. <em>Zane's </em>not putting his name on the bill is proof that he did not mean to be bound with the others. And though <em>Vause </em>put his name on the paper, it was not at the same time with the others, but subsequently, at the instance of <em>Heiskell, </em>and upon the agreement of <em>Zane </em>to indemnify. This being the nature of the contract, it might be maintained with great reason, even if <em>Vause </em>had paid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number><em>debt, </em>that he had no right to call on the other sureties. For the claim to contribution depends on a eon-tract, express or implied, to share equally the burthen. And it is not perceived how such contract could be implied here, when there was no privity whatever between <em>Vause </em>and the others. But the case is much stronger. <em>Zane </em>claims to be substituted in the place of <em>Vause, </em>who has made no payment, and has no right of contribution <em>to </em>which <em>Zane can be </em>substituted. The principle of <em>Hopewell &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Bank of Cumberland, </em>10 Leigh 206. is therefore applicable. Nor can <em>Zane </em>make out his case independently of the doctrine of substitution. . If he claims in his own right, he does not shew equality with the other sureties in the time or in any of <em>the </em>circumstances of the suretyship. He is not therefore upon the same footing with them, and upon the principle of <em>Givens &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Nelson\u2019s ex\u2019or &amp; al. </em>10 Leigh 383. and <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Fagg, </em>8 Leigh 588. cannot claim contribution from them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-5\">II. The original bill, and all the proceedings before <em>Zane </em>became a party, amounted to nothing. They were by a person who had no right. <em>Stout\u2019s </em>title was therefore acquired before there was any valid lien upon the land, and must be held good.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b204-6\"><em>George H. Lee </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABN\">The rights of <em>Zane </em>arise out of the original contract. The agreement was not that <em>Zane </em>should stand between <em>HeisJcell </em>and dishonour, but between <em>Vause </em>and dishonour. <em>Zane\u2019s </em>agreement was to pay the money for <em>Vause. </em>Though there is no decision of this court exactly in point, the opinion of <em>Carr, </em>J. in <em>Enders &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Brune, </em>4 Rand. 438. maybe referred to for the equitable principles which govern in such cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-7\">II. The suit might have been maintained in the name of <em>Vause, </em>without making <em>Zane </em>a party. And if in such suit there had been a decree, <em>Zane </em>could not have maintained a suit afterwards for the same money. There was such privity between <em>Vause. </em>and <em>Zane, </em>that <em>Zane </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>would have been </em>bound although not a party. If this be so, it is an answer to the second point. And if it be not so, the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>does not require that every person who appears to be a necessary party should have been before the court at the time of suit brought. On the contrary the doctrine is, that a purchaser is bound by the decree which may be made in the suit, whether the proceedings be regular or irregular. And <em>though it </em>may be necessary to amend the bill and suggest new matter, the <em>lis pendens </em>is not brought down to the time of the amendment. <em>Walker v. Smalwood, 2 </em>Amb. 676. <em>Murray &amp;c. v. Ballou &amp;c. </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 566. <em>Bishop of Winchester </em>v. Paine, 11 Ves. 194. <em>Style </em>v. <em>Martin, 1 </em>Ch. Ca. 150. <em>Garth v. Ward, 2 </em>Atk. 174. <em>Sorrell </em>v. <em>Carpenter, 2 </em>P. Wms. 482. The only modification of the principle is where there is great and unnecessary delay. In the present case, the application for leave to amend was not resisted, but the bill was filed without objection, and asserted a claim for the same money that was sought to be recovered by the original bill.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-6\"><em>Price, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1Q\">Though the name of <em>Vause </em>was used, <em>Zane </em>was the real surety. After <em>Zane </em>paid, if a motion had been made in the name of <em>Vause </em>for the money so paid, though <em>Vause </em>had been unwulling, a court of law would have compelled him to let his name be used. But here we are in a court of equity. And this court will surely regard <em>Zane </em>as the real surety, having the right to call on his cosureties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-7\">II. The proposition seems clear, that when a suit is once instituted, a purchaser of the subject in controversy is bound by all the consequences of the suit. And the introduction of a new party cannot prevent its having this effect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-9\"><em>C. Johnson </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYo\">The rights of cosureties against each other are rights of indemnity; and when one claims contribution as a cosurety, he must shew that he is such, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>and has paid. The sureties need not be bound by the . ... same agreement, or at the same time; but it must in some way be ascertained that they are cosureties. Here it does not appear that there was any privity of contract. It does not appear that any of the sureties except <em>Vause </em>knew what <em>Zane </em>was doing, or that <em>Zane </em>knew what any of them except <em>Vause </em>was doing. <em>Zane </em>did not agree to be surety, but to indemnify a man who would become surety. <em>He never said to Robinson </em>that he would indemnify him if he had to pay more than his share. A cosurety can claim indemnity upon no ground except that the principal is unable to pay. If <em>Vause </em>had paid the money, he could not have proceeded against <em>Robinson </em>until he ascertained that <em>Zane </em>was unable to pay. Suppose that after the bill was executed, the agreement had been made to indemnify, and <em>Zane </em>had then deposited money in bank, which was used, when the bill became payable, <em>to </em>take it up; <em>could Zane </em>have had contribution ? If he could not, what difference is there between a prior and a subsequent agreement; between an agreement without, and an agreement with a deposit? When a bill of exchange is taken up, for the credit of the acceptor, by another, that other has no claim against any one but the acceptor. And here, if <em>Zane </em>had paid at maturity, the payment must have enured to the benefit of all the sureties. Every indemnity given to one surety enures to <em>the beneGt of all. And </em>this principle applies, whether the indemnity proceeds from the principal debtor or from a third person. All must be common sufferers. One must not be under guise and free from danger, while there is risk upon all the others'. And the contract must be one of equality. A party who could not have been subjected as cosurety, can have no right to recover as such. Here there were no means of resorting to <em>Zane. </em>If <em>Vause </em>had become insolvent before payment, a cosurety could not have obtained indemnity either from him or <em>Zane.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>II. What is Stout to be charged with notice of, uponthe doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>? It must be of that which appeared in the cause that was pending; to wit, that <em>Vause </em>claimed as creditor, and had attached to satisfy that claim. And if <em>Vause </em>had turned out to be creditor, the purchaser would have been subordinate to his claim. For the title which the purchaser gets is subject to such claim as the plaintiff has asserted against his vendor, provided a decree be rendered for the claim in that suit. But here no decree has been rendered for the claim asserted by <em>Vause. </em>If the suit had been proceeded in upon his bill, he could not have shewn that he was the creditor of Robinson, and his bill must have been dismissed with costs. It was error to permit <em>Zane </em>to be united with <em>Vause, </em>for the purpose of shewing that <em>Vause </em>had not title, and that <em>Zane </em>had. The case of <em>Sorrell </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>cited on the other side, shews that the court ought to have refused leave to the plaintiff to amend his bill for any such purpose. At all events the claim must be regarded as a new claim of <em>Zane, </em>not asserted until the amended bill was filed. And the case of <em>French </em>v. <em>Loyal Company, </em>5 Leigh 627. shews that the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>is confined to one who purchases, from a party to the suit, a right which the plaintiff has asserted in his bill, and which is successfully prosecuted by him in that suit. Here the purchase by <em>Stout </em>cannot be considered as made pending the suit of <em>Zane. </em>Moreover, at the time <em>Zane </em>commenced his proceedings, <em>Robinson </em>could not have been proceeded against as an absent debtor; and the amended bill alleges no facts to shew that- he was liable then to be proceeded against as such. The doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>has in truth nothing to do with the case. It rests upon the foreign attachment law, under which the creditor suing out the attachment, and claiming a lien by it, must shew himself to be a creditor. A plaintiff who has attached for <em>\u00a3 </em>100. would not be allowed to amend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>his bill and make his case an attachment for <em>\u00a3 </em>1000. to . . . _ the prejudice of an intervening purchaser; surely not, u, at the time of the amendment, no new attachment could be commenced.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\"> They had each of them been counsel for the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b208-7\">Stanard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWd\">The first question to be solved in this case is, does the record shew any valid claim in any one to subject the defendants, seven of the sureties of <em>Isaac Heiskell </em>in the bill discounted at bank, to contribution for the payment made (on the default of the principal) to take up that bill? This depends on the enquiry, whether the bill was taken up by a surety under circumstances to authorize the sureties against whom the claim of contribution is preferred, to make the payment subservient to their indemnity, in exoneration of the duty to contribute; or under circumstances to leave them subject to that duty. If the obligation of surety-ship, by virtue of which the payment was made, be not, in its substance and nature, that of one of several original sureties, then, according to the circumstances under which the obligation may have been incurred, the original sureties may be exempt from the duty of contribution altogether, and the new surety, on the other hand, be liable to indemnify <em>them; </em>or they may be bound <em>to </em>make full indemnity to such new surety paying the debt. Thus if the creditor, in the pursuit of his remedy against the principal debtor, obtains an additional security, as bail on the writ, or surety in the forthcoming or prison bounds bond, and such bail or surety pays the debt, he has no claim to contribution against the original sureties, and those sureties have the right, if they pay, to enforce his obligation for their indemnity. Examples of the application of this principle are furnished by the cases of <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, 2 </em>Vern. 608. and <em>Givens &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Nelson\u2019s ex\u2019or &amp; al. </em>10 Leigh 382. and many others that might be cited. If, on the contrary, the case be that of a creditor who, having the obligation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>of the principal debtor and sureties, and desiring additional security, obtains the undertaking of a third party to pay the debt if the obligors do not, the discharge of the debt by this third party, under the obligation of this undertaking, entitles him to full indemnity from the sureties in the original obligation. If the suretyship be substantially and in its nature that of one of several original sureties, on the payment under its obligation, the duty of contribution attaches to the other sureties. Was the payment in this case made by a party whose obligation was of this nature <em>}</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">Coupled with the facts agreed by the parties, the following are shewn by the record. Before the application of <em>Heiskell </em>to <em>Zane, </em>he and the seven sureties (defendants) had made their single bill payable to the <em>Northwestern </em>bank. This bill he proposed to discount at the bank, for which purpose it was necessary that he should have an \u201c endorser\u201d (that is, a surety in the bill) living in <em>Wheeling: </em>and accordingly, under the arrangement made with <em>Zane, Vause </em>became a cosurety.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">The rights and obligations of the parties depend on the facts so agreed and shewn. It is contended by the appellant that the just conclusion from them is, that <em>Zane </em>undertook to pay the money for <em>Heiskell </em>if he failed, that is, to assume the obligation of <em>Heiskell </em>on his failure, and by performing for him, to relieve and save harmless the surety <em>Vause; </em>and that such obligation, or at least the performance of it, enured to the benefit of all the sureties. It seems to me that this conclusion does not result from the facts, and is manifestly at war with any intention that can be rationally ascribed to <em>Zane </em>or <em>Vause, </em>the parties to the arrangement from which the conclusion is deduced. All that was asked of <em>Zane </em>was to become one of eight sureties. All that he was willing or intended to do was to incur such responsibility. This being most manifest, if not uncontested, the arrangement with <em>Vause </em>was but a substitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>lion of <em>Vause\u2019s </em>responsibility for that which <em>Zane </em>was willing to incur, and as between <em>Zane </em>and Vause, made <em>Zane </em>liable for that suretyship which to the bank and the cosureties had been incurred by <em>Vause. </em>As between these parties, it was a suretyship of <em>Zane </em>in the name of <em>Vause. </em>The conclusion which converts the intended responsibility of <em>Zane, </em>from that of one of eight sureties, into one of indemnity to all the sureties for the whole debt, is drawn from a technical or rather a literal adherence to the terms in which the arrangement between <em>Vause </em>and <em>Zane </em>is slated in the agreed facts. That written statement should be expounded in reference to the ascertained intent and object of the parties to it, and the occasion that caused it. <em>Vause </em>had no possible motive to obtain from <em>Zane </em>an engagement that would enure to the indemnity of the other sureties, and <em>Zane </em>clearly did not intend <em>to </em>make such a one ; and a construction of the terms of the arrangement deducing an engagement which the one did not seek, and the other neither <em>intended nor </em>was even asked <em>to </em>incur, is, in my estimation, hostile to the clearest principles of justice and of law. For this construction there is no colour, unless the letter of that part of the agreed facts which professes to state the engagement of <em>Zane </em>to <em>Vause, </em>be insulated from the considerations that led to it, and then interpreted without regard to its object and the intent of the parties. The engagement so extracted from the statement of facts is the assurance of <em>Zane </em>to <em>Vause, </em>when he became endorser (or cosurety), \u201c that if <em>Heiskell </em>did not pay off the note when it arrived at maturity, he <em>Zane </em>would pay it off for him.\u201d Detached from the circumstances which led to the assurance, and from the position of the parties, such an engagement might justly involve the responsibility which the argument of the appellant has ascribed to it. Had <em>Vause </em>been one of many sureties to an existing obligation of <em>Heiskell, </em>seeking indemnity from his principal, and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number><em>HeisJcett </em>given the indemnity, either by a lien on pro- . , i*. i perty, or in such an engagement o\u00ed a third person, the indemnity in either form, certainly in the first, might enure to the benefit of all the sureties. But such is not the case in question. Adhering to the letter of the extracted engagement, it is argued that <em>Zane </em>engaged to pay the note for <em>Heiskdl. </em>But how pay it ? as the substitute of <em>Heiskdl? </em>or in place of <em>Vause? </em>It is the one or the other, according to the intent and object of the parties <em>Zane </em>and <em>Vause. </em>Had <em>Zane </em>not procured <em>Vause </em>to be the surety, and made no engagement with him, then, on the default of <em>Heiskdl, Vause </em>would have been bound to pay the note; and if he paid it, he would pay for <em>Heiskdl, </em>and such payment would subject the other sureties to the duty of contribution. <em>Vause </em>was the surety substituted for <em>Zane, </em>with the engagement of <em>Zane </em>to discharge the obligation <em>Vause </em>had incurred at his instance. The stipulation to pay for <em>Heiskdl </em>cannot be interpreted so as to place <em>Zane </em>in the position of <em>Heiskdl </em>the principal, with his obligations. According to the just interpretation, <em>Zane </em>stipulated to pay for <em>Heiskdl </em>as <em>Vause </em>had bound himself to pay for <em>Heiskdl, </em>that is, as one of eight sureties ; and the payment made in pursuance of that engagement, by necessary intendment, would be in discharge of the obligation that <em>Vatise </em>had assumed for him. The payment was the fruit of the obligation of one of eight sureties (ail bound in the same obligation), and being made under an engagement which cast on the person making it the duty of one of eight sureties, has thereby imparted to it the quality of a payment by one surety in discharge of the obligation of all; and the duty of contribution from those who did not pay, is its legal and equitable offspring.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The seven sureties defendants, then, were liable to the claim for contribution for the payment made in discharge of the bill, and this suit was brought to enforce that liability. It was brought in the name of <em>Vause, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>and was resisted on the ground that the payment was not made by <em>Vause. </em>Subsequently, <em>Zane </em>was united in the suit as a coplaintiff; and having ascertained that the defendant sureties were liable to contribute, the difficulty in the way of a decree on that liability was removed, as it could certainly be enforced in the name of <em>Vause </em>or <em>Zane.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">But the material question in this case is, what is the effect of the <em>Us pendens </em>? or rather, what is the time to which it ought to relate ? the liability of the land in the hands of the appellant as purchaser, depending on the date from which the <em>lis pendens </em>takes effect. If the suit can be supported in the name of <em>Vause </em>alone, then there was an effectual <em>lis pendens </em>before <em>Stout </em>purchased, and his title as purchaser is overreached. <em>Zane </em>became a coplaintiff long after the purchase of <em>Stout: </em>and if the claim to contribution could be asserted by and in the name of <em>Zane </em>only, then it is argued with great force, that <em>the </em>suit in the name of <em>Vause </em>was nugatory as a <em>Us pendens, </em>as no decree could <em>be </em>rendered in that suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">.That a suit could not be sustained in the name of Vause for <em>Vausds </em>benefit, I have no doubt. The beneficial-interest in the claim for contribution was in <em>Zane. </em>It is only by regarding the suit in the name of <em>Vause </em>as one brought for <em>Zand\u2019s </em>benefit, that title can be shewn to a decree in that suit. Could the suit be brought for <em>Zane </em>in the name of <em>Vause, </em>and was it so brought ? My first impression was very strong in favour of a negative answer to the first branch of this enquiry. The general rule of the court of equity requires the person having the beneficial interest to be a party, and, if the recovery of that interest be sought, a party plaintiff asserting that right, and asking a decree to enforce it: and unless he be such party, the rule forbids a decree in respect to such interest. There were views of this case presented in the conference with one of my brethren, and in the course of my own reflections on it, that weakened this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>first impression, and furnished at least plausible reasons to extricate the case from the operation of the general rule. But the first impression has not been removed, and I conclude that <em>Zane </em>was a necessary party plaintiff; and if so, there was no <em>lis pendens </em>in respect to the only party interested in its operation, until he became a coplaintiff. I adopt this conclusion with the less hesitation in this case, because, had I reached a different one, a difficulty in sustaining the suit in the name of <em>Vause </em>would still be presented by the second branch of the enquiry, to wit, was the suit in the name of <em>Vause </em>so brought by <em>Zane </em>for his benefit? The accession of <em>Zane </em>to the suit as a coplaintiff, long after <em>Stout </em>had been admitted a defendant, and had resisted the claim in the name of <em>Vause, </em>and claimed protection as a purchaser for value, is the only ground for the implication that the suit in the name of <em>Vause </em>was instituted by <em>Zane </em>for his benefit. The propriety of an implication having so large an effect on the interest of the parties, is at least most doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">On the whole, I am of opinion that the decrees in this case, so far as they subjected the sureties to contribution, and required the defendant <em>Robinson </em>to contribute in respect to the insolvent sureties, are right; but that the same are erroneous so far as they charged the land in the hands of the appellant (who purchased it before there was a claim asserted by a party entitled to a decree, and consequently before there was an effectual <em>Us pen-dens) </em>with the amount decreed to be paid by <em>Robinson; </em>and that the bill, as to <em>Stout </em>the purchaser, ought to have been dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b213-4\">Cabell, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AN0\">held, not only that the proceedings created no lien upon the land in the hands of the purchaser, but also that <em>Zane </em>had no right to contribution. He was of opinion that the decree should be reversed and the bills dismissed <em>in tolo. </em>But</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"ATlT\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A0g\">concurring with Standrd, J. the decree of the court of appeals declared, that the decree of the court below, so far as it subjects the land claimed by the appellant to the amount decreed to be paid by <em>Robinson </em>to <em>Vause </em>and <em>Zam, </em>be reversed and annulled; that the bills of <em>Vause </em>and <em>Vause Sf Zane </em>be dismissed as to the appellant; that the appellant recover his costs expended, as well in his defence in the court below, as in the prosecution of his appeal here; and that, in all other respects, the decree of the court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
