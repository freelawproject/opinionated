Creel, </em>the declaration contained two counts, of which one was in case for a <em>tort, </em>and the other in <em>assumpsit. </em>The defendant demurred generally to the declaration, in which demurrer the plaintiff joined; and issues in fact were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>also joined, upon the plea of <em>not guilty </em>to one count, and <em>non assumpsit </em>to the other. On the issues in fact, a verdiet was found for the plaintiff; and then a motion for a new trial being made and overruled, it was considered by the court that the plaintiff recover against the defendant the damages assessed by the jury, and the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-4\">On the petition of the defendant, a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-5\"><em>Fisher, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-6\"><em>William A.

Though, according to the decision of this court in the cases of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Dulany, </em>2 Munf. 518. and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>5 Munf. 7. it was irregular to try the issue of fact before judgment on the demurrer, yet if it appeared that the demurrer ought to have been overruled, and so no inconvenience had ensued from that irregularity, it would not be sufficient cause to reverse the judgment. But as it appears to this court, that by reason of the misjoinder of action, (one of the counts in the declaration being in case as for a <em>tort, </em>and the other in <em>assumpsit) </em>the demurrer ought to have been sustained ; and as the plaintiff might (had the right judgment on the demurrer in the court below preceded the trial of the issue) have cured the defect in the declaration by amendment, and from that benefit the irregularity of first trying the issue in fact would have precluded him, the objection founded on this irre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>gularity becomes substantial, and ought to prevail, so far as to entitle him to have the cause placed in the court below in the position it would have occupied had the irregularity not occurred. The court is therefore of opinion that the judgment be reversed with costs, the verdict set aside, and a new trial of the issue in fact awarded <em>; </em>and that the cause be remanded to the circuit superior court, that it may proceed to judgment on the demurrer, unless the plaintiff\u2019 should, on leave obtained in that court, amend his declaration <em>; </em>and if the declaration be amended, for such further proceedings as may be proper on the present pleadings, and such other pleadings as may be offered by either party and admitted by the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
