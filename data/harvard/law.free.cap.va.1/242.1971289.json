The preamble to that law, as well as the enacting clause, is literally confined to the sale of goods by retail, and was intended to provide a species of evidence unknown to the common law 5 by which, retail merchants were permitted to prove their store accounts by their own oath. This law, not only opened a door, to perjuries, and to infinite frauds, but tended to encourage extensive credits, from the facility of establishing such demands. T\u2019 0 repeal this law, and to do away its effects as to extensive credits, was obviously the design of the Act of 1779. The preamble recites, that the method of proving book debts, and the extensive credits formerly given by merchants and traders, had been found injurious to this Commonwealth ; the law then proceeds to repeal the law of 1748, and to enact, \u201cthat all actions founded upon account for goods sold and delivered, or for any articles charged in any store account, shall be commenced within six months after the cause of action accrued, and not after\u201d. The mischief stated in the preamble, existed only in the retail business, which, almost entirely formed the internal commerce of this country, before the war, and of course, must have been alluded to by the Legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-6\">The law requires each item in the account to be truly dated, which is an additional proof that the retail trade was alone contemplated.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-7\"><em>Warden, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-8\">When a law is expressed, as this is, in general terms, reasons for forming constructive exceptions from it, ought to be so strong, as to leave nothing to conjecture\u2014whenever we quit the plain expressions of a law, to wander at large in the wide field of construction, we should be sure that the guides we take will not mislead us.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aiz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The Legislature had two motives for passing the \u00a1aw of 1779\u2014the one, to repeal the Act of 1748, because it warranted an unsafe species of evidence\u2014the other, to prevent extensive credits, as an evil independent, of, and not growing out of the Act of 1748\u2014'for if it had necessarily resulted from that law, it must have expired with the law, and need not have been stated as a primary mischief, intended to be cured. If it had been considered merely as a consequence, it was highly absurd to entitle the law, \u201c an Act discouraging extensive credits, <em>and </em>repealing the law prescribing the method of proving book debts.\u201d The second clause of the Act creates a bar against all actions founded upon account for goods sold and delivered, <em>or </em>for any articles charged in any store account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-9\">Now, is this an action for goods sold and delivered, or not ? If the law only meant store accounts, why is the former part of this clause inserted ? the latter would have answered the purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-10\">If it were politic to prevent extensive credits in the confined sales of a retail store, the reason applies a <em>fortiori </em>to extensive wholesale negotiations; if it were wise to prevent it, when transacted in a house by <em>pri - vate </em>bargain, was it not equally so, if sold upon &amp; wharf at <em>public auction f</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b264-11\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AcD\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">In discussing the case, of <em>Beale </em>v. Edmundson, it was agreed, by the unanimous opinion of a full Court, that the Act of 1779, applied only to the store accounts of retail dealers; and we should feel ourselves bound by that opinion, unless it were over-ruled by as full a Court, even if our sentiments at this time, respecting the principle then established, were different from what they then were. But the present Court retain the same opinion upon the subject; and must therefore pronounce the law to be in favour of the plaintiffs, upon the special conclusion of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">Judgment reversed, and to be entered for the plaintiff</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
