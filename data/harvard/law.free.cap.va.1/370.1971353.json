The next day the grandfather and father agreed to exchange the above negro for another, which was duly carried into execution.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b390-18\">Bill by the children to set up the'first deed, which was lost, and for a decree for the negro named in it, dismissed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b390-19\">If the owner of an equitable title stand by, and suffer another to purchase without disclosing his title, he is guilty of a fraud sufficient to defeat his claim. But a legal claim cannot be so lost even in favor of a purchaser, and it is doubtful if even an equitable claim can be so lost, in the case of a mere <em>voluntary </em>conveyance.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>This was an appeal from a decree of the High Court of Chancery, reversing a decree of the County Court, in favor of the appellants, who were plaintiffs' in the suit. The bill states a marriage agreement between <em>Thomas </em>Applebury, father of the plaintiffs, and <em>James </em>Anthony, their grandfather, by which the grandfather promised to give to the said <em>Applebury </em>a slave named Lucy, in marriage with his daughter, the mother of the plaintiffs. That the marriage took effect, and the grandfather refusing to deliver the slave, the father brought a suit lo recover her. That the suit was referred to arbitration, when the grandfather, finding it would be decided against him, proposed to convey the slave to all the children of his daughter, begotten, orto be begotten \u00ed; with which proposition <em>Applebury </em>closed, and dismissed his suit.\u2014That in May, 1769, the grandfather executed a deed for the slave, according to the terms of the compromise, which deed is lost or mislaid. That the grandfather died in 1784, and that the defendants are his executors, and refuse to deliver <em>Lucy </em>and her children 5 and to compel them to do so is the prayer of the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-3\">The answer admits the marriage contract; the suit and reference th\u00e9reupon; that <em>Lucy </em>was determined to be the property of <em>Applebury, </em>and she was soon afterwards delivered into his possession. That upon an application made by the grandfather to <em>Applebury, </em>the latter agreed to exchange <em>Lucy </em>and her children for a slave called Dinah, and two notes of hand for 60/. which were delivered, and <em>Lucy </em>was retained by the grandfather; that a receipt, expressing this exchange, was signed by <em>Applebury </em>in <em>May, </em>1769. It admits a deed from the grandfather to <em>Applebury, </em>for <em>Lucy, </em>which was put into the hands of a third person, and which was, after the exchange, delivered to the defendants by an order from <em>Applebury.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-4\">The deed of the grandfather, dated in <em>May, </em>1769, to the <em>children </em>of <em>Applebury, </em>is proved by a deposition, and that it was delivered to a third person to be recorded. The answer is fully supported by the testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>Copland, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-8\">The <em>children </em>of <em>Applebury </em>taking a legal estate under the deed, as purchasers, not under their father, but under <em>James Anthony </em>the grandfather, the father had no right to sell, exchange, or in any manner to defeat that right. They stand upon the same ground as all other persons who apply to a Court of Equity to set up deeds lost, or destroyed, by accident or fraud; and the deed in question having been destroyed by the testator of the defendants, this Court will establish it, without regarding the unauthorised interference of the father.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-9\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-10\">The <em>equitable </em>right to these slaves was originally in the father himself; and the subsequent conveyance to the <em>children </em>being without consideration,they are merely volunteers against the representatives of <em>James Anthony, </em>whose testator was a purchaser, for valuable consideration, of the father\u2019s original equitable title.\u2014So that this is not the case of a contest between volunteers, but that of a volunteer asking the aid of this Court, against a purchaser for valuable consideration; in which case, I conceive, a Court of Equity will not interfere. The only deposition in the cause is that of the father, who says, that he considered himself entitled to dispose of the negro mentioned in the deed, which leaves a strong presumption that the deed was delivered as an escrow.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-11\"><em>Copland, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az\">I do not rely upon the deposition, because the answer admits the conveyance. As to the main point, there can be no good reason, why this Court should not set up a deed destroyed by the party who gave it, because he had purchased the property from a person, who he knew had no right to dispose of it. Such a bargain could not bind the present plaintiffs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b392-12\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AZI\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">This being an application to a Court of Equity, to restore a lost deed to its legal validity, it becomes important to consider whether the deed, if restored, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>any legal force. It is the deed of the grandfather, for slaves, to which he had, at the time, no title. For upon the state of the case, the title appears to have been in Applebury, the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">But it is said, that this deed was made with the consent and privity of Applebury, and therefore ought to bind him : to this there are two answers, 1st. It is admitted, that if a man has an equitable title only, and stands by, and suffers another to purchase without disclosing his title, he is guilty of a fraud, which shall defeat him of his equitable claim. But it is supposed, that a legal claim could not be so lost, even in favor of a purchaser; and it is doubted, if even an equitable claim would be destroyed by that circumstance, in the case of a mere voluntary conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">But 2dly. Suppose the children had this equity against their father, it is but an equity, which may be opposed by circumstances of superior equity on the other side, especially on behalf of the grandfather, who was a fair purchaser, and had his deed delivered to him without the same having been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The whole transaction was fair. The grandfather, who was bound to give <em>Lucy </em>to Applebury, conveyed her to his children, with his consent and approbation. The next day an agreement was made between the same parties, to substitute a valuable consideration for Lucy, and this, not with any fraudulent view, but upon the laudable motive of. gratifying the wishes of the slave. The consideration was paid ; <em>Lucy </em>re-delivered; and the deed restored to the grandfather. And now, the grand-children are endeavouring to set up this voluntary deed, made .upon a contract between their father and grandfather, who agreed without any fraudulent intention to change the contract, and to cancel the deed, whilst it was in their power to do so, (it not being recorded,) notwithstanding their father\u2019s estate was thereby augmented, in consequence of the consideration paid for <em>Lucy. </em>So that they have a chance at least, of receiving an equivalent, if they should get <em>Dinah </em>and the two other slaves purchased with the <em>601.f </em>which the father may give them in lieu <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>of <em>Lucy. </em>The grandfather has already paid Applebu<em>ry, </em>his wife\u2019s fortune; and if the plaintiffs were to succeed in this suit, they would compel the grandfather to pay it over again.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Upon the whole, the plaintiffs have neither law nor equity in their favor. The defendant <em>Anthony </em>has both, and the decree of the <em>Chancellor </em>is right. But it may be necessary to distinguish this case from that of <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Webber et. ux. (ante </em>p. 274,) where a voluntary conveyance by a father to a child, being cancelled by the father, was restored to its legal validity :\u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">1st. In that case, the father was' proprietor of the estate, and had a power to convey. In this, the grandfather had no title, and this original defect was to be supplied in equity by the consent of the father, and so liable to be opposed by superior equit}\\</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">2dly. In that case, the deed was delivered into the daughter\u2019s keeping, who was of full age, and was privately cancelled by the father, without her consent; in this, the children, if they were in being, had no hand in the transaction, nor had they even the deed. The father who consented to accept it, relinquished it the nest day, and gave it up to the donor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">3dly. The defendant in that case, was a mere volunteer-; here he is a fair purchaser for a valuable consideration, so that the cases are wholy dissimilar, and the decrees perfectly reconcileable.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">Decree affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b394-14\"> <em>Taylor v.
