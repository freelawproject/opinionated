Held, the evidence had a connexion, though very slight, with the matter in controversy, and though it might have been of very little weight, it was not error to permit it to go to the jury as a link in the chain of circumstances.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b295-9\">A second bill of exceptions stated that the defendants asked a witness, whether he was present at a settlement made between <em>S.

The plaintiffs objected to the question, on the ground that the acts and declarations of the defendants could not be given in evidence for them, and the court sustained the objection.

Heed, the evidence was properly admissible to prove that the plaintiffs intended to sell to, and S. intended to purchase for, a partnership, but was no proof against <em>B. </em>and <em>C. </em>that they were the partners. That evidence, however, was not regularly admissible, even for this limited purpose, until the plaintiffs had offered evidence tending to shew that there was a partnership between $. <em>B. </em>and <em>C. </em>which authorized \u00a1S. to purchase on the credit of the three.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b296-5\">A fourth bill of exceptions stated, that the court was asked by the defendants to give the jury the following instructions : 1.

If the jury shall believe from the evidence, that the election by <em>B. </em>and <em>C. </em>under the contract with <em>S. </em>of June 1832, was made in September thereafter, and was to take the 20 <em>per cent., </em>and that the same was previous to-the purchase of goods by (Si. of the plaintiffs, and that the plaintiffs at the time of giving the credit to <em>8. </em>did not know of the said contract made in June 1832, then they ought to find for the defendants.

But if the court not only declines to give the instruction asked, hut proceeds to give another in lieu thereof, the inference is a reasonable one, that there was evidence tending to prove the case supposed, and the appellate court will not only enquire whether the law is correctly expounded in the instruction given, but will also enquire whether it is correctly stated in the instruction asked.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-7\"><em>John S.

Yet the jury must have supposed it was to prove something.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b302-12\">IV. and V. Upon the question whether the contract supposed by the instructions asked constituted a partnership, the authorities will first be examined that are relied on upon the other side. The principle established by the case <em>Ex parte </em>Hamper, 17 Ves. 404. and laid down in Gow on Partn. 15. and 3 Kent\u2019s Comm. 32. is, that a person who has a specific interest in the profits themselves, as profits, is a partner. In <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Tapscott, </em>9 Leigh 424. Cary on Partnership 8. 10. 14. <em>Waugh </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>2 H. Black. 235. and Smith on Mercantile Law 3. it is laid down, that a share of the profits constitutes a partnership, and that when there is no community of profits there is no partnership. The question then is, whether in this case there was a community of profits? Was there ever a time, after the contract by <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>with <em>Smith, </em>in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>the </em>two former had a specific interest in the profits ? Until they made their election, there was no such interest; and after their election, there could be none. Had <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>elected to take a part of the profits, their election might have related back to the delivery of the goods. And if it would so have related back, an election to take the 20 <em>per cent, </em>must equally relate back. No case has been found in which a contract like this has been held to create a partnership. Here the credit was not even give-n during the time that the right of election existed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-6\">But if any partnership existed, what kind of partnership was it ? A partnership may be general, or limited to a particular branch of business or particular object. 3 Kent\u2019s Comm. 30. <em>Willett </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>Cowp. 814. Gow on Partn. 7. Montague on Partn. 9. <em>Ensign </em>v. <em>Wands, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 171. <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Roosevelt, </em>4 Johns. Rep. 251. Here the partnership was limited to the sale of a 1000 dollars worth of goods, and the only interest which <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>could have in the concern was a portion of the profits arising from the sale of those goods. Such a partnership could not authorize <em>Smith </em>to purchase goods upon the joint credit of himself and <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman. </em>Moreover, if there was a partnership, whether general or limited, <em>Beirne Sf Chapman </em>were only dormant partners, and not liable for the contracts of <em>Smith </em>made after they had retired from the concern, whether notice was given of the dissolution or not. 3 Kent\u2019s Comm. 68. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Hussey, 12 </em>Serg. &amp; Rawle 315. It is said in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>4 Esp. N. P. Cas. 89. that \u201c if the acting partner represents the dormant partner as a partner even after the dissolution, the dormant partner will be bound, unless he gives notice of the dissolution.\u201d But <em>Kent, </em>with this case before him, lays down the law differently. And the doctrine is also questioned by <em>Starkie; </em>3 Starkie on Evid. 1080. His reason is conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>sive, to wit, that the moment the partnership ceases, the . .-i right to bind ceases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATIX\">The court manifestly erred in instructing the jury that <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>were liable until public notice was given of the dissolution. A person dealing with a firm, who has notice of its dissolution, cannot hold the partner bound who has retired, although there may have been no public notice of such dissolution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">It will not do to argue that the instructions asked for and given were mere abstractions. The appellate court cannot presume that instructions given by the court below were inapplicable to the case. There is a great difference between an instruction refused and one given. An erroneous instruction, even upon an abstract question, might mislead the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b304-9\"><em>Peyton, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5HG\">Where a partnership is denied, creditors of the firm, not being privy to or in possession of the partnership agreement, can only establish the partnership by circumstances. If it can be shewn that the defendants suffered their connexion as partners to be known, or suffered their names to be used as partners, this is conclusive. Roscoe on Evid. 212. Now <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>(two of the alleged partners in the firm of <em>French C. Smith &amp; Co.) </em>having a store at <em>Parisburg, </em>the fact of goods being boxed or in boxes at the store last mentioned for <em>French C. Smith &amp; Co. </em>would be a circumstance to lead <em>the public to conclude </em>that they were partners. It must be borne in mind, that though in point of fact persons are not partners, yet if they so represent themselves, and thus credit is gotten, they are liable. <em>De Berkom </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Esp. N. P. C. 29. <em>Kell </em>v. <em>Nainby, </em>10 Barn. &amp; Cress. 20. 21 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 17. <em>Gurdon </em>v. <em>Robson, </em>2 Camp. 302. <em>Waugh </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>2 H. Black. 235.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-10\">II. It is supposed by the second bill of exceptions that goods had been furnished one defendant by the two others, and that after such goods were furnished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the three defendants had a settlement of their mercan- ... , tile accounts; and the object seems to be, to prove that in that settlement 20 <em>percent, </em>was added to the amoun<em>t </em>due for the goods furnished. But what goods were furnished, when, and for what purpose, is unexplained. What this settlement embraced, whether the whole mercantile dealings of the parties, or the goods furnished <em>; </em>and for what purpose the 20 <em>per cent, </em>was included, whether as an agreed profit, or as an advance upon the sale of the goods furnished, is equally unexplained. The evidence was of transactions to which the plaintiffs were strangers, and by which, if true, they could not be affected. The only legitimate purpose for which it could be offered was to prove a dissolution of the concern. A partnership formed by <em>parol </em>may, it is true, be dissolved by parol. <em>Rackstraw </em>v. <em>Imber, </em>1 Holt 368. 3 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 132. But though a partnership may be dissolved as it regards the partners themselves, their liability to creditors may still continue. And as this consequence can only be obviated by notice, the evidence offered, without evidence of notice, was altogether irrelevant and of course inadmissible. All persons dealing with a concern rely upon the united credit of all its members. Therefore when a dissolution takes place, justice requires that the world should be fully apprized of the fact. Those having dealings with the concern must have particular, and the world general notice. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Turnbull, </em>1 Esp. N. P. C. 371. <em>Parkin </em>v. <em>Carruthers, </em>3 Esp. N. P. C. 248. <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hanbury, </em>Cowp. 445. Though a partner whose name does not appear in the firm is only liable for goods furnished during the time that he is actually a partner, yet if he be known to be a dormant partner, though his name does not appear in the firm, the usual notice of dissolution is necessary to avoid liability. Cary on Partn. 187. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>4 Esp. N. P. C. 89.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAY\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>HI. It was competent to the plaintiffs to prove that <em>French C. Smith </em>bought the goods not upon his own credit, but upon the credit of the defendants. The declarations of <em>.Smith </em>on this point were conclusive, and admission that such declarations were made was equally conclusive. The defendants <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman, </em>it is admitted, were not bound by these representations unless they were partners; and the court instructed the jury that the declarations of <em>Smith </em>were inadmissible to establish the partnership. This opinion of the court, thus limited, seems to be correct. Cary on Partn. 139. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>4 Esp. N. P. C. 89. <em>Parkin </em>v. <em>Carruthers, </em>3 Esp. N. P. C. 248. Gow on Partn. 273.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-8\">IY. What constitutes a partnership between individuals contracting together, is one <em>question; but </em>what constitutes a partnership as to third persons, is another and different question. The first species of partnership is the result of a contract <em>inter se. </em>The latter species may be created without contract. For the law is, that he who lends his credit to a firm, or holds himself out as a partner, is liable for the engagements of the partnership with third persons, though he may not be interested in the capital or profits. <em>Alderson </em>v. <em>Clay, </em>1 Starkie 405. 2 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 445. Smith on Mercantile Law, p. 6. <em>Ex parte Hamper, </em>17 Ves. 404. <em>Waugh </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>2 H. Black. 235. <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Tapscott, </em>9 Leigh 424. In this case, <em>Beirne Sf Chapman </em>have held themselves out to the world as partners in the store on <em>Brush </em>creek, have furnished the capital in goods, and have reserved to themselves an election to take a portion of the profits. This election, by the terms of the contract, could not be made until the goods were sold: for, until that period, it was not in the power of <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>to make the election .with a proper regard to their own interests. After the sale, they could see from the books whether it was to their interest to take the 20 <em>per cent, </em>or a portion of the profits. Any varia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>tion of this contract, made in September, after the business was commenced by the defendants and before a sale of the goods, and not made known to creditors, could not screen the defendants from their liability as partners to third persons. Cary on Partn. 8. 10. 14. <em>Alderson </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>1 Camp. 404. <em>Ex parte Hamper, </em>17 Ves. 404. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Turnbull, </em>1 Esp. N. P. C. 371. and the cases cited on the second point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-4\">But it is argued that the defendants were associated for a limited purpose or branch of business, <em>viz. </em>for vending the goods sold by <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>to <em>Smith. </em>In answer to this we say, there was nothing that could apprize the public that this was a limited partnership. The public saw <em>Smith </em>commencing mercantile business upon <em>Brush </em>creek. They saw that the goods to be vended were in part procured from <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman; </em>that <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>were interested in the store, and were, at their election, to receive a portion, of the profits. How was the public to know that this trading was limited to the vending of the goods gotten from <em>Beirne Sp </em>Chapman? If they could know this, still, might not occasional additions to the stock be indispensably necessary to effect a sale of the original 1000 dollars worth of goods bought of <em>Beirne &amp; Chapman </em>? If so, the subsequent purchase from the appellees would have been within the scope of this limited partnership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-8\">The appellees therefore insist that the instruction given by the circuit court is free from error; that the contract constituted the appellants partners previous to election, and subsequent thereto (no notice being given thereof) as it regarded third persons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-9\">Neither did the court err in refusing to give the instructions asked. The court was clearly right in refusing to give- the first instruction asked. ' For there was clearly a partnership, between the contract of sale in June 1832, and the period of election in September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>1832. The store was opened, and a part of the goods sold. The election in September, if it amounted to any thing, must have been a dissolution. For the election was not made according to the contract of June 1832 ; that contract only authorizing election when the goods were sold. Gow on Partn. 15. <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>2 W. Black. 998. <em>Ex parte Hamper, </em>17 Ves. 404. <em>Fromont </em>v. <em>Coupland, 2 </em>Bingh. 170. 9 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 366. <em>Purviance </em>v. <em>M\u2019Clintee, </em>6 Serg. &amp; Rawle 259. 3 Kent\u2019s Comm. 32.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACX\">The same principles and authorities shew that the second instruction asked was properly refused. This instruction seems to proceed upon the ground that partners are not liable to creditors who are ignorant of the terms of the partnership contract; a contract rarely, if ever, known to creditors in any case. A partnership is often created by construction of law; as where one person engages jointly with another in a transaction, either as agent or otherwise, and has an interest in the profits. As frauds might be practised if such agreements bound third persons, and the law will protect third persons against frauds, it has therefore declared all persons entering into such agreements liable to the world as partners. Cary on Partn. 8. 9. 10. Whoever shares in the profits of a concern is a partner as it regards the public. <em>Waugh </em>v. <em>Carver, 2 </em>H. Black. 235. Where a merchant employs a broker to purchase <em>goods, and it is </em>agreed between them that the broker shall receive a portion of the profits as a recompense for his trouble, they are partners as it regards third persons. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Cress. 401. 9 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 122. <em>Reid </em>v. <em>Hollinshead, </em>4 Barn. &amp; Cress. 867. 10 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 460. <em>Ex parte Hamper, </em>17 Ves. 404.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-9\">It is moreover apparent that the judge of the circuit court considered, that the facts supposed by the instructions asked did not correspond strictly with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>facts proved. That the goods purchased in June 1832 were in part immediately delivered, and the store opened upon <em>Brush </em>creek, and the sales going on before the election made, are facts kept out of view, though not expressly negatived. And the instruction of judge seems to have been given with a view of bringing to the consideration of the jury those facts, and the law arising thereon. His object was to prevent the jury from being misled by a plausible but incorrect statement of facts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">V. The same object seems to have influenced the judge in giving the instruction mentioned in the fifth bill of exceptions. The instructions appearing by this bill to have been asked only vary from those appearing by the fourth bill to have been asked, in this, that in the instructions last asked the contract of June 1832 is represented as a private contract, unknown to the plaintiffs when they extended credit to <em>Smith. </em>The judge having heard evidence going to prove that both <em>Beirne </em>and <em>Chapman, </em>from the time of the contract in June 1832 till the period of their election in September, had publicly represented themselves and acted as the partners of <em>Smith </em>in the store upon <em>Brush </em>creek, considered it his duty, while he gave the instructions last asked, to bring to the consideration of the jury a state of facts entitling the plaintiffs to recover notwithstanding those instructions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-8\">All of the exceptions are liable to the following observations : 1. In none of them is the evidence set forth, so as to enable an appellate court to ascertain whether the verdict was rendered under the influence of any opinion excepted to. 2. When the defendants excepted to the admission or exclusion of evidence, they should have taken care to state such a case as would shew the relevancy of the .evidence excluded, or the irrelevancy of the evidence admitted, because it is always incumbent on a party seeking to reverse a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ment to shew that there is error. <em>Rowt\u2019s adm'x </em>v. <em>Kyle</em>'s <em>adm\u2019r, 1 </em>Leigh 216.\u20143. There is no statement of the facts proved, to enable the court to ascertain whether the instructions asked for and given had any applica\u00a3i\u00b0n t0 case\u2019 or \u00a3o shew that the opinions were erroneous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-6\"><em>C. Johnson, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3qk\">cited the cases <em>referred to in 1 </em>Rob. Pract. <em>344-348. </em>and said, the establishment of the proposition which the counsel on the other side was endeavouring to establish as to the imperfect nature of the bills of exceptions, would lead to a reversal of the judgment. He proceeded then to examine the opinions excepted to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-7\">I. Although (he remarked) the statement in the first bill of exceptions does not shew what was the point in issue, yet enough is stated to shew that testimony was improperly admitted. All testimony is improper which is irrelevant. If testimony be pnroa <em>facie </em>irrelevant, it is incumbent on the party who offers it, to make it appear that it is relevant. If, for example, declarations of a stranger be offered, it is not necessary for the party who excepts to the opinion of the court admitting them, to do more in the bill of exceptions than state that such declarations were offered and received. And yet such hearsay evidence might be proper in consequence of some evidence previously given. They might, for example, be declarations of a witness who had been examined, contradicting what he had deposed to. But in such case the party offering them must take care to have enough stated in the bill of exceptions to shew the propriety of receiving them. In the present case, how could the evidence set forth in the first bill of exceptions tend to prove a partnership ? By itself, we cannot see that it would have such tendency; and if any other evidence bad been given that would have authorized it to be admitted, that other evidence ought to have been stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>II. In the second bill of exceptions, the previous evidence not being stated, the case is governed by those already cited which require a reversal because of the imperfect nature of the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqH5\">III. The third bill of exceptions shews that declarations respecting the existence of the partnership were permitted to be given in evidence, with an instruction that they were not evidence of its existence. Of what else could they be evidence ? This bill of exceptions is at least obnoxious to the objection of the want of certainty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-7\">IV. We admit that if the compensation had not been in the alternative; if the contract had been to take a part of the profits without any condition, it would have been a case of partnership. But we have been unable to find any case in which a party thus contingently entitled to a share of the profits has been held a partner. The main reason assigned for holding one who shares in the profits a partner, is, that he who so shares ought, in reference to the other dealers, to be held to share in the losses, because those dealers give credit trusting to the profits as a fund belonging to those whom they trust. Where the interest is alternative and contingent, there is, until the election of one thing or the other, no right to either, and until a share of the profits is elected, there is no community of profits. The vendor must not wait until he sees that profit is sure. The vendee has a right to require that the election be made in a reasonable time. But when the election is made, it relates back to the commencement of the dealing. What objection can there be to this view of the subject, as it regards the public ? If they know the contract and deal in reference to it, they cannot complain that they are injured by it. If the contract be secret, they deal on the credit of him to whom they sell, and from him no part of the profits is taken. The court should therefore have given the first instruction asked. It was evidently per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>tinent to the issue, and the court did not refuse it because there was no evidence of the facts supposed by it, but gave an instruction based upon the same state of facts. An appellate court can never presume that the court below gave an instruction not pertinent to the matter in issue. And in giving that instruction, as well as in refusing the second instruction asked, that court has clearly erred. If there had been a partnership, it was certainly dissolved before the transaction in question, and the former partners then cannot be liable unless for want -of notice. The cases cited by mr. <em>M\u2019Comas </em>shew that notice of the withdrawal of a dormant partner is not necessary at all. And the circuit court has held that there must be notice to the world. Surely, there is no foundation in law for this. If notice had been given to the plaintiffs, it would not only have been good, but better than notice in the papers. The court was eminently wrong in another respect. It should have told the jury that if they thought there was a partnership, it was limited to a single object,\u2014to the vending of these goods, and the business properly connected with it; not that it was a partnership in other goods. The argument on the other side supposes that a very curious mode might be adopted to sell these goods; <em>viz. </em>to purchase others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-4\">V. What has been said upon the fourth bill of exceptions will also apply to the fifth; the variations being very slight.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b312-5\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AtCN\">delivered the following opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The court is of opinion that the evidence mentioned in the first bill of exceptions had a connexion, though very slight, with one of the questions involved in the issue, and though it might have been of very little weight, it was not error to permit it, as a link in a chain of circumstances, to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The evidence mentioned in the second bill of exceptions was properly rejected. The exception does not shew the time of the transaction between the defendants, nor suggest any connexion between the fact the evidence was offered to prove, and any matter in controversy in the suit; nor is there any thing stated in the exception from which such connexion can be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The evidence mentioned in the third bill of exceptions was properly admissible, to prove that the plaintiffs intended to sell to, and <em>Smith </em>intended to purchase for, a partnership, but was no proof against <em>Chapman Beirne </em>that they were the partners. That evidence, however, was not regularly admissible in this case, even for this limited purpose, until the plaintiffs had offered evidence tending to shew that there was a partnership (either by express contract, or by <em>Chapman &amp; Beirne </em>permitting their names to be used as partners, or otherwise,) between <em>Smith, Chapman </em>and <em>Beirne, </em>that authorized <em>Smith </em>to purchase on the credit of the three.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The law of the case stated in the fourth exception is correctly expounded by the instruction asked for thereon by the defendants. But it is not stated that evidence was offered tending to prove such case; and if the court had simply declined to give the instruction, such refusal might have been justified, on the ground that the case was merely hypothetical, and the law arising on it an abstract question. As the court, however, not only overruled the instruction asked, but proceeded to give an instruction, it is a reasonable implication that there was evidence tending to prove the case, and therefore the rectitude of the judgment on the instruction overruled, and on that given, is proper for enquiry in the appellate court. As before stated, the court erred in overruling the instruction sought. The case stated, to which the instruction given was applied, differs from that on which the instruction was asked; and if such case had been made out by the proof, the instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>was wrong in this, that though the case so stated might create a temporary partnership until election, it was limited to the sale of <em>the goods </em>furnished, and to the . \u00b0 profits thereof, and did not extend to purchases and sales of other goods $ and the dissolution of such partnership was effectual in respect to all who may have had actual notice, though such notice may not have been given to the world, or even publicly.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The addition to the instructions, which is the <em>subject </em>of the fifth exception, was not error, if it be understood that the representing themselves and acting as partners by <em>Chapman &amp; Beirne, </em>mentioned in that addition, had relation to an existing and continuing partnership for the sale and purchase of goods, or to a partnership generally, without express qualification or limitation as to the subject or the continuance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">It does not however appear with sufficient clearness, that the said addition was, or was intended to be, so understood <em>; </em>and for that reason the addition was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The judgment ought to be reversed with costs, the verdict set aside, and a new trial awarded, on which the principles herein declared in respect to the admission and rejection of evidence, and the instructions to the jury on the law of the case, are to govern, should occasions occur on the new trial for their application, and the court be asked to apply them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
