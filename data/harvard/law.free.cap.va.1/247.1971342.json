Keeling.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-7\">ill <em>April, </em>1778, a sum of paper money was lent, not to be repaid in less than twelve months thereafter. The money was tendered shortly after the expiration of the twelve months, and was refused. A mortgage having been given to secure the debt, the mortgagee brought an ejectment, ond recovered possession of the mortgaged premises. Upon a bill filed for relief, the mortgagee will be decreed to recovery upon pa yment of the debt according to the scale of depreciation, of the day when the money was lent (notwithstanding he had received the <em>identical </em>money in'discharge of a <em>specie </em>debt, and notwithstanding the mortgagor employed the same in the discharge of a special debt) without interest from the time of the tender, to that of a new demand.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-8\">This was an appeal from the High Court o\u00ed Chancery <em>\u2014Keeling\u25a0 </em>the plaintiff in that Court, borrowed from <em>MJIae </em>m <em>Aprils </em>1778, a sum of pauer money amounting to 422/. i8s. not to be repaid in less than twelve months thereafter, which money (the answer states) belonged to the ward of <em>MKiac* </em>being so much received by him in discharge of a specie debt due to the ward. <em>Keeling </em>conveyed to Wilson, as a trustee for <em>M\u2018Rae, </em>certain property by way of mortgage to secure this loan\u2014after the money became due. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>but not on the very day, <em>Keeling </em>tendered the debt in \u201e paper money, to <em>Wilson </em>the trustee, who refused to receive it. An ejectment being brought <em>to recover </em>possession of the mortgaged premises, a judgment was thereupon obtained. <em>Keeling </em>filed his bill in the High Court of Chancery praying an injunction, and liberty to redeem, upon paying according to the scale of depreciation, at the time when the money was lent. The answer states, that the money was borrowed by Keeling, for the purpose of discharging a specie debt, and that it was actually so applied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">The Chancellor being of opinion, that the debt in question for money borrowed and secured by mortgage, might be discharged in the same manner, as a debt created and secured by a pact in any other form; and that by refusal of the money tendered, the right to interest, between the time when the tender was made, and the time when the debt was demanded by <em>M\u2018Rac.t </em>was extinguished, decreed a reconveyance to the plaintiff upon his paying to the defendants, 84/. 11s. 8&lt;/., with interest thereupon, from the time of the loan, until that of the tender, and from the 1st day of <em>Sep</em>tember, 1784, (when a demand was made,) until payment of the principal debt, with the costs of the suit at law, and his costs in defending this suit; bat upon his failing to do this, the Court decreed a foreclosure and sale, in the usual manner.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-8\">Campbell, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">The appellant <em>MtRea, </em>having gained the legal title to the mortgaged property, has thereby obtained an advantage, of which a Court of Chancery will never deprive him, without forcing the party who seeks its aid, to retribute the other party by doing complete equity. This is an over-ruling maxim in that Court. If the appellee should be found to sustain no injury, or to be deprived of no equitable right by paying the nominal amount of the debt in specie, what is it that shall warrant the interposition of a Court of Equity, to deprive the mortgagee of the full benefit of his judgment at law ? <em>Keeling </em>cannot lose any thing by paying the full amount o'f the loan in specie, because- he: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>made a specie ase of the money. On the other hand <em>M'Bea </em>is injured by applying the scale of depreciation to the debt 5 because the money lent, though it consisted:^ paper bills, was the representative of so much specie, as it was received by him in discharge of a specie debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-2\"><em>M.'-Bea </em>is to be considered in this Court, as standing in the shoes of the person to whom <em>Keeling </em>paid the sum he had borrowed, in the same manner, as if that debt had actually been assigned to him. That the parties considered this as a specie contract is evident from the value of the property mortgaged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-3\">But the decree is surely erroneous, so far as it stops that interest from the tender of the money, to the time of the subsequent demand, since the present case, cannot be likened to that of a tender made in specie. In the latter case, the money always continuing of the same value, no injury can arise if it be not tendered on the day of payment. But in the case of paper money, its value ivas continually lessening, and therefore it ought to have been tendered on the <em>very days </em>as the lender, (relying on the punctual payment of the money,) might have made contracts, providing for the immediate application of it, and might lose the benefit of such contracts by disappointment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-4\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AJf\">was stopped by the Court</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b269-5\">Lyons I.</author>\n<p id=\"AK0Z\">delivered the opinion of the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The case is too clear to be argued. This is a downright attempt to evade the law, directing the mode of settling debts contracted in paper money, without a single circumstance to countenance it.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">In the case <em>Wily </em>v. <em>Panky, </em>in the General Court, it was determined, that the creditor who concealed himself in his house, to evade a tender, should sustain the loss by the depreciation of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Decree affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\"> <em>Nicholas's Ex. </em>v.
