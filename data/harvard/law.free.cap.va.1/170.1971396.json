G., </em>whereby the said testator bound himself to sell the balance of the debt, which should remain unsatisfied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the sale of the property, paid by a certain day. That the intention was to favor the said <em>J. G.; </em>in consideration whereof, the said testator assumed to pay such balance;\u2014 avers a sale made, and that a balance still remained unsatisfied. To the agreement are three scrolls annexed, opposite to each signature, but it is not said to be sealed in the agreement, the attestation, or declaration. This is not to be considered as a sealed instrument. But if it were so, the agreement is only inducement to the action, the real foundation of which is the subsequent assumpsit, and therefore it is sustainable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b235-3\">A parol agreement made subsequent to one under seal, may be declared upon, though it should alter the terms of the written agreement.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\">This was an action on the case brought by the appellants in the District Court of <em>.Yew </em>London. The declaration states, that the plaintiff\u2019s having obtained a judgment against a certain <em>Jeremiah </em>Glenn, and being willing to give to the said <em>Glenn </em>an opportunity of disposing of his property to the best advantage, to enable him to satisfy the judgment, an agreement was entered into between the plaintiffs, the said Glenn, and the testator of the defendant, (which is set forth verba<em>tim,) </em>whereby, the testator of the defendant bound himself to see the balance of the aforesaid debt, interest, and costs, (which should remain unsatisfied, by the property which the said <em>Glenn </em>might sell, for that purpose,) paid by <em>October, </em>1775. That the intention of the said agreement was, to favor the said <em>Glenn, </em>by enabling him to sell his property at the highest price. That in consideration thereof, the said testator, after-wards, See. assumed upon himself, to pay such balance when required. The declaration then avers, that the sale by <em>Glenn </em>was made, and a balance still remained unsatisfied, of w hich the testator had notice ; whereby an action accrued to the plaintiffs, to have of the said testator, the said balance, nevertheless,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">The agreement stated in the declaration, has three <em>scrolls, </em>opposite to each signature: but no part of the agreement, either in the beginning, conclusion, or attestation, says any thing, about its being sealed. The conclusion is thus \u201c as witness our hands\u201d &amp;c. The attestation thus <em>H </em>teste.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AtD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Upon the general issue, the plaintiffs had a verdict, and upon motion, the judgment was arrested. From this judgment, the plaintiffs appealed,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AeD\"><em>Ronald, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1G\">The error stated as the ground for arresting the judgment is, that this action js not sustainable, being founded upon an instrument under seal. This might have been a serious objection, if the fact had been true ; but it is not, or at least it does not appear to be so, upon the face of the record, for in the first place, the Court cannot say, that the agreement was sealed, and if they could, then 2dly\u201e the action is not brought upon the agreement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"At6Z\">It is true there are scrolls to the agreement which might, or might not, have been intended for seals; but it cannot be considered as a deed, unless it be mentioned to be sealed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-6\">But if it were sealed, the agreement is not the foundation of the action. It is true, the declaration states the agreement, but yet it avers that the testator assumed in consideration of the <em>indulgence given to </em>Glenn, not in consideration of the <em>agreement. </em>This consideration is sufficient to maintain the action, since it might produce loss to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-7\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-8\">Whether this instrument be sealed or not, the Court must determine upon an inspection of it, and if so, there can exist no doubt that there are three seals to each signature. The calling it a sealed instrument cannot make it one, unless it be actually sealed, which is the substantial part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-9\">It is not easy to read this declaration, and not con-\"' sider the agreement to be the very foundation of the suit. It is set out in <em>hcec verba, </em>and the cause of its being made is mere tautology, that being expressed in the deed, and would have resulted without the averment\u2014the consideration is plainly referrible to the averment, and to nothing else. If it be to any thing else, it is to the <em>intention </em>of making it, which would certainly be an insufficient consideration\u2014an <em>assumpsit, </em>in consideration of an intention in the other party to do a thing, would be dearly a <em>nudum </em>pactum\u201e <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The <em>assumpsit </em>Is not stated to have been made In consideration of an indulgence <em>actually </em>grantedof course, it must refer to the <em>intention </em>or to the <em>agree</em>ment\u2014if to either, the plaintiff cannot recover\u2014if to the first, there was no right for want of a valid consideration ; if to the second, the remedy was misconceived.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b237-3\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"AEqX\">The Court are not satisfied that this Is to be considered as a sealed instrument It is in no part of it expressed to be sealed\u2014the attestation is the same as in common simple contracts, not under seal, nor does the declaration speak of it as being of that dignity\u2014it is true, there are scrolls annexed, but it may nevertheless remain a matter of doubt, whether they are to be considered as the seals of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">However, it is unnecessary to determine this point, as we are of opinion, that if it were a sealed instrument, this action is sustainable. The agreement is only stated as inducement to that, which forms the real ground of the consideration afterwards alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The foundation of the action is the subsequent <em>assumpsit </em>which is stated in the declaration, and there is no doubt but that a parol agreement made subsequent to one under seal, may be declared upon, though it should alter the terms of the written agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Judgment of the District Court reversed, and entered for the plaintiff upon the verdict.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\"> <em>Austin\u2019s adm. </em>v. <em>Whitlock\u2019s ex. </em>I Munf. 487. 492. <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Hickman </em>6 Munf. 15.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
