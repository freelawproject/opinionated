Upon the same principle, that Court has refused its aid in relieving against a judgment obtained by fraud.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b270-10\">The property of an insolvent debtor afterwards acquired, is not exempted from the payment of prior debts; it is his person only which is protected.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4y\">This was an appeal from a decree of the High Court of Chancery. The appellant filed his bill in that Court, stating, that his testator was indebted to the testator of the appellee by bond, upon which a judgment had been obtained in the year 1766, during the h\"ves pities. That the bond being afterwards found by the defendant amongst the papers of his testator, the defendant had instituted an action upon the same bond, against the plaintiff, in a different Court from that in which the original judgment had been obtained : that the plaintiff, not knowing of this judgment, was prevented from pleading it in bar, in consequence of which, a second judgment was rendered in the year 1789, against the plaintiff. The ground of Equity is, that the testator of the plaintiff had, in the year 1766, conveyed the greatest part of his property to <em>John </em>Semple, in trust for the payment of the debt in question (amongst many others,) provided the enumerated creditors would, within a reasonable time, accede to, and accept of that security. That <em>Fleet </em>was one of the acceding creditors, and had been fully satisfied for the above mentioned debt out of the trust estate. An injunction was prayed for and granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b270-7\">The defendant, in his answer, denied any knowledge of the judgment in 1766, or that the debt had been satisfied either by <em>Payne </em>himself, or by Semple, out of the trust estate; and insists, that the debt (for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>which the judgment sought to be enjoined was rendered) being yet due and unpaid, it ought now to be satisfied b} the plaintiff, whether <em>Fleet </em>was, or was not, an acceding creditor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-6\">The judgment in 1766, was entered upon confession | no declaration or bond was filed, and, consequently, it was entered generally, without ascertaining any precise sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-7\">The Chancellor, upon a hearing of the cause, dismissed the bill, being of opinion that the equity stated, was neither admitted by the answer,- nor supported by the evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b271-8\">Campbell, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b271-9\">I am aware of an objection which may be urged against the relief sought for by this bill, which is, that the defendant at Law having lost the opportunity of availing himself of a legal advantage, cannot expect the favour of a Court of Equity, unless he shew that the judgment is an unconscientious one. But it should be observed, that this legal advantage was unknown to the appellant, whereby he lost the opportunity of availing himself of the presumption that the first judgment (obtained so long ago as the year 1766,) had been paid; a defence which he might safely have used, if, instead of improperly instituting a second suit upon the same bond, a <em>scire facias </em>had been prosecuted to revive that judgment. The presumption arising from length of time, is much stronger against a judgment than against a bond 5 for, in the first case, a <em>scire facias </em>cannot be sued out after seven years, but by permission of the Court. There are strong circumstances in this cause to strengthen the presumption. On the day when the first judgment was to be confessed, <em>Payne </em>executed a deed of trust, conveying his property to Semple, to secure such of his creditors as should accede thereto. That <em>Fleet </em>vvas one of the acceding creditors, appears from the circumstance of one of his sons being found in possession of a part of the trust estate <em>\\ </em>after which it does not appear that any demand of payment was made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A-EV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Marshall, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArV\">The principle stated and admitted by Mr. <em>Camp bell, </em>furnishes a complete answer to all the objections re^ed upon; for it is clear, that where a man has neglected to avail himself of an advantage merely legal, Equity will not assist him, so as to defeat the justice of the case. <em>Fleet, </em>by receiving part of the trust estate, is not thereby barred from recovering the balance of his debt, if other property can be found. It is like the case of a mortgagee, who, if not fully satisfied by the sale of the property mortgaged, may proceed to recover the balance from the mortgagor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-6\">Lyons, J. in case of a <em>foreclosure, </em>how would it be if there were no covenant for payment of the debt?</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-7\"><em>Marshall.\u2014In </em>that case, the mortgagee must be satisfied with the security he has taken ; but he may elect to have the property sold, in which case he may proceed against the mortgagor for the balance left unsatisfied by the mortgaged property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b272-8\">As to the presumption of payment, it was a fit subject to have been relied upon at law. But surely it cannot be seriously contended, that the acceding creditors are precluded from claiming such part of their debts as remained unsatisfied under the trust.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b272-9\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"A8B\">The presumption of payment arising from length of time, besides being defeated by the acknowledgments of the debtor in 1775 and 1779, is sufficiently repelled by considering the delay necessarily incurred, whilst the creditor was waiting to see what the trust estate would produce. The creditors</p>\n<p id=\"AWW\">are not barred by the terms on which they acceded to the deed of trust, from demanding any balance not satisfied under the trust\u2014nor does it even appear that the debtor had a letter of license, which, on such occasions, is generally given.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">It never was supposed that the property of an insolvent debtor, acquired after his discharge, was exempted from the claims of his creditors until the debts before contracted were fully satisfied. It is his person only which is protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>We come now to consider the nature and extent of the relief sought for. Courts of Equity never interfere to deprive the plaintiff at Law of any legal iage which he may have gained, unless the party seeking relief, will do complete justice by paying what is really due. Indeed, they have (upon the same principle,) gone so far as to refuse their assistance, in relieving against a judgment, obtained by fraud. The trust deed furnishes no equitable bar to the cre - ditor, since he has waited to know the result of that fund, as long as could have been expected. If <em>Payne\u2019s </em>executor had supposed, that a balance of the trust property were still remaining unapplied, he might have made the representatives of the trustees parties, and called for an account</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">Decree affirmed. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b273-8\"> <em>Libscomb's Adm. </em>v. <em>Littlepage's Adm. </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. <em>468</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
