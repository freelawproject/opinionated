Taylor </em>filed a bill in the circurt superior court of law and chancery for the county of <em>Randolph, </em>against <em>John G. Stringer, </em>and others, to recover a tract of 9998J acres of land, which had been sold in the year 1815, for the nonpayment of taxes. The bill stated that <em>Thomas A. Taylor, </em>the father of the plaintiff, owned 10,000 acres of land in the county of <em>Randolph, </em>of which that sought to be recovered in this suit, was a part. That the sheriff of the county, in August 1815, sold the said 9998J acres of land, for the nonpayment of the taxes for the years 1813-14-15, to a certain <em>Thomas O. Williams, </em>a de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>puty sheriff of said county, for the sum of <em>7 </em>dollars 99 r <em>J </em>/.tiii <em>j </em>cents, the amount of taxes due on the whole tract; and conveyed the same to him. That <em>Williams, </em>in Octo- , , , her 1817, conveyed all his interest m the land so purchased, to <em>Daniel Stringer, </em>for the sum of 300 dollars. That <em>Daniel Stringer, </em>afterwards, on the 9th of Nober 1820, conveyed 1000 acres of this land to his son <em>John G. Stringer, </em>for natural love and affection. That said <em>Daniel Stringer, </em>on the 27th September 1826, executed another deed, whereby, after reciting that he had conveyed 2000 acres, part of the tract aforesaid, to his son <em>John G. Stringer, </em>and his daughter <em>Eleanor, </em>and 500 acres, another part thereof, to a certain <em>Henry Camden, </em>conveyed the residue, to wit, 7498J acres, to a certain <em>Tilghman Hillary, </em>for the consideration of 3750 dollars; and that the said <em>Daniel Stringer </em>and <em>Henry Camden, </em>afterwards, on the 21st of June 1828, by another deed, conveyed the aforesaid 500 acres to <em>Joshua Wood, </em>for the consideration of 600 dollars. That these purchasers from <em>Daniel Stringer, </em>had taken possession of said land, and now claim the same as their own. The bill then states that the land was sold by the sheriff, at private <em>sale; </em>that there were other irregularities in the sale, which are mentioned; that <em>Thomas A. Taylor </em>died in the year 18\u2014, having been insane at the time of the sale of his land in 1815, and continuing so until his death; and that the plaintiff was his sole heir at law. He then makes the purchasers of the land parties to the bill: prays that the conveyances aforesaid, may be set aside ; and that the land may be decreed to him ; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-11\">The plaintiff having died in 1835, the suit was revived in the name <em>Holden Rhodes </em>and <em>Archer L. Wooldridge, </em>as devisees in trust for <em>Caroline M. R. Johnson, </em>as plaintiffs; and then the defendants filed a general demurrer to the bill; which upon the hearing, was sustained by the court, and the bill dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArGf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>From the decree dismissing the bill, the plaintiffs obtajne(j an appea| to this COUl\u2019t.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJp\"><em>Johnson </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aro\">in the petition for appeal, relied on the act of 1813, see Sess.
