To the first plea, the appellee replied generally. To the second, that the motion was made under the Act of Assembly of 1769, entitled, \u201cAn act to amend an act, entitled, an act declaring the Law concerning execu tions, and for relief of insolvent debtors,\u201d which said act being construed strictly in motions, an award of execution upon the said forthcoming bond was refused for some inaccuracy in the condition of it. To the third plea, the appellee replied, that the bond was taken in pursuance of the Act of 1769, upon an execution, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-3\">The parties agreed the following case: that the bond in the declaration mentioned was taken by the Sheriff upon an execution issued at the suit of the appellee, conditioned for the forthcoming of property, seized by the said Sheriff under that execution. That the property was not delivered according to the condition of the bond, nor the money paid. That a motion was made for an award of execution upon the said bond, which was over-ruled, and the motion dismissed with costs, on account of the insufficiency of the bond. That afterwards, another motion was made by the appellee to quash the execution, which was also rejected. Judgment was entered below for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">This bond was taken under the Act of 1769; but not pursuing that act in reciting the execution, and the amount of it, it is utterly void. The law requires forthcoming bonds to be returned to the Clerk\u2019s office, and to have the force of judgments ; but if the bond be not made in conformity with the law, it can have no greater force than a defective judgment, or recognisance, upon which no recovery could be had. An irregular judgment may be set aside upon motion, and if this be considered as such, the appellee could not elect</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>to take it as a thing in <em>pais, </em>and bring an action upon it. But if he had such an election, he has made it, and a regular judgment has passed against him upon his motion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b496-8\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-9\">This question has been fully settled by this Court, in the case of <em>Merriweather </em>v. <em>Johnson. </em>In that case, the objection to the bond was, that it was taken payable to the Sheriff, instead of the creditor, as the law required; but the principal decided in that case is strictly applicable to the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-10\">In that case, as in this, a motion for judgment upon the bond had also been made, and overruled. In short, the very same objections were there stated and argued which are now urged ; and, upon full consideration, the Court determined, that an action of debt upon the bond might be sustained.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b496-11\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"Azd\">\u2014The case of <em>Meriweather </em>v.
