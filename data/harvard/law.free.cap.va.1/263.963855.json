Hill </em>and others. Upon a report being afterwards returned by the freeholders, <em>Hill, for </em>himself, and as agent for the other land-owners, moved the court to quash the same ; but bis motion was overruled, and no good cause being shewn against the report in the opinion of the court, the same was affirmed and entered of record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASxL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>From this order, <em>Hill </em>prayed an appeal to the circuit court; and upon his entering into bond with security, conditioned to pay all costs which might be awarded against him, the county court allowed the appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYR\">In the circuit court, the appellees moved the court to dismiss the appeal, upon the ground that the county court had no power to grant the same; and this motion prevailed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-5\">Thereupon, on the petition of <em>Hill, </em>a <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by a judge of this court to the judgment of the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">The act of April 16. 1831, establishing the circuit superior courts, (Sess.

The act prescribing regulations for the incorporation of turnpike companies does not regulate the mode of taking appeals; and in the absence of any special regulation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>the </em>general law allowing appeals in controversies concerning roads ought to govern the case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-4\"><em>M\u2019Comas </em>was counsel for the defendants in error, but did not argue the case.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b293-5\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ANEE\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
