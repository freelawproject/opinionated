In 1834 the appellee <em>Meehan </em>qualified as their administrator, in the county court of <em>Middlesex; </em>and in 1835 he brought this suit in the circuit superior court of law and chancery for the county of <em>Louisa, </em>against the executor <em>Michie, </em>to recover these legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>MicTiie </em>in his answer admitted the bequests, and that he had by a compromise with <em>Davenport, </em>made in 1815, received the sum above mentioned in three equal annual payments; but that at the time this money was paid, he did not know where the legatees lived, if alive at all; indeed he knew nothing of them, never having heard of them, except as they were mentioned in his testator\u2019s will ; and that he was possessed <em>of no </em>means by which he could ascertain their residence. He farther averred that there was no representative of either of them, or of either of their husbands, known to him prior to the application made to him by the present administrator ; nor did he know any person to whom he could legally pay these legacies : and that he had offered to pay the principal money, which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-4\">Although it appeared that there had been an administrator upon <em>Catharine Chewning\u2019s </em>estate in 1816, there was no evidence that there ever had been an application to the executor for the payment of either of the legacies ; or that he knew, or had ever heard of the legatees except by the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">The cause coming on to be heard in September 1836, the court decreed that <em>the executor </em>should pay to <em>the </em>plaintiff, as the administrator of each of the legatees, the one fourth of the sum of <em>\u00a3 </em>139. 2. 10., with interest thereon from the 15th of May 1815, till paid.
