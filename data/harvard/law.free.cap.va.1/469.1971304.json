'</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-10\">This was an appeal from the District Court of <em>Northumberland, </em>and the only question was, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>an issue was properly joined. It was an action on the case, upon an <em>assumpsit. </em>Plea, non-assumpsit, con.\u201d eluding as usual to the country, but no <em>similiter </em>apPears upon the record.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-4\">warden, tor the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9m\">contended, that the omission of the <em>similiter </em>was fatal, and could not be amended by an appellate Court. He cited 1 <em>Str. </em>641, in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEP\">There being other cases in the Court of a similar nature, the counsel who were interested in the general question, argued the point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKqI\">Washington, on the same side, contended, that the case from <em>Strange </em>cited by Mr. <em>Warden, </em>was expressly in point, and was unimpeached by any subsequent adjudication. Those which come the nearest to it, are <em>Sayer </em>v. <em>Pocock, Cowp. Rep. </em>407, and <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Peak, </em>3 <em>Burr. </em>1793. In the first, there was an <em>et </em>catera, which the Court construed to mean a similiter, since nothing else could be inferred from it. That, at farthest, it could be considered only as an issue misjoined, and, (being in the same Court,) amendable by the Statute of <em>Jeofails, </em>which, however, does not cure the <em>want of an issue. </em>In the other case, the plaintiff replied, \u201c and the <em>defendant </em>likewise,\u201d instead of the <em>plaintiff. </em>In that case, it was no more than the misjoining of the issue. But no case can be produced, where the total want of an issue has been aided by verdict.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-7\">Warden.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOW\">In the case of <em>Sayer </em>v. <em>Pocock, </em>the amendment was made in the same Court, and to prevent a writ of error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-8\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-9\">It would be mischievous, as well as a disgrace to justice, if such captious objections were permitted after a trial. The issue is completely formed, by an affirmation on the one side, and a negation on the other, and the adding of the <em>similiter </em>is either done by the Clerk, or by the party who tenders the issue. It is always understood that the one or the other will do it, and it would be a palpable fraud to permit the party to avail himself of a mistake, which it is understood and expected he will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>prevent. The case of <em>Cooper </em>v. Spencer, 1 <em>Str. </em>641, Is not in point, for the replication did not tender an issue.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-3\">Washington, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anc9\">The replication, in the case of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>was <em>de injuria sua propria, </em>&amp;c. which was a complete negation of the plea of <em>son assault demesne, </em>and concludes to the country, as the plea now under consideration does.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b491-4\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AQS\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The mere omission of a <em>similiter, </em>in a plea importing the general issue, if it be a fault at all, is the <em>misprision </em>of the Clerk, and, therefore, amendable. In this case, the parties considered it as joined ; the jury were sworn to try the issue joined\u2014the parties go to trial upon the merits, and the verdict is, that the defendant did assume. After this, it is too late to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
