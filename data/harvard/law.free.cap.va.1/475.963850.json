The creditor, plaintiff in the execution and <em>scire facias, </em>resists the motion. It appears that the debtor, having been surrendered to the sheriff by his special bail at the suit of the other creditor, and brought before two justices of the peace, subscribed and delivered in a schedule of his estate, made oath thereto in due form of law, and was thereupon discharged by warrant from, the justices, which recited that he had \u201c complied with the directions of the general assembly for the relief of insolvent debtors.\u201d No other evidence is adduced to shew that the debtor was ever <em>charged in execution by </em>the creditor at whose suit he was surrendered.

Burks </em>and <em>William B. Jacobs, </em>for 1400 dollars and costs, to be discharged by the payment of 700 dollars with interest from the 27th of November 1821 till paid, and the costs; subject to credits for payments made at different times amounting to 537 dollars 17 cents. Pending the action, <em>William Lee Harris </em>had become special bail for the defendants. On the 24th of November 1823, a <em>ca. sa. </em>was issued upon the judgment, directed to the sheriff of <em>Nelson </em>and returnable to January term 1824, on which the sheriff made the following return : \u201c 29th November 1823, executed on <em>Jacobs </em>and committed to jail; <em>Burks </em>not found.\u201d On the 11th of December 1824, after the death of <em>William Lee Harris </em>the special bail, a writ of <em>scire facias </em>was sued out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>against <em>Lee W. Harris </em>his executor. Various proceed- . . . <em>mgs </em>were had upon the <em>scire facias, </em>and it was still pending and undetermined on the 27th of August 1834. On that day, <em>Harris's </em>executor and <em>Richard H. Buries </em>move(j county court of <em>Nelson </em>to quash the <em>ca. sa. </em>so far as it affected the said <em>Burks, </em>upon the ground that before the same was issued, and since the recovery of the judgment, <em>Buries </em>had taken the oath of insolvency at the suit of other creditors, and that the said <em>ca. sa. </em>emanated without the order of the court. This motion was resisted by <em>Turner, </em>the plaintiff in the execution and <em>scire fu\u00f1as.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">In support of the motion, <em>Harris's </em>executor and <em>Burks </em>produced a warrant under the hands and seals of two justices of the peace for <em>Amherst </em>county, dated the 23d of August 1823, and directed to the keeper of the jail of said county, in the following terms: \u201cWe hereby command you, in the name of the commonwealth, forthwith to release and set at liberty <em>Richard H. Burks, </em>a prisoner now in your custody by virtue of the following <em>hail pieces': </em>One in the name of <em>William Morgan </em>&amp;c. against the said <em>Richard H. Burks </em>&amp;o. for 4800 dollars, to be discharged by the payment of 2400 dollars with interest &amp;c. and costs; <em>John Van Lew &amp; Co. </em>against <em>Richard H. Burks </em>&amp;c. for 269 dollars 20 cents with interest &amp;c. and costs; and one in the superior court of <em>Amherst, </em>in the name of <em>Archibald Robertson </em>assignee &amp;c. against <em>Richard, H. Burks, </em>for 200 dollars with interest &amp;c. and costs: <em>the said Richard H. Burks having complied with the directions of the general assembly for the relief of insolvent debtors.\" </em>It further appeared, by a receipt under the hand of the sheriff of <em>Amherst, </em>dated the same 23d of August 1823, that <em>Buries </em>was on that day surrendered to the said sheriff by <em>William Shelton, </em>his bail at the suit of <em>Van Lew Sf Company, </em>and thereupon committed to jail. The warrant for bringing <em>Buries </em>before the justices, and the schedule subscribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>and delivered in by him, were also produced; and it was proved by the testimony of two witnesses, that Burks, previous to his discharge under the warrant first above set forth, made oath to the said schedule in due form of law. But except the warrant of discharge itself, there was no evidence proving, or tending to prove, that <em>Burks was charged in execution </em>by any of the creditors in the said warrant mentioned, when he took the oath of insolvency and obtained his discharge as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">Upon this evidence the county court of <em>Nelson </em>held that the execution ought to be quashed, so far as <em>Burks </em>was concerned, as it had been issued without the direction of the court, and after <em>Burks </em>had taken the oath of insolvency at the time and in the cases above stated ; and ordered that the same be quashed accordingly. This order was affirmed by the circuit superior court of <em>Nelson, </em>on a <em>supersedeas </em>thereto obtained by <em>Turner; </em>and thereupon, on his petition this court allowed him a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment of affirmance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-10\"><em>Rhodes, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3p\">submitted, that <em>Buries </em>was not duly discharged, not having been charged in execution by any creditor, and consequently that <em>Turner\u2019s ca. sa. </em>was rightfully issued.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-11\">There was no counsel for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b505-12\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A75\">Judgments of both courts reversed, and motion to quash the <em>ca. sa. </em>overruled.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-13\"> See also <em>Green v.
