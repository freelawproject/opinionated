The proper remedy is <em>case </em>for consequential damages.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-15\">This was an action of debt, brought by the appellee against the appellant, as High Sheriff, for levying an execution on the property of the plaintiff\u2019s tenant, without paying him a year\u2019s rent, due at the time. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The declaration \u201c demands 80/., which the defendant owes and detains, for that the defendant refused to pay the plaintiff the said sum of 80/., though he, the defendant, as Sheriff, levied an execution on the property of <em>J. </em>Stith, which property was on the plaintiff\u2019s premises, rented to the said Stith, for the said 80/. a year, and notwithstanding the said <em>Stith </em>was in arrear to the plaintiff, for the last years rent, to wit, for 1780, and although the defendant was applied to for the said 80/. contrary to the form and effect of the Act of .Assembly, &amp;c. and the defendant still refuses to pay the said 80/. though often required, &amp;c. to the plaintiff\u2019s damage 150/.\u201d &amp;c. Plea, <em>non </em>assumpsit\u2014verdict and judgment for the plaintiff for 83/. 18s. <em>4d. </em>damage. This judgment being affirmed in the District Court, an appeal was prayed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-8\">The <em>Attorney </em>General, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-9\">This record, though small, is as full of error as it can well be. The writ is in case\u2014the declaration in debt\u2014the issue is <em>non </em>assumpsit, and verdict and judgment is entered for the plaintiff, though the jury nave not found that the defendant <em>did assume.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-10\">The declaration being in debt, makes an incurable error in the proceedings at the ver} threshhold. Debt will not lie in a case of this sort, where no contract exists, unless it were given by Statute. It is brought, too, against the Sheriff, for an act of commission, for which even an action on the case would not lie. But if the action were proper, still the issue is immaterial, for, though the defendant did not assume, yet he might be liable to the recovery of the plaintiff.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-11\"><em>Wiclcham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-12\">That an action will lie against the Sheriff, for levying an execution upon the property of a tenant on the demised premises, without paying a year\u2019s rent to the landlord, if the same be due, is settled by the cases of <em>Palgrave </em>v. Windham, 1 <em>Str. </em>212, and <em>Gore v. Gofton, </em>1 <em>Str. 643, </em>both of which being adjudications upon the Statute of <em>Ann, </em>from which our Act is copied, will be considered as authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The objection to the declaration is more to the form than to the substance of it, though it begins like a declaration in debt, by stating the defendants <em>to owe and detain, </em>&amp;c. yet upon a view of the whole of it, we shall find it to be in fact a declaration in case ; and if so, the <em>debet et detinet </em>may properly be rejected as surplusage. It states the Act of Assembly, the rent due, and execution levied, notwithstanding notice to the Sheriff, and demand of the years rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-3\">As to the issue, it is only informal, and, therefore,, cured by the Act of <em>Jeofails\u2014nil debet </em>may be pleaded to an action upon the <em>case\u2014not guilty, </em>to an action of debt\u2014and though neither are formal, yet they are cured by verdict.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-4\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"Adk\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">If the declaration could be supported, the Court might get over the errors which precede and follow it, either by considering them as cured by the verdict, or by awarding a repleader from the first fault. Bui the declaration is certainly in debt, and though, after a verdict, objections to the form of a declaration will be disregarded, yet we can find no authority to justify a rejection of that part of it, as surplusage, which designates it a declaration in debt. As an action of debt, it is not sustainable under the Act of Assembly, which does not impose a <em>penalty </em>upon the officer; and therefore, an action upon the case for consequential damages, was most clearly the proper remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Both judgments must be reversed with costs.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b319-11\"> <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Rainbow, 2, </em>Hen. &amp; Munf. <em>444.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
