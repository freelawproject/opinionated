Court refused to suffer the witness to be exam-med, considering him to be incompetent on account of his sued as a trespasser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAxjQ\">The defendant below filed a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the Court, and a verdict and judgment being given against him, he obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>from this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-6\"><em>Ronold, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-7\">There seems to be no good reason for rejecting this witness upon the ground of incompetency. A person named in the <em>simul cum </em>may give testimony for the defendant in an action of trespass. <em>Bull. Ni. Pri. </em>285. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Shelly, </em>1 <em>Term Rep. </em>301, is expressly in point. <em>Hardw. Cas. </em>360, and 3 <em>Term Rep. </em>27. In the last case, this principle is laid down, that if the witness is neither to gain nor lose by the event of the cause in which he deposes, or if the verdict cannot be given in evidence for or against him, he cannot be objected to on the score of incompetency.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A68\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b258-9\">My own opinion is, that the law is correctly stated by Mr. <em>Ronold, </em>but the point has been otherwise determined in the General Court, upon an indictment for an assault.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b258-10\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"A4D\">The plaintiff, by bringing separate actions, has removed all objection to the testimony of the witness, since the verdict in one suit cannot be given in evidence in the other. The objection, therefore, can only go to the credibility, not to the <em>competency </em>of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">Judgment reversed, verdict set aside, and new trial awarded, with directions to admit the examination of the witness.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
