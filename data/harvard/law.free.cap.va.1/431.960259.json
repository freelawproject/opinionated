His son <em>Henry J. </em>Peyton, his son-in-law <em>A. B.

The defendants answered, contesting the plaintiff\u2019s claim to any thing prior to 1803, pleading the statute of limitations to all the claims prior to 1799, and pleading out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>standing dc c of superior dignity to the full amount of the assets. f,ho cause was removed to the superior court of chain cry, and the accounts were referred to a commissioner, who was about to report a large sum against <em>Pe\u00eddo \u00a1is </em>estate, when the administrator <em>Gray- , . </em>47 <em>son, </em>in I SIT, made a compromise with <em>Keith, </em>by which <em>Keith </em>io receive 10,000 dollars, and said <em>Grayson, </em>with <em>John S.

Grayson, </em>having become indebted to <em>Louisa M. Peyton </em>on account of transactions arising out of the sale, by the said <em>Louisa M. </em>to said <em>Grayson, </em>of a tract of land, and the rescission of that contract, had executed to her his four several bonds with <em>Benjamin Grayson </em>as his surety, on two of which judgments had been obtained, and a suit brought upon the third. That said <em>Louisa, </em>though a minor when the compromise was made with <em>Keith, </em>approved of it, and after coming of age had promised to contribute her proportion to the discharge of the sum of money which was to be paid to <em>Keith, </em>and had agreed with <em>Grayson </em>that \u2022the bonds executed by him to her should be applied to that object: and that <em>Grayson </em>had paid to <em>Keith </em>6721 dollars 66 cents, which had been accepted in full of his liabilities by the administrator of <em>Keith. </em>The plaintiffs, therefore, having made <em>William L. Clarke, </em>who had married <em>.Louisa M. Peyton, </em>and the said <em>Louisa M. </em>parties defendants to their bill, asked the court to injoin all farther proceedings upon said judgments, and in said suit, and that the amount of the said <em>Louisa Mis </em>liability might be ascertained, and applied to the satisfaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>of the bonds executed by the plaintiffs to her. The court granted the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9m\"><em>Clarke </em>and wife answered, denying that <em>Grayson </em>was authorized to make the compromise with <em>Keith, </em>and especially denying that the defendant <em>Louisa M. </em>had ever agreed to pay any part of the amount which <em>Grayson </em>had agreed to pay to <em>Keith. </em>Upon the coming in of the answer the injunction was dissolved, and the plaintiffs were permitted to carry on their suit as an original bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9d\">In the progress of the suit, the representatives of the original administrators, and <em>John T. Cookus </em>and <em>Robert Worthington </em>the administrators of <em>Morrow, TiibalVs </em>administrator, <em>Douglas, </em>and the widow and children of <em>John Peyton, </em>were made parties defendants, and the accounts of the original administrators were settled by a commissioner of the court. These accounts consisted of the separate administration accounts of each of the administrators, on which judge <em>Brown </em>was ascertained to be slightly in advance to the estate; and <em>Peyton </em>and <em>Armistead </em>were each debtors to a small <em>amount; </em>and of a general administration account in which the administrators were found indebted in the sum of 9819 dollars <em>7 </em>cents, as of the 1st of January 1830, with interest on 4238 dollars 11 cents, a part thereof, from that date. The commissioner also stated the administration account of <em>Robert O. Grayson, </em>reporting againsr him the sum of 6086 dollars 85 cents, with interest on 3859 dollars 46 cents, from the 1st of January 1824. A special statement was afterwards made out under the direction of the judge; from which it appeared that after allowing to <em>Grayson </em>what he had <em>paid, to Keith, </em>he was debtor to the estate 1779 dollars 10 cents, whilst <em>Elizabeth C. Peyton, </em>one <em>of </em>his joint obligors in the bonds to <em>Keith, </em>was debtor to him 1731 dollars 10 cents, and that the estate of <em>John Peyton </em>was debtor to said <em>Elizabeth C. </em>on account of her payments to <em>Keith </em>and to <em>Grayson, </em>5787 dollars 91 cents, as of the 1st of January 1830. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>The balance found due from the administrators of <em>John Peyton, </em>after deducting the amount due to <em>Elizabeth C. Peyton </em>as a creditor of the estate, was apportioned by the commissioner among the widow and children of <em>John Peyton, </em>and then the cause coming on to be heard in May 1830, and it being admitted that executions against the estates of the original administrators would be unavailing, the court made a decree by which their representatives, and <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus, </em>administrators of <em>Morrow, </em>and the administrator of <em>Titball, </em>out of the assets in their hands respectively, and <em>Douglas </em>should pay <em>to Elizabeth C.

This hill was answered by <em>Elizabeth C. Peyton, William L. Clarke </em>and wife, and <em>Clarke </em>as administrator of <em>Susan Peyton </em>and. <em>Francis A. Peyton, </em>denying that the objections made to the accounts were well founded. The cause came on to be heard at the November term of the court, when the injunction was dissolved and the bill dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-5\">Previous <em>to </em>filing this bill of review, executions having been issued on the decrees of May 1830, and returned no effects, <em>Elizabeth C. Peyton, William L. Clarke </em>and <em>Louisa M. </em>his wife, and <em>Clarke </em>as administrator of <em>Susan Peylon </em>and of <em>Francis A. Peyton, </em>in August 1830, filed their bill against <em>Cookus </em>and <em>Worthington, </em>as administrators of <em>Morrow, </em>who was surety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>Henry J.

This is the case of <em>Morrow's adm'r </em>v. <em>Peyton's adm'r, </em>reported in 8 Leigh 54, and for the facts of the case, up to the period of the decree, reference is made to that report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-7\">When the cause came back from the court of appeals, <em>William L. Clarke, </em>as executor of <em>Elizabeth C. Peyton, </em>who was then dead, and as administrator of <em>Francis A. </em>and of <em>Busan Peyton, </em>and <em>Clarke </em>and wife filed their amended bill against <em>Robert Worthington </em>and <em>John T. Cookus, </em>as administrators of <em>Morrow, Butler, Grove </em>and <em>Buckles, </em>their sureties, and <em>Btemmons </em>the executor of <em>Downey, </em>another surety, and the said <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus </em>as cosureties with these parties, for the separate <em>devastavits </em>of <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus, </em>in which they ask that the accounts of <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus </em>may be settled <em>de novo </em>according to the principles of the decree of the court of appeals, and that they may have a decree against the defendants, according to their legal liabilities, for the amount of the claims they had set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-8\">The sureties, including <em>Cookus, </em>and <em>Btemmons </em>the executor of <em>Downey, </em>answered the bill. They all relied upon the act of 8th of March 1826, limiting actions against persons acting in a fiduciary character, and their sureties. The executor of <em>Downey </em>stated that long before he had heard of the claim set up by the plaintiffs in their bill, he had fully administered all the assets of the estate of his testator, and <em>Butler </em>and <em>Buckles </em>impeached the statement of the account of administration of <em>John Peyton's </em>administrators upon the same grounds taken by <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus </em>in their bill of review.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-9\">The cause was referred to a commissioner with directions to settle <em>de novo </em>the accounts of <em>Worthington </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Cookus </em>as administrators of <em>Morrow; </em>and he returned . \u2022. /\u00bb _ . , it. his report m April 1821, from which it appeared that <em>Cookus </em>was in advance to the estate in the sum of 3911 dollars 16 cents, as of the 1st of January 1833, with interest on 3745 dollars 56 cents, a part thereof, from that date ; and that <em>Worthington </em>was debtor to the estate in the sum of 7771 dollars 19J cents, as of the same date, with interest on 6942 dollars 8J cents from that time. The accounts were excepted to by the plaintiffs because, 1st, the administrators were allowed credits for the payment of simple contract debts; and 2nd, that they were not charged <em>interest on </em>the sums paid <em>to </em>distributees, both payments having been made without knowledge of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the payments to distributees being but partial payments, and the estate of <em>Morrow </em>being much more than sufficient to pay all debts then known to the administrators. Another objection taken to the accounts in this court, though not taken in the court below, was, that each of the administrators was allowed a credit for moneys retained by him in satisfaction of certain simple contract debts due him from <em>Morroiv.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-10\">The cause came on to be heard in September 1841, when the court decided that the act of March 1826, did not bar the plaintiffs\u2019 demands against the sureties, and overruled the exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report, and reserving the question, whether the amount found due to <em>Cookus </em>might be allowed as a credit upon the amount found due from <em>Worthington, </em>so as to reduce the amount which the defendants might be required to pay to the plaintiffs, gave a decree for the balance, after crediting that sum in favour of the plaintiff <em>Clarke </em>as executor of <em>Elizabeth C. Peyton. </em>And the cause coming on again to be heard in November 184.1, the court expressed the opinion, that <em>Cookus </em>and <em>Worthington were to </em>be considered as one administrator, and were properly entitled to a credit for all sums disbursed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>either; the court, therefore, refused to give any farther decree against the defendants, except for costs, and reserved to the plaintiff Clarke, executor of <em>Elizabeth C. Peyton, </em>and the other plaintiffs, liberty to apply for a ^art^er decree to be paid out of any assets which might thereafter come to the hands of the administrators of <em>Morrow.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-4\">From the decree of September 1841, the defendants petitioned this court for an appeal, which was allowed them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">The errors assigned by the appellants in their petition for an appeal, were, 1st, that the act of March 8th, 1826, was a bar to the claim of the plaintiffs against the sureties of <em>Morroio's </em>administrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">2d. The administration accounts of <em>John Peyton's </em>administrators should have been opened at the instance of the sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">These questions were argued orally by <em>Leigh </em>for the appellants, and <em>Cooke </em>for the appellees, but the reporter was not in court at the time, and <em>therefore </em>cannot give a report of the argument. The objections to the decree, taken by the appellees, were argued by the same counsel in writing.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-8\"><em>Cooke, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ4N\">The first objection to the report of the commissioner, is the failure to charge interest on the payments made by the administrators to the distributees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-9\">Creditors may, in equity, pursue the estate of their deceased debtors in the hands of legatees, <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Lambert, </em>1 Wash. 308, and this even though the testator\u2019s effects would have been sufficient to pay both debts and legacies. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>2 Rob. Rep. 668; 1 Vern. 162.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b462-10\">The principle on which this right of the creditor rests, is that the legatee having got into his possession a fund equitably bound for the payment of the decedent\u2019s debts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>he is a trustee for the creditor. And if he be a trustee, lie must, on the well established principles regulating trusts, account for the interest of the trust fund in his hands, as well as for the principal, if the interest as well as the principal be necessary to satisfy the charge upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-7\">If the creditors, instead of pursuing their remedy against the legatees, proceed against the executor, and obtain a judgment or decree against him, the executor shall have his remedy against the legatee to compel him to refund. <em>Bowers\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. Glendening, 4 Munf. 219; <em>Burnley </em>v. <em>Lambert, supra. </em>Neither of these cases state the principle <em>upon </em>which this doctrine is founded; but this is done in the case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>2 Rob. Rep. 664, and it is placed solely on the ground of substitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-10\">These authorities are decisive of the question now under consideration. The creditor in this case, <em>E. C. Peyton, </em>having established her debt against <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>estate, by the decree of 1830, had then a right, and has it still, to proceed against the distributees as trustees holding a trust fund, equitably bound to discharge her whole claim against the intestate\u2019s estate, and as trustees they would have been compelled to account for both principal and interest of that fund. Rut she has proceeded against the administrators, and as the remedy of the administrators over against the distributees extends to principal and interest, there can be no reason why their liability should be less. On this question the court is referred to <em>Spode </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 502; <em>Kippen Co. </em>v. <em>Carr\u2019s ex\u2019x, </em>4 Munf. 119; <em>Gallego\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>The Attorney General, </em>3 Leigh 450; and <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Day, </em>Amb. 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-13\">The second objection to the commissioner\u2019s report, is that he allows the administrators credit for the amount of the simple contract debts due to them from <em>Morrow.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>All the text books and a multitude of cases lay down the rule that an executor or administrator has a right to retain for his own debt, due to him from the deceased, in preference to all other creditors of equal degree. But privilege is accompanied with this limitation, that he shall not retain his own debt as against those of a higher degree. Williams on Ex\u2019ors 685; Ram. on Assets, 8 Law Libr. 174, 175. These writers refer to many cases for the principle they state, and among them all there seems to be no exception to the rule growing out of the circumstances of the case. Tested by this rule, it is clear that the administrators are not entitled to retain their simple contract debts against the specialty debts of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-6\">But it is said that a retainer by an administrator stands on the same footing as a payment, and as an administrator will be protected in paying simple contract debts, where he has no notice of debts of higher dignity, and will also be protected in such payments, as against contingent securities, where the condition is not yet broken, so it is insisted he will be authorized to retain for his own debt in such cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b464-7\">The reason given for the rule, which justifies a payment by an administrator of a debt of inferior dignity when he had no notice of a debt of higher dignity, is \u201c that otherwise it would be in the power of a superior creditor to ruin an executor by suppressing his security till all the assets were exhausted in the payment of debts of inferior degree.\u201d Williams on Ex\u2019ors 676-7, citing 3 Bac. Abr. 82, title Ex\u2019ors L.; 2 Fonb. Equ. book 4, ch. 2, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 2, note m., p. 406, who cites <em>Britton </em>v. <em>Bathurst, </em>3 Lev. 113. This is the only reason given for this exception to the general rule, and this reason does not apply to the case of a retainer by the administrator. In the first case the administrator has paid away the assets, and if required to pay a debt of higher dignity after-wards, he must pay it out of his own estate : but in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>case of a retainer by the administrator, the fund remains in his hands, and the delay of the superior creditor in asserting his claim, instead of ruining the administrator, only gives him the advantage of using the money at legal interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-4\">Although no reason is given in the books for the rule, that an administrator may pay a simple contract debt, as against a contingent security, where the contingency has not occurred, yet that reason seems to be, that perchance there never may be a breach of the condition of the bond, and consequently no debt. And therefore it is more conformable to natural equity to pay at once a debt which certainly exists, though it be a debt of inferior dignity, and so defeat the contingent and superior debt altogether, than to keep the actual creditor waiting an indefinite number of years in contemplation of an event, which may never happen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-5\">But in deciding the question, whether the administrator may retain his own inferior, but actual debt against a superior, but contingent debt, there is no necessity to choose between these alternatives. By allowing the administrator to retain until the superior, though contingent debt becomes an actual and absolute debt, the fund is not placed beyond recall, but is ready, when the superior debt becomes an actual debt, to discharge it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-6\">The true right of retainer then, is a right to retain against debts of equal dignity, and until a debt of superior dignity is established; and then the right of retainer ceases. This temporary right of retainer we have never disputed, and no greater, or other right of retainer can exist, while the rule remains in force that \u201can administrator shall not retain for his own debt against a debt of superior dignity.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-7\">The counsel referred to some other errors in the report of the commissioner, but they were matters of fact and detail, and involved no disputed principle.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AXca\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A11\">Upon the right of the ad-ministrators 1\u00b0 retain for the debts due themselves, the counsel for the appellees and myself, are agreed as to general principles\u2014we differ as to the application of f;heiiL An executor or administrator may retain his own debt due from the deceased, in preference to all debts of equal degree; but not in preference to debts of superior degree. If a reasonable time has elapsed since the decedent\u2019s death, and he has no notice of any debts of superior degree to the debt demanded of him, he is justified in paying the debt demanded, and majr plead it in bar of a debt of superior degree afterwards demanded. And with respect to bonds with collateral condition, of which the condition has not been broken, he may pay a debt of inferior dignity without regarding the superior dignity of such bond, whose condition has not yet been broken, though it may be at any moment. So far we agree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-4\">The counsel for the appellees contends, 1st, for a distinction between the payment of a debt to a creditor, and the retaining a debt due to the representative himself ; and 2dly, he contends that a debt due by bond, whether the administrator has notice of it or not at the time he pays or retains a simple contract debt, is a debt of higher degree than the simple contract debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b466-5\">1. The case of <em>Shearman </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>9 Leigh 571, has settled the principle that the retainer of a debt due to the administrator himself, and the payment of a debt to another, stands upon the same footing; and that wherever the payment of a debt to a stranger will be a good administration, the retainer of a similar debt by the administrator will also be good. This court held in that case that a retainer was a payment. If this is not so, then the administrator stands not on an equal footing with other creditors. But in fact there is no distinction between paying and retaining a debt. Retaining is paying. <em>Blackstone </em>says, among debts of equal degree the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>executor or administrator is allowed to <em>pay </em>himself first by <em>retaining </em>in his hands so much as his debt amounts to. 2 Comm. 511. So he says, the law gives an executor or administrator a remedy for his debt by allowing him to <em>retain </em>so much as will pay himself before any other creditors of equal degree. 3 Id. p. 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-6\">2. \u201cAn administrator has a right to retain as against creditors in equal degree, but not as against creditors of superior degree.\u201d The counsel for the appellees and I dififer upon the question, what is a debt of superior degree to a simple contract debt in due course of administration. He thinks that a bond debt is, under all circumstances, a debt of superior degree to a simple contract debt\u2014that a debt claimed on an executorial bond, before breach of the condition, is a debt of superior degree to a simple contract debt. I say that if an administrator wait a reasonable time to give bond creditors an opportunity to assert their claims, and receive no notice of any such, he may pay or retain a simple contract debt, and that in such case the bond debt is not of superior degree to the simple contract debt; and the proof is, that the payment of the simple contract without notice of the bond debt, may be pleaded in bar of the action on the bond. I say farther, that a debt claimed on an executor\u2019s bond, is not a debt of superior degree to a simple contract debt, till the condition of the bond is broken and the breach ascertained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b467-7\">In the present case, <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus </em>took upon themselves the administration of <em>Morrow's </em>estate, eight years before they had notice that their intestate was one of the sureties of <em>Peyton's </em>administrators, and eleven years before it was ascertained that the condition of that bond was broken. By the common law, if they waited a \u201creasonable time,\u201d to give creditors by bond an opportunity to assert their claims, and received no notice of such claims, they had a right to pay or retain simple contract debts. It may be doubted what is \u201c a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>reasonable time,\u201d but surely eight years will more than meet its demands. Our act of 1825-6, Supp. Rev. Code, ch. 200, \u00a7 5, has fixed this reasonable time to nine , months.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvU\">3. allowance of credits to <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus, </em>respectively, of interest on their payments to the distributees of their intestate, presents a question which has never yet been decided by this court. Every case of this kind must be decided mainly upon its own peculiar circumstances; and though general principles may aid us in estimating the influence of circumstances, yet circumstances may take any case out of the influence of such general principles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-9\">The record does not inform us, what was the nature of the payments made by the administrators to the distributees. One thing only is certain\u2014the administrators did not make a general distribution of the estate; in which case, the law authorizes them to require refunding bonds to indemnify them against debts outstanding and unforeseen. All they did was to make <em>partial advances </em>to the distributees\u2014advances (I have no doubt, though it does not distinctly appear) for their maintenance and education: one of the advances was <em>\u201c </em>162 dollars for boarding &amp;c. of the <em>Misses </em>MorrowAt the time these advances were made, <em>Morrow\u2019s \u201c </em>estate was greatly more than sufficient to pay off the debts then known to\u201d the administrators. And the question is, whether, under such circumstances, they did more than their duty in making <em>partial advances </em>to the distributees without taking refunding bonds at each advance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b468-10\">If these distributees were <em>infants </em>at the time the advances were made, it is certain that the administrators cannot reclaim the money of them, to satisfy the claims of a creditor afterwards established, though not then foreseen. The record does not shew whether they were infants or of full age; but whatever is necessary to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>port the decree of the court below, ought to be presumed, unless the contrary appears. If an executor pay over the assets to legatees, and a creditor afterwards appears, the creditor may pursue the assets in the hands of the legatees, and the executor may be subrogated to the rights of the creditor\u2014this was the opinion of this court in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Newman, </em>2 Rob. Rep. 664. But that opinion had reference to a <em>general distribu,lion </em>of the assets, and to a distribution among <em>adult </em>legatees. The case does not go the length of saying, that a creditor, or by subrogation to him the executor, can recover of the legatees partial advances made by him to the legatees, especially if the legatees at the time of the advances made to them were infants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-5\">The statute of <em>Virginia, </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 104, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 58, p. 389, provides, that \u201c no distribution shall be made of an intestate\u2019s estate, until nine months after his <em>death; </em>nor shall an administrator be <em>compelled </em>to make distribution at any time, until bond and security be given by the persons entitled to distribution, to refund due proportions of any debts or demands which may afterwards appear against the intestate, and the costs attending the recovery of such debts.\u201d It is most obvious, that the provision has respect to a general distribution of assets, and not at all to partial advances to distributees <em>\u2022 </em>and that the administrators, in the present case, were under no duty to require refunding bonds, even if the distributees had been of full age ; and in practice, such a thing is unheard of. What the administrators have done, is what every man in their situation would and ought to have done.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b469-6\">Executors and administrators are, in this country, as they ought to be, held to a very strict account\u2014but to hold them liable for every cent they advance to the distributees, <em>without having a,ny notice of, or any reason to suspect, any outstanding debt, </em>and not only liable for the sums advanced, but accountable to the creditor for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>interest on those sums, which they have never them- . selves used, and never made any interest or profit from, were to hold them to an extent of responsibility, which will make every prudent man extremely cautious, how he undertakes so onerous a trust. A man dies, leaving children, and an estate amply sufficient for their support and for the payment of all his debts known to exist\u2014 the children stand in need of food, raiment, lodging\u2014 is the administrator to let them starve or perish with cold ? Is he to wait, and how long is he to wait, before he supplies them necessaries, in order to see whether any claim can be set up against his intestate\u2019s estate, on an old executorial bond in which his intestate was a surety? And are the distributees to starve, or to live upon charity, in the interval ? And if the administrator makes partial advances to them, and years afterwards an old executorial bond is made the foundation of a claim against the intestate, shall the administrator not only be held liable to the extent of the advances, but liable also to interest on such advances, of which he has not himself made any interest or profit? There is not, and there cannot be, any law which justifies such rigour. If, indeed, the administrator can be charged with notice, or with a suspicion on reasonable grounds, that the assets are insufficient for payment of debts, then he may be held responsible for partial advances to the distributees, and interest upon the sums advanced; and such, I apprehend, must have been the state of the case of <em>Giles </em>v. Dyson, 1 Stark. N. P. 32; 2 Com. Law Rep. 282.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b470-5\">The present case is yet more remarkable. The claim of <em>Keith </em>arose in <em>1804\u2014Elizabeth Peyton\u2019s </em>right to be subrogated to that claim arose in 1819, which was the very year in which <em>Worthington </em>and <em>Cookus </em>qualified as the administrators of <em>Morrow; </em>and she had, in 1819, the right to call the administrators to an account of <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>estate. If she had done so, no <em>partial advances </em>would have been made to <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>distribu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>tees. But her claim was not asserted till 1827, and then asserted in the case of <em>Grayson </em>v. <em>Peyton\u2019s heirs. </em>In the mean time, the administrators made the <em>partial advanees </em>to <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>distributees; and she now claims, that those partial advances, made in consequence of her own <em>laches </em>in the prosecution of her claim, shall be accounted for by the administrators, and that they shall be charged therewith, with interest on the sums advanced. Can such a claim be just ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-4\">So far from allowing the charges of interest on the partial advances, I doubt very much, to say the least, whether the full amount of the advances ought not to be credited to the administrators as of the date when they were made. I say this upon a view of the particular circumstances of this case\u2014I arn not asserting a general proposition applicable to all cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-5\">In 2 Williams on Ex\u2019ors, p. 1106, it is stated, that it is not a <em>devastavit \u201c </em>to pay over the whole of the assets to the legatees or distributees, so as to leave nothing to satisfy a claimant for valuable consideration, if the executor had no notice of the existence of the demand, and a reasonable time had elapsed after the death of the testator before the payment by the executor to the legatees or next of kin,\u201d for which the writer cites without a word of disapprobation or doubt the case of <em>Chelsea Waterworks </em>v. Cowper, 1 Esp. N. P. Cas. <em>275. </em>I do not see that either <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Day, </em>or <em>Kippen </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>cited by the counsel on the other side, is contrary to <em>Chelsea Waterworks </em>v. <em>Cowper, </em>on the point on which the latter is cited as authority here, to shew that the advances made by <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>administrators to <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>distributees, ought to be allowed as credits to them against the claim of <em>Elizabeth C. Peyton </em>as a creditor of <em>Peyton\u2019s </em>estate under the circumstances of this case. To hold them liable to the extent of these advances to the distributees, is to make them liable for losses arising from the <em>laches </em>of the creditor herself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>But our question is, not merely whether they are to account to this creditor, calling on them thus lately when she might have made her demand against them the moment they qualified, for the advances they made ^he distributees, but whether they are to account to her, not only for the amount of these advances, but for <em>interest thereon ? </em>I say, that supposing them accountable for the <em>principal </em>sums advanced to the distributees, they ought to be exempted from the payment of interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-4\">Interest is a compensation for the use of money enjoyed. The administrators never enjoyed the use of the money they advanced to the distributees, and cannot be charged with interest upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-5\">It is on that principle, that if an executor neglect to recover money due to his testator\u2019s estate, which with due diligence he might have recovered, though he shall be held accountable for the <em>principal, </em>he is exempted from the <em>interest. </em>I always understood that the decision in <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Colston, </em>that an executor who might with due diligence have collected a debt, but failed to do so, was accountable for the <em>principal, </em>but ought not to be charged with the <em>interest, </em>was founded on the principle, that he ought not to be charged with interest on money which he never enjoyed the use of, and could not receive interest or profits from. The only ground on which an executor is ever charged with interest, is that he might and ought to have made interest, or used the money himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-6\">In <em>Kippen </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>there is not a word said about interest. Suppose that, in fact, interest was adjudged in that case,\u2014is a decision in which the point was nowise considered, to be regarded as a decision of the point ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-7\">In <em>Spode </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Russ. 511; 3 Eng. Condens. Ch. Rep. 502, the executor, <em>with full notice of the existence of debts to a large amount, </em>(near \u00a3 19,000.) <em>immediately upon the death of his testator, </em>allowed a specific legatee to take and keep possession of specific legacies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>to the amount of <em>\u00a3 </em>8000. and more, under an impression that the sale of real estate which his testator had made in his lifetime would be ample for the payment of all debts. The sale was objected to\u2014and it was still a question whether it could be enforced. Upon a bill by creditors for administration of the estate, the executor was held responsible for the value of the specific legacies, <em>which he had immediately </em>delivered to the legatees, with 4 per cent, interest. And this case is quoted as authority to prove, that administrators, who <em>some years after Ihe death of their intestate, without notice of any demand against his estate, </em>made partial advances to the distributees, ought to be charged, not only with the moneys advanced, but with interest on the sums advanced! and charged with interest to a creditor, who was herself guilty of <em>laches </em>in not asserting her claim before the advances were made! The case is not authority to any such purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-4\">4.

Peyton </em>claiming to be a creditor of <em>John Peyton\u2019s </em>estate, in the year <em>18%7, </em>became a party to the suit of <em>Robert O. Grayson </em>and <em>Benjamin Grayson </em>against the administrators of said <em>John Peyton, </em>deceased, the securities of those administrators and the administrators of <em>John Morrow, </em>who was one of those securities; that this suit was in the nature of a suit on the administration bond, seeking to charge the administrators of <em>John Peyton, </em>deceased, with a debt, and the securities of said administrators with a <em>devastavit; </em>and in that suit it was competent for her to sue the administrators of <em>John Morrow, </em>who was a security of the administrators of <em>John Peyton, </em>according to the terms of the 63d section of the act concerning executors and administrators, 1 R. C. ch. 104, which gives the right to prosecute a suit against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>the administrators and their securities, or the executors and administrators of either of them, upon the official bond; but that in such action on the administration bond given by the administrators of <em>John Peyton, </em>deceasedj i* would not have been regular to have joined the sureties in the administration bond given by the administrators of said <em>Morrow, </em>who was one of the securities in the bond given by said <em>Peyton\u2019s </em>administrators. The liability of said <em>Morrow </em>as a surety to the plaintiff was contingent, and of the sureties of his administrators still more so. It would not have been regular, in the administrators of said <em>Morrow, </em>to have applied the assets of their intestate to pay the plaintiff\u2019s claim until it had been first ascertained, that the plaintiff was a creditor of <em>John Peyton\u2019s </em>estate, and secondly, that his administrators had committed a <em>devastavit, </em>for which their securities were liable. These facts were ascertained by the decree pronounced on the 1st May 1830. This decree, first ascertaining the liability of said <em>Morroio, </em>authorized his administrators to apply the assets of his estate to the discharge thereof. If they had then so applied the assets of <em>Morroio\u2019s </em>estate, there would have been no breach of the condition of their administration bond. Until the plaintiff had established her claim to satisfaction out of those assets, she had no right to sue the securities on the bond for the faithful administration thereof. The failure and refusal so to apply <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>assets after her right to satisfaction thereout was ascertained, constituted a breach of the condition of their bond, and gave her cause of action. The court is therefore of opinion, that the recovery is not barred by the act, passed March 8th, 1826, for the limitation of actions against persons acting in a fiduciary character.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The court is further of opinion, that decrees in chancery equally with judgments at law, are embraced within the meaning of the 63d section of the act concerning executors and administrators, and that, accordingly, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>was decided by this court in the case of <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Beale, ante, </em>p. 229, that after a decree and a return of <em>nulla bona </em>on an execution, an action might be maintained on the administration bond.</p>\n<p id=\"AFJ\">The court is further of opinion, that there was no error in omitting to direct a resettlement of the accounts of <em>Peyton\u2019s </em>administrators at the suit of these securities. They were not interested in the controversy between the plaintiff and said administrators. They wore bound for the proper administration of <em>Morroto\u2019s </em>estate. The administrators were the proper parties to controvert the liability of their intestate. The decree of 1830 did not establish any debt from their principals, the administrators of <em>Morrow, </em>but from <em>Morrow </em>himself, and enabled their principals to apply the assets properly, the only question in which they were <em>interested; </em>it was immaterial to these securities whether the assets of <em>Morrow\u2019s </em>estate were paid to creditors or distributees, so they were faithfully applied. And the question whether the plaintiff had properly established her claim against <em>Peyton\u2019s </em>administrators and <em>Morrow </em>their security, was one in which they had no interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The court is further of opinion, that under any view of the case, the decree would be treated as <em>prima facie </em>correct, and under the circumstances disclosed here, after their principals had sought to impeach the decree by bill of review and failed, and they themselves after alleging the same objections taken by their principals in their bill of review, had failed to exhibit any evidence in support thereof, there was no error in the omission of the court to direct an account of the administration of <em>John Peyton\u2019s </em>estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The court is, therefore, of opinion, there is no error against the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">But the court is of opinion, that there is error as against the appellee, in this, that interest was not charged against the administrators for the sums paid the distri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>butees. The assets are first to be applied to the payment of the debts, and it is not competent for the administrators, by a voluntary payment to the distributees, and without taking a refunding bond, to lessen the am0u.nt of the assets. That the condition of a refunding bond to refund due proportions of any debts or demands, would have bound the distributees to have accounted for the sums received, with interest from the time when received. And the omission of the administrators to take such refunding bonds, which, under the act of March 8, 1826, might have protected them from suit, should not place the creditors in a worse condition. The court is of opinion, that this error in the settlement of the accounts appearing on the face of the report, advantage may be taken of it without exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The court is further of opinion, that though it is permitted to an executor to retain for his own debt, as against debts of equal degree, there is no warrant for the doctrine that he may retain as against debts of superior dignity. In the first case, he is permitted to retain upon the principle that he cannot sue himself, but no such reason applies to the second case. The assets are to be applied in due course of administration, to the debts, according to their dignity. A failure so to apply them, subjects the executor to a <em>devastavit </em>in the general. But where after a certain period they are applied to the payment of debts of inferior dignity, without notice of debts of superior dignity, the application, though not in due course of administration, exempts the executor from liability, because of the <em>laches of </em>the creditor by debt of superior dignity, in failing to give notice of his claim before the executor has parted with the assets, or because no creditor entitled to immediate satisfaction ought to be postponed, and the assets held up to await a contingent and collateral liability, which may never be established. In such cases, the law excuses the application of the assets to debts of inferior dignity; and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>no recovery could be had from the creditor, who has received no more than he was entitled to, and the executor has parted with the assets in good faith, it would be unjust to hold him accountable. But these reasons do not apply to the case of retainer; the assets have not been paid away, the executor has had the use of them, he must be presumed to have retained with the knowledge of his accountability to creditors whose debts were of higher dignity. Any other rule would hold out inducements to executors and administrators to deny notice of outstanding debts of superior dignity, so as to retain for their own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"ATi\">The court is, therefore, of opinion, that the exceptions to the allowance of credits for various sums retained by the administrators in satisfaction of claims due to them by simple contract, should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The court is further of opinion, that there are other errors apparent on the face of the report, in the mode of deducting the interest upon the sums paid the distributees, and in the calculations by which the sums mentioned in the decree were arrived at, but as the opinion of the court, as already expressed, will render a restatement and remodelling of the account necessary, it is unnecessary to correct such erroneous calculations and statements at this time. The decree is, therefore, reversed, with costs to the appellees, as the parties substantially prevailing, so far as it conflicts with this opinion, and is affirmed for the residue, and the cause is remanded to the court below, for a restatement of the account of the administration on the said <em>Morroio\u2019s </em>estate, and to be further proceeded in according to the principles of this decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
