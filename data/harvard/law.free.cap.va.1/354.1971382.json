A suit was instituted by <em>Tfebber and </em>wife, in the former General Court, on the Chancery side, against the father of the appellant and of Mrs. <em>Webber, </em>stating that the father had, by a deed executed in 1754, conveyed to his said daughter, whilst single, several tracts of land, together with sixteen slaves, and all the furniture and stocks on those plantations. That previous to this deed, and before her marriage, the father had frequently declared his intention to give his daughter the greatest part of his estate, if she should marry to please hinp That in consequence of these promises, the co'mpl\u00e1inant addressed the daughter and married her. . ,That the father, after executing the deed, got possession' of it surreptitiously, and cancelled it. The object of the bill was to set up the deed. The answer of the father denied the- material allegations in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>bill; admitted the existence of the deed, daughter that it married to was made on condition that the please him, which she did not</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AFfX\">Upon the death of the father, the suit was revived against the appellant, the son, and against the executors, and a decree was made in that Court, in favour of the complainant, as to the land, and part of the slaves, which were in the possession of the defendant The same plaintiffs, afterwards, instituted a suit in the High Court of Chancery, for the balance of the negroes. The appellants filed a bill to \u2019-eview the former decree; and that being opened, the whole question came on again to be heard and considered. The ground now relied upon by the appellants to set aside the former decree, as well as to defend the last suit, is, that the father, at the time of making the deed labored under a prosecution which threatened his life, and that the deed was executed, in order to screen his estate from forfeiture, in case he was convicted, and under a trust, to re-convey the estate to the father, if he should get clear of the prosecution. Sundry depositions were taken, upon the'weight of which, the present cause very much depended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-8\"><em>The Chancellor, </em>dismissed the bill of review, and decreed for the appellees upon their bill, from which decree, this appeal was prayed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b375-9\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-10\">It might perhaps be made a question in this cause, whether the deed of 1754, being made without consideration, can deserve the aid of a Court of Equity to set it up ? But as this is a point upon which I do not rely, I shall pass it over, and insist, that there are circumstances in this case, which would render it iniquitous in a Court of Equity to aid the plaintiffs, and that it will therefore leave them in the situation the law has placed them. That there waj trust and confidence between the father an&lt; is so strongly to be presumed from circumstE aided by the positive evidence of one of the the fact can scarcely be doubted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b375-11\">1 st, the <em>time </em>when the deed was made, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>then labouring under a perilous prosecution, which he to have been very apprehensive would affect his life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-6\">2dly.

The various expressions of the father about that time, indicating his apprehensions, and the mode by which he expected to save his estate, (all of which are abundantly proved,) at a time too, when it is not to be supposed, he was preparing for future litigation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuF\">4thly. The father continuing in possession of the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b376-9\">These circumstances, strong as they are by themselves, are very much strengthened by a fact proved and admitted, <em>viz </em>: that the daughter declared, that the deed for one parcel :-,f land (about which there is no dispute,) was to be recorded, but that the other (which is the deed in question,) was not to be recorded. The fact is, that one deed was recorded, and the other was not, which proves, that as to the deed which was not intended to be recorded, a mere trust was understood. If then the Court be satisfied that.a trust was intended, its aid will not be afforded in an attempt to violate that trust.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-10\">Warden, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b376-11\">Before the deed was made, or a prosecution apprehended, it is in full proof, that the father had frequently made parol declarations of his intention to give the greater part of his estate to his daughter when she married. If the deed in question had not been made, this Court would have decreed a specific performance of those promises ; being made, it must be considered as done in execution of them. The title of the daughter therefore is paramount to, not dependent upon that deed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-12\">Campbell, upon the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axc\">I lay down this as a principle of Equity not to be controverted, <em>viz </em>: that where a father makes a deed to a child, it will be considered as an advancement and not a trust. 2 <em>Vern. </em>19\u201428\u2014436. <em>Eq. Cas. Ab. </em>382. 1 <em>Vern. </em>467. 2 <em>Ch. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Cas. </em>26. 231. The principal circumstances relied upon in this case to establish a trust, is the proof of fraud intended by the father, for the purpose of defeating the Crown of its eventual dues. It would be strange, if a person who hath committed a fraud, could be permitted to defend himself by averring it. It is not pretended that this trust was declared in the deed itself, and parol evidence is relied upon, not to explain a doubtful construction, but to establish one, totally different in its operation, from that which the real deed upon the face of it imported; and this, no Court has ever yet gone so far as to suffer. Even in the case of last wills, evidence is received with great caution, and even then only, to rebut an equity. 2 Vern. 98. 337. 648. 736.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-6\">The first point having been given up, it will be unnecessary to take up time in proving, that a Court of Equity will aid a volunteer against a volunteer. But if it should be doubted, I will refer the Court to the following cases, 1 <em>Vern. </em>219. 365\u2014464. 2 <em>Vern. </em>473. 1 <em>P. </em>Wms. 60.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-8\">Marshall, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABd\">A Court of Equity will never lend its aid to set up a deed, (though destroyed by fraud) if it would do iniquity. I may go farther, and say, that it will not even assist in setting up a hard and oppressive deed. It is contended, that independent of the deed, this Court would enforce a specific performance of the parol promises of the father. But there is abundant proof, that those promises were conditional, and that the father was always strongly opposed to the marriage of his daughter with <em>Webber. </em>Besides, the bill does not claim the property upon that ground; those promises are not put in issue, and of course the evidence, as to them, is irrelevant to the real merits of the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b377-10\">The principle contended for by Mr. <em>Campbell, </em>that every thing is to be presumed against him who commits a fraud, applies not to this case, because there is no dispute between us, as to the contents of the deed. If there were, then I admit, that every thing should be presumed against the person who destroyed the deed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>But I contend that the deed, though absolute on the face of it, was intended to pass a beneficial interest, only in case the grantor should be convicted, and that a resulting trust was meant, in the event of his escaping the prosecution. Whether the fact be so or not, depends upon the evidence. I admit, therefore, that if this case were unconnected with those circumstances relied upon to prove a trust, the deed would be considered as an advancement to -the daughter, in which case the authorities cited would apply. But since a child may as well as any other person be a trustee for a father, evidence to establish the trust may as properly be admitted in such a case, as if the conveyance were made to a stranger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-8\">I do not contend, that if <em>Ward </em>had applied to the Court to <em>set aside </em>the deed, he would have been entitled to its aid : but on the other hand that Court will not assist the <em>daughter </em>to <em>set up </em>the deed. For if the father were guilty of a fraud by intending to defeat the Crown of its rights, she was <em>particeps criminis, </em>and can be in no better situation than he is. We ask no favors, nor do we 'require the aid of the Court; we only desire that none may be granted to the other side, but that the parties may be left where the law has placed them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b378-9\">As to the propriety of admitting parol evidence in this case, I do not contend that it ought to be received to <em>explain, </em>orto <em>contradict the words </em>of a written contract; but it is every day?s practice to admit such evidence to prove a <em>secret trust. </em>As for instance, to convert a deed absolute upon its face into a mortgage, which is a case parallel with this. So, too, the establishment of resulting trusts depends almost always upon parol evidence varying the nature of the written deed. Upon the whole, I rely upon this principle, that though Equity may aid a volunteer in setting up a deed against another volunteer, yet the plaintiff in such a case must have complete equity, and must come to ask relief wdth clean hands.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b378-10\">Campbell.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKj9\">The case stated of an absolute deed being considered as a mortgage is not apposite to this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>because in that, it is a fraud in the grantee not to insert the defeasance. Besides, the mortgagee is active, and is a real purchaser; whereas, in this case, the daughter is merely passive, and cannot be guilty of a fraud in accepting the deed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b379-5\">Marshall.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AK8\">If he who conveys, commits a fraud, the receiver, knowing of it, is equally guilty, because to all deeds there must be at least two parties, and if there were no fraudulent grantees, there could be no fraudulent grantors. A mere volunteer may as well be guilty of a fraud, as he who pays a valuable consideration, and all trustees are volunteers.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b379-6\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AJq\">delivered the opinion of the ' Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">The first point mentioned, though not relied upon, was, that Equity will not aid one volunteer against another, but will leave them to the Law, their equity being equal. It is generally true, that this Court will not aid a volunteer in <em>supplying legal defects </em>in a prior deed, against a subsequent volunteer. But there are exceptions to this general rule, one of which is, the cases of advancements for younger children, otherwise unprovided for, in favor of whom the Court will supply such legal defects. The counsel probably considering this as such a case, did not press the objection; but he insisted, that applicants to this Court must come with clean hands, and a fair case, as this Court will not enforce iniquitous, or even hard bargains.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">As to. the first, the whole proceeded from the father, and if there were any evil in his intentions, it is not to be imputed to the daughter, who was wholly passive, and used no means either fair or otherwise to procure the deed. Nor can it be thought immoral in her to accept the voluntary bounty of her father, securing to her a provision for life. Natural aifection imposes upon parents a moral obligation to provide for their children, and it hath been esteemed, both in Law and inEquity, a good consideration for supporting such provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">As to the second branch of the objection ; it is true <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that the Court will never decree iniquity; and there . are instances where they have refused to decree hard bargains, though fair ; but these are rare, and are generally cases of glaring hardships. For, in general, the Court will not undertake to estimate the speculations of parties in a contract, but will deem them\u2019 the best judges of their own views, and will compel a performance, though they may be eventually disappointed in their expectations. As to iniquity, the Court discovers none in this case, at least on the part of the daughter, and, upon the ground of hardship, how does it appear <em>? </em>It is suggested, that the father left himself nothing to subsist upon ; but the fact is not proved. On the contrary, it being charged in the original bill, that he had a considerable estate, he who best knew the truth or falsity of the assertion, does not deny it, nor does he complain of hardship, but rests his defence on quite another ground, viz. that the promise was conditional, and was broken by the daughter. So that the principles of the objection do not apply to the present case. If they did, it might be worthy of consideration, whether the present application <em>to restore a deed to its legal force, which it had lost by fraud or </em>accident, is not distinguishable from an application to <em>supply original defects </em>in a deed. The difference seems to be a strong one, and the Court recollect the case of application to supply defects in bonds against sureties, which is Constantly refused ; yet if a bond in which they are <em>legally </em>bound be lost, the Court will not on account of the sureties, withhold the usual relief in giving it the same validity as if it were produced. The argument seems <em>a </em>fortiori, that a-deed, deprived of its legal force by fraud in the donor, will be restored, though in a hard case, the Court considering that as undone, which should have been done; but, as I said before, it is unnecessary to decide this point, since the facts do not support the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Two other objections remain to be considered. 1st\u00bb That the promise was conditional and broken. As to this, there is no proof,</p>\n<p id=\"b381-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>2d. That there was an implied trust for the father, In case he survived the impending prosecution for felony. Upon this head, the proof is generally derived from the vaunting declarations of the father, that he had secured his estate to his children ; that he would face his enemies, and was a proper person to go to law. Mrs. <em>Cotterel </em>is a positive witness, that when he delivered the deed to his daughter, he said, it was not to have effect if his life were saved; and the circumstances stated by the counsel might have weight to induce a presumption of the trust, if there were nothing to encounter them\u2014'but there is abundant proof to over-rule both.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\">1st. The deed was absolute\u2014without trust or condition\u2014if the former could not safely be inserted, the latter might, and ought to have been, in order to prevent imposition upon her future husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">2dly. There were three subscribing witnesses to the deed, and a fourth present, who did not subscribe it, all of whom swear that no mention was made at the time of either trust or condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">3dly. Mrs. <em>Woodson?s </em>deposition is material\u2014she says, that when <em>Ward </em>was speaking of the condition and trust, he was asked if there were any agreement at the time, either verbal or in writing, to that purpose, and he answered there was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">4thly. As to the trust <em>.\u2014Ward </em>himself, who certainly knew more of the matter than Mrs. <em>Cotterel, </em>does not mention it in his answer\u2014whereas, he ought to have relied upon it, if it were true, and ought to have brought a cross bill to discover and establish the trust\u2014He did neither, and upon what ground can it now be set up ?</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The decree must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
