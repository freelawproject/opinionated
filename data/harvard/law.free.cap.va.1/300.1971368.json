Admitting <em>Judith </em>to be an <em>Indian, </em>that she was, nevertheless, a slave. 2dly. That it does not sufficiently appear that she was an <em>Indian, </em>entitled to freedom. 3dly. That the plaintiffs cannot recover in <em>this </em>action, though both these points be against me.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b320-16\">1st. The first Act respecting <em>Indians, </em>passed in the year 1662, c. 136, <em>Purv. Ed. of the Laws, </em>p. 96, which does not relate to the subject of slaves. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>next was in 1670, c. 12s p. 172, which enacts, that all servants, not Christians, imported into this country by shipping, shall be slaves for life, but that those who come by land, shall serve for a limited time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APN\">The next law passed in 1672, c. 8, p. 181, which speaks of <em>Indian </em>slaves, or servants for life, and proves that the Act of 1670 did not prevent <em>Indians </em>from being made slaves. The Act of 1679, c. 1, p. 235, declares, that <em>Indian </em>prisoners taken in war should be free purchase to the captor. Then comes the Act of 1682, c. 1, p. 282, which repeals that part of the Law of 1670, relating to slaves, and enacts, \u201c that all servants, (except <em>Turks </em>and Moors, whilst in amity with his Majesty,) which shall be brought or imported into this country by sea or land, whether <em>Negroes, </em>Moors, <em>Mulattoes, </em>or <em>Indians, </em>who, and whose parents and n ative country were not Christian, at the time of the fi rst purchase of such servants by some Christian, though afterwards, and before such their importation and bringing into this country, they shall be converted to the Christian faith, and all <em>Indians </em>which shall be hereafter sold by our neighbouring <em>Indians, </em>or any other trafficking with us, and for as slaves, are deemed to be slaves, to all intents and purposes.\u201d The act of. 1705, c. 49, which is re-enacted by the acts of 1748 and 1756 declares, e\u2018 that all servants, Imported and brought into this country by sea or land, who were not Christians in their native county, (except <em>Turks </em>and <em>Moors </em>in amity with his Majesty, and others that can make due proof of their being free in England, or in any other Christian country, before they were shipped, in order for transportation hither,) shall be accounted and be slaves, and, as such, may be bought and sold, notwithstanding a conversion to Christianity.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-3\">It is true, that in this law, there is a repealing clause of all other laws within the purview of it; yet, as this law differs not materially from that of 1682, it cannot be considered as intended to repeal that, but is merely a revision and collection of all the laws upon the subject. The Act of 1682, makes slaves of <em>Indians </em>with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>in our territory, which this act does not, and therefore part of the former law may be repealed by this\u00bb I am aware, that a notion has prevailed, that <em>Indians </em>couW not be made slaves; this can only be accounted for, by considering the opinion, as applying to <em>Indians within the limits of this country.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnT\">2dly. The verdict is so insufficiently found, that no judgment can be entered upon it. It finds, that <em>Judith </em>was an <em>Indian, descendant of one ; </em>but it does not find <em>expressly, </em>that she was an <em>Indian. </em>Admitting the plaintiffs to be descendants from <em>Judith, </em>in the maternal line, it does not follow that they are <em>Indians intitled to freedom. </em>Suppose <em>Judith </em>had only been stated to be <em>descendant of an Indian, </em>that might as well have been in the paternal as maternal line. The jury in tracing the plaintiff's descent, derive it from <em>Judith </em>in the <em>maternal line ; </em>but when speaking of <em>Judith\u2019s </em>ancestry, they state her to be a descendant from an <em>Indian generally, </em>which shews that they understood the principle, that the issue, as to the question of slave or no slave, follows the condition of the mother. We may therefore fairly conclude, that the jury could not ascertain, in which line <em>Judith </em>was descended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKyO\">Thirdly, There is no principle of law better settled than this : that in personal torts, two or more cannot join as plaintiffs in the action, because the injury done to one, is not an injury to the other. I submit it therefore, whether upon this point, the present can be maintained.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Ant\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxV\">In favor of freedom, we are bound to construe all laws tending to its destruction, with the greatest strictness. From a view of all the Acts which have been cited, it is evident, that the Legislature never intended that <em>Indians generally, </em>should be made slaves, though some particular <em>Indians, </em>in special cases might. When therefore we speak of an <em>Indian, </em>unqualified by circumstances of any sort, we as certainly speak of a freeman, as if an <em>Englishman </em>had been mentioned. To associate the idea of slavery with the condition of this class of men, it is necessary to speak of them, as <em>Irb </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>tlians </em>of a <em>particular </em>description, who, by some law might lose their freedom. The preamble to the of 1705, c. 52, shews, that the design of it was to regu\u00edate trade and intercourse with <em>all Indians </em>whatsoever, proving thereby, the sentiments of the Legislature as to the free state of the Indians.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">If then, <em>Judith w </em>as <em>an </em>Indian, she was free\u2014if a descendant from one, the Court will presume her equally free, unless, they should presume the descent to be from such an <em>Indian, </em>as might by law be made a slave. For as Indians, generally speaking, are free, the presumption, (unless opposed by circumstances proving her to be of that description which might be made slaves,) will be, that the descent was from a free Indian\u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">The third objection is not a solid one. Actions of this sort are merely fictitious, and intended for the purpose of trying the single question, whether free or not? They are under the controul of the Court, as much as actions of ejectment, and will be so moulded, as to bring into view the only point to be tried, and to favour the most complete attainment of that object. Besides, it is a benefit to the master that they should all join.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-8\"><em>Marshall, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKf\">The Act of 1670, does not speak of <em>Indians </em>generally, but of such only, as are captured in war by each other, and sold to the whites. The Act of J679, does not make slaves of any, but only declares, to whom the property, <em>such as it is, </em>belongs. The <em>Indians </em>mentioned in the recital to the Act of 1682, (on whom alone that law operates,) are such only, as were captured by other <em>Indians </em>in war, and sold, as mentioned in the Act of 1670. This law speaks only of <em>Indian servants, </em>(not of <em>Indians </em>in general,) and authorizes such, as were held in servitude in their native country, to be made slaves, though <em>Indians </em>in general could not. But whatever may be the construction of these laws, I take the Act of 1705, to be conclusive upon the subject. It not only repeals, in <em>express </em>terms, all former laws upon the subject, but establishes an intercourse with the <em>Indian </em>na <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>tions, as with freemen\u2014it authorizes a free commerce with them. Is it usual for freemen to treat, or to trade with nations as free, the individuals of which, if caught, become slaves? The Act of 1705, therefore shews, that <em>Indians </em>in general could not be made slaves, but such of them only, as were <em>servants </em>in their own country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYK\">The Second objection goes to the insufficiency of the finding. But if I am right upon the first point, then it follows, that if <em>Judith </em>was an <em>Indian, </em>she was free, unless she were also found to come under that description of <em>Indians, </em>who, by law, might be made slaves. As to the alternative finding, the Court must presume, that <em>Judith </em>was a descendant from an <em>Indian </em>in the maternal line, because where marriages are unknown, the father can never be certainly ascertained ; the mother always may; and consequently, the presumption in all such cases is, that the descent, when generally spoken of, is in the maternal line. In the case of illegitimate issue,. the law acknowledges no father.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\">The third point I consider as being completely settled, by the affirmance of the judgment, obtained by <em>Tom and others </em>v. Jenkins, <em>(ante, </em>p. 123,) all of whom joined in one suit, in the <em>Northumberland </em>District Court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b324-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL3\">The act of 1705, (which I call the treaty law,) could only relate to <em>Indians </em>within our territory. First, because the preamble so states it; and secondly, because <em>Virginia </em>had no right to make regulations respecting <em>Indians </em>without her limits. This law is intended to regulate trade with <em>Indians, </em>considered in a rational point of view, which is by no means incompatible with the right, or the policy, of purchasing the individuals of those nations for slaves. Suppose this had been a Statute of the Parliament of <em>England </em>respecting a trade with <em>Guinea, </em>though that nation is acknowledged to be free, and is so treated, yet it would not follow, that a traffic carried on for the purchase of the individuals of that nation, as slaves, would be incompatible with that acknowledgment. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>admit that no <em>Indians, </em>but'such as were brought in, in a state of servitude, could be made slaves; but I contend, that <em>Judith\u2019s </em>situation was such, is fairly to be inferred from the verdict, which finds that <em>she was brought in bij Coleman, and held by him as a slave; </em>that is, brought in asa slave, and held as a slave, which is-the plain construction of the finding. The mother being stated to have been retained in slavery, is at least <em>prima facie </em>evidence that her posterity are so, and ought to require some opposing testimony to defeat it. If this be not the case, what, let me ask, will be the situation of our negro property? If the master, in every instance, is bound to prove his negro to be of that particular description which subjects him to slavery, there is not one in ten thousand instances where he could do so.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-6\">But upon the second point I still rely with confidence. If the finding <em>Judith </em>to be an <em>Indian, </em>is finding that she might be either free or a slave, it leaves the question as to that fact in a state of too much uncertainty, for a decision either way. This Court can presume nothing for, or against, the plaintiffs. As <em>individuals, </em>they may form their own conjectures as to the fact\u2014as Judges, the fact must be found for them, and that with certainty. But if presumption is to be let in, I must still controvert the rule mentioned by Mr. Marshall. A bastard is said not only to have no father, but no mother. He is <em>nulliusfilms*</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-7\">Marshall.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Ut\">The question seems to be narrowed to a single point; and that is, whether <em>Judith, </em>being found to be an <em>Indian, </em>unqualified by any circumstance, or description whatever, is sufficient, or can amount to a finding against the plaintiffs? Now I hold the rule to be, that where an affirmative is proven, and can only be defeated by a negative, the party who would claim a benefit under the negative, must prove it Thus, a verdict which finds, that the plaintiff\u2019s ancestor died seised, and that the plaintiff is his heirs need not find also that the ancestor died <em>intestate, </em>in order to perfect the plaintiff\u2019s title, but the defendant must prove that he did not die intestate, if being true' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>he would avail himself of that fact. Sober <em>t, Judith </em>is stated to be an Indian\u2014an <em>Indian </em>generally speaking is free.\u2014Butsome Indians are not free\u2014yet <em>Judith </em>is not found to be such an <em>Indian </em>as could not be free: the affirmative therefore being found, clear of the exceptions, the latter is not to be intended, so as to destroy the former. It is useless to cite cases to esta - blish such plain principles of law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-5\">Wickham.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfDB\">The cases cited, are not in point. The Court intended matter <em>collateral </em>to the issue, in order to sustain the verdict; but they did not, and could not, intend the <em>very point </em>in issue, for that would be in fact a finding of the Court, not of the jury. I will examine one of the cases. The dying intestate was a point merely collateral to the issue. But suppose the issue had expressly been, whether the person died intestate or not, would the finding in that case have been sufficient ? So here\u2014the point in issue is slavery or not: but whether in the affirmative or negative is not deducible from the verdict; for though <em>Judith </em>was an Indian, yet she might be either a slave., or free. Can this Court then intend that she was free? Surely not.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b326-6\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AR9\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AEd\">We considered the last point first, because if this were against the plaintiffs, it would have been unnecessary to decide the others. The objection, when applied to common cases of personal <em>torts, </em>is well foundedbut actions like the present are merely fictitious, and were, very properly, in this respect, liken ed to actions of ejectment. For if many persons may unite, as plaintiffs, to try a joint right to land, (which no doubt they may,) no good reason can be given, why they may not unite to try a joint right to freedom, as in the present case. Although suits for freedom may b instituted without the leave of the Court, yet it is usual to petition for such leave. The Court generally require the opinion of the Counsel upon the plaintiff\u2019s right | and if it appear that the plaintiff has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>probable cause for suing, the Court will make special orders for the purpose of protecting the plaintiff from the master\u2019s resentment, or ill treatment on that account, and for allowing him reasonable time to prepare for his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">As to the first point made at the bar, the Court are of opinion that the Act of 1705, is a complete repeal of all former laws on the subject, and that since that period, no <em>American </em>Indian, can be reduced into a state of slavery. <em>Foreign Indians </em>coming within the description of that Act, might be made slaves. When therefore, we speak of <em>Indians </em>generally, it is to be understood, that some might, but others might not he made slaves in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">This principle being ascertained, we were led to <em>s </em>consideration of the second point, which respects the Insufficiency of the finding. Upon this, the Court are. divided.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Two Judges think, that finding <em>Judith </em>to be an <em>Indian, brought in </em>by Coleman, without saying from whence, whether by sea, or land, is insufficient to warrant the judgment That whatever lengths the jury might have gone in presuming the fact, the Court cannot supply those circumstances, necessary to estab lish it. On the other hand, two lodges, presuming in favor of liberty, think that the verdict is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The judgment therefore must be affirnied.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b327-12\"> <em>Hudgins </em>v. <em>Wrights, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 133. <em>Pallas et. al. </em>v. <em>Hill et. </em>al. <em>Hen. </em>Munf. 149. <em>Butt </em>v. <em>Rachel, </em>4 Munf. 209.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
