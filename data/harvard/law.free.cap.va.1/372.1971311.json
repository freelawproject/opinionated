It was an action on the case,, brought by the appellees in the County Court, against <em>Barnett, Woolf oik </em>&amp;? <em>Co, </em>The declaration states, <em>u </em>that the defendants were indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum of 171/. <em>5s. 4d. </em>sterling money of <em>Great Britain, </em>worth in <em>Virginia </em>currency, 228/. <em>7s. </em>for so much advanced by the plaintiffs to <em>Forest \u00a3s?

The writ being served upon <em>Woo folk, </em>he pleaded, separately, the general issue; and an abatement of the suit was entered as to <em>Barnett, </em>who was returned \u201c no inhabitant.55 An order was made for taking the deposition of <em>Benjamin Stoddart, on </em>the part of the appellees, asid at a subsequent term, and after a jury had been sworn upon the above issue, and withdrawn, <em>Barnett, </em>as the record states, \u201c came into Court, and entered himself1 a <em>defendant </em>at the suit of <em>Watson </em>Es? <em>Urquhart, </em>and the said defendants acknowledged legal notice, as to the taking of the above deposition, and on the motion of the defendants, the suit was continued at their costs.55 At another day (it is stated) <em>u </em>the parties aforesaid came, as also a jury, who say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>upon their oaths, that the <em>defendants have not paid the debt in the declaration </em>mentioned, as in pleading they have alleged, and assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages, by occasion of the non-performance of that assumption, to 294/. 12s. current money.\u201d Upon this verdict, judgment was entered for the appellees. <em>Barnett </em>and <em>Woolfolk, </em>filed a bill of exceptions to the opinion of the Court, which admitted the deposition of <em>Benjamin Stoddart </em>to be read in evidence at the trial; the objection was made upon the score of incompetency. The substance of the deposition (which is spread at large upon the record) is, that <em>Barnett, Woolfolk, </em>U Co. shipped <em>to Forest </em>&amp;? <em>Stoddart, </em>sixteen hogsheads of tobacco, and drew on them for 240/. sterling, in favor of the appellees, who remitted the bill, and requested that it might be honored, though the tobacco should not produce that sum, agreeing to be answerable themselves to the drawees for the deficiency, if any. In consequence of this request, <em>Forest </em>Es\u2019 <em>Stoddart </em>paid the bill, although the tobacco netted only 68/. 14i. <em>8d. </em>sterling; that <em>Forest Stoddart </em>have since demanded, and received from the plaintiffs, the balance due from <em>Barnett, Woolfolk, </em>Es? <em>Co. </em>The deposition was not signed by Stoddart, and was excepted to, foe this reason also. The magistrates who took the deposition certified, \u201c that in pursuance of a commission, they had examined the said <em>Benjamin Stoddart, </em>a witness, as well on the part of <em>Watson </em>Es\u2019 <em>Urquhart, </em>as on behalf of <em>Joseph Woolfolk, </em>in a suit depending in <em>Orange </em>Court, the witness being duly sworn.\u201d The defendants, <em>Barnett </em>and <em>Woolfolk, </em>moved for a new trial, which being refused, they excepted for that reason likewise, stating as the ground of it, that a material witness was absent; that the damages were excessive, being a few pounds more than the debt in the declaration mentioned, and that the Court would not permit them to urge any other reasons for a new trial, except the two above stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-9\">Upon an appeal to the District Court of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>the judgment of the County Court was affirm-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>id, and a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>to this latter judgment was awarded by one of the Judges of this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b503-3\">Warden, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-4\">I rely upon the following errors in the judgment of the Country Court. 1st. The plaintiff, in his declaration, claims a <em>sterling money </em>debt, of the value of so much in <em>current money; </em>whereas the demand should have been \u00a1nade in <em>sterling money </em>only. In support of this objection, the case of <em>Scolds executors </em>v. <em>Call, (ante, </em>115,) is fully in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-5\">2d. The declaraci\u00f3n staves a demand against <em>Barnett, Woolfolk </em>Cs' <em>Co.; </em>and the judgment is against <em>Barnett </em>and <em>Woolfolk </em>only, which is a fatal variance\u00bb The contract, as stated, is a joint one, and the judgment should have also been joint, that the whole might assist in bearing the burthen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-6\">3d\u00bb There is no issue as to Barnett, and yet a verdict and judgment in rendered against him. The p'ea of <em>Woolfolk </em>is several, that <em>he </em>did not assume, avid Barnett, who was not bound to stake his defence upon this issue, might have chosen to put in a special plea 5 but instead of his having an opportunity to do so, a verdict was rendered upon the plea of <em>Woolfolk </em>alone against Barnett, as well as <em>Woolfolk, </em>though the former was in truth no party to the suit, and probably was not, nay could not, be defended upon any special ground which he might have chosen, distinct from that taken by <em>Woolfolk.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-7\">4th. The deposition of <em>Stoddart </em>does not go to prove that the appellants assumed, or that the money was paid by <em>Watson </em>&amp;? Urquhart, at their request.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b503-8\">5th. <em>Stoddart </em>appears clearly to have been an interested witness. <em>Barnett </em>and <em>Woolfolk </em>considered their tobacco as having been either disposed of at an under value, or as having been sold at a higher price than that stated by <em>Forest </em>Stoddart, and they would have been entitled, in case <em>Forest Stoddart </em>had sued them on their bill, (and which was alone prevented by the officious interference of <em>Watson </em>&amp;? <em>Urquhart,) </em>to oppose the demand by proofs of improper conduct in the sale of their tobacco. Stoddart\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>therefore, was a very improper witness to prove the price at which the tobacco was sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-8\">6 \u2018h. The deposition, not being signed by Stoddarl, ought not to have been read, since if perjury had been committed, a prosecution could not have been instituted against the witness in consequence of this omission. 1 <em>Morg. Ess. </em>124.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-9\"><em>Duval, </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-10\">For any thing which appears in the record, the bill drawn by <em>Barnett, Woolfolk </em>&amp;? <em>Co. </em>may yet be in circulation, and may, at some future time, rise up against the drawers ; for it does not appear, that <em>Watson C Urquhart </em>took it up, Upon the third objection made by Mr. <em>Warden, </em>he cited 3 <em>Morg. Ess. </em>10.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b504-11\"><em>Washington, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-12\">The first objection is, that the current money value of the sterling debt ought not to have been stated in the declaration ; and in support of this, the case of <em>Scott\u2019s executors </em>v. <em>Call </em>is relied upon. That was an action of <em>debt for a specific sum, </em>where the jury failed to ascertain the value of the money, though that subject was rendered by the pleadings an essential part of the matter in issue. This is an action on the case, founding entirely <em>in damages, </em>and the jury have assessed those damages in current money, leaving nothing for the Court to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b504-13\">In answer to the second objection, let it be premised, that contracts by partners are joint and several. If the action be not brought against all, those who are sued may plead in abatement, discovering the names of the other partners, so as to prevent the plaintiff from making more than one mistake. But if they do not plead in abatement, they cannot afterwards object that all are not joined. If there be any thing in the objection now insisted upon, a recovery can never be had upon a partnership contract, where some of the firm are not named, but included under the general style of the <em>company, </em>if the members will only keep their own secret. For if, as in this case, the suit is brought against Barnett, <em>Woolfolk </em>\u00a3s? <em>Co. </em>it is objected, that a judgment cannot be obtained against <em>Barnett </em>and <em>Woof </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>folk </em>only ; and it is clear that it cannot be rendered against the whole, if the un-named partners be unknown, since they cannot be made parties to the suit. You cannot sue the known partners only, for then the contract must be stated to be made by them, and if this be done, then it would be variant from the real one, which would be clearly fatal. So that, if the present objection be a good one, the plaintiff, in a case like this, would be without any remedy at all at law ; whereas, on the other hand, the defendants may discover who are the concealed partners by a plea in abatement, and ought to do so, if they mean to make it a joint burthen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b505-4\">There is more difficulty in the next objection, than in any which has been mentioned. To understand it, we must consider the real nature and end ofpleading. A plea consists of two parts; the first is the <em>making of </em>defence, and the other is the extension of that defence, under all the various modifications of which the case admits. <em>Making defence, </em>is the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s demand as he has stated it. 3 <em>Mac. </em>Com. 296. If the defendant mean not to rely upon a bare denial, but would go farther, and oppose the plaintiff\u2019s claim by something not necessarily growing out of the defence, but quite collateral thereto, he must state such other ground in the form of a plea. Thus, in <em>assumpsit, </em>the defendant, by making defence, and consequently denying the plaintiff\u2019s demand set forth in the declaration, <em>substantially </em>says, that he did not assume; because the affirmation being that he did assume, the negation must be that, he did not assume, which forms a complete issue ; but if the defendant would go farther, and say, for instance, that he did not assume within five years, he must <em>plead </em>that special matter, (because this is not necessarily implied by a mere negation,) so as to give the plaintiff notice of the real ground of defence, -which is the primary and only end of pleading. In this case, then, Barnett, by entering himself a defendant, which is tantamount to <em>defending the force and injury, </em>denies the <em>assumpsit </em>charged, as much as if he had said so in a more regular plea. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>But what puts this question beyond doubt is, that his <em>co-defendant </em>had regularly pleaded <em>non-assumpsit, </em>to a joint demand, and, therefore, <em>Barnett, </em>by entering himself defendant, going to trial on the plea, and <em>actually defending the suit </em>in all its stages, as the record shews he did, made <em>Woolfolids </em>plea his own, and after a verdict against him, ought not to be permitted to set it aside, because he had neglected to put in a formal plea. The want of a <em>similiter </em>appears from the case of <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>1 <em>Str. </em>641, cited in <em>3 Morg. Ess. </em>p. 10, to have been considered as fatal, and not aided by the Statute of <em>Jeofails ; </em>yet, <em>after defence made, </em>the objection is removed. 21 <em>Vin. </em>480.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-8\">4th. This objection, as well as that made by Mr. <em>Duval, </em>may be answered together, by observing that the whole evidence is not stated. This, is not a demurrer to evidence, where all the testimony is spread upon the record, but it is merely an exception to the admissibility of a particular deposition. So that this Court cannot say that evidence was not produced of the <em>assumpsit </em>or of the request, or that the bill was taken up by <em>Watson </em>&amp;? <em>Urquhart. </em>Besides, as to the first, the <em>law </em>creates the <em>assumpsit, </em>and as to the latter, the bill not having been protested, never can charge the appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-9\">5th. <em>Stoddart </em>can neither gain nor lose by the event of this cause, and this is the touchstone by which to try the interest of a witness. The claim of <em>Forest Stoddart </em>against <em>Watson Urquhart </em>was independent of <em>Barnett, Woolfolk &amp; Co. </em>It arose from their special undertaking; they did that without suit, which they might have been compelled to do. They could not defend themselves by alleging an injury done by <em>Forest &amp; Stoddart </em>to <em>Barnett, Woolfolk Co., </em>nor are they precluded by this judgment, nor by the payment made by the appellees, from contesting that point with <em>Forest Stoddart, </em>who could not, in such a suit, avail themselves of any benefit from the evidence given in this cause. If <em>Forest </em>fc? <em>Stoddart </em>has injured the appellants, it is nothing to the appellees, who only claim the money advanced for them, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>prove the amount of that advance, the receiver is a proper, and often the only witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-3\">Gih. This objection is supported neither by authorities, nor by principle. 2 <em>Str. </em>920, which is referred to, does not warrant the doctrine contended for, and the reason assigned for it is totally unfounded. The signing of the deposition cannot be necessary, even for the purpose of furnishing evidence of the oath, since, \u00abpon a prosecution for perjury, it would be re - quisite to prove, that the evidence stated in the deposition, signed by the witness, <em>was szvorn to by him. </em>The certificate of the magistrate would not be sufficient. The signature, if proved, (for this too must be done,) might be evidence of his having deposed what is there written ; but, that he deposed it upon <em>oath, </em>would still remain to be proved. So that, after all, other evidence must be resorted to, in order to sustain the prosecution. If the false oath were not committed to writing, yet, upon proving it, the witness might suffer for perjury; and surely it is not <em>less perjury </em>if it be committed to writing, because it is not signed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-4\"><em>Campbell, </em>in reply.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ0\">The objections upon which I rely, are, first, that no plea is put in by Barnett, and yet judgment is entered against him. But it is contended that there is a plea. I ask what is it ? Is it payment ? <em>Non assumpsit ? </em>The Act of Limitations, or what ? For if there be a plea, it may be all or either of those which I have mentioned. The oath administered to the jurors is, that they shall well and truly trv the <em>issue joined. </em>But if there be no plea, there can be no issue, and consequently the jury cannot answer to their charge. It is essential that the pleadings should be so far formal at least, as to submit some point or other to the consideration of the jury ; for otherwise the Court cannot even presume, that the matters in difference between the parties have been settled bv the verdict. We know, that wherever an immaterial point is put in issue, a repleader will be awarded, and for the very reason which I Lave mentioned, namely, that the rights of the parties were not involved in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>issue, and therefore could not have been decided by the jury. There is certainly a great distinction between <em>making defence, </em>and <em>pleading. </em>The former, is no more than an introduction to the latter, and although it imports a general denial of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover) jt \u00bfoes not disclose the ground upon which that right is opposed, so as that it may appear whether the question decided by the jury', was upon a point material to the merits of the caus\u00e9, or not. Co. <em>Lit. </em>127, <em>b. </em>The truth is, that <em>no defence </em>in this case, according to the technical meaning of the word, was made, the appellant <em>Barnett, </em>having done no more than enter his appearance to the suit, so as to dispense with the necessity of process being served upon him. But if any particular plea can be presumed to have been intended by <em>Barnett, </em>the probable one would be the general issue ; and if so, it may properly be objected, secondly, that the verdict is totally immaterial, since it is neither for nor against the appellants. The jury have found, \u201c that the defendants have not paid the debt in the declaration mentioned;\u201d now they may not have <em>paid </em>the debt claimed, and yet they may never have <em>assumed to pay it. </em>The former may be the consequence of the latter, and the jury have not found that he did assume. So-that the very gist of the issue, (if there be any,) is still left undetermined. 3 <em>Salk. </em>374.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6mQ\">Third, <em>Stoddart </em>was <em>certainly an </em>interested witness. If the tobacco sold for a price equal to the sum drawn for by the appellants, then <em>Forest Stoddart </em>had no right to demand any thing from either the drawers, or endorsers of the bill; and an action, for money had and received, might have been maintained against them by the appellees, in case they had failed in this suit, upon the ground of the tobacco having sold for a greater price than that credited by <em>Forest Stoddart. </em>The success of the appellees was consequently interesting to <em>Stoddart.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">Washington.\u2014The case from <em>Salk. </em>374, was decided when the Courts were much more rigid than they now are, respecting the doctrine of verdicts. The rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>now is, that after a fair trial, the Court will not set aside a verdict, merely because it may be informal, but will mould it into form. And if this be the rule in Englandit should be very liberally adopted in this country, when it is recollected, that in the County Courts, a short minute only is made of the proceedings by the Clerk, during the sitting of the Court; the verdict is usually drawn by the jury in general terms, and the extension of it so as to make it responsive to the issue, is always left to the Clerk, who does it after the term is ended, when he makes out a complete record. So that errors of this sort are the mere misprisions of the Clerk. But in this case, the verdict stated in the record, substantially corresponds with the issue | for the damages assessed, are for the plaintiff\u2019s <em>non-performance of his assumption: </em>which is clearly-finding an assumpsit, and a non-performance of it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b509-3\">The Presideutt,</author>\n<p id=\"AulJ\">The first objection stated to the judgment of the County Court is, that the demand is for <em>sterling </em>money, of the value of so much in <em>Virginia </em>currency; in support of which, the case of <em>Scott\u2019s ex. </em>v. <em>Call, </em>is relied upon. The principle of that case is a strong one in support of this judgment. The error in that was, that the jury left the value of the sterling money to be ascertained by the Court, instead of settling it themselves; the very reverse of which has been done in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The next objection is, that the declaration is against <em>Barnett Woolf oik </em>&amp;? Co., and the judgment is against <em>Barnett </em>&amp;? <em>W oolfolk only. </em>The answer to this is obvious. <em>Barnett </em>&amp; <em>Woolf </em>oik, are sued as the <em>ostensible partners </em>of the company, and have it completely in their power to make it a joint charge upon the whole company, by disclosing the names of the unknown partners by a plea in abatement. But instead of pleading this matter, they take the whole defence upon themselves, and it is certainly too late after verdict, to complain that the judgment is not against all the members of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">But it is objected, that no plea was put in by <em>Bat-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number><em>nett, </em>and consequentl}, that a verdict against him was improper. The declaration is against both; <em>Woolfolk </em>alone pleaded, and an issue was made up. <em>Barnett </em>voluntarily appeared, and desired to be made a defendant with <em>Woolfolk. </em>It is true, that he might have pleaded separately, if he had been inclined to do so : but not desiring it, his being made a defendant with the other, who was at issue, implies a consent to be united with him in his plea. This consent is suffi\u00bb cientlv established by his subsequent conduct. He acknowledged notice of the taking of <em>Stoddards </em>deposition ; proceeded to the trial, and defended the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The fourth objection is, that no assumpsit was proven. To this there are two answers.\u2014 1st. That the deposition does not appear to have been the only evidence given at the trial. 2dly. The plaintiff having proved a debt to be due, the law implies an assumpsit to pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The fifth objection is to <em>Stoddards </em>deposition, on the score of interest. The only evidence as to this point, is the deposition itself. From that it appears that <em>Forest id Stoddart </em>paid the excess of the bill beyond the proceeds of the tobacco, at the request of <em>Watson id Urquhart, </em>and upon their special promise \u00abto be answerable for such payment. When that was ascertained, they applied to <em>Watson id Urquhart, </em>who performed their promise, without any agreement to refund or to connect it in any manner with the fate of the. present dispute. So that <em>Stoddart </em>could be in no wise interested in the event of this cause. But it has been contended that the sales of the tobacco were fraudulent, and that there was a combination between <em>Forest id Stoddart, </em>and <em>Watson id </em>Urquhart, to shift the demand for the balance into the hands of the latter, to deprive <em>Barnett, Woolfolk id Co. </em>of their defence on the ground of the fraudulent sales. Of this combination there is no proof. On the contrary, th.- e is the strongest ground to presume otherwise. <em>Watson id Urquhart </em>appear to have been the friends o\u00ed <em>Barnett, Woolfolk id Co. </em>and as such they endorsed their I'll arid gave it credit. They went further, and requested honor to the bill, though the funds upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>which it was drawn should prove deficient: by which friendly interference they preserved the credit of the drawers, and saved them from the payment of damages, which would have been the consequence of the bills being protested. This conduct does not warrant a suspicion of combination to the prejudice of Barnett, <em>Woolf oik &amp; Co. </em>But it was said that <em>Watson </em>&amp; <em>Urquhart </em>ought not to have pa;d the money without the consent of <em>War nett, fkoolfolk </em>&amp;? <em>Co. </em>If they had - been litigious, or inclined to evade a performance of their promise, they might have delayed payment under a pretext of this sort. But knowing that they Had induced <em>Forest is? Stoddart </em>to advance the money, they very properly, and without delay, repaid it with interest; having nothing to do with any dispute between them and the appellants; but leaving it to be litigated between them, when and how they pleased.. This may still be done if the appellants are inclined, and nothing sw orn by <em>Stoddart </em>in this suit, can avail him in that.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">Another objection to this deposition is, that the witness has not subscribed it. Whether <em>Stoddart </em>could be prosecuted for perjury, in case he has taken a false oath, in consequence of this omission, is a question which we leave to be determined by those before whom the prosecution shall be instituted. The deposition is certified by two magistrates, to have been taken before them <em>upon oath, </em>which gives it sufficient authenticity.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The objection to the verdict applies merely to <em>the form </em>of it. The damages assessed by the jury are <em>for the non-performance of the assumption, in the </em>dec\u00eda<em>ration mentioned, </em>and the irregularity, in the extension of the verdict, is apparently a clerical misprision, and therefore amendable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Judgment of the District Court affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\"> <em>Moss et al. v.
