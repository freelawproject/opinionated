The appellate court being farther of opinion that what was declared in the decree would, by necessary implication, relieve the heirs from responsibility for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>certain land, but that it would have been more regular to direct a reiease 0f that hm^ decreed such release accordingly.

The deed contained a covenant that <em>Blessing </em>and his heirs would warrant and defend the right and title \u201c to the above described premises,\u201d to <em>Beatty </em>and his heirs, free and clear from the claim or claims of any person or persons whatever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-4\">After the death of <em>Blessing, </em>to wit, on the 24th of October 1834, a suit in equity was brought by <em>Beatty </em>against the administrator and heirs of <em>Blessing, </em>in the circuit court of <em>Smyth </em>county. The bill set forth, that since <em>Blessing's </em>death the plaintiff had discovered that the boundaries by which the land was conveyed by <em>Blessing </em>to him do not contain 280 acres, and that of the land included in the said boundaries there is between 15 and 30 acres to which <em>Blessing </em>had no title. And then the bill proceeded to explain how this arose. It stated, that the tract of land conveyed by <em>Blessing </em>to the plaintiff as containing 280 acres was mortgaged by a certain <em>Arthur Campbell </em>to <em>Blessing; </em>that under this mortgage it was decreed to be sold, and was sold by <em>Poston </em>and <em>Tate </em>as commissioners, and <em>Blessing </em>the mortgagee became the purchaser thereof; that in the conveyance to <em>Blessing, </em>the commissioners included land which was not included in the mortgage, and that in this way <em>Blessing </em>was probably led into the error of attempting to convey to the plaintiffland to which he had no valid claim. The bill prayed that a survey might be directed, to ascertain the deficiency in the land conveyed by <em>Blessing </em>to the plaintiff, and that for this deficiency satisfaction might be decreed the plaintiff out of <em>Blessing's </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">The administrator of <em>Blessing, </em>after excepting to the jurisdiction of equity, answered, that he knew nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>of the terms of the contract between <em>Blessinff </em>and <em>Beatty. </em>^ He did not know whether <em>Beatty </em>purchased the land by the quantity, or in gross; and he called upon the plaintiff to shew what the contract was. He did not know there were not 280 acres contained in the tract mentioned in the bill, nor that <em>Blessing </em>had conveyed any land to the plaintiff to which he had not right; and he called for proof. <em>Blessing, </em>he said, had put the plaintiff into possession of the land contained in the deed, and the plaintiff had never been evicted; and if he had voluntarily surrendered possession of it to others, it was his fault,\u2014a fault for which <em>Blessing\u2019s </em>estate was not liable. At all events, he insisted, the plaintiff should have brought a suit at law upon the warranty, and not resorted to a court of equity for relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">Some of the defendants were out of the commonwealth, and the cause was proceeded in against them by publication. Some were infants, and answered <em>by </em>guardian <em>ad litem.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">Under an order of survey made in the cause, the surveyor of the county returned a plat and report; but the report was deficient in clearness. The deposition of the surveyor was taken, which stated, that he ran the lines agreeably to the courses of the mortgage given by <em>Campbell </em>to <em>Blessing; </em>\u201c or rather, running to the corners, where they could be found, and where not found, according to the courses and distances of said mortgage;\u201d and found the tract of land to contain 258 acres. In answer to a question of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, he stated that he had compared the courses of the mortgage with the courses o,f the deed made by <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty, </em>and found them to differ, the deed last mentioned including some land that the mortgage would not cover; to wit, land on the south side of the main road, in the possession of <em>James P. Strother. </em>Other depositions were taken, but it is not material to state the purport of them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>The cause coming on to be heard the 3d of May 1839, the following opinion and decree were entered : \u201c The court, not being able from the evidence before it to perceive the extent of relief to be decreed to the complainant, supposes the difficulty may be removed by an additional report of the surveyor on the survey already made, or by making another survey and report; and perceiving that the probable relief to be granted will be a correction of the conveyance from <em>Blessing </em>to the complainant, so as to conform it to the deed of conveyance from the commissioners <em>Poston </em>and <em>Tate </em>to <em>Blessing, </em>under which <em>Blessing </em>held said land, and which (by mistake, as is believed) was departed from in the conveyance from <em>Blessing </em>to the complainant, so as to leave out some of the lands held by him under said deed, and to include others not conveyed to him ; and then, by ascertaining the deficiency, to compensate the complainant therefor, leaving him to action at law upon his warranty for compensation for eviction of any portion thereof of which he does not now complain: therefore it is adjudged, decreed and ordered that the said surveyor so amend his report, if it can be done without a farther survey, as to shew how much land is contained in the tract in the bill mentioned, surveyed according to the lines of the conveyance made by the said commissioners <em>Tate </em>and <em>Poston </em>to <em>Jacob Blessing, </em>and also to shew the amount of acres included in <em>Blessing\u2019s </em>conveyance to the complainant; also to shew the number of acres included in the latter and not embraced by the former, and how much of the former is left out in the latter; reporting also whether or not he finds marked trees and corners on the lines surveyed by him : and if he cannot do so in the survey by him now reported, that he again go upon the land in controversy, and survey and lay off the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">The surveyor made an additional report, setting forth the boundaries called for in the mortgage from <em>Campbell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>to <em>Blessing, </em>and the boundaries called for in the deed from the commissioners <em>Poston </em>and <em>Tate </em>to <em>Blessing, </em>and specifying wherein the two deeds corresponded and wherein they differed, and accounting for the variations between the two. The principal difference was the omission in the latter deed of one course and distance specified in the former. The surveyor supposed that a mistake was committed in copying the courses of the one deed into the other. There were, he said, two white oak corners following in succession, and he supposed that the copyist, after writing the words \u201c white oak,\u201d overlooked the description of the first corner and passed to the description of the second. This supposition, he said, was strengthened by the fact that thenceforward the lines of the commissioners\u2019 deed pursued the calls of the mortgage, except that one course in the mortgage was S. 71 E. whilst the course of the correspondent line in the other deed was S. 21 E. which was a mistake that might readily happen with a negligent copyist, the words twenty and seventy, when written, being often mistaken for each other. The surveyor had no doubt that the commissioners intended to convey to <em>Blessing </em>according to the boundaries of the mortgage. This opinion, he said, was confirmed by the fact that the plat made from the courses of the mortgage closed accurately, whilst the plat according to the lines of the commissioners\u2019 deed failed to close, by a difference of 11 degrees in course, and a deficiency of 90 poles in distance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-11\">It seemed to the surveyor that the deed from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty </em>was made upon actual survey, and that the surveyor who made that survey went by the calls of the commissioners\u2019 deed (making some corrections in course and distance) until he reached two white oaks at one of the corners described in the mortgage deed, after which he left entirely the courses both of the mortgage and of the deed from the commissioners, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>struck out a new course for himself. This error was committed in attempting to run with the surrounding lands of <em>Robert Thompson's </em>heirs and <em>Wyatt M\u2019Ghees, </em>mentioned in the deed from <em>Blessing to Beatty.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AsEe\">The surveyor reported that the quantity of land conveyed by the mortgage deed, according to his survey thereof as actually run by marked boundaries, when found, and by courses and distances taken from the mortgage deed, when corners were gone, was 253 acres; so that the quantity of land embraced in the mortgage deed was less by 27 acres than the quantity for which <em>Beatty </em>contracted. He further reported that the deed from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty </em>embraced 23-J- acres of land not contained in the mortgage deed, and left out 8 acres included in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">The cause came on to be finally heard the 7th of May 1840. The circuit court, being of opinion that an error was committed in the conveyance from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty </em>by departing from the mortgage deed, and being satisfied that the sale from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty </em>was intended to include all the lands within the bounds of the mortgage, to which <em>Blessing </em>had, as mortgagee, the legal title, and that the boundaries thereof were departed from by mistake, decreed that the heirs of <em>Blessing, </em>or, in case of their failure, a commissioner appointed for the purpose, should convey to the complainant the land embraced by the mortgage deed, according to the calls thereof. And it appearing by the report of the surveyor, that the quantity of land embraced within the mortgage was only 253 acres, and it also appearing (as the court thought) by the original contract, that <em>Blessing </em>contracted to sell to the complainant 280 acres, and the average price paid for said land per acre being 7 dollars 14 cents, at which price the 27 acres deficient would amount to 192 dollars 78 cents, the court therefore decreed that the administrators of <em>Blessing, </em>out of his estate, pay to the complain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ant the said sum of 192 dollars 78 cents, with interest thereon from the 6th of September 1830 (when the last payment of the purchase <em>money </em>fell due) till paid ,* and that the complainant recover against the defendants his costs&gt;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-6\">Although <em>Arthur M. Bowen </em>was the only person sued as administrator of <em>Jacob Blessing </em>deceased, and his son <em>Jacob Blessing </em>was no otherwise a defendant than as one of the heirs of the deceased, yet the decree was against both <em>Arthur M. Bowen </em>and <em>Jacob Blessing </em>as administrators.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\">On their petition, an appeal was allowed from the decree.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-8\">The cause was argued in writing by <em>M'Comas </em>and <em>B. R. Johnston </em>for the appellants, and by <em>Sheffey </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-9\">I. It was contended for the <em>appellants, </em>that the sale of the land was not by the acre, but in gross. Where the contract is not explicit, they argued, the question whether it is of the one character or the other, depends upon the particular circumstances of the case. The insertion or omission of the terms <em>more or less </em>is immaterial. In the case of <em>Keytons </em>v. <em>Brawfords, </em>5 Leigh 39. the land was mentioned in the deed as containing a specified number of <em>acres; </em>but the court considered that this was merely descriptive of the tract of land, and could not be referred to the clause of warranty, so as to bind the party to make good a deficiency. The sale was held to be in gross, and the circumstance that the purchase money was not an equimultiple of the number of acres was strongly relied on. That circumstance equally exists here. The price per acre in this case, if it were considered to be by the acre, would be 7 dollars 14 cents and eight twenty-eighth parts of a cent. The deficiency, moreover, is not excessive. Under the authority of <em>Keytons </em>v. <em>Brawfords, no allowance </em>should be made for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>For </em>the <em>appellee, </em>it was contended to be a general principle of equity, that for deficiencies relief will be granted. Only in peculiar cases will that relief be refused. From the cases on the subject, this rule is fairly to be deduced : that where it can clearly be shewn by the vendor that the parties understood and expressly agreed that the one should risk the loss of a surplus and the other of a deficiency, let the quantity be what it might, no relief will be granted; but where the parties did not contemplate a deficiency, or expressly contract with reference to risk as to quantity, and there turns out to be a deficiency, there equity will relieve. <em>Jolliffe &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Hite &amp;c. </em>1 Call 329. <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Cunningham's ex'or, </em>1 Munf. 330. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Carrington &amp; others, 4 </em>Munf. 332. Is it shewn by the appellants that such was the express contract and understanding of the parties? What evidence is there that a deficiency was contemplated, or made the subject of a contract ? It does not appear by the contract, nor by the deed of conveyance. Not even the usual words \u201c more or less\u201d are used; and if they were used, they wrnuld not be conclusive. Who shews that <em>Beatty </em>expressly took upon himself the risk of a deficiency ? No one. There is no principle of equity, then, which will throw upon him the loss. The only circumstance that can be relied upon to make the contract a sale in gross, is, that the average price per acre is not an even one. In <em>Keytons </em>v. <em>Brawfords, </em>this circumstance was expressly held not to be sufficient by itself. There were other strong circumstances in connexion with that; and from the whole the court inferred that the sale was a sale in gross.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">II. It was contended for the <em>appellants, </em>that the case was not proper for the interference of equity. In <em>Long's ex'or &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Israel &amp;c. </em>9 Leigh 556. it is decided, that while equity will interfere by way of injunction to restrain the collection of purchase money, where a defect of title is alleged by the vendee, yet it is only in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>mode that it will take jurisdiction; and that where the , * \u00bb \u00b6 . . \u00b6 , purchase money has been paid, and there is a mere covenant of general warranty, as in this case, the party will be left to his action at law, which only accrues w{jen there has been eviction by paramount title. Though the facts in that case were stronger than in this, the party was left to his remedy at law. No compensation was allowed for land which, upon the proof, was covered by an elder and better title. In the case at bar, it appears that the appellee was put in possession under <em>Blessing\u2019s </em>deed, and the bill sets forth no complaint of eviction. But if equity interfere, it should only allow for so much as the land embraced in the deed from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty </em>falls short of 2S0 acres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\">For the <em>appellee </em>it was said, that though the allowance for deficiency would be ascertained by the deed from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty </em>if that deed was correct, yet as there was a mistake in that deed, it was right to correct the mistake. The case of <em>Long\u2019s ex'or </em>v. <em>Israel &amp;c. was </em>an authority in support of the decree in this respect. <em>Blessing </em>having contracted to sell, and <em>Beatty </em>to buy, according to the mortgage deed, it was proper to give compensation for the deficiency ascertained by running the lines according to that deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-6\">III. It was contended that the allowance per acre for the deficiency was too high.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmO\">The counsel for the <em>appellee </em>relied <em>upon Nelson </em>v. <em>Matthews &amp;c. </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 164. and <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Carrington &amp; others, </em>4 Munf. 332. as sustaining the allowane\u00e9, which was of the average value of the whole tract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-8\">For the <em>appellants, </em>it was said, that where there is a mere defect of quantity (the boundaries of the deed not including the full number of acres), the only rational and attainable standard of damages is the average value per acre; but that where, on the contrary, land is included within the boundaries which is lost by defect of title, the land itself is subject to view and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>valuation, and no more damages will be given than the .. . _ <em>\u2022 ^ </em>actual value ot that very portion lost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiP\">IV. It was insisted, that no correction could be made according to the mortgage deed, without making the heirs of <em>Campbell </em>parties. The counsel for the <em>appellee </em>answered, that all the interest of <em>Campbell </em>had been parted with by the mortgage, the sale under it, and the purchase by <em>Blessing </em>at that sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">V. It was contended that the decree was clearly erroneous in decreeing against <em>Jacob Blessing </em>as administrator, when he was not sued in that character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">For the <em>appellee </em>it was said, that this, though erroneous, was an error without an injury. <em>Blessing </em>was not directed to pay out of his own funds, but out of the estate of the decedent. Having in his hands no estate of the decedent, he incurs no contempt by not performing the decree of the court, and his rights are no way affected. The burthen must fall upon the assets in the hands of <em>Bowen the </em>true administrator, and the associating another\u2019s name erroneously with his neither lessens his obligation to pay, nor renders the payment by him more difficult.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-9\">The counsel for the <em>appellants </em>replied that the decree as to <em>Blessing </em>was not so harmless as was supposed. For, while it remained unreversed, it fixed conclusively that there were assets in his hands, though he had never had the opportunity of pleading that he had no assets.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-11\">VI. It was insisted that the decree was erroneous in giving costs jointly against the administrators and heirs, and giving them, as against the administrators, <em>de bonis propriis. Long\u2019s ex\u2019or &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Israel &amp;c. </em>9 Leigh 556.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-12\">The counsel for the <em>appellee </em>said, he did not understand the decree as making <em>Bowen </em>individually liable; and <em>Blessing </em>stood on the same footing with his coheirs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b325-13\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ada\">I am well satisfied, from all the circumstances of the case, that it was the intention of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>Blessing </em>to sell, and of <em>Beatty </em>to purchase, the land embraced by the mortgage deed, according to the true boundaries, whatever those might be, and adopting the estimate of quantity expressed in that deed, to wit, 280 acres. but that a mistake occurred in .relation to the boundaries, occasioned by errors in the deed from the commissioners to <em>Blessing, </em>and an unfortunate attempt to correct those errors without resorting <em>to the </em>calls of the mortgage <em>deed. </em>The consequence has been that the deed from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty </em>embraces some land not conveyed by the mortgage deed, to which <em>Blessing </em>had no colour of title, and omits some comprised in that deed, to which there does not appear to have been any adverse claim. The decree of the circuit court very properly corrected the mistake, by directing a conveyance from the heirs of <em>Blessing </em>according to the calls of the mortgage deed. The corrected boundaries contain only 253 acres, shewing a deficiency <em>of 27 acres: </em>and the questions presented for our consideration upon the merits are, whether compensation ought to be made for that deficiency, and if so, what should be the measure of compensation?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The principle upon which equity gives relief in cases of deficiency or excess in the estimated quantity upon the sale of lands, I understand to be that of mistake ; whether the mutual mistake of the parties, or the mistake of one of them, occasioned by the fraud or culpable negligence of the other. I do not perceive any other principle upon which the jurisdiction can be founded; for if there has been no mistake, either in the contract itself or the execution of the contract, the parties must stand upon their legal rights, to be adjudicated and enforced in a legal forum, unless the question should arise incidentally in a court of chancery, in the exercise of some other branch of its jurisdiction. The principle was recognized in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Buckley, 17 </em>Ves. 394. <em>401. Glover </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Desaus. 433. and <em>Duvals </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>v. <em>Ross, </em>2 Munf. 290. It was the expressed and sole ground of decision in <em>Quesnel </em>v. <em>Woodlief. </em>That case, though commented upon and approved in <em>Jolliffe &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Hite &amp;c. </em>1 Call 301. was for some time misunderstood and questioned, 5 Call 9. 10. 2 Rand. 67. from the want of a correct report of it; (see an imperfect one in 2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 173. note.) but it is now well and accurately reported in 6 Call 218. and its authority no longer disputed, but recognized<em>; Bierne &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Erskine, 5 </em>Leigh 64. The cases of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Matthews &amp;c. </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 164. and <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Cunningham's ex\u2019or, </em>1 Munf. 330. must have been founded upon the same principle. The idea is sometimes adverted to, of a tacit warranty annexed to every contract, that the thing bought or sold shall correspond with the representation made of it at the time, 5 Call 5. but this is only another mode of suggesting the same principle, and imports nothing more than the duty of one party to correct a mistake to which he has been instrumental, committed to the prejudice of the other. In the application of the principle, it is wholly immaterial whether a deficiency arises from a miscalculation of the area within the boundaries, as in <em>Duvals </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>or the exclusion by the described boundaries of a part of the tract sold, as in <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Cunningham\u2019s ex'or, </em>or the exclusion of a part unquestionably belonging to a third person, as in one aspect of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Matthews &amp;c.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The cases proper for compensation on account of deficiency or excess are of three classes. The first I will mention is that of a sale by the acre, by the express terms of the contract; for example, the sale of a tract stated at 1000 acres, for the price of five dollars per acre. Here the quantity mentioned is manifestly mere matter of description, or conjectural or temporary estimate ; either party having a perfect right to ascertain accurately the precise quantity by actual admeasurement ; which quantity, when so correctly ascertained, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>gives infallibly, by the application of the stipulated price per acre, the exact amount of the purchase money. But if the parties, relying too much upon the estimated quantity, go on to adjust the consideration by that cri\u00bfer;or3) ancl turns out that the estimate is erroneous, the mistake is undoubtedly one which must be corrected. In such a case, the mistake is not in the terms of the contract, but in the result of those terms when applied to the subject. The parties may, however, by their agreement, make the estimated quantity conclusive, by stipulating to dispense with a survey and to be governed in all events by the given estimate. This changes the sale into a contract of hazard, and necessarily excludes the interposition of equity on the ground of mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoi\">A second class of cases is where the agreement or understanding of the parties is for a sale at a stipulated price per acre, but instead of stating those terms in the contract, they express, as the consideration, the result of a calculation based upon an erroneous estimate of the quantity. Here the mistake is in the terms of the contract, a gross sum having been adopted under the belief of its being the aggregate of the agreed price per acre. In such cases, also, the right to relief, otherwise clear, may be excluded by a stipulation that the estimated shall in any state of facts be taken as the actual quantity ; the parties thus contracting for an anticipated hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The third class of cases is where the parties contract for the payment of a gross sum for a tract or parcel, upon an estimate of a given quantity, which influences the price agreed to be paid. Here there is no mistake in the terms of the contract, nor in the application of those terms to the subject, but in an important element of the contract, which, if correctly understood at the time, would in all probability have prevented the contract from being made, or haye varied its terms. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>such cases require relief in equity, is well established; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Buckley, Glover </em>v. <em>Smith, Quesnel </em>v. <em>Woodlief, </em>and <em>Duvals </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>above cited; to which may be added <em>Bierne &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Erskine, </em>5 Leigh 59. and the authorities cited by judge <em>Lyons </em>in 1 Call 316. The proper relief is to set aside the contract, or to give a just compensation, such as will place the parties in the same relative situation in which they would probably have placed themselves, if the true state of the fact had been known W\u2019hen they made their agreement. In this, however, as in the other classes of cases, the relief being founded upon a mistake unprovided for, it is repelled by shewing that it wms anticipated as probable, and provided for by an agreement that the contingency should be a matter of hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">This is briefly my view of what I consider the correct doctrine on this subject; over which it is true there is some obscurity, attributable, as I conceive, not so much to a difference of opinion in regard to the principles, as to an occasional want of accuracy and precision in the terms employed to express them; which has arisen in a great measure out of the use of the same words in different senses. Thus the word \u201c gross\u201d is applicable as w\u2019ell to the price as the thing sold, and \u201c a sale by the acre\u201d has reference to both. But we must bear in mind that upon the question of compensation, the substantial distinction is between a sale that is a contract of hazard, and one that is not. When \u201c a sale in gross\u201d is used as equivalent to a contract of hazard, the term is properly applicable not to the price but to the subject: for a sale by the acre may be a contract of hazard, and a sale for a gross sum may not. A sale in gross, when applied to the thing sold, means a sale by the tract without regard to quantity; and in that sense is (as was said by judge <em>Cabell </em>in <em>Russell &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Keeran &amp;c. </em>8 Leigh 19.) <em>ex vi termini </em>a contract of hazard. In that sense, however, the distinction sometimes taken be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>tween a sale in gross and a sale by the acre is too narrow ; inasmuch as, though a sale in gross, thus understood, is a contract of hazard, a sale by the acre may be so too: and this want of comprehensiveness in the d\u00a1st,inC|;ion \u00a1s apt to beget a confusion of ideas, and lead us into error. Thus, when a sale for a gross sum is spoken of as a sale by the acre, because the quantity is not hazarded, two distinct classes of cases are confounded, and the absence of a provision regulating the price in the event of deficiency\u2019or excess, substituted for an express provision which does regulate it; in other words, a mistake of the parties as to quantity, not provided for by the terms of the contract, is treated as identical with one which is provided for by the terms of the contract: for a sale at a given sum per acre carries out the intention of the parties, whether they are correct or mistaken in their estimate of the quantity; whereas a sale for a gross sum effectuates their intention, only where they are correct, and not where they are incorrect, as to the quantity. The inadequacy of the distinction tends to obscure the doctrine, and lead us away from the true ground of relief (the mistake of the parties) into delusive speculations as to the specific character of the contract. For example, where a given sum per acre is not an even quotient of the gross price stipulated, it cannot, as has been sometimes supposed, serve to shew that the sale is a sale in gross <em>(understood </em>as a contract of hazard), inasmuch as it may well have happened, not merely that there was no sale by the acre, but no estimate of the price per acre which the gross sum would give, and yet the gross price may have been influenced by the supposed quantity, by enhancing or diminishing the value according to an aggregate and not a distributive estimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The question of compensation usually arises (for reasons already suggested) not in sales by the acre, but in sales for a gross sum. In the latter cases, the enquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>to be made in the first place is, whether the parties made a mistaken estimate of the quantity, which influenced the price; and then, whether, notwithstanding such mistaken estimate, they have waived the right to compensation, by an agreement of hazard. In the absence of all direct evidence, the safest general rule, I think, is, that an estimate of the quantity by the par-lies, whether in a contract executed or a contract executory, ought to be taken <em>prima facie </em>to have influenced the price; for quantity is usually an important element of the agreement, and can hardly be supposed to have been disregarded by the parties, or to have been unmeaningly stated by them in a solemn contract. As a mere matter of description in a conveyance, it is for the most part useless; and more emphatically so in an executory contract. That the statement of the quantity has not generally been regarded as a matter of indifference, is evident from the frequent introduction of the additional words \u201c more or less,\u201d the habitual employment of which can be for no other purpose than to shew that the parties do not intend to bind themselves for the precise number of acres mentioned : and the effect which the courts have given to those words (which have been construed to cover only small deficiencies or excesses, attributable to variations of instruments and the like, and not important deviations, <em>Quesnel </em>v. <em>Woodlief, </em>6 Call 218. <em>Jolliffe &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Hite &amp;c. </em>1 Call 301.) illustrates the strong leaning of the courts against the inference of a contract of hazard; a construction which has moreover been expressly declared in several cases to be one that ought not to be favoured. <em>Hundley </em>v. <em>Lyons, 5 </em>Munf. 342. <em>Keytons </em>v. <em>Brawfords, 5 </em>Leigh 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In the case before us, the quantity is unequivocally and expressly stated at 280 acres, in the deed of conveyance from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty, </em>without even the addition of the customary words \u201c more or less;\u201d and the articles of agreement between them evidence a sale of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>\u00ab a certain tract or parcel of land containing 280 acres, called <em>Staley creek place.\u201d </em>These terms, to my mind, furnish at least strong presumptive evidence against a contract of hazard; and I am aware of no circumgtanceg jn the cause, by which that presumption is rebutted. The case of <em>Keytons </em>v. Brawfords, 5 Leigh 39. relied on by the appellants\u2019 counsel, is not like this. There, the claim to compensation was not for a deficiency within the boundaries contemplated bj' the parties, but for the loss of land out of those boundaries, not intended to be sold, and which had been long held by an adverse claimant under a good title; and the 'deviations in the deed were from the known boundaries by which the land was sold and had been long held, the parties being misled in the description of the boundaries by erroneous title papers. Here, the deviations were from the true, but not accurately known boundaries of a correct title paper, by which the parties intended to be governed. There, the statement of the quantity in the deed was not an estimate according to the known and contemplated boundaries, but an incident of the erroneous description of the boundaries. Here, the statement of the quantity in the deed corresponds with that in the correct title paper, and must have been a mistaken estimate from the true and contemplated boundaries. These points of difference between the two cases are sufficient for my purpose; and I need not notice the various other circumstances relied on in the case cited, and not existing here, tending to shew a contract of hazard. The case of <em>Pendleton's ex'ors </em>v. <em>Stewart, 5 </em>Call 1. is more like this; but that case turned upon the effect of the words \u201c more or less\u201d in an executory contract, which, under the circumstances, were held to make a contract of hazard, upon the authority of <em>Jolliffe &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Hite &amp;c. </em>1 Call 301. where a public sale by an executor for more or less, so distinctly understood, was held to be of that character. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>I do not consider the authority of <em>Pendleton's ex'ors </em>v<em>. Stewart </em>as applicable to the case before us, which is very much like, and cannot be distinguished in principie from, that of <em>Bierne &amp;c. </em>v. Erskine, 5 Leigh 59. where a purchaser was compelled to make compensation for an excess, upon an executory contract for the sale, at a gross price, of a tract stated in the agreement to contain 100 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">For the reasons above stated, I am of opinion that the decree of the circuit court was right in holding the representatives of <em>Blessing </em>liable for the deficiency of 27 acres. As to the measure of compensation, I think there can be no difficulty. If the deed from <em>Blessing </em>to <em>Beatty </em>had been correct in the first instance, it would have presented the case of a mere deficiency in quantity within the boundaries of the tract conveyed ; and such is the real nature of the case, after the correction of that deed according to the true boundaries. In such a case the general rule of compensation is according to the average value of the whole tract; and there are no particular circumstances here, requiring a departure from that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The other objections to the decree require but little notice. There was no necessity for making the heirs of <em>Campbell, </em>the mortgagor, parties in the <em>cause; </em>he having. been divested, by the mortgage and the decree of foreclosure, of all title, legal and equitable. The joint decree <em>de bonis iestatoris </em>against <em>Bowen </em>and <em>Jacob Blessing, </em>as joint administrators with the will annexed of the vendor <em>Blessing, </em>for the value of the deficiency, when the pleadings indicated that <em>Bowen </em>was the sole administrator, is not an error of judgment, but a clerical misprision, which may yet be amended. And so the decree against the administrator <em>Bowen, </em>jointly with the other defendants, the heirs of <em>Blessing, </em>for costs <em>de bonis propriis, </em>was evidently not intentional, but a mere oversight, which might have been corrected, on motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>by the court in which the decree was rendered, and which is still amendable. And the declaration contained in the decree, of the true boundaries of the tract, would by necessary implication relieve the heirs of <em>ftiess{ng </em>from any responsibility, .upon their ancestor\u2019s warranty, for the land out of those limits, but comprised in the erroneous deed : but perhaps it would be more regular, and certainly cannot be improper, to direct a release from <em>Beatty </em>to the heirs of <em>Blessing </em>of the land thus improperly conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"AeCA\">\u2022 Upon the whole, I am of opinion to affirm the decree of the circuit court with costs, after correcting it in the points above indicated.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b334-5\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ADhH\">dissented, But Allen, <em>J. </em>and Cabell, <em>P. </em>concurring in opinion with <em>Baldwin, </em>J. the decree of the court of appeals was entered in the following terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The court is of opinion that there is no error in the said decree for which the same ought to be <em>reversed; </em>but that there is a clerical misprision therein, in decreeing jointly against the appellants <em>Bowen </em>and <em>Jacob Blessing, </em>as joint administrators with the will annexed of <em>Jacob Blessing </em>deceased, the value of the deficiency in the tract of land in the proceedings mentioned, sold and conveyed by their ancestor to the appellee, when the pleadings indicate that the said <em>Bowen </em>is the sole administrator with the will annexed of said testator, and therefore that the decree for that matter ought to have been against him alone as such administrator. And the court is also of opinion that the decree against the said administrator <em>Bowen, </em>jointly with the other defendants, for costs <em>de bonis propriis, </em>was evidently hot intentional, but a mere oversight, which might have been corrected on motion in the court by which said decree was rendered, and is still amendable. It is therefore considered by the court that the said decree be, and the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>is hereby, amended in said particulars. And the court is further of opinion, that though the declaration in said decree, of the true boundaries of said tract of land, would by necessary implication relieve the heirs of said <em>Jacob Blessing </em>deceased from any responsibility, upon their ancestor\u2019s warranty, for the land out of those limits, but comprised within the erroneous deed executed by him to the appellee, yet that it would have been more regular to direct a release from the appellee, to the appellants who are the heirs of said <em>Jacob Blessing </em>deceased, of the land thus improperly conveyed. It is therefore considered by the court that the appellee do execute, to those of the appellants who are the heirs of said <em>Jacob Blessing </em>deceased, a good and sufficient deed of release for the land last mentioned. Therefore it is adjudged, ordered and decreed that the said decree, thus amended in the particulars aforesaid, be affirmed, and that the appellant <em>Bowen </em>out of the estate of his testator, and the other appellants out of their own estates, pay to the appellee his costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
