Fisher </em>was his attorney engaged in said cause ; that the said <em>Henry J. Fisher </em>was in possession of a paper material to the defence in said suit, which paper is to the tenor following:\u201d (The paper was here set out at length, purporting to be an assignment to <em>Roach </em>by <em>Thomas Carney, </em>of his interest in the <em>land; </em>and then the indictment proceeded), \u201c and that the aforesaid defendant could not go safely into trial without the production of the aforesaid writing from said <em>Thomas Carney </em>to said <em>William Roach; </em>and the jurors aforesaid, on their oaths aforesaid, do further present, that at and upon the motion aforesaid, it was a material question whether a continuance should be granted, or whether the said <em>Andrew Davis </em>and <em>William Davis </em>should be compelled on the day and year aforesaid to go into trial as aforesaid. And the jurors aforesaid, on their oath aforesaid, do further present, that the said <em>William Roach, </em>being so sworn as aforesaid, not having the fear of God before his eyes, nor regarding the laws of this <em>Commonwealth, </em>but being moved and seduced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>instigation of the devil, and contriving and intending to aggrieve the said <em>John Armstrong, </em>and unjustly to delay and hinder the due and speedy administration of justice, and to subject him the said <em>John Armstrong </em>to trouble and expense, did, then and there, on the motion for a continuance of said unlawful turning out of possession as aforesaid, upon his oath aforesaid, wilfully, corruptly, and by his own voluntary act, falsely and maliciously, before the said justices constituting a court as aforesaid, depose and swear, among other things, in substance and to the effect following ; that is to say, that <em>Henry J. Fisher </em>was his counsel engaged in said cause, and that the paper assigning the possession as aforesaid to the said <em>William Roach </em>by the said <em>Thomas Carney </em>as aforesaid, was in the possession of the said <em>Henry J. Fisher, </em>when in fact and in truth the said <em>Henry J. Fisher </em>was not the counsel of said <em>William Roach; </em>neither was the paper assigning the possession as aforesaid in the possession of the said <em>Henry J. Fisher, </em>but was in truth and in fact in the possession of the said <em>William Roach </em>at the time of taking the oath aforesaid. And so the jurors aforesaid, upon their oaths aforesaid, do say, that the said <em>William Roach, </em>on the occasion aforesaid, at the county of <em>Jackson </em>aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of the circuit superior court of law and chancery for <em>Jackson </em>county, before the said <em>Nehemiah Smith </em>and <em>John Kouns, </em>constituting a court as aforesaid, which court had then and there competent power and authority to administer an oath to the said <em>William Roach </em>as aforesaid, by his own voluntary act and consent did wilfully, corruptly and falsely commit wilful and corrupt perjury, to the evil example of all others in like cases offending, contrary to the form of the statute in such cases made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the <em>Commonwealth.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A05U\"><em>Roach </em>demurred to the indictment.
