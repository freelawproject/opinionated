November.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-6\">In ejectment, where the lessor is a fictitious person instead of the lessee, evidence on the part of the plaintiff, not going to shew a title in the lessor, ought to be excluded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-7\">Although the act of Jeofails, cures any objection of form or substance to tlie declaration in ejectment, after issue joined, yet it does not dispense with the rule, that the evidence must be relevant to the issue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b267-8\">Depositions ought not to be admitted in a suit at law, unless it appears by the record in what suit and by what authority they were taken, and that the wit* nesses could not attend at the trial.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-9\">This was an action of ejectment 'brought in the county court of Southampton, by Samuel Blunt and others, trustees of the Nottoway Indians, against Daniel Butts, for a messuage and fifty-nine acres and a half of land. The declaration laid a demise from <em>Aaron Burr </em>to the said trustees. An issue was made up on the plea of not guilty. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs, and the court rendered judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-10\">At the trial, the defendant excepted to the opinion of the court admitting certain depositions to be read in evidence. There is no commission contained in the record for taking these depositions. It is not stated whether they were taken in chief, or <em>de bene esse; </em>nor was there any evidence that the witnesses were dead or unable to attend the trial. These depositions go to prove the general reputation, that the lands in question were <em>Indian lands.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-11\">An appeal was taken to the superior court of Southampton, and the cause was afterwards removed to the superior court of Dinwiddie; and that court affirmed the judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-12\">From this judgment, the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AxZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Gilmer, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5_\">The depositions were improperly permitted by <em>the coun</em>ty court, to be read in evidence. 1. Because no suit was pen&lt;jjng a\u00a1- f\u00a1le time they were taken. They were taken on the 29th March, 1809, and the suit was brought on the 18th June, 1811. 2. There was no previous <em>affidavit </em>to warrant the issuing of a commission, and there does not appear to have been any commission. 3. There was no <em>notice i </em>for the certificate of it in the caption of the depositions is not sufficient. 4. The persons who took the depositions do not appear to have been <em>justices. </em>There is no consent to cure all these errors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-7\">These objections are sustained by the cases of <em>Minnis </em>vs. <em>Echols,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Collins </em>vs. <em>Lowry,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>They also shew that depositions in such a case can only be taken <em>de bene, esse, </em>unless by <em>consent; </em>and then certain steps must be taken, which have been wholly omitted in the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-8\">But even if they had been regularly taken, they <em>ought </em>to have been excluded, on account of their <em>matter. </em>They are intended to establish a right to <em>real property </em>by <em>hear, say emdenee </em>and <em>general reputation. </em>Even in cases of <em>boundary </em>of old manors, it is necessary to prove occupa~ <em>tion; </em>that the witnesses were dead, and in a situation to know the facts.<footnotemark>(<em>c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But the <em>right </em>to real property, never was proved by such evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-9\">The patent to Simonds Butts, from whom the appellant regularly derives his title, cannot be impeached in an ejectment. <footnotemark>(d<em>)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-10\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-11\">As to the objections to the <em>irregularity </em>of the depositions, they ought to appear upon the face of the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>otherwise, they cannot be urged for the first time, in the appellate court. It is incumbent on the party excepting to the opinion, to set forth the alleged error; not on the prevailing party, <em>to </em>shew that the judgment is right. All <em>presumptions </em>are in favor of the judgment of a competent tribunal. Tbe preliminary steps in taking depositions, are frequently omitted in records, from the mere circumstance, that no notice was taken of them in the court below : and it would operate as a surprize on a party, to state those objections for the first time, on the <em>appeal.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-3\">The objection to the <em>substance </em>of the depositions, cannot be sustained; for it amounts to this, that a person claiming under a previous grant of the commonwealth, made and sanctioned by law, cannot prove that certain lands are within that grant, in opposition to a patent for them, obtained one hundred years after the grant. The title of these Indians is distinctly recognized by numerous acts of Assembly; particularly by the acts of August, 1734, February, 1779, November, 1792, and December, 1803. Indian lands were never subject to location.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b268-12\"><em> </em>2 H. &amp; M. 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b268-13\"> 2 Wash. 75.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b268-14\"> Phil Evid. 182-3 ; Nicholls <em>vs. </em>Parker, note 14, East, 331.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b268-15\"> Witherington <em>vs. </em>McDonald, 1 H. &amp; M. 306,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><em>November </em>\u00a38th.</p>\n<author id=\"AzQ\">Judge Brooke,</author>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The declaration in this case, avers the lease to have been made by <em>Aaron Burr, </em>to the appellees, and the plea of not guilty, puts bis title in issue. Although the act of Jeofails, prohibits any exception of form or substance to the declaration in ejectment, after issue joined, yet the court is of opinion, that it does not dispense with the rule, that the evidence must be relevant to the issue. The depositions objected to in the bill of exceptions, prove nothing in relation to the title of <em>Aaron </em>Burr, tbe lessor of the plaintiffs; and on that ground were improperly admitted to go in evidence to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The court is further of opinion, that it not appearing by any thing in the record, in what suit or by what autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>j-ity, they were taken, nor that the witnesses could not .... attend at the trial, (and not deciding whether they were proper evidence of boundary) that the county court erred, on that ground also, in permitting them to go to the jury,</p>\n<p id=\"AATL\">The judgments of both courts are therefore reversed, and the cause remanded; the verdict to be set aside, and a new trial to be had.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
