If the recovery was obtained by fraud, the defendant may, by plea, put that matter in issue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b416-6\">Except in questions of descent, slaves are considered as chattels. \u2018</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9d9\">This was an action of covenant, brought by <em>Cooke, </em>in the District Court of <em>King and Queen, </em>upon a warranty contained in a deed poll, dated in 1779, by which the testator, for a valuable consideration, conveyed to <em>Cooke, </em>a negro, and covenanted for himself and <em>his heirs </em>to warrant the title against all persons whatsoever. The declaration charges, that the negro had been recovered by <em>William Morgan, </em>by the judgment of the County Court of <em>King and Queen, </em>in an action of <em>detinue, </em>and so, neither the testator nor the executor had kept the testator\u2019s covenant, but had broken the same, &amp;c. Upon the plea of covenants performed, the jury found a conditional verdict, subject' to the opinion of the Court;\u2014if upon the bill of sale, an action of covenant can be supported against the defendant as executor, and if evidence can be admitted, or is necessary, to prove, that notice was given to the defendant of the action of <em>detinue </em>having been brought, (the notice not having been stated in the declaration, and the defendant having pleaded conditions performed,) then they find for the plaintiff 94/.,10\u00ed. <em>5d. </em>damages ; but if the Court be of a different opinion, on both, or either of those points, .then they find for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-8\">The District Court determined in favor of the plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>Warden, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-3\">The plaintiff most certainly ought to have charged . in his declaration, and established by testimony, that he had given notice to the warrantor, or to those liable under the covenant, of the pendency of the suit brought to recover the negro conveyed by that deed, in order that proper attention and assistance might have been afforded by those so deeply interested in the defence of that suit. Otherwise, the judgment might have been recovered by <em>covin, </em>or negligence in the party; in which case the warrantor surely ought not to be bound. But it is not clear that this action could be maintained against executors. Negroes, at the time when that deed was made, were, by the law of this State, <em>real </em>property, and this being a covenant real, it descended upon the <em>heir, </em>who alone could be liable to this action. The heirs are specially named, and if this had been a deed for land, there could be no question, but that the executor, in such a case, could not have been sued upon the covenant.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-4\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-5\">The doctrine of warranty has nothing to do with this case. This is a covenant to warrant the title of a slave, and in all conveyances of such property, whether by deed or by will, they are considered as personal, and not real estate. The executor, though not named, is bound to compensate in damages for a breach of covenant by his testator, and as no particular form of words is necessary to make a covenant, the agreement to warrant in this case must be considered as a covenant, which certainly binds the executor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-6\">The notice which, it is supposed, ought to havNe been given to the warrantor, is not required by the deed; and it is only necessary for the plaintiff to lay the breach in the words of the deed, which he has done. If the judgment had been obtained by fraud, the defendant might, and ought to have pleaded it, that it might have been put in issue; and then the parties might have gone into the title.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b417-7\">Tre President.</author>\n<p id=\"ACF\">The objection, that a suit will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>not lie against the executor upon this warranty, because the testator bound only himself and his <em>heirs, </em>is novel and unfounded. Without inquiring whether the executor is bound by such a covenant in a conveyance of real estate, wherein he ,is not named, (which the Court forbear, it being hinted at the bar, that there is another case in Court where that is to be a question) it is clear that in personal contracts, if the testator be bound, the executor is also bound, though not named. This is such a personal contract; for in the sale of slaves, and in all transfers of them by deed, or will, they have ever passed as chattels, and were only considered as real estate in the case of descents.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">The objection to the want of notice of the pendency of the action of <em>detinue, </em>stands curiously upon the statement in the verdict. It would seem that the plaintiff was ready to prove such notice to the executor, if it were necessary. The objection comes from the defendant, that such was improper, because the notice was not charged in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">The Court however are of opinion, that it was not necessary to charge such notice in the declaration, nor to prove it. Every judgment of a Court is presumed to be fair until the contrary appears, and if there were any collusion between <em>Morgan </em>and <em>Cooke </em>in that action, it should have been pleaded, and proven on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b418-13\"> <em>Pegram </em>v. <em>Isabell, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 387. <em>Bower's ex. </em>v. <em>Glendening, </em>4 Munf. 219.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
