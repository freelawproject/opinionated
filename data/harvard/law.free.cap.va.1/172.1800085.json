It was once before in this court, and was sent back to the hustings court for a new trial. 5 Rand. 126. The case was then stated and agreed by the parties, and was, in substance, thus:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-10\"><em>George Hunter, </em>the plaintiff, was born in the county of <em>Fairfax, </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>the slave of <em>Thomas W. Offutt, </em>a resident citizen of that county; by whom he was given to his daughter, who married <em>William M. Offutt, </em>and after her marriage, removed with her husband, from <em>Fairfax </em>to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>county of <em>Montgomery </em>in <em>Maryland. </em>And upon their removal to <em>Maryland, </em>they carried <em>Hunter </em>with them, as their slav<em>e; </em>and <em>he </em>resided, with his master and mistress, in <em>Mary</em>land, about twelve years. After this residence in <em>Maryland, </em>he was brought back to <em>Virginia, </em>and was sold by his master <em>William M. Offutt, </em>in the county of <em>Jefferson, Virginia, </em>for valuable consideration, to one <em>Hill; </em>who after-wards brought him to <em>Richmond, Virginia, </em>as his slave, and there sold him to the defendant <em>Fulcher, </em>for 450 dollars. The sale to <em>Hill, </em>as well as the sale to <em>Fulcher, </em>was made after the year 1819. By an act of the general assembly of <em>Maryland, </em>passed at its session of November 1796, entitled <em>an act relating to negroes, and to repeal the acts of assembly therein mentioned, </em>it was, among other provisions, enacted as follows, <em>viz. </em>\u201c That it shall not be lawful from and after the passing of this act, to import or bring into this state, by land or water, <em>any negro, mulatto, or other slave, for sale, or to reside within this state; </em>and any person brought, into this state as a slave, contrary to this act, if a slave before, shall thereupon immediately cease to he the property of the person or persons, so importing or bringing such slave within this state, <em>and shall be free.\u201d </em>And this provision of the statute of <em>Maryland </em>was, at the time when <em>Hunter </em>was carried thither by <em>W. M. Offutt, </em>and during all the time of <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>residence there, and still is, in full force, as part of the statute law of that state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-5\">The question was, Whether upon this stale of facts, <em>Hunter </em>was entitled to his freedom ? The hustings court held, that he was not, and gave judgment for the defendant. <em>Hunter </em>appealed to the circuit court of <em>Henrico, </em>which affirmed the judgment. And then he appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Scott,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3f\">assigned counsel for the pauper. The appellant was born a slave in <em>Virginia. </em>He did not himself break his bondage: his owner, who was or became a citizen of <em>Maryland, </em>carried him to that state, to reside there, and in fact kept him there for twelve years: and by the positive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>law of <em>Maryland, </em>the owner forfeited all right of property in his person, and he was free. His right to freedom was completely vested in <em>Maryland. </em>But he did not assert it there. He was afterwards brought back to <em>Virginia </em>without any exercise of his own will, and <em>sold here </em>as a slave. And the only question is, whether he can assert in <em>Virginia, </em>the vested right of freedom he acquired by the law of <em>Maryland </em>?</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-4\">If he cannot, it is difficult to imagine any reason, why the owner of a slave in <em>Virginia, </em>carrying him of his own accord to <em>Maryland </em>to reside, and there voluntarily emancipating him in conformity with the laws of that state, may not, if he can at any time afterwards find or bring him here, resume the- property which he formerly held in him under the laws'of <em>Virginia: </em>for an act of manumission of the owner conferring freedom on his slave, by authority of the law of <em>Maryland, </em>cannot be more effectual to confer freedom, than the very law of <em>Maryland </em>itself, acting on persons and property to all intents and purposes subject to her jurisdiction. Neither is there any just reason, why this right to freedom acquired under the law of <em>Maryland </em>should not be enforced in <em>Virginia, </em>as well as any other personal right acquired under the laws of that or any other state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFD\">In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Fullerton, </em>1 Rand. 15. the pauper claimed a right to freedom, on the ground that his mother had, before his birth, sojourned in <em>Ohio, </em>and so had been made free by the law of that state, and had been there adjudged free, upon a writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>The only residence of the mother in <em>Ohio, </em>proved in the case, was, that she was once seen on a Sunday, working in a sugar camp there, in her owner\u2019s absence, and without any evidence that it was with his <em>permission; bat </em>the court said, that such <em>an occupation as that, </em>had it even been for the owner\u2019s benefit, and in his presence, could not operate an emancipation of his slave. As to the judgment on the <em>habeas corpus, </em>it had not affirmed the mother\u2019s right to freedom; and if it had, the court intimated ,a strong doubt, whether the judgment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number><em>hare </em>concluded the right of the owner, <em>in that instance; </em>that is, under the circumstances of that case. But the court indicated its opinion, clearly enough, that the effect of the residence of a <em>Virginia </em>slave in <em>Ohio, </em>for a great length of time, with the assent of the owner; the effect of that circumstance, in relation to that person who might thereby have become one of the permanent members of that <em>state; </em>would he to confer freedom upon him. Now, this is our case. And the previous adjudication in <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Fanny, </em>Gilm. 143. is in point, and conclusive, that the pauper here is free. There, a slave was sold by <em>Kincheloe </em>her owner to <em>Skinner </em>a citizen and resident , of <em>Ohio, </em>who held her there; the constitution of <em>Ohio </em>declared her <em>free; </em>and to avoid this her vested right to freedom, <em>Skinner </em>procured <em>Kincheloe to make a bill </em>of sale of her to <em>Griffith; </em>who finding her in <em>Virginia, </em>took possession of her, and claimed her as a slave. She asserted her right to freedom acquired in <em>Ohio, </em>under the constitution of <em>Ohio: </em>and this court adjudged her free.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b187-4\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An_\">There are principles of peculiar interest involved in this case. Is it competent to the state of <em>Maryland, </em>by her laws, so to devest rights of property acquired under the laws of <em>Virginia, </em>and according to them never in any way devested, as not only to deprive, the owner of the property, while he and it are in Maryland, but also to deprive him of it, after he has returned and brought it back to <em>Virginia </em>? Can <em>Maryland </em>impose a forfeiture for the violation of her laws, of such universal efficacy, that, though it have never been exacted there, while the offender and the subject were within her jurisdiction, it may and must he exacted here, whenever the offender and subject come within our jurisdiction, though offending against no law or policy of our own ? If it suit the policy of <em>Maryland, </em>to declare slaves imported into that state free, and to suffer slaves so emancipated to remain there, are our courts of justice to set them free in <em>Virginia, </em>with liberty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>to remain here, contrary to the policy of our own laws, which require slaves emancipated to leave the state ? The appellant\u2019s counsel must be prepared to maintain the affirmative on all these points.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-4\">If <em>Maryland </em>may devest the right of property in a <em>Virginia </em>slave carried thither, every other state in the union may do the same; so, indeed, may any foreign nation; for, in respect to their own merely internal concerns, the U. States are foreign to each other. If <em>Maryland </em>may declare a slave carried thither to reside, immediately free; she, and every other state, may declare a slave free, if his owner wilfully carry or send him there, no matter for what purpose, or for how short a time. Her power is as competent to the one act of legislation, as to the other; for the constitution of the U. States (art. 4. \u00a7 2.) only provides, that slaves <em>escaping from, one state into another, </em>shall not, in consequence of any law therein, be discharged from bondage. The statute of <em>Maryland </em>under consideration, setting free all slaves brought there to reside, does not fix any term of residence, or allow any discrimination in respect of the citizenship or domicil of the owner; so that if the appellant be adjudged free upon the strength of that statute, he was equally free the first hour of his stay in <em>Maryland, </em>as at the expiration of his twelve years residence; and he would have been equally free, if his <em>Virginia owner </em>had never moved to <em>Maryland </em>himself, but had only sent his slave to his farm on the other side of the <em>Potowmac. </em>The <em>Maryland </em>statute must be held effectual to this whole extent, if it be allowed to be effectual at all; that is, if it be allowed to operate in <em>Virginia, </em>it must be allowed to have the same effect here, as it had in <em>Maryland.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-5\">It is not more the province of our courts of justice, to enforce <em>this </em>forfeiture, to inflict <em>this </em>punishment, denounced by <em>Maryland </em>against a person violating her laws in this particular, than any other punishment for any other act, which, having regard to her own condition, she may think it just and politic to prohibit and punish. The general proposition would be rejected at once.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>' If <em>Maryland </em>thought it wise to promote partial emancipation in her territory, it is not perceived how it could further even her views, or how any comity towards her would require, that we should set slaves free in our territory; and surely, it is contrary to our policy to do so. This slave was brought back to <em>Virginia </em>since 1819, when the law of <em>Virginia </em>permitted emancipation <em>under its own authority, </em>only on condition, that the freedman should leave the state within twelve months (1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. \u00a7 61.) : but if this slave be set free, his right to freedom, being <em>derived from the law of Maryland, </em>that statute of <em>Virginia </em>will not embrace his case. He may remain here for life. Indeed, I do not perceive, how a person, who has been always held in slavery in another state, though he may be justly entitled to freedom <em>in that state, by </em>its laws, can therefore be set free in <em>Virginia; </em>for, though our laws respect the right of freedom actually enjoyed by persons belonging to any other state, they allow no emancipation of persons actually held in slavery, but such as is made under their own authority, and in conformity with their own provisions. When we say a person has a <em>vested </em>right of <em>freedom, </em>we use a phrase (for the want of one more appropriate) applicable, in its proper sense, only to rights of property. To say that a man is free, is not to say that he has a <em>vested property in himself, but to </em>describe his <em>status </em>or condition. This imperfection of language sometimes leads to fallacy of judgment: this court corrected a fallacy of the kind, in <em>Maria </em>v. <em>Surbaugh, 2 </em>Rand. 230. 246. It seems a solecism to say, that a man <em>actually in bondage, </em>has a <em>vested right of freedom. </em>If the appellant be set free, his right to freedom will <em>vest </em>by the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-5\">The constitution of <em>Ohio </em>declares, that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in that state, even for a moment. In <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Fullerton, </em>it appeared that the mother of the plaintiff, before his birth, had been once seen at work in <em>Ohio, </em>in the absence of her master, indeed, and for aught that appeared without his permission: but this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Said her working there for so short a time, for her owner\u2019s benefit, and in his presence, would not have altered the case. By the constitution of <em>Ohio </em>she was free: this court, administering the law of <em>Virginia, </em>adjudged her a slave.- The mother had been taken possession of, by one claiming her as his slave, and upon <em>habeas corpus </em>in <em>Ohio, </em>she was set at liberty; she was then <em>actually free </em>in <em>Ohio: </em>but this court strongly-questioned, whether, if the judgment on the <em>habeas corpus </em>had affirmed her right to freedom, that would have Concluded the right of her owner. The mother had been emancipated by deed made in <em>Ohio, </em>though under an agreement that she should be brought to <em>Virginia, </em>and serve her master here two years : this court held the deed ineffectual to emancipate her; because it was not recorded according to our law; and because \u201c the <em>lex loci </em>is to be taken, subject to the exception, that it is not to be enforced in another country, when it violates some moral duty, or <em>the policy of that country, </em>or <em>is inconsistent with a positive right secured to a third person or party, </em>by the laws of the country in which it is sought to be enforced. In such a case, we are told, <em>magis jus nostrum quarn jus alienum servemus. </em>That third party in this case is the commonwealth of <em>Virginia: </em>and her policy and interests are also to be attended to. These turn the scale against the <em>lex loci </em>in this instance. - For want of being emancipated agreeably to the provisions of our act, the duty of supporting the old and infirm slaves would devolve upon the commonwealth. That burthen is to be borne by the master in relation to slaves <em>so emancipated; </em>that is, emancipated agreeably to the provisions of the act.\u201d The decision of <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Fullerton, then, </em>and the reasoning it is founded on, sustain my view of the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-fU\">The court did not, in that case, decide upon the effect of a residence of a slave in <em>Ohio, </em>for a great length of time, and with the assent of the owner. It cautiously abstained from any decision upon it. And how can such a residence be material? _ It cannot vary the case in principle. It is not less competent to <em>Ohio </em>by her <em>constitution, </em>to give freedom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>to all slaves <em>permitted </em>by their owners to set foot on her soil, than it is to <em>Maryland </em>by statute, to set free all slaves brought diere to <em>reside </em>without fixing any term of residence. One term of residence does not disprove the owner\u2019s <em>animus revertendi </em>more than another: Where is the line to be drawn ? In this case the owner has done more than evince the <em>animus revertendi: </em>ho has returned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-4\">As to <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Fanny, </em>it does not appear from the report, that <em>Fanny </em>had ever been a slave in <em>Virginia, </em>or that <em>Kincheloe, </em>her first owner, was a citizen of <em>Virginia. </em>The transaction was a mere fraud on the law of <em>Ohio. </em>The case was not argued on any general principle: the court gave no reasons for its judgment: and <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Fullerton, </em>which was fully considered, was decided after it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-5\">In <em>England, </em>it is now settled, that a person who is a slave by the laws of one country, cannot acquire freedom, by going or being carried into another country, by the laws of which he is free while there, so that if he return or he brought hack (by whatever means) to his former country, he is exempt from his former bondage. Lord <em>Mansfield\u2019s </em>decision of the ease of <em>Somerset </em>(Howell\u2019s state trials, vol. 20.) seems to have made a general impression, that when once a slave got to <em>England, </em>he was thenceforth absolutely free. But Lord <em>Mansfield </em>decided nothing as to the operation of the laws of <em>England </em>beyond the limits of the realm: he only determined, that by the constitution of <em>England, </em>slavery could not exist there; and that, consequently, there was no authority in that kingdom, by which a slave, transported thither, could be compelled to return to a state of bondage in the country from which he was brought. Later decisions have corrected the false inferences deduced from <em>Somerset\u2019s </em>case. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 69. it was held, that <em>a fugitive </em>slave, coming to <em>England </em>from <em>Grenada, </em>and afterwards returning to <em>Grenada, </em>was subject to his former bondage iu <em>Grenada. </em>And in the case of <em>The mongrel woman Grace </em>(of which we have as yet only a newspaper report) Lord <em>Stowell </em>decided, that a slave brought by her owner from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number><em>Antigua </em>to <em>England, </em>and then carried back by her owner to <em>Antigua, </em>was lawfully held in bondage there. So, in our case, the appellant, a slave by the law of <em>Virginia, </em>was carried to <em>Maryland, </em>where he could not be lawfully held in bondage, but was in fact held as a slave there, and then brought back as a slave to <em>Virginia, </em>where he was born a slave, and where he might be still lawfully held in bondage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-4\"><em>Scott, </em>in his reply, said, that the <em>english </em>cases determined no more than this, that though the law of <em>England </em>afford no means of enforcing the rights of the owner of a slave over his person, while there, yet it does not emancipate the slave, because he comes or is brought to <em>England. </em>But, in this case, the law of <em>Maryland </em>did expressly emancipate the slave. The owner was domiciled in <em>Maryland: </em>he had voluntarily submitted his slave, and himself too, to her authority. Surely, it was a competent exercise of legislative authority in <em>Maryland, </em>to devest her own citizen\u2019s right of property in a slave imported in defiance of her laws, and to change the <em>status </em>of the slave from bond to free. In <em>M'Michen </em>v. <em>Amos, </em>4 Rand. 142. this court held that a slave imported into and held in <em>Virginia, </em>contrary to our statute of 1792, acquired <em>a perfect vested </em>right of freedom, so that, though held in actual bondage till all penalties and forfeitures incurred under that statute, had been taken away by another statute, he was all the time free.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-5\">Green, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Auy\">The decision of this case in favour of the appellant, does not appear to me to involve the proposition, that in <em>all cases </em>and under <em>all circumstances </em>(except that of persons bound to service in one state, escaping to another, provided for by the constitution of the U. States), a slave born and owned in <em>Virginia, </em>and found in another state, may be emancipated by the laws of that state, so as to enable him to assert that right in our courts. If it did, I should wish the cause to be submitted to the consideration of a full court. My strong impression is, that such a proposition cannot be supported, and was rightly denied by this court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Fullerton, </em>where it was held, that a slave temporarily employed in <em>Ohio, </em>for the benefit of her master, a resident citizen of <em>Virginia, </em>was not thereby entitled to be considered as free in the courts of <em>Virginia, </em>although she might be so considered in those of <em>Ohio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">In this case, a slave born and owned in <em>Virginia, </em>was carried to <em>Maryland </em>to <em>reside there, </em>and he was kept there for twelve years, by one who acquired a title to him by marriage, then being a resident citizen of <em>Maryland, </em>or soon afterwards removing and domiciliating himself there; thus voluntarily becoming a permanent member of that community, and submitting himself and his property to the full force of the laws of <em>Maryland, </em>by which the slave was declared to be <em>free; </em>and thereby also (according to the opinion of judge <em>Cabell, </em>in <em>Murray </em>v. <em>M\u2019Carty, </em>2 Munf. 393. in which I concur) becoming, upon the principles of natural law, and the spirit of our institutions, a citizen of that state. We are, therefore, called upon in this case, to enforce rights acquired in <em>Maryland, </em>under the laws of that state, against one claiming under a citizen of that state, after those rights were vested. And I see no objection, in principle, to giving full effect here, to those laws, operating on the rights of persons, who were to all intents and purposes justly subjected to them, and touching the rights of no others: in this respect, the case is like that of <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Fanny, </em>where a citizen of <em>Virginia </em>carried a slave to <em>Ohio, </em>and there sold and delivered her to a resident citizen of that state, who, in fraud of the laws of <em>Ohio, </em>look a bill of sale to a resident citizen of <em>Virginia, </em>in trust for himself, and retained possession of the slave in <em>Ohio </em>for two years. The court there, enforced the laws of <em>Ohio </em>against a resident citizen of that state, without affecting the rights or interests of any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The english cases cited do not touch this, in any point. They were all collated and examined by lord <em>Stowell </em>in the case of <em>The mongrel woman Grace, </em>decided by him in 1827. And he declared their effect to be, that the laws of <em>England </em>did not emancipate slaves brought there, or annihilate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>master\u2019s rights, but afforded no remedy for enforcing them, the relation of master and slave not being known to the common law; and that, upon the return of the slave to the country from whence he was brought, the subsisting rights of the master might be there enforced, according to the laws of that country.</p>\n<author id=\"b194-4\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AGW\">Agreeing, as I do, with the general view taken of this case by my brother <em>Green, I 1 </em>should not add a word, but to mark the exact extent to which I mean to go. The law of <em>Maryland, </em>having enacted, that slaves carried into that state for sale or to reside, shall be free; and the owner of the slave here, having carried him to <em>Maryland, </em>and resided there with him for twelve years, thus becoming himself a citizen of <em>Maryland, </em>and voluntarily subjecting himself and the slave to the operation of her laws; I think the right to freedom vested, and could not be divested, by the bringing him back afterwards to Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Cabell, <em>J. </em>concurred in the opinion, that the judgment should be reversed, and judgment entered for the appellant</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
