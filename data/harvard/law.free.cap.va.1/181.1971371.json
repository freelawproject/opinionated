The case, as extracted from the bill, answer, depositions, and exhibits, was shortly as follows, viz: <em>John Spots-wood, </em>the father, died some time in the year 1758. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>seised of a considerable entailed estate, part of which consisted of very valuable iron works, and leaving a widow, (whoafterwards intermarried with <em>John Campbell,) </em>as also the appellee his eldest son and heir at law, and one other son. <em>Campbell, </em>after his intermarriage, agreed with the said <em>Hunter </em>to sell him the proportion of the iron made at the works, to which he would be entitled, in right of his wife\u2019s dower in the same ; and <em>Bernard Moor, </em>the guardian of the appellee and executor of <em>John Spotswood, </em>agreed to deliver the same to <em>Hunter, </em>upon his undertaking to pay for <em>Campbell </em>a debt due from his wife to the executor, for property belonging to the estate, and sold to her before her intermarriage ; and also one third of the expenses which might be. incurred in carrying on the iron works. In consequence of this agreement, the iron was delivered to <em>Blunter, </em>who paid to the executor the debt due from <em>Campbell </em>on account of his wife, and part of the expenses. <em>Campbell </em>having left this country, attachments were sued out against his effects by <em>Hunter, </em>who had a considerable claim against him; as also by <em>Bernard Moor, </em>to recover the amount of the expenses due from him on account of the iron works, which then remained unpaid. <em>Bernard Moor </em>obtained a judgment in the County Court, which was reversed in the General Court, and the attachment quashed, \u201c it appearing to that Court that <em>Campbell </em>had given public notice of his intention to leave the country, which vvas known to his creditors.\u201d But <em>Herndon, </em>(the sheriff,) having levied the attachment- upon property belonging to <em>Campbell, </em>the Court directed that he should sell the same, and pay the money to <em>Hunter, </em>he giving security to be accountable for it, in such manner as the Court should thereafter direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-10\">At the sale of the attached effects, <em>Hunter </em>purchased to the amount of 650/., but failed to give security, according to the direction of the Court. He declined receiving the balance of the money, amounting to about <em>7501., </em>which, <em>with </em>interest, is now claimed from <em>Herndon\u2019s </em>executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>The appellee also claims from <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>executors the 650/., with interest, and also about 300/., the ba-, lance of <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>debt due for the expenses of the iron works.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-4\"><em>Hunter\u2019s </em>executors answered, and also put in three pleas, to wit: 1st. To the jurisdiction. 2d. The act of limitations; and, 3d. Want of right in the plaintiff to sue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-5\"><em>Herndon\u2019s </em>executors in their answer say, that the money died in the hands of their testator, and, therefore, it ought not now to be paid in specie.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-6\">The bill being taken for confessed, as to <em>Campbell, </em>for 1717/. O\u00ed. l\u00fc|(/., the Court decreed the same to be paid by that defendant. That 697/. 3i. <em>Hid., </em>part thereof, in the hands of <em>James </em>Hunter, should be paid by his executors, and 722/. 13\u00ed. <em>lid., </em>other part thereof, remaining in the hands of <em>Herndon, </em>(both sums bearing interest from the 3d of <em>May, </em>1770,) should be paid by his executors to the plaintiff, after deducting the costs of those defendants ; the plaintiff to give such bond and security as the law requires.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b203-7\"><em>Washington, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-8\">The plea to the jurisdiction cannot be sustained. This suit is brought for the purpose of enforcing a settlement of a long and complicated account, subsisting between different persons, but the whole so interwoven, that complete justice could not be done unless all those persons were before the Court. In cases where an <em>an action of account </em>may be brought, a suit in Equity may properly be sustained. 1 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-9\">Much stronger is this case, when, by resorting to this tribunal, multiplicity of suits is prevented. Thus, if <em>Spotswood </em>had sued <em>B. Moor </em>and recovered, <em>Moor </em>would recover against <em>Hunter. </em>So, if he recover against <em>Herndon\u2019s </em>executors, they must recover against <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>executors. All the parties being before the Court, a decree is made against <em>Herndon\u2019s </em>executors for the money retained by that testator, and against <em>Hunter\u2019s </em>executors for the money received by theirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-10\">The next objection to a recovery, is the act of 11 mi-tat\u00a1ons--as to the 650/. received by Hunter, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>Herndon, there can exist no doubt. <em>Hunter </em>was not , only a trustee for that money, in the same manner as <em>Herndon </em>would have been, had he retained it, but he was guilty of a fraud, in obtaining the possession of <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>property, from <em>an officer of the </em>Court, against the order of that Court ; and that too, under a promise to give bond and security as the order required, which he afterwards refused to do. Cases of trust, or fraud, are without the operation of the Act of limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-10\">As to the remaining sum of 300/., respecting which an account is directed, there is more difficulty ; but I am inclined to think, that there .are sufficient circumstances in the case, to take it out of the operation of the Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-11\"><em>Hunter, </em>having received the profits of an infant\u2019s estate, is a trustee for those profits, and therefore cannot protect himself by length of time. Again~ the iron in the 'hands of <em>Hunter </em>was a deposit, placed there by <em>Campbell, </em>chargeable with the payment of a certain debt to <em>Spotsivood, </em>which places him in the situation of a trustee, bound to execute the trust for which the pledge was placed in his hands. But I principally rely upon the particular circumstances of this case. The appellee after his arrival at age, appears to have been totally in the dark as to his affairs, which had been conducted by his guardian, until a few years before the late war commenced; and this suit was brought shortly after its conclusion. There are many cases which do not come within any of the exceptions from the Act of Limitations, and yet are construed to come within the equity of them;\u2014as if the time has elapsed during a period when no executor has qualified, or where there is a contest respecting the right of administration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-12\">As to the right of the appellee to sue, it is clear that if he cannot, no other person can. He is entitled to to the subject of recovery, namely, the profits of the land, and whatever objection might have been made to him at law, in this Court none can exist.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b204-13\">Objections are made to the depositions of two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>the witnesses, on the ground of interest. To one of them, because he is the executor of one of the securities of <em>B. </em>Moor, in his capacity of guardian ; to the other, because he was security for <em>B. </em>Moor, on his suing out the attachment against <em>Campbell. </em>As to the first, the recorr\u00ed does not shew that he is executor. But if it did, the interest is too remote to preclude him from giving testimony, 4 <em>Burr. </em>2255, 1 <em>Str. </em>575, are stronger than the present. Again\u2014both witnesses were cross examined by the objecting party, which estops him now, to impeach them on the ground of <em>incompetency\u2014Vern. </em>254\u20142 <em>Bac. Ab. </em>289-4 <em>Burr. </em>2252. 1 <em>Ld. Ray. </em>730.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-4\">As to the objection to the other witness, there is no colour for it; because, whether Spotswoodsucceeds, or fails in this cause, it will not bar <em>Campbell </em>of his action on the attachment bond, if the attachment issued illegally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-5\">As to <em>HerndoFs </em>executors, the princ is to the claim for interest on the m him. I admit, that if he actually kepj\u00bb trie mone him during the whole time, he ought est. But the answ er admits that this v|as not the case, for if it u ere, the money could not but would at this day, be specially tins\u00edgame tliat J. was w-hen received. A tender, will not even^fi^pnty prevent interest from running, unless the money was kept, and no profit made of it; and this should be sworn to by the party. 2 <em>Ch. Cas. </em>206\u20142 <em>P. Wms. </em>373\u20142 <em>Vern. </em>192.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-6\">For the appellants, it was argued by <em>Marshall, War </em>den, and <em>Stark.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-7\">They contended that this was a stale demand, putting the Act of Limitations out of the question, and ought not to be countenanced in a Court of Equity. The plaintiff came of age in 1768, and this suit was not commenced until 1784. It appears, that within a short period after his taking possession of his estate, he had a schedule of it delivered to him. Even if <em>Hunter </em>is to be considered as a trustee of the profits received during the infancy of the plaintiff, still, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Act of limitations will run against a suit to recover those profits. 1 <em>Eq. Ca. Ab. </em>304\u2014if the iron is to be considered as a deposit in the hands of Hunter, and so ]jjte to g00ds pledged, there cannot exist a case of a sale, where the same argument may not be urged\u00bb The truth is, that the iron was sold by <em>Campbell </em>to Hunter, and he assumed to pay so much to <em>B: Moor </em>for it. As to the fraud charged upon Hunter, there is not more Aan exists in every case of a breach of promise to pay money, or to perform any act. But if it were a fraud, still the Act of Limitations will begin to run from the time it is discovered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-6\">The objection to the jurisdiction was not relied upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-7\">They observed that the order of the General Court, directing <em>Herndon </em>to pay the proceeds of the attached property to Hunter, was very unusual and improper, upon attachments of this sort, and could be accounted for in no other way, than by supposing that the money was intended to be paid to him as a creditor of <em>Campbell </em>: the General Court at that time having an equitable jurisdiction in cases of attachments against absentees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-8\">The cases cited to prove that the cross-examination. of a witness amounts to a waver of all exceptions to his competency, must have been decided upon the principle, that the party knew of the objection at the time of the examination, otherwise the doctrine would be unreasonable and absurd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-9\">As to <em>Herndon\u2019s </em>executors, it was contended to be a settled rule, that a sheriff, or a stake holder, pays no interest. Interest is a retribution for the use of money, and therefore, if the person having the principal money in possession, is not permitted to use it, (being liable at any moment to be called upon for it,) he ought not to pay interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b206-10\">The answer (it is said) does not state that the money was unemployed by <em>Herndon: </em>if it had, it would not have been evidence, since the contrary not being charged in the bill, such an allegation would not have been responsive to it. <em>Herndon </em>was not bound to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>keep the identical money by him. He might have deposited it with a friend for safe keeping, by means it might have been lost. The money might well have died in his hands, as the answer states, without his having parted with it, when it is recollected, that this country was at that time full of <em>James\u2019 </em>River bank notes, which were totally lost to the holders by the war.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The Court were just about to deliver an opinion, when it was observed by Mr. Marshall, that it did not appear in the record, or by the decree, that publication against <em>Campbell </em>had been made in the Gazette, which ought to have been done, he being an absent debtor, and not served with the process\u2014that without a publication <em>Campbell </em>was no party to the suit: and therefore a decree against persons called upon to pay <em>his </em>money, would be as improper as if he had been <em>personally </em>decreed to pay it. And though the Chancellor ordered that publication should be made, yet the execution of that order is not to be presumed, unless there be evidence of it in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">A certificate was then produced from the Clerk of the High Court of Chancery, stating that due publication had been made <em>% </em>but this was not considered as sufficient by a majority of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">In answer to the objection, it was argued that no person could take advantage of this omission but Campbell, who had not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">But the Court, for this reason only, reversed the decree, and sent back the cause to the High Court of Chancery. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> ,<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\"> The Chancellor having corrected the error by stating in bis decree, that evidence of publication was proved to him, the canse went back to the Special Court of Appeals, where the decree was affirmed <em>in </em>toto.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b207-11\"> <em>Tazewell's ex. </em>v. <em>Barrett &amp; Co. </em>4 Hen, <em>&amp; </em>Munf. 262. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Beverleys, </em>ib. 415. <em>Hadfield v.
