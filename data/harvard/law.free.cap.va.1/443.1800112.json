The marriage took place. The deed was duly recorded in the county court of <em>Hanover, </em>on the 27th July 1820, the property being at the time in that county. <em>Pledge </em>the husband, within two months after, removed, and brought the slaves with him, to the city of <em>Richmond; </em>but the deed of marriage settlement, was not recorded, either in the hustings court of <em>Richmond </em>or in the county court of <em>Henrico. </em>And by indenture, dated the 22fi-jan u ary 1821, and duly recorded the same day in the hustings court, <em>Pledge, </em>the husband, conveyed them to <em>Riddle, </em>in trust, to secure a debt he owed to <em>Shippard.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-4\"><em>Riddle </em>being about to sell these slaves, under this deed of trust, to satisfy the debt due to <em>Shippard, </em>and having actually advertised them for sale, <em>Hughes, </em>the trustee in the marriage settlement, exhibited his bill in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond, </em>against <em>Pledge </em>the husband, and the trustee <em>Riddle, </em>setting forth the marriage settlement, and the other facts above stated, and praying, that <em>Riddle, </em>the trustee for <em>Shippard, </em>should be enjoined from selling or otherwise interfering with the property. This bill was filed, and an injunction awarded accbrding to the prayer of it, June 12th, 1821. And on the 22d February 1822, an amended bill was filed, making <em>Shippard </em>a party defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number><em>Shippard, </em>in his answer, insisted, 1st, that, though the deed of marriage settlement was duly recorded in the county court of <em>Hanover, </em>in which county the property was at the time, yet <em>Pledge, </em>the husband, having the possession of it, removed, and brought it with him, to <em>Richmond,, </em>within less than two months afterwards, <em>and the deed was never recorded there; </em>and, therefore, was void as to him, a purchaser for valuable, consideration without notice, according to the provisions of the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99. \u00a7 11. p. 364. And, 2ndly, that, at least, the interest which <em>Pledge </em>had, or had a right to dispose of, in the property, under the marriage settlement itself, was subject to <em>Shippard\u2019s </em>claim, and ought to be applied towards the satisfaction of it; namely, the use of the property during the joint lives of the husband and wife, and the contingent interest limited to the husband after the wife\u2019s death without making any appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-4\">Pending this suit, <em>Shippard </em>on his part exhibited a bill, complaining, that <em>Hughes </em>and <em>Pledge </em>had evinced a design to remove the subject beyond the jurisdiction of the court, and praying an injunction to restrain them from doing so; which was allowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">The two causes came on together for a final hearing, in June 1826. The chancellor held, that the case stated in <em>Hughes\u2019s bill </em>was not proper for relief in equity, because if he had right, he had a complete remedy at law; founding this opinion against the jurisdiction of the court, upon his understanding of the authority of the case of <em>Bowyer </em>v. <em>Creigh, </em>3 Rand. 25. And, therefore, he dismissed that bill with costs. As to <em>Shippard\u2019s </em>suit, he held, that the deed of marriage settlement, not having been recorded in <em>Richmond </em>or <em>Henrico, </em>whither the slaves had been brought soon after the marriage, and where they had ever since remained, was void as against <em>Shippard; </em>and, therefore, he perpetuated the injunction he had granted to <em>Shippard, </em>and decreed a sale of the slaves to satisfy the debt for which they were mortgaged to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-7\"><em>Hughes </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number><em>Scott, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoYv\">upon the question of jurisdiction, raised in the first suit, cited <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>3 Rand. 170. <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Randolph, </em>6 Rand. 194. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>Id. 506. directly in point to sustain the jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b458-4\">As to the omission to have the marriage settlement recorded in <em>Richmond </em>or <em>Henrico, </em>after the subject had been brought there, he said, 1st, That this deed was a conveyance by the wife of her own property only; and whether it had been recorded at all or not, it was good against the creditors of, or purchasers from, the husband, as he was not the grantor. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>5 Cranch 154. <em>Land </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>5 Rand. 211. 2ndly, That, supposing this the case of a deed respecting the title of personal chattels, which by law ought to be recorded, yet the statute only provided, that in case the person claiming title under the deed, should permit the person in possession of the subject, to remove with it to another county, and should not within <em>12 </em>months after the removal, have the deed recorded there also, the deed should be void, so long as it should not be so recorded, as to <em>'all purchasers without notice </em>and all creditors. Now, <em>Shippard </em>had full notice of this marriage settlement, within the twelve months allowed for recording it in <em>Richmond </em>or <em>Henrico ; </em>for the bill of <em>Hughes, </em>the trustee, was exhibited, and the injunction to restrain <em>Shippard\u2019s </em>trustee, <em>Riddle, </em>from selling the property, was awarded, within nine months after it was brought to <em>Richmond.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>Shippard, </em>in his answer, insists, that <em>Pledge, </em>the husband was entitled to an interest m the subject, under the deed of marriage settlement; and that <em>his </em>interest in it, at least, ought to be held liable to his debts, and subject to his disposition. But, to allow any sale or disposition of <em>his </em>interest to interfere with or affect the trust for the <em>joint </em>use of the husband and wife, during their joint lives, would be to defeat the purposes, as well as the express intent, of the settlement. <em>Scott and wife </em>v. <em>Gibbon &amp; Co. </em>5 Munf. 86.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-7\">No counsel for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-11\"> There are two provisions affecting this point, in the statute of conveyances; 1 Rev.

The question as to the inefficacy of the deed, depends on the construction of the <em>11th </em>section of the statute of conveyances. That section allows to the person claiming title under the deed, <em>the </em>term of twelve months, to have the deed recorded in the court of that county or corporation, to which the property may he removed. If, therefore, the deed he recorded there, at any time within the twelve months, it will defeat any previous sale which may have been made of the property. And as the main object of recording such deeds, is to afford the means of obtaining information as to the title of the property, it would seem that, as to that object, actual notice of the deed would he as effectual as if it were re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>corded. Accordingly, this section of the statute, so far as relates to purchasers, makes notice of the deed equivalent t0 recording it; for it vacates an unrecorded deed as to such purchasers only, as are purchasers without notice. In the cases before us, it is evident, that <em>Shippard </em>had notice of the deed within twelve months. On this ground alone\u2014 independently of any influence which the case of <em>Land </em>v. <em>Jeffries </em>may have on this; and admitting that the deed of 18th July 1820, in order-to be effectual against the creditors of the husband, ought to have been duly recorded, (as it really was) in the county court of <em>Hanover; </em>and without considering or deciding, whether, if the husband and wife were justly entitled to the possession and use of the slaves in the deed mentioned, and removed and held possession of them in the county of <em>Henrico </em>and city of Richmond, the case can come within that clause of the law, which speaks of the person claiming title permitting \u201c any other person in whose possession such property may be, to remove the same,\u201d &amp;c. or whether, if the wife, for her sole and separate use, was entitled to the possession of the slaves, and her husband had removed them, she could be considered as <em>permitting </em>their removal within the meaning and intention of the act\u2014without considering any of these points, the court is of opinion to reverse the decrees in both cases; to perpetuate the injunction in the first case, and to dissolve the injunction and dismiss the bill in the second.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
