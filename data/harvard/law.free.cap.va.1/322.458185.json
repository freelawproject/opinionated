If either of them should die before twenty-one, or marriage, leaving no issue, the survivor was to receive the portion of his deceased brother <em>; </em>but, if the said Isabella should survive both her children and their issue, he gave her the said estate in fee-simple. The testator appointed the said Isabella, and two other persons his executors, desiring at the same time, that the said Isabella might act without the interference of the other executors, if she was so disposed, and that no security whatever might be required of her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-4\">The said Isabella alone qualified, without giving security, according to the directions of the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">In the year 1815, <em>Isabella Jones </em>married <em>John S. </em>Stubbs, <em>senr., </em>having previously entered into articles of agreement with the <em>said </em>Stubbs, <em>by </em>which it is <em>agreed, that </em>all the property of the said <em>Isabella, </em>should remain subject to her own control and disposition, freed from the marital rights of the said <em>Stubbs, </em>and that all the property of the said Stubbs, should be free from the dower and other matrimonial rights of the said <em>Isabella ; </em>giving her an unlimited power of disposition during the coverture, and if she survived the said Stubbs, without having made any disposition of the said property, then to the only use and behoof of the said <em>Isabella, </em>her heirs and assigns forever.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-6\">After the marriage between the said <em>Isabella </em>and the said <em>Stubbs, </em>viz : on the first day of April, 1816, a deed of settlement was executed in pursuance of the said articles, in which <em>Francis Whiting </em>was made the trustee; by which all the property real and personal which had been settled on the said Isabella, by the deed first mentioned, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the will of <em>Emanuel Jones, </em>was settled on the said <em>Isabella </em>and her children <em>Emanuel Macon </em>and <em>William Booth Jones </em>or to the use of any other person she might appoint by deed or will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQ0\"><em>John S. Stubbs </em>died in 1821; and the said <em>Francis Whiting, </em>the trustee in the last mentioned deed, filed a bill in the county court of Gloucester, suggesting, that the said <em>Isabella </em>was about to convey a part, if not the whole of the said slaves, and other personal property, out of the state, and praying that the sheriff might go forthwith and take possession of the negroes and other personal property, disposed of for the benefit of the said <em>Isabella </em>and her children, the said <em>Emanuel Macon </em>and <em>William Booth Jones.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-7\">The county court made an order restraining the said <em>Isabella C.

Jones, </em>all her individual rights over the property in question were preserved <em>to </em>her, free from the control of her intended <em>husband; </em>and it is expressly provided, that in case of her surviving him, (the event which has happened,) she should he remitted to all the estate which she had before the marriage. The estate was not <em>joint, </em>to her and her two children by <em>Jones; </em>but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>was <em>exmessln </em>placed under her entire control, both by the <em>1 J 1 ,,, . </em>marriage agreement, and by the settlement made after marriage and intended to carry the agreement into effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJL\">But,' if the articles and the deed are at variance, the articles ought to be preferred; more especially where the deed, (as in this case,) professes to follow the articles. The articles are made <em>before </em>marriage; the deed <em>after-wards ; </em>and the authorities are explicit, that in such case, the <em>articles </em>will be <em>set up.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The chancellor, therefore, erred in requiring her to give bond, that she would not remove the property conveyed by the articles, out of the state; but, if there is any property given by the <em>will </em>of <em>Emanuel Jones, </em>not comprised in the marriage agreement with him, a restraining order may be proper.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-8\">No counsel for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\"><em> </em>1 Fonb.

Stubbs, </em>and herself, to the appellee, was intended by the parties to be made in pursuance of the marriage articles, entered into <em>between </em>them, before marriage, and bearing date the 18th of July, 1815, and must be controlled thereby; by which she having survived the said <em>John S. Stubbs, </em>again became entitled, in absolute right, to all the property included in the marriage articles first above mentioned. The decree, therefore, so far as it restrains the appellant from removing, or otherwise using that property, is erroneous, and must be reversed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>And the cause is remanded to the court of chancery, for an enquiry to be made, whether the marriage articles and deed of settlement, between the appellant and her last husband <em>John S. Stubbs, </em>embraces any other personal estate, than that derived to her in and by the marriage settlement aforesaid, between her and her first husband <em>Emanuel Jones, </em>which she holds as executrix of the will of the said <em>Jones; </em>and in that event, further to enquire, whether she has given sufficient security as executrix, and if not, to take such measures, as may be proper and effectual, to compel her <em>to </em>give such security : or otherwise to provide for the preservation of such property, and its ultimate disposition, according to the rights of the parties interested therein. But, in case such sernrity shall have been given, then the bill is to be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
