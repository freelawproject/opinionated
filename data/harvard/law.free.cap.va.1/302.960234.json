By his will, which is dated in 1804, he devised and bequeathed to each of his sons, <em>John, William, Richard, </em>and <em>Armstead, </em>to his daughter <em>Sophia, </em>and grandson <em>John Waller Hoomes, </em>real estate and slaves, giving to each of them, in express terms, an estate in fee simple in the property devised to them.

Apperson </em>the land devised to him by the will of his father, and, in this conveyance <em>Richard </em>united, and entered into a covenant, by which he bound himself and his heirs to warrant the title to the land generally. This land, or that part of it in controversy in this cause, came, by regular conveyances, into the possession of <em>William W. Dickinson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">In 1827, the children of <em>Richard Hoomes </em>filed their bill in the chancery court of <em>Fredericksburg </em>against Dickinson, in which they alleged the facts as above stated. They claimed to be entitled, under the will of their grandfather, <em>John Hoomes </em>the elder, to one undivided fourth of the land devised to <em>John Hoomes </em>the younger; and prayed for a division thereof, and for an account of rents and profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">In 1830, <em>Dickinson </em>demurred to the bill, on the ground that the title set up by the plaintiffs was a legal title, and proper to be tried at law, and, therefore, the court had no jurisdiction of the cause. The court overruled the demurrer, and made an order to retain the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>cause for a reasonable time, to enable the plaintiffs to establish their title at law: and the cause was removed to the circuit superior court for the <em>county of Caroline.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL_\">The children of <em>Richard Hoomes </em>then brought an action of ejectment, in the superior court of law and chancery for the county of Caroline, against <em>Dickinson </em>for the recovery of so much of the land, devised by <em>John Hoomes </em>sen\u2019r to <em>John Hoomes </em>jr. as was in his possession; and the parties having agreed the facts substantially as above stated, the court pronounced judgment thereon, in favour of the plaintiffs, for two undivided fourth parts of the land in possession of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-8\">A copy of the record in the ejectment case, having been filed in the chancery cause, and the defendant not having answered, the court proceeded to take the bill for confessed, and made a decree in favour of the plaintiffs, for one full fourth part of the land mentioned in the judgment in the action of ejectment, and appointed commissioners to lay it off by metes and bounds. The court farther decreed, that the defendant should render an account of the rents and profits of the land from the 1st of January 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-9\">The defendant <em>Dickinson </em>applied for and obtained appeals from the judgment at law, and the decree in equity, and the causes came on to be heard together in this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-10\"><em>C. Sy G. N. Johnson </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKr\">This case turns upon that clause in the will of <em>John Hoomes </em>the elder, by which he devises over the estate he had given to each of his sons, upon his dying without issue at his death. It is impossible to give any construction to this paper, which will not require some change in the phraseology.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-11\">The appellees claim as remaindermen, and not as heirs of then- father <em>Richard, </em>under the term representative. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>We insist that they must claim as heirs of <em>Richard, </em>and he having conveyed the land now in controversy with general warranty, they have no title. The question turns upon the words \u201c survivors or their representatives.\u201d The appellees read the clause as if it said \u201cto the surviving children, and the heirs of such as are dead.\u201d We say \u201c the survivors and their heirs.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-4\">The word \u201csurvivors\u201d often means \u201cothers,\u201d as may be seen from the cases of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>1 Call 165; <em>Bells </em>v. <em>Gillespie, 5 </em>Rand. 273; <em>Broadus </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>Id. 308; <em>Sydnor </em>v. <em>Sydnors, </em>2 Munf. 263; <em>Burfoot </em>v. <em>Burfoots, </em>2 Leigh 119; <em>Wilmot </em>v. <em>Wilmot, </em>8 Ves. Rep. 10; and <em>Hansford </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>9 Leigh 79. The result of these cases is, that a party designated by the term survivor, must not necessarily be alive when the previous estate falls in; but it passes to his heirs, as heirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-8\">The only other objection to the title of <em>Richard </em>arises out of the word \u201c or.\u201d But on any construction that can be given to this will, this word \u201cor\u201d must be read as \u201cand.\u201d That it may be so read, will be seen from the cases of <em>Read </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>2 Atk. 642, and <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>1 Ves. sen. 409.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-10\">As to the real estate, <em>the </em>word \u201crepresentatives\u201d must mean heirs; and as to the personalty, next of kin. This is its true meaning, and there is nothing in this will which restricts it. What representatives then are to take ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-11\">Clearly those who would have taken, if the persons designated as survivors had died intestate, for the will directs that they shall take according to the statute of descents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-12\">2. The deed of <em>Richard Hoomes </em>is a deed with covenant of general warranty binding the covenantor, his heirs and personal representatives, and the court should, therefore, have directed an enquiry to ascertain, whether the heirs had not received assets by descent fom their father.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A-G\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdI\">We read the will of <em>John Hoomes </em>the elder, according to the usual and natural meaning of the language employed; taking \u201c survivors\u201d as meaning the children who survive, \u201c or\u201d in its usual sense, and \u201c representatives\u201d as descendants. Although it is true that \u201c survivors\u201d is sometimes read \u201c others,\u201d to carry out the intent of the testator, yet it does not always, or generally, bear this meaning, as will be seen from the cases of <em>Burfoot </em>v. <em>Burfoots, </em>2 Leigh 119, and <em>Broadus </em>v. <em>Turner, 5 </em>Rand. 308. As to <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Tyler, Bells </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>and other cases of that class, the question was, not on the force of the word \u201c survivor,\u201d but whether the first taker took an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-6\">It is true, likewise, of the word \u201cor,\u201d that it sometimes means \u201c and,\u201d to effect the intent of the testator; but that is not always or generally its meaning. Bridgman\u2019s Index, title \u201c Meaning of words.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">Take the language of the testator in its usual and natural sense, and the obvious intention is, to limit over the estate of the child dying without issue, to the surviving children, and the descendants of such as are dead; these last, to take <em>per stirpes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\">2. The covenant of <em>Richard Hoomes </em>is not a technical warranty, but a personal covenant of warranty. <em>Binford </em>v. <em>Tabb\u2019s heirs, </em>4 Leigh 182. And it is only to the former, that the statute applies; 1 Rev. Code, ch. 99, \u00a7 20, 21, p. 368; though it is true, that an action of covenant would lie upon it against the heirs, if they are bound by the covenant. But if assets by descent would have been a good defence to this action; it is surely matter of defence, and if the defendant has not set up or sustained that defence; that is his own neglect or failure, and not ours.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b330-9\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APK\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The court is of opinion, that the general intent of the testator, <em>John Hoomes </em>the elder, was to keep the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>property devised to his children respectively (placing his grandson upon the footing of a child) in his family, as long as he could consistently with the rules of law, and without cross remainders, but so as not to restrict the estates in fee given to the first takers further than was expedient in carrying out that general intent. The obvious mode of effecting his purpose, as our laws do not allow the existence of estates tail, was to reduce the estates in fee devised to the children respectively, in the event of their dying without leaving issue, to estates for life; and upon the happening of such contingency in regard to any one of them, to limit over the remainder in fee by way of executory devise to his other children and their descendants. And if there be any difficulty in the construction of this part of the will, it is upon the question, whether the limitation over is to the children who should survive the testator, or those who should survive the first taker. The latter, we think, was the testator\u2019s intention. He clearly intended, if any child should die leaving issue, that such issue should succeed to the original share of the parent, and also to what would have been the contingent interest of the parent, in the original share of any other child, dying before him or her <em>without issue. And </em>whether such succession is to be by descent or purchase, is to be determined by considering, what surviving children were contemplated as beneficiaries on the happening of the contingency. Are we to look to the dead as well as the living, or the living only and the issue of the dead ? We think the latter. We think the testator intended that his children respectively, leaving descendants, should have an estate in fee in the property devised to them respectively; and those not leaving descendants an estate for life only, with a limitation over of the remainder in fee to the testator\u2019s children then surviving, and the descendants of those not then surviving, such descendants to take <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita. </em>It is ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>nifest that the testator\u2019s intent cannot be made effectual by a literal interpretation of the will, whether the construction be in favour of the appellant, or in favour of the appellee; and that we must, in either case, depart from the literal import of the words employed, by understanding them in a different sense, or by supplying words omitted. Either is admissible, or both, to effectuate the testator\u2019s intent; and neither to defeat it. We think that the intention of the testator requires the clause in question (omitting, for perspicuity, the parenthesis in reference to his grandson) to be read thus: \u201c But it is my express intention, and I do hereby devise and direct, that if any, or either of my four [five] children should die without issue living at the time of his or her death, that all the estate real and personal of every such child, shall be equally divided between the <em>then </em>survivors (or <em>my children then surviving) and the </em>representatives <em>of those not then survivors, </em>(or <em>the </em>representatives <em>of those then dead) </em>according to the principles of the law of descents.\u201d And then, understanding, as we do, \u201c representatives\u201d to mean here descendants, and <em>\u201c </em>according to the principles of the law of descents\u201d to import here that they are to take <em>per stirpes </em>and not <em>per capita; </em>the effect of our construction is to give to the appellees, who are the children of the testator\u2019s son <em>Richard, </em>one undivided fourth of the property devised to the testator\u2019s son <em>John, </em>who survived the said <em>Richard, </em>but died without having had issue; being the same interest which their father <em>Richard </em>would have taken had he survived the said <em>John, </em>but to which the appellees succeed, not by descent from their father, but by purchase from their grandfather. As to the construction and effect of the covenant of warranty in the deed of conveyance, embracing the land in question, executed by the said <em>Richard </em>and others, if coupled with the descent of assets from him to the appellees; the court deems it irrelevant to go into the consideration thereof, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>inasmuch as no such defence was made either in the action of ejectment or the suit in equity; nor can any cause of action founded upon said warranty be prejudiced by said judgment and decree. The court is, therefore, of opinion that there is no error in the said decree of the said circuit superior court. Wherefore it is decreed and ordered that the same be affirmed with costs to the appellees. And the court is further of opinion that the said judgment in the action of ejectment, ought, upon the case agreed, to have been for one undivided fourth part of the lands in said judgment and decree mentioned, whereas the same is for two undivided fourth parts thereof: Wherefore it is considered by the court that the said judgment be reversed and annulled with costs to the appellant: and this court proceeding to render such judgment as the said circuit court ought to have rendered, it is considered that the plaintiff in said ejectment recover against the defendant therein his term yet to come of and in one undivided fourth part of, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
