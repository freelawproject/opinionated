After that time the husband states that his wife has declined joining him in the deed, and has forbidden him to convey his estate, and he refuses to make any conveyance. Thereupon a bill is filed by the purchaser against the husband, stating that there are children of the marriage, claiming that the husband is therefore entitled to a life estate, and praying that he may be decreed to convey to the complainant all his interest in the land, reserving to the complainant his right of action at law upon the bond against the husband for failing to procure his wife to unite with him in the conveyance. The bill being demurred to, the circuit court sustains the demurrer and dismisses the <em>bill; and </em>this decree is <em>affirmed.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-G\"><em>John Ross </em>having an estate of inheritance in a tract of land in the county of <em>Harrison, </em>and dying intestate, the same descended to his children, ten in number, of whom one was <em>Patsy. </em>She, after the death of her father, married <em>Joseph Janes, </em>and there were children of the marriage. <em>James M\u2019Cann </em>purchased, for the sum of 110 dollars, so much of the land and the rents thereof as <em>Janes </em>and wife were entitled to; and <em>Janes </em>executed a bond to him in the penal sum of 200 dollars, with condition that <em>Janes </em>and his wife should make him a good deed for the same within two years from the date thereof. After the two years had expired, <em>M'Cann </em>exhibited a bill in the circuit court of <em>Harrison, </em>setting forth, that since the expiration of the two years, he had frequently applied to <em>Janes </em>to have a deed made by himself and his wife according to the bond, and <em>Janes </em>had promised him it should be done; but after those pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>mises, <em>Janes </em>stated that his wife would not join him in a deed: that by the marriage and the birth of children, <em>Janes </em>was at all events entitled to a life estate; but he said that his wife had forbidden him to convey that, and he refused to convey it. The bill prayed, that <em>Janes </em>might be decreed to convey to the complainant all his interest in the land, reserving to the complainant his right of action at law upon the bond against <em>Janes, </em>for failing to procure his wife to unite with him in the conveyance ; and that the court should grant such other, further and general relief in the premises, as to equity appertains.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-5\">The cause coming on to be heard upon the bill and a demurrer thereto, <em>Duncan, </em>J. delivered the following opinion :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b285-6\">\u201cIf this were a bill for a specific execution of the entire contract, that is, to obtain a decree for conveyance of the wife\u2019s estate, then my judgment would incline to the opinion expressed by judge <em>Story </em>in his excellent commentaries on equity, vol. 2. p. 38-40. See also Sugden on Vendors, p. 152. (9th London edi. p. 198, 9.) To grant such a prayer would, to my mind, be undertaking to enforce a contract against the policy of the law, as it would tend to a violation of conjugal duties, and it would be \u2018offering a premium to the husband to be ungenerous as well as unjust to his wife.\u2019 Weighty authorities exist, however, shewing that the courts have thought otherwise, and that upon a contract of this kind, the husband might be thrown into jail until the affections of the wife could be so worked upon as to induce her to surrender perhaps the only means that remained to her to save herself and children from penury. I confess, that unless borne down by the weight of authorities,! should decide differently.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>plaintiff has relieved the court from a more full examination of the question, by shaping his cause differently. He seeks for a partial execution of the contract, and a right to resort to law to recover compensation for the residue. Can this be done ? There are indeed many cases decided in <em>Virginia, </em>where a vendee has obtained a decree for a part of the land he purchased ; for example, where there was a small deficiency in the quantity, but yet the vendor was capable of giving a title to what was the substantial inducement to the contract, the deficiency lying in compensation. There are cases also in which a vendee has obtained a decree for a conveyance from a husband who had bound himself to obtain a relinquishment of his wife\u2019s dower. But in such cases the vendor has gotten substantially what he purchased, to wit, the fee simple title of the husband. This, it is true, the ven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>dee has taken subject to a contingent right of dower ; but he has gotten also the husband\u2019s covenant of warranty for his protection against the claim of dower, and as he purchased with a knowledge of the contingent right of the wife, it is no great hardship that he should be compelled to take the husband\u2019s deed alone, with a risk of the possibility of his wife\u2019s having an estate in dower, and be made to rely for compensation in that event, upon his covenant of title. The question may be asked, whether, if the vendee be willing to take the title of the husband such as it is, the court ought not to decree it to him ? As a general rule, I suppose that equity will decree specific performance so far as the vendor is capable of performing bis contract, if the vendee be willing to receive the same. See Sugden on Vendors, p. 159. (9th London edi. p. 209.) But I apprehend that the vendee must take the decree of equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ty as full satisfaction, or not at all. He cannot be permitted to come into equity for part satisfaction, and resort to a court of law for further satisfaction. But even in a case in which the vendee is willing to take from the vendor a less estate than he bargained for, it must appear that the vendor has a lawful right to convey such less estate. Thus the question arises, whether the vendee can have a decree for a conveyance by the busband of his life estate in the lands of the wife, during her life ? A tenancy by the curtesy is only consummated by the death of the wife; and I apprehend that the husband has only a limited usufructuary right during the life of his wife, a right to receive the rents and issues. His right to lease his wife\u2019s lands, without her joining in the lease, is doubted : See Lomax\u2019s Digest vol. <em>2. </em>p. 90. T am therefore of opinion that the demurrer to the bill must be sustained, on two grounds ; to wit, 1. That any decree which equity can render must be in full satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s claim ; it cannot sustain a bill fora specific performance in part, with a right to resort to a court of law for the recovery of damages for the residue: and 2dly, That a husband cannot be decreed to convey a life estate in his wife\u2019s lands, during her life. The plaintiff suggested, that although the court might refuse to give a decree for a specific performance of the contract, it might rescind the contract, under the prayer for general <em>relief. I </em>think otherwise. The prayer for general relief in addition to a prayer for specific relief, will only authorize such a decree as is consistent with the specific relief sought.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-3\">In conformity with this opinion, the circuit court, sustaining the demurrer, decreed that the bill of the plaintiff be dismissed, and that the defendant pay to the plaintiff his costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\">On the petition of the plaintiff, an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Note by the </em>reporter.\u2014In <em>Mortlock </em>v. <em>Buller, </em>10 Ves. 316. lord <em>Eldon </em>says : \u201c I agree, if a man having partial interests in an estate, chooses to enter into a contract, representing it, and agreeing to sell it as his own, it is not competent to him afterwards to say, though he has valuable interests, he has not the entirety, and therefore the purchaser shall not have the benefit of his contract. For the purpose of this jurisdiction, the person contracting under those circumstances is bound by the assertion in his contract; and <em>if the vendee chooses to take as much as he can </em>have, he has a right to that, and to an abatement; and the court will not hear the objection by the vendor, that the purchaser cannot have the whole.\u201d Lord <em>Eldon </em>repeats the same doctrine in. <em>Mestaer </em>v. <em>Gillespie, </em>11 Ves. 640. \u201cIt is familiar,\u201d he says, \u201cto come to this court for a specific performance of an agreement, the whole benefit of which the party cannot have; and <em>if he waives that part, </em>it is not competent to the other party to refuse to perform the rest.\u201d\u2014\u201cNo one,\u201d he observes in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>1 Swanst. 54. \u201cwill dispute this proposition, that if a man offers to sell an estate in fee simple, and it appears that he is unable to make a title to the fee simple, ho cannot refuse to make a title to all that he has. The purchaser may insist on having his estate, such as it is. The vendor cannot say that he will give nothing, because he is unable to give all that he has contracted to give. If a person possessed of a term for 100 years contracts to sell the fee, he cannot compel the purchaser to take, hut the purchaser can compel him to convey, the term, and this court will arrange the equities between the parties.\u201d Other authorities sustain the same view. See <em>Milligan </em>v. <em>Cooke, </em>16 Ves. 1. <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Gee, </em>17 Ves. 274. <em>Western </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>3 Ves. &amp; Beam. 192. <em>Waters </em>v. <em>Travis, </em>9 Johns. 450. <em>Morgan's heirs </em>v. <em>Morgan, 2 </em>Wheat. 303. note <em>d. </em>Sugden on Vendors 198, 9.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-12\">The plaintiff in a bill for specific performance must not, however, call upon the other party to do an act which he is not lawfully competent to do. \u201cIf,\u201d says lord <em>Redesdale, </em>\u201ca party is compelled to do an act which he is not lawfully authorized to do, he is exposed to a new action for damages at the suit of the person injured by such act: and therefore, if a bill is filed for a specific performance of an agreement made by a man who appears to have had a had title, he is not compellable to execute it, unless the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>seeking performance is willing to accept such a title as he can give; an(j oniy cases where an injury would be sustained by the party plaintiff, in case he were not to get such an execution of the agreement as the defendant can give. I take the reason to be this, amongst others; not only that it is laying the foundation of an action at law, in which damages may be recovered against the party, but also that it is, by possibility, injuring a third person by creating a title with which he may have to contend.\u201d <em>Harnett </em>v. <em>Yielding, </em>2 Sch. &amp; Lef. 554.

Lee </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-8\"> <em>Note by the </em>reporter.\u2014In <em>Howel </em>v. <em>George, </em>1 Madd. Ch. Rep. 1. the defendant, when he entered into the agreement, thought he had an absolute power over the estate, but afterwards found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>he was only tenant for life: and his wife and son, who had interests in the estate, refused to join with him in suffering a recovery. The vicechancellor (sir <em>Thomas Plumer) </em>said: \u201cIt was not much pressed in argument, that the defendant ought to be decreed to procure his wife and son to join in a recovery. It could not be argued that a man should be compelled to use his marital and parental authority to compel his wife and son to do acts which ought only to be spontaneously done. In <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>3 P. Wms. 189. the master of the rolls says, there have been a hundred precedents where, if the husband, for a valuable consideration, covenants that his wife shall join with him in a fine, the court has decreed the husband to perform his covenant; and in <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Stephenson, </em>7 Ves. 474. a husband was, under the circumstances, decreed to procure his wife to join in a surrender of a copyhold estate; but in <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Wase, </em>8 Ves. 505. lord <em>Eldon </em>reviews the cases, and expresses great doubt whether, under a contract by a husband to sell the estate of his wife, the court will decree him to procure her to join. In <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>1 New Rep. (4 Bos. &amp; Pul.) 267. the chief justice of the common pleas (sir <em>James Mansfield) </em>who was very conversant in the doctrines of a court of equity, thought nothing could be more absurd than to allow a married woman to be compelled to levy a fine through the fear of her husband being sued and thrown into jail, when the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>prineiple of the law was that a married woman shall not be compelled to <em>levy </em>a fine. Those cases on which a husband was compelled to make his wife concur have been where he has agreed she should convey, and her consent might be supposed to have been previously obtained; hut in this case there is no pretence that the defendant agreed that his wife and son should join in a recovery. None of the cases have gone so far as to say that a father can be compelled to procure his son to join in a recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Afterwards, in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Mitchell, 2 </em>Jac. &amp; Walk. 425. the same judge (being then master of the rolls) expressed himself in these terms: \u201c If it was only the agreement of the husband, what becomes of the plaintiff\u2019s case ? The point, that the court should compel the husband to coerce the wife to join with him in the conveyance, was abandoned. The counsel did not urge that that is the law now, and that the husband was to go to prison if she refuses to concur. It is not necessary, therefore, to go into the class of cases upon that subject, the authority of which has been very much weakened. They were much shaken by the remark of the lord chancellor, upon the difficulty of a court of equity compelling her to consent to a fine, while the court of common pleas always examines her to ascertain whether she acts freely, and if they find her tobe under constraint, still her consent must be taken, or the husband will be punished. That point, however, is not pressed here.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b289-6\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Akp\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b290-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>Neither (it seems) must the plaintiff by his bill seek that which was prayed by the bill here, <em>viz. </em>a decree giving the plaintiff a conveyance of that which the defendant can convey, and allowing the plaintiff to proceed at law to recover damages against the defendant for that which he cannot convey. The first ground taken in the opinion of the judge of the circuit court, to wit, that a court of equity ought not to sustain the bill for a specific performance as to part, and allow the plaintiff to proceed at law for the recovery of damages as to the residue, is that on which the court of appeals affirmed the decree, as the reporter has been informed by one of the judges.
