The bill states that on the 3d of April, 1810, the plaintiff recovered, in Spottsylvariia county court, a judgment against the defendant Alexander for g 800, with interest from the 25th of April, 1802: that an execution was taken out, but not put into the hands of any sheriff, because the said Alexander had, before that time, taken the oath of an insolvent <em>debtor; </em>and the said judgment still remains unsatisfied, except g 63 <em>75 </em>cents, which had been paid : that Alexander took the oath of insolvency, before the judgment was rendered, but long after the money had become due: that the insolvency of the said Alexander %vas pretended and fraudulent; he having, before that time, <em>voluntarily </em>and <em>fraudulently </em>conveyed a considerable portion of his property: that the deed (hereafter mentioned,) to John Taliaferro, is <em>voluntary </em>and <em>fraudulent </em>as to creditors, so far as it conveys the reversion of the property to John S. Taliaferro, the son of the said John Taliaferro: that the deed from the said Alexander to John Taliaferro, in trust for ills wife Lucy Alexander, is also voluntary, fraudulent, and void as to the creditors of the said Alexander: that the deed from the said Alexander, and Lucy his wife, to James G. Taliaferro, being made without consideration, after the said Alexander had taken the oath of insolvency, with full notice to the said James G. Taliaferro, is also fraudulent and void: that if the deeds are not voluntary and fraudulent as to creditors, yet, the deed from Alexander to Taliaferro, in trust for his wife Lucy, is void as to the creditors of the said Alexander, as the same has not been recorded in the manner prescribed by law, and the plaintiff had no notice of the existence of the said deed : The complainant therefore prays, that the said deeds, or bne or more of them, may be set aside, and the property therein conveyed, be. subjected to pay the claim of the complainant, with interest and concludes with a prayer for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Lucy Alexander answered, that at the time of her inter marriage with the defendant Alexander, she was entitied, in her own right, to a very valuable tract of land in the county of Essex, containing about 950 acres, and to another in the county of Westmoreland, containing 600 acres ; that she was also entitled to sixty or eighty slaves, and to a valuable stock of all descriptions, &amp;c.; that some time after her marriage with the said Alexander, he proposed to sell, and did sell the lands aforesaid ; that before the respondent would consent to join in the conveyance of her said lands, the said Alexander engaged to settle on her, lands of equal value, and to place them in the same situation as to title; that to carry this engagement, in part, into elfect, the said Alexander did, on the 10th day of October, 1802, execute the deed mentioned in the bill of that date; that by this deed, the property therein specified, was conveyed to the respondent, and at her request and desire, the reversion, after the death of the said Alexander, of the tract of land called <em>Hayes, </em>was conveyed by the said deed to John S. Taliaferro, the nephew of the respondent, and son of the defendant, John Taliaferro | who, thereupon, as an additional consideration to the said Alexander for the conveyance made to J ohn S. Taliaferro, did execute a deed to tiie said Alexander, for the tract of land called <em>Oakland, </em>and paid other considerations to the said Alexander ; that the deed hearing date the 16th day of December, 1804, was executed upon the following considerations: 1. To satisfy a considerable excess in the value of the lands and other property belonging to the respondent in her own right, beyond the lands, &amp;c. conveyed to her by the deed of the 10th of October, 1802. 2. An agreement, on the part of the respondent, to relinquish her right of dower in a very valuable real estate held by the said Alexander, in the town of Alexandria. 3. A release, on the part of the respondent, of all her claim on the said Alexander, for her future support and maintenance <em>\u2022, </em>that these various considerations, independently of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>^ie considei\u2019ation paid by the said John Taliaferro, on account of the reversion of the Hayes land, were more than an equivalent to the said Alexander, for all the property conveyed by him to the respondent and the said John S. Taliaferro, by the two deeds mentioned in the <em>bill; </em>that, as it was notorious that the said Alexander was wealthy, independently of the property conveyed by the said two deeds, nothing can be more erroneous than the suggestion, that the said two deeds were executed <em>voluntarily </em>and <em>fraudulently </em>by the said <em>Alexander; </em>that the respondent has regularly received, up to the present day, from the said John Taliaferro, the annuity conveyed to her by the deed of the 16th of December, 1804: that she sold and conveyed to James G. Taliaferro 3001. of the said annuity and the other property conveyed to her by the two deeds aforesaid, and delivered the same into his possession, long before the institution of this suit: that Alexander and John Taliaferro joined the respondent in the conveyance of her right to the said property ; and accordingly a deed was executed by them to the said James G. Taliaferro: that as to the suggestion that the deed of December, 1804, has not been recorded according to law, the respondent has been informed that the said deed was duly recorded within eight months from the <em>execution </em>and <em>delivery </em>thereof: that she has also been informed, that the said deed has, in a second instance, been recorded in a manner to render it valid : that even if the said deed has not been recorded <em>precisely </em>at the period required by law, such <em>omission cannot destroy her </em>claim to <em>the property </em>thereby conveyed to her, as she is a creditor entitled to the highest consideration of a court of equity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-4\">The answer of John Taliaferro, confirms all the material statements in the answer of Lucy <em>Alexander; </em>particularly as to the value of her separate estafe, which she had consented to sell, in consequence of an agreement with the said Alexander, that he would, when thereto required, settle other lands on her, of at least equal value to those which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>she had parted with: that at the date of the deed of 1802, the said Alexander was wealthy, and not indebted beyond the current accounts usual to men of his large income : that the said Alexander, wishing to free himself from the perplexing attentions incident to the management of his estate, to which he found himself unequal, proposed to the respondent that he should take a lease of all the lands in the county of King George, together with a portion of the slaves, stocks, &amp;c., at the price of 500/. <em>per annum, </em>for the life of the said Alexander: that Lucy Alexander, seeing that she had no reasonable prospect of children, determined to convey to her nephew, John S. Taliaferro, the son of the respondent, all the interest intended for her, in the tract of land called <em>Hayes: </em>that in consideration of this provision for the respondent\u2019s son, he determined to accept the lease of all the said Alexander\u2019s lands in King George, including the <em>Hayes </em>land, and to give 600/. instead of 500/. <em>per </em>annum; which latter sum the said Alexander had at first proposed to lease the said lands for: that in addition to this, the respondent conveyed his mansion tract containing at least 300 acres with a comfortable dwelling house Ac. to the said Alexander for his own life and the life of the said Lucy, and in remainder to such issue as the said Lucy might by possibility <em>leave; </em>which conveyance is dated the 10th day of October, 1802; that the respondent also paid g 5000 to the said Alexander, fay granting to him an acquittance in writing of a debt due from the said Alexander to the respondent: that since the 1st day of January, 1803, he has paid the said 600/. <em>per annum </em>with punctuality: that the said <em>Spring Hill </em>tract of land, leased by the said Alexander to this respondent, never did vest in the said Alexander in fee simple, but was, in pursuance of the bond of the 14th day of August, 1800, conveyed by James G. Taliaferro and wife <em>to </em>this respondent, in trust for the said Lucy ; as will appear, by their deed of the 9th of April, 1803.

In point of law, and 2dly. Because they are proved, in point of fact, to have been entirely <em>voluntary.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACx\">1. The deeds are void against creditors, on legal principles, because the consideration expressed in both of them, is nothing more than the \u201c love and affection which \u00abthe said Alexander bears to his wife Lucya consideration, which cannot be sustained against a <em>bona fide </em>creditor. This objection can only be evaded, by proving some <em>valuable </em>consideration, not expressed on the face of the deeds. But such proof cannot <em>legally </em>be admitted. It may be laid down as a correct rule, that a deed purporting on its face, to be made for natural <em>love and </em>affection, cannot be averred and proved to be for a <em>valuable consideration. </em>In <em>Clarkson </em>vs. <em>Hanway,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in <em>Peacock </em>vs. <em>Monk,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is expressly decided that a different consideration from that expressed in the deed, cannot be averred. The same principle was decided in <em>Maigley </em>vs. <em>Haner.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The only cases in which a consideration can be averred, that is not expressed on the face of the deed, are those in which cither <em>no </em>consideration is expressed; or general words are used, such as \u201c <em>and for other </em>considerations;\u201d or where the new consideration is congruous with the consideration expressed by the deed. The cases already cited, support the two first exceptions; and the last is exemplified in the case of <em>Eppes </em>vs. <em>Randolph </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>where <em>parol </em>evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>received under the terms <em>\u201cfor the better advancement in life of D. R.\u201d </em>This consideration was deemed <em>congruous </em>with the evidence, that the deed was made in consideration of marriage, and therefore such evidence was admitted. But no such general terms are contained in the present deeds, and therefore no new consideration can be averred.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-9\">The next objection is, that the deed of 1804 was not recorded according to law, as more than eight months had elapsed between the day of its delivery, and its being admitted to record. The only mode in which this conclusion can be evaded, is to contend that the deed was <em>in fact delivered </em>on a <em>subsequent </em>day, to that which it bears on its face; and for this purpose, <em>parol </em>evidence must be resorted to. It cannot be denied that a deed may be <em>dated </em>on one day, and <em>delivered </em>on another. But, this fact can only be made to appear by the <em>record </em>itself. When no particular day of <em>delivery </em>is mentioned in the deed, or in the entry of its being admitted to record, the <em>date </em>of the deed must be taken to be that of its <em>delivery ; </em>and no averment can be admitted, that it was delivered on a <em>different </em>day. Otherwise, the date of the deed, would be entirely nugatory, or calculated to mislead. To admit parol evidence to prove a <em>different </em>day of delivery, would be to contradict a record. The policy of the law, was. to give notice on <em>record, </em>to the whole world of the <em>existence </em>of a conveyance, and of its <em>due execution, </em>in respect to all the steps necessary to be taken, to render it valid against creditors and subsequent purchasers. But, if a purchaser or creditor should be driven to make inquiries in <em>pays, </em>as to the validity of a deed, the main object of the law would be defeated. The evidence so adduced, must necessarily be weaker, than that afforded by the record. But, if such evidence can be received, it can only proceed from the <em>attesting witnesses. </em>All other evidence must necessarily be inferior in force and effect, to that of the subscribing witnesses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>^Par\u00b0l </em>evidence may be admitted, still the evidence adduced in this case is both <em>incompetent </em>and <em>unworthy of credit. </em>The only witness who proves that the deed was delivered on a different day from that on which it is dated, is John Taliaferro. But he is clearly interested. He was bound to pay a rent of <em>6001. per annum </em>to Alexander and his wife. As soon as he had notice that the deed was charged with fraud (and he had notice from the filing of the bill,) all payments made by him were made in his own wrong, and he would <em>be liable to a </em>decree to that amount, in this suit. He is therefore deeply interest\u00bb cd in sustaining the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-5\">[The remarks of the counsel to prove that the evidence is unworthy of credit, being a mere comment upon testimony, involving no question of law, are omitted as not coming within the scope of this report.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-6\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-7\">1. As to the question whether <em>parol </em>evidence can be admitted, to prove a consideration not expressed on the face of the deed ? Whatever may be the rule in a court of law, a court of chancery will inquire into the <em>real </em>consideration. This is proved by the case of <em>Quarles </em>and <em>Lacy</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> ; </em>and <em>Sugden</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>supports the position. The cases cited by Mr. Stanard do not sustain his doctrine. <em>Eppes </em>vs. <em>Randolph</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is in my favor, because the terms <em>\u201c advancement in life\u201d </em>apply only to a <em>gift </em>to a child and not to a <em>marriage portion. The </em>proof, therefore, of a marriage portion was not comprehended in the consideration expressed ; and yet the court admitted such evidence. Moreover, the court lay no stress upon that circumstance, but say in general terms, as to David Randolph, that \u00ab being at liberty to <em>aver and prove the real consideration, t( </em>he has satisfactorily proved the deeds to have been in consequence of a marriage between, &amp;c He is to be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>sidered as a <em>purchaser for a valuable </em>Stronger words could not be used to shew that, in equity, a party may aver and prove the <em>real </em>consideration. The case in <em>7 </em>Johnson <footnotemark>(h)</footnotemark><em> </em>was a case at law ; but even there the court intimate an opinion, that a court of equity would afford redress. The bill in this case charges a gross <em>actual </em>fraud. This puts the <em>real </em>consideration directly in issue. The bill does not charge a fraud upon Lucy Alexander and John Taliaferro. While this precludes the appellant from proving fraud as to them, it opens the question of consideration as to the remaining parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-4\">2. The deed of 1804 is not void, because it was not recorded within eight months from its <em>date; </em>but <em>parol </em>evidence may be admitted to prove its <em>execution </em>on a different day. The difference between our act of assembly and the statute of Henry 8th, on the subject of recording deeds, is remarkable. The latter speaks of enrolment from the <em>date; </em>the former speaks of recording within eight months from the time of \u201c <em>sealing and delivering.\u201d </em>This difference in the two statutes, plainly indicates the will of the legislature, that the <em>date </em>of a deed should not be regarded as conclusive evidence of the time of its <em>execution. </em>Even in England, Lord <em>Coke</em><footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>tells us, that where there is no date, the deed shall have effect from its execution. The act does not require that, for the <em>purpose of recording, </em>the time of delivery should <em>appeur upon record, </em>but only says that the deed must be admitted to record, within eight months from the time of its <em>execution ; </em>leaving the parties at liberty to prove a delivery by <em>parol evidence. </em>Some of the objects of this deed do not require recording at all. So far as it releases the rent to John Taliaferro, it does not come within the provisions of the act. A <em>debt in money </em>tnay be released without the solemnity of recording. If, for example, a deed contains among other things, the release of a bond, the release will be effectual, although the deed should never be recorded. If the release had been on a separate piece of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>PaPer&gt; ^ would have discharged the <em>release. </em>The statute relates only to legal rights which subsist after the deed <em>; </em>not to debts which are <em>extinguished </em>by the release.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADp\">Taliaferro is not an incompetent witness. He could never be rendered liable to the appellants for the rents which accrued after the filing of the bill, and which he had duly paid under his contract. A bill merely <em>suggesting fraud </em>could not be a sufficient notice to him, to justify his withholding the rents from the person entitled to them, by a solemn deed. It was not his duty to decide on the conflicting evidence and to weigh the points of law, on which the question of fraud depended. If the appellant had wished to prevent John Taliaferro from paying over the rents, he might have applied to the chancellor for an injunction to restrain him. In that case there would at least be a judicial decision, that the allegation of fraud was supported <em>by prima facie </em>evidence \u00bf and he would be saved from the embarrassing necessity of deciding for himself, on a complicated question of law and fact. The charge of fraud might be unfounded and frivolous. Would it be said that, in such a case, Taliaferro could justly keep back the rents from those who were entitled to them by deed ? And, if his duty in this respect is to depend upon the <em>strength </em>or <em>weakness </em>of the evidence, is it just to make him the judge, at his own risque, of questions only suited to a judicial tribunal? On the other hand, how easy would it have been for the plaintiif to have added to his bill, a prayer for an injunction ? As he has not done this, he has no <em>right to </em>claim a benefit from his omission.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b244-4\"><em>Stanard, </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AxW\"> 2 P.

Alexander, for a debt contracted in April, 1802, prefer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>j'ed his bill, seeking to set aside, as <em>voluntary </em>and <em>frandn</em>lent, two deeds executed by the said William T. Alexandec; one of them bearing date the 10th day of 1802, <em>the </em>other bearing date the 16th of December, 1804. He farther contends that if the deeds be not <em>fraudulent, </em>the last of them is <em>void </em>as to creditors, not having been recorded within the time required by Jaw. The appellees deny the fraud, and aver that both deeds were executed for valuable and meritorious consideration : And as to the deed of 1804, they aver that although it was not recorded within eight months from its date, it was recorded within eight months from the sealing and delivery thereof. The chancellor dismissed the bill of the appellant, who appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The deeds will be separately examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">First. As to the deed of 10th October, 1802. The considerations expressed in the deed are \u201c natural love and affection,\u201d and <em>\u201c </em>one dollar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">The counsel for the appellant, considering this deed as voluntary on the face of it, contended that proof of valuable consideration was inadmissible, as being inconsistent with the deed. But the court is of opinion, that the question whether evidence inconsistent with the deed can bo admitted, does not arise in this cause. This is not the case of a deed purporting to be for good consideration only. It is, in express terms, for valuable as well as for good consideration. It is true that the valuable consideration expressed, is only one dollar: But, one dollar, viewed as a consideration, is as much a <em>valuable </em>consideration, as a million of dollars. The real question is, whether a deed, purporting <em>to </em>be for <em>\u201c </em>love and affection,\u201d and for \u201c one dollar,\u201d and assailed as being fraudulent as to creditors, can be supported by evidence shewing that in addition to the one dollar expressed, full value was received by the grantor. This question may be simplified by supposing the deed to have been between the same parties, and for the same purposes$ and that the only consi=</p>\n<p id=\"ARR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>deration expressed in the deed was the sum of one dollar paid by the grantee. It could hardly be doubted, that the evidence would be admissible in that case. Indeed, the principle of the objection made by the counsel for the appellant, that the evidence would be inconsistent with the deed, does not apply to such a case. It is believed to have been the practice, at an early period, both in England and in this country, for deeds not to express the actual sum, but a nominal one only : and yet the court has not seen a single case in which it has been held incompetent to the party claiming under the deed, to aver and prove the sum really given. <em>The King </em>vs. <em>The Inhabitants of Scammonden,</em><footnotemark><em>(j)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is an authority in point, shewing that such evidence is admissible. In that case, the consideration expressed was <em>28l.; </em>whereas the sum really given was 30?., which it became necessary to prove. Lord Kenyon said it was clear that the party might prove other considerations than those expressed in the deed. The case of <em>Eppes </em>vs. <em>Randolph,</em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Quarles </em>vs. <em>Lacy,</em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>have a strong bearing on this point. In the latter case, there was no consideration expressed as moving from the wife, and only the .consideration of one dollar from the trustee. (See the original record.) There can be no reason for not extending the same rule to a deed which, in addition to a valuable, states also a good, consideration. On a view of the authorities, this court is clearly of opinion that such evidence is admissible ; and more especially where, as in the present case, the persons beneficially interested in the conveyance, are a <em>feme covert, </em>and an infant, to whom, in consequence of the incapacities under which they labour, greater indulgence is extended for any defects in points of form. And, in estimating the amount of the consideration, we are to take into the estimate every valuable consideration received by the grantor. It is not necessary that they should move from the person claiming under the deed. From whatevei source proceeding, they operate as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>legal considerations for the conveyance, and enure to his benefit. On this principle we are to estimate the considerations moving from John Taliaferro, jun. the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"APq\">But it is objected, that the said John Taliaferro, a witness relied on by the appellees, for the purpose of estabfishing the consideration, is incompetent on the score of interest. If this objection be intended to apply to him as a necessary party to the cause, in his character of trustee, it is clearly unsustainable. There can be no question that a naked trustee is a competent witness. It may also be remarked, as a general principle, that courts, at present, receive objections to witnesses with great caution as they relate to their competency 3 and that they incline to refer them to their credibility. It is alledged, however, that the objections in this case are too strong to be overcome <em>; </em>for, that he has a direct interest in the cause, because of the rent of 600k per annum, which, by the deed aforesaid, he became bound to pay $ that the bill gave him notice that the deed was charged with fraud ; that all payments made by him, since the bill, were made in his own wrong, and that he is liable to a decree therefor in this suit: That the rent, in case the deed shall be set aside, ought to be subjected to the claims of creditors, the court does not deem necessary to affirm or deny. But, if Taliaferro shall have actually paid the rents, either to Alexander or to his assignees, the court is of opinion, that the \u25a0said Taliaferro ought not, under the circumstances of this case, to be made liable therefor. The institution of the suit, or the fifing the bill impeaching the deed of fraud, but containing no prayer that he should not pay the rent over, was not of itself sufficient to justify him in withholding the rent from those to whom he had contracted to pay it. All the parties interested in the rent were before the <em>court; </em>and if the appellant wished to injoin the rent in the hands of Taliaferro, the court of chancery was always open to him to apply for an order to that effect. For aught that appears to this court, the appellant might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>preferred that the rent should be in other hands than those * \u00b0f John Taliaferro. His failure to obtain from the chancellor, such an order as has been mentioned, especially when his bill was silent on the subject, left John Taliaferro at liberty to pay the rent to those who, under the deed, were entitled to receive it. And this remark applies with equal force to that portion of the rent to which James G. Taliaferro became entitled, and which he released in consequence of a surrender to him of a portion of the property on which the rent was reserved. It is not charged in this bill, nor established hy proof, that there was any fraud practised by Taliaferro in obtaining the lease, nor that the rent was inadequate. The reverse, as to the rent,, is positively proved. In fine, the court does not perceive the weight of any of the objections to the competency of this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">John Taliaferro, being thus decided to be a competent witness, is he credible ? This is a question which the court is not disposed to argue. We doubt not that the counsel for the appellant, in the freedom and severity of his remarks on this topic, was urged by a sense of duty to his client, and actuated by a strong conviction that he was supported by the record. The view, however, which we have taken of the circumstances touching this point, is very different from that which presented itself to the appellant\u2019s counsel. We have examined the record patiently and minutely, and we have not seen that John Taliaferro has done any thing that considering the relation in which he stood to the parties, he ought not to have done. We perceive nothing that is calculated to cast a shade on his character j nothing to impeach his conduct as a man, or his credit as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">- The court is of opinion, that the testimony in the cause shows that Alexander received valuable consideration, full and adequate, for all the property conveyed by the deed of the 10th of October, 1802 ; and that that deed, therefore, stands discharged from every imputation of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Secondly. As to the deed bearing date the 16th December, 1804. The considerations expressed are \u201c natural love and affection,\u201d and \u201c live pounds.\u201d What has been said, therefore, with respect to the deed of 1802, as to the propriety of admitting proof of farther consideration than that expressed, applies with equal force to the deed of 1804. The considerations proved, are the release of Mrs. Alexander\u2019s right to all future support from her <em>husband; </em>the relinquishment of her right of dower in all her husband\u2019s real <em>estate; </em>and the excess of the value of the property, which Mrs. Alexander once held, but which was sold by Alexander, over the value of the property previously settled on <em>her; </em>a portion of this property, however, being personal, had, by the marriage become Alexander\u2019s, subject to his disposal and liable to his debts; it ought, therefore, to be excluded in estimating the amount of the valuable consideration of the deed of 1804. And even when excluded, the court is by no means certain that the valuable consideration was not full and adequate. Admit, however, that they were not full and adequate, it will not necessarily follow that the deed was <em>mala fde, </em>and fraudulent as to creditors: although the personal property brought by Mrs. Alexander to her husband and sold by him, can form no part of the valuable consideration of a deed settling other property on her, yet it may and ought to be taken into view as a meritorious consideration of such <em>deed; </em>and the deed will be supported or set aside according <em>to </em>circumstances. What are the circumstances of this case ? It appears that Alexander at the time of bis marriage, was possessed of a magnificent estate. His wife brought him another, not much inferior. It appears that he was extravagant and prodigal in the extreme. To supply the demands of this prodigality, a sale of property became necessary. The personal property acquired by his marriage, he had a right to sell; and he did sell much of it. He prevailed on her, moreover, to consent to his selling the whole of her real estate, and she con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>veyed it accordingly : stipulating, however, that he should , , 1 \u201e \u201e , settle other lands upon her or equal value. lie promised moreover to make a similar settlement of other property, equal in value to the personal property which ho had got by her and which he had sold. These promises were partly performed by the deed of 1802, heretofore examined. In the latter part of the year 1804, he had become so intemperate in his habits, thatjhis wife could no longer live with <em>him; </em>and she resolved on a final separation from him. This resolution received the concurrence of Alexander himself. In contemplation of this event, Mrs. Alexander agreed, as before stated, to relinquish all claim on him for future support, and to relinquish her claim of dower in his real estate <em>$ </em>in consideration whereof, and of former promises made by him in relation to her personal property sold by him as aforesaid, Alexander agreed to convey, and did convey for her benefit, the property embraced by the deed of 1804 which property in addition to that conveyed by the deed of 1802, is proved to be of less value than the property, real and personal, which had been held by Mrs. Alexander in her own right, and which had been sold by her husband. There is no proof in the cause that at that time, or even as late as the last of April, or first of May, 1805, Alexander was much involved in debt. It is not pretended that at that time, he was otherwise than solvent. There is on the contrary positive proof that at that time, viz : in April or May, 1805, he was not materially indebted <em>; </em>and that exclusive of the property conveyed by the said <em>deed, </em>and <em>exclusive </em>of as much more as would he sufficient to pay all his debts, he was worth a large estate. It is also proved by John S. Wei ford, that after the first of May, 1805, ho made a deed of gift to McFarlane and wife of ground rent in the town of Alexandria, amounting to about 1501. for ever. The said John S, Welford, who had long acted as the general agent of Alexander, and who declares himself well acquainted, in consequence of that agency, with his situation, express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Sy proves liim to have been solvent as late as the month * *\u25a0 of February, 1806, when his agency <em>terminated; </em>and moreover declares his belief, that if the claim of the appellant had been presented to him at any time during his agency, (which agency was general and notorious in Fredericksburg and in Alexandria and their vicinities,) satisfactory arrangements would have been made for its discharge. It is proved also, that Mrs. Alexander did not permit Alexander to incur any farther expense for her support, and that she relinquished, whenever required, her claim of dower to his real estate. Under all these circumstances, this court is not satisfied, as at present advised, that the said deed ought to be set aside as fraudulent, even as to a prior creditor of the said <em>Alexander; </em>and even, although a part of the considera\u00fcon of that deed may not have been valuable, but meritorious only. But on this point <em>the </em>court gives no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">But it is alledged, that the said deed has not been recorded within the time required by law, and that therefore, although not fraudulent, it is <em>void </em>as to creditors. The deed is an exhibit in the cause. It bears date the 16th December, 1804, and it appears by the certificate of the clerk that it was not proved till the 5th day of September, 1805. It does not appear, that the witnesses proved this deed otherwise than in the usual form $ it does not appear, that they proved it otherwise, than as a deed sealed and delivered on the day on which it bears date. Looking no farther than to the certificate of the clerk, we should be bound to say that it was not proved and recorded within the time required by law. But it is averred by the appellees, that the deed, although dated on the 16th day of December, 1804, was not, in fact, sealed and delivered till April or May, 1805; and they have taken depositions to prove the fact. It is contended, however, for the appellant, that whatever may have been the time of the sealing and delivery, yet if the deed bears date more than eight months before the time of proving it, and flic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>record does Hot shew that the witnesses proving the deed, 1 proved that it was sealed and delivered within eight months before the time when it is fully proved and lodged to be recorded, it has no validity as a <em>recorded deed, </em>against a creditor. This is a question of great importance, and the court has found it one of some difficulty. Its solution depends on the sound construction of an act of Assembly prescribing a general regulation, <em>juris positivi, </em>merely. In such cases, the court has nothing to do with the hardship of the case, nor even with the principles of abstract justice. It is a great hardship, to the individual, that a fair purchaser of lands, for valuable consideration, shall lose the benefit of his purchase, because of unavoidable accidents preventing the attendance of his witnesses to prove his deed within the required time. Yet the case has frequently <em>happened; </em>and should the party complain of hardship, he would receive for answer, <em>it a lex scripta est. </em>The object of the legislature was to prescribe a general regulation, and to establish a criterion by which we may know, with greater certainty, who are the real owners of lands and tenements. For that purpose, the act of Assembly under which this deed was recorded, directs, that all conveyances of such property shall be by writing, sealed and <em>delivered; </em>and declares, that such conveyance shall not be good against a subsequent purchaser without notice, nor against any creditor, unless acknowledged or proved according to law, and recorded within eight months from the sealing and delivery thereof. And as to all deeds of trust and mortgages whatsoever, they are declared to be void as to all creditors, and subsequent purchasers, unless they shall be acknowledged or proved, and recorded as aforesaid. A deed, it is admitted, takes effect from its delivery, and not from its date. The policy of the law, therefore, (the giving information as to the situation of the title to lands,) would seem to require, that the time of de\u00ab livery shall appear on the record. For, how, otherwise, can creditors, or others, know who are the real owners of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>land. If a deed has a date, the law intends it to have * t been delivered <em>at the date.</em><footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>When, therefore, a deed Laving a date, is proved by witnesses who say nothing as to the time of delivery, and is thereupon recorded, it stands recorded as a deed proved to have been delivered at its <em>date; </em>and if that date bo more than eight months before if is lodged to be recorded, the deed, although spread upon the record, is shewn by the record itself not to have been recorded according to law; and is, therefore, not good as a recorded deed. It has been held in England, that although a stranger is not concluded by an enrolment, but may aver that the deed was delivered at a day different from that which the enrolment purports, yet that the <em>parties </em>are concluded, and shall not be permitted to aver that a deed was delivered at a day since the <em>date; </em>for, by the same reason it might be averred that it was never delivered, <footnotemark><em>(n)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is not necessary to decide that principle in this cause, and the court accordingly does not decide it. We moan to go no farther than to decide, that a deed not lodged to berccorded until eight months after its date, and not proved by the witnesses, on whose testimony it was recorded, to have been sealed and delivered within eight months before it was recorded, <em>is not good as a recorded deed. </em>On this ground vve are of opinion, that the deed in the record mentioned, bearing date the 16th Dec. 1804, is void as to the appellant. The decree of the chancellor, is therefore reversed so far as it dismissed the bill as to that deed, and is affirmed as to the <em>residue; </em>and the cause is remanded, <em>See.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The court is of opinion, that the deed of the 10th Oct. 1803, was executed, bona fide, for full, adequate and valuable consideration, and stands discharged from every imputation of fraud. The court is farther of opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>that the deed of the 16th Dec. 1804, was executed bona fide,' for considerations valuable and meritorious, without any intention to defraud creditors ; but the court is of opinion, that the said deed, not having been recorded within the time required by law, is <em>void </em>as to the appellant, a creditor of the grantor Win, T. Alexander. So much of the decree, therefore, as is in conflict with this opinion, is reversed with costs, and the residue thereof is affirmed; and the cause is remanded for farther proceedings to be had therein, according to the principles now declared.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(j)\">\n<p id=\"AOX\"><em> </em>3 Term Reports, 474.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(k)\">\n<p id=\"AqRj\"> 2 Call, 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(l)\">\n<p id=\"Anj\"> 4 Mun. 251.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(m)\">\n<p id=\"b253-10\"><em> </em>2 Inst. 674.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(n)\">\n<p id=\"b253-11\"><em> </em>Comyn's Dig. 2 vol. p. 66, 67, referring to Savel\u2019s Re. 91 ; <em>1 </em>Leo. 183, 2 Leo. 122, and Ow. 138.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
