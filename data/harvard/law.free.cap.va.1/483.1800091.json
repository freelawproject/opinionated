Philips </em>pleaded that the bond was not the deed of Ills testator. At the trial, the counsel for <em>Raines proved, \u201c </em>that the subscribing witness to the bond was dead, and then <em>stated to the court </em>that every inquixy had been made in the neighbourhood where he resided, to ascertain whether any person was acquainted with his hand writing, but after the most diligent search, no person who knew it could be found: and then he offered testimony to prove the hand writing of the obligor: but the court decided, that <em>under this statement, Raines </em>could not be allowed to go into evidence of the hand writing of the supposed obligor.\u201d To this opinion <em>Raines </em>excepted.

It is now the settled rule, where' the witness to an instrument is dead, and it is impracticable, after all possible diligence has been used, to prove his hand writing, to admit proof of the hand writing of the party himself. (See <em>Gilliam\u2019s adm\u2019r. </em>v. <em>Perkinson\u2019s adm\u2019r. </em>and the cases there cited). But upon this bill of exceptions, it is difficult to say on what ground the evidence was rejected by the court. There is a great want of precision in its language. The judge said, that <em>under the statement made hy the counsel for Raines </em>(who, it seems, had <em>proved, </em>that the witness was dead) he could not be allowed to go into evidence to prove the hand writing of the supposed obligor. If we are to understand, that he admitted the truth of the statement, if it is to be inferred, from the circumstance that the counsel had <em>proved </em>the death of the witness (it is to be presumed on oath), that he made the statement in question, in like manner (that is, on oath); then the judge might be understood as denying the rule before stated. On the contrary, if the fact was, that it was a mere statement not on oath, his objection was, that the facts necessary to entitle the plaintiff to go into evidence of the hand writing of the obligor, were not proved. But, whether he considered the statement as proved, and denied the rule, or admitted the rule, and objected to the statement because it was not proved, is so doubtful, that we think the safest course will be to reverse the judgment, as the court has often done for uncertainty in a' bill of exceptions, and send the cause back for a new trial, in which, if the question again occurs, the objection to the admission of proof of the hand writing of the obligor, may be more precisely stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
