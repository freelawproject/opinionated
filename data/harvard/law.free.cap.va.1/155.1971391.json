Plea, that J 8. was jointly bound with the testator in the bond, and survived him. Replication, <em>\u201c </em>that <em>it is not expressed in the bond </em>that the said J. S. was <em>jointly </em>bound with the testator, and, if it were, by the Act of 1\"86, entitled an Act, &amp;c. it is declared, that the representatives of one jointly bound with another, may be sued as well as the surviving obligor, and insists, therefore, that the action does not survive, &amp;c., and this the defendant is ready\" to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>verify,53 &amp;c. The record states, \u201c and thereupon issue was joined by the parties.\u201d The plea is good, and the replication faulty, and a repleader from the plea awarded.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b215-2\">The judgment upon the verdict rendered in this case for the plaintiff, is also erroneous, there being no Issue joined.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-3\">This was an appeal from a judgment of the District Court of Fredericksburg, reversing a judgment of an inferior Court, and awarding a repleader from the plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-4\">It was an action of debt brought by the appellant against the appellee, upon a bond given by the testator and a certain <em>John Pattie. </em>The defendant, without taking oyer, pleaded in bar, \u201c that the said <em>John Thornton </em>was jointly bound with a certain <em>John Pat-tie </em>in the said identical writing obligatory in the declaration mentioned, and that the said <em>John Pattie </em>survived the said <em>John </em>Thornton, and this he is ready to verify wherefore, &amp;c.\u201d To this plea the plaintiff replied, et that he ought not to be precluded, &amp;c., because he says, in the said writing obligatory, it is not expressed that the said <em>John Thornton </em>was jointly bound with the said <em>John </em>Pattie, as is alleged in the plea, and if they were jointly bound, that, by an Act of Assembly passed in the year 1786, <em>i </em>intituled an Act concerning partitions and joint rights and obligations/ it is therein declared, that the representative of one, jointly bound with another, may be sued as vvel! as the surviving obligor himself; and he insists, therefore, that the said action does not survive against the said Pattie, but is maintainable against the said Johns &amp;c., and this he is ready to verify-'\u2014wherefore, gee.\u201d The record then proceeds thus, \u201c and thereupon an issue was joined by the parties/\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-5\">Verdict and judgment was rendered for the plaintiffin the County Court, and an appeal prayed to the District Court, where that judgment was reversed as above stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-6\">Marshall, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-7\">The plea in this case is faulty in two respects, and, therefore, could oppose no legal bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. 1st, It does not state that the obligors <em>were </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>not severally bound, </em>which they might have been, al - though they were <em>also jointly </em>hound. 2d. It does not set forth at what time <em>John Thornton </em>died; for if that event happened after the law mentioned in the replication took effect, which was in 1787; then this case would come within the operation of that law, although the bond was executed long before. The same inconvenience which is generally and properly chargeable upon retrospective constructions of laws, would not exist in this case; for the two obligors, if they were both alive when that law took effect, stood upon equal ground as to the chance of survivorship. If there had been a demurrer in this case, (let it have come from which ever side it might,) there could have been little doubt but that judgment must have been given for the plaintiff, because the first fault in pleading being committed by the defendant, the demurrer tvould have reached it, however defective the replication might be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-8\">Though there may be an objection to the informality in joining the issue, yet it is cured by the Statute of <em>Jeofails, </em>and the verdict will not, on that account, be set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-9\">The Court informed <em>Washington, </em>who was about to argue the cause for the appellee, that there was no necessity to say any thing, as there was no difficulty in the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-10\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"AjL\">The plea is certainly sufficient, and if the Act of 1786 were material in the case, the plaintiff' might have set forth the time of Thorn<em>ton's </em>death in his replication, by way of avoiding the bar relied upon by the defendant. What would have been the opinion of the Court upon the operation of that Act, if the time of the death had been stated in the replication, need not be mentioned. The replication is certainly faulty, and containing the first slip, the District Court did right in reversing the judgment, and in setting aside the pleadings subsequent to thepiea.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">We are also of opinion, that' the judgment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>County Court is erroneous, there being no issue joined in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Judgment of the District Court affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> <em>Taylors </em>v.
