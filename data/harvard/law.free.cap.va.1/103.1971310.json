Street.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b115-11\">Some of the jury being persuaded by the others, that a majority agreeing to the verdict, it must prevail, do not object, This being proved by many of the jurors, a new trial ought to be granted 5 and a Court of Equity may set the verdict aside, and award a new trial, where the objection to the verdict comes to the knowledge of the party too late to enable him to move for a new tr\u00edalo</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-12\">This was an action of slander, brought by <em>Street </em>against Cochran, in the County Court; wherein a verdict was given in favor of the plaintiff for 150/= <em>Cochran </em>having failed in a motion in arrest of judgment obtained an injunction on the Chancery side of the same Court, suggesting that the trial was unfair, and brought on by surprise, and also charging misbehaviour in the jury-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b115-13\">The cause coming on for a hearing, the Court without setting aside the former verdict, directed a new trial, and the verdict thereon to be reported, in order to a final decree\u00bb The material facts, proved by the depositions taken in the suit in Chancery, are, that this cause, and another of <em>Cochran v. </em>Street, were. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>taken by consent, out of course, to be tried at <em>November </em>Court; but that the latter coming on first, employed the whole of the Term ; so that this was necessarily continued over until the succeeding Term, when it was tried, though much objected to by Cochran\u201e Four of the jurymen declared on oath, that they were of opinion upon the evidence that no damages ought to have been given against <em>Cochran ; </em>but that being unacquainted with the duties of jurymen, and the nature of their office, and being told by others who were more experienced, that they must agree in any verdict which the majority should approve, they did not object to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-9\">From the decree of the County Court, <em>Street </em>appealed to the High Court of Chancery, where it was reversed; and from that decree of reversal, an appeal was prayed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-10\"><em>Marshall, for the </em>appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AX1\">The verdict in this case is the finding of only eight jurymen, and is in truth no verdict at all. If the circumstances which attended it had been known, it could not have been received by the County Court. Being afterwards discovered there was no remedy but by the equitable interference of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-11\">There are no better reasons for setting aside a verdict, than its having been unfairly procured, whether by surprise on the parties, or mistake in the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-12\">I would also observe that the appeal in this case from the decree of the County Court was premature ; for the Court not having set aside the first verdict, but merely directed a new trial, the decree was interlocutory only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-13\"><em>Duval, for the </em>appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP7\">If the Court should affirm the decree of the County Court, much injustice may flow from it, as after so long a time since the former trial, witnesses may have died, or removed, by which the parties may not have so fair a trial as the former was. Besides, a new trial cannot be obtained at Law after a motion in arrest of judgment; and therefore it ought not to be directed by a Court of Equity 5 <em>Bac. 239. </em>242, 243.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Nothing can be productive of so much mischief, as a practice, once introduced, of permitting jurymen, by their after affidavits, to set aside their own verdicts. They are liable to be tampered with out of Court, to defeat the fairest verdicts p and thus to produce endless vexation, and real injustice to the parties; particularly, where one of the parties may in the mean time have lost his witnesses. The proof of misbehaviour should not come from the juryman, but from some other person.\u20141 <em>Term </em>Rep. IL</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-3\">This decree is as final as one for negroes, where <em>m </em>account of the hires is directed t and yet there Is no doubt but that an appeal may be taken from stick a decree.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-4\">Marshall, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvJ\">I grantfthat In the case stated by Mr, <em>Duvall </em>it is the practice to appeal from such a decree^ but the reason of It is? that as to the negroes, It Is final, and execution for them may issue immediately.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-5\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AAC\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">We do not take into consideration the depositions, touching the merits of the cause? before the jury. They were the proper judges upon that subject. As to the unfairness of the trial on the score of surprise, there is no doubt tat, that if it were proved, it would afford good ground for granting a new trial, as if the cause were tried out of Its turn? without the previous consent of the party. But the Court think the proof too slender to establish the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">To meddle with the verdict of a jury, upon the evidence of some of the jurors, Is a delicate business, and should be proceeded In with caution, to prevent the mischief of the jurymen being tampered with. Lord <em>Mansfield </em>very properly, In the case cited from <em>Term-Reports, </em>refused a new trial upon the affidavit of two of the jurors, that the cause was decided by cross and pile, because it went, not only to prove <em>themselves </em>guiliy of misbehaviour, but also ten others of the jury. But here, ten of the jerofs are examined3 and eight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>them agree in the fact, that part of their body were , opposed to giving any damages at all, and that the verdict was found on the opinion of a majority. Four of them swear that they did not incline to give any damages <em>; </em>that they did not differ from the verdict, in consequence of a misapprehension of the law, and a belief that the opinion of the majority was to prevail ; that they did not previously agree to be bound by the determination of a majority; and that, if they had known that they could have prevented a verdict till their consciences were satisfied, they would not have agreed to the verdict. There does not appear to have been any tampering with the jurors by any person, in order to obtain this information. It comes out upon examination as other testimony does a great majority of the jury confirm the fact to which these four have sworn; and none of them contradict it. It is clear therefore that the verdict was found under a mistake, and that a new trial should be awarded.\u2014The inconvenience which may happen from another trial, if real, is to be attributed to the party who complains of it.\u2014It might, but for him, have been had at a much earlier day.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The decree of the Chancellor must be reversed, and that of the County Court afiirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b118-11\"> <em>Prices Ex. </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. 385. <em>Armstrong </em>et. ux. v. <em>Hickman, </em>6 Munf. 291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
