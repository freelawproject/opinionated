The cause coming on, upon bill and answer, the latter must be considered as being true in every part of it$ arid therefore, the payments alleged by the defendant to have been made, ought to have been allowed by the commissioners, two of which were not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-15\">2d. The Commissioners do not state when, or where, the}'\u2019 met to settle the accounts, or whether the defendant had notice of their meeting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-16\">3d. The decree is for more than the commissioners report to be due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b226-17\">4th, and principally.\u2014The rents of the land, and the <em>injury it sustained </em>during the plaintiff\u2019s possession, were referred to <em>Commissioners, </em>instead of a <em>jury </em>to ascertain.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b226-18\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"AVC\">As to the first objection, there is no doubt, but that the answer in this case must be considered as being perfectly true. But the counsel mistakes, uhen he supposes that the payments insisted upon in the answer have not been allowed. All of them are, except a credit of wheat, the price of W'hich the defendant could not ascertain, and perhaps did not, for that, or for some other reason, bring before the Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-19\">The third objection is, that the decree is for more than the balance stated to be due by the report, and that too, with accumulated interest. But it does not appear, that the interest upon interest amounts to a great\u00e9r sum, than that, for which a deduction is made by consent of parties, on account of <em>miscalculation of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>interest. </em>As to the principal sum, it does hy'fio means appear, that the decree is for more than tie report makes it 1</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The decree therefore must be affirmsd.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> The Court took no notice of the other objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> <em>Roberts\u2019s Widow et. al. </em>v.
