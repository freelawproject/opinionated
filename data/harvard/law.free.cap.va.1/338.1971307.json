When he speaks of <em>all his slaves, </em>it is impropable that he meant to include the <em>dower slaves, </em>because he directs that <em>all his slaves </em>be worked on his lands by his executors. Now it would be improper to extend the generality of this clause to the dower \u25a0 slaves, which the testator knew he had no power over, during the life- of the widow. And if he could not mean to include those slaves in this part of the clause, it is not probable that he had them in view in the proceeding part of the clause which respects the disposition of them.\u2014The clause, is an entire one, connected together by an evident continuation of the same idea, without any interruption, and must be supposed to embrace the <em>same </em>subject, throughout.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-13\">It would therefore seem to be a very strained and unnatural construction to break the clause, and make the testator mean, only a part of his negroes, when he speaks of the whole of them in one instant, and the whole of them, when he mentions them in another place, but in the very same sentence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b360-14\"><em>Duval, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b360-15\">The devise of the residue of the negroes, though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>coupled in the same clause with the direction to the executors concerning the temporary employment of ihemj is nevertheless a distinct part of the sentence from that, and may with propriety receive a di\u00edferent exposition. It is not unusual, in the construction of wills, and even of deeds,\" to enlarge, or limit the meaning of particular words, so as to fit them to the subject on which they are meant to operate, and to avoid contradiction -or absurdity. Thus, though the word <em>all </em>would, if unrestrained, comprehend the dower slaves, yet, as the testator could exercise no dominion over them during the life of the widow, it is not probable that he meant to include them in that part of the sentence, which directs his negroes to be employed on the plantation. Bui if he did intend it, he mistook the extent of his power ; but that he meant to pass all his slaves in the former part of the sentence is evident: 1st Because the plain and natural import of the words include them j and secondly, because it is a residuary devise, which from the very nature of it is intended to leave nothing undisposed of. The Court always inclines against such a construction,'as tends to produce a partial intestacy. But what strengthens this exposition in the present case, is, that the heir at law is provided for by an estate entailed upon him, which is noticed by the testator, and operates strongly to repel a presumption that the testator intended to leave any part of his estate to descend upon the heir.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b361-6\">As to the possession, it is found to have been in <em>Leigh </em>from the year 1752 till 1769, before any suit was brought.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b361-7\">Lyons, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARq\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">There is no difficulty in this case. A testator may carve out as many particular estates from the fee simple interest in the property disposed of, as he pleases; and, whatever part is*not specially given away, remains with him. If he disposes of the rest and residue of his estate, such remnant will pass, unless restrained by other parts of the will. There are no words in this will which limit the general operation of the sweeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>clause. <em>All the rest of his estate, </em>means every thing over which he had a power ; and his intention, so far from appearing to control these general expressions, seems to favour the operation of them in their greatest latitude. The testator had no doubt an equal affection for all his children. They are all equally provided for by the will, and it can hardly be presumed that he would leave a part undisposed of, in order that it might descend to the heir at law, who was otherwise provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">This case is not like that of <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>M'Roberts, </em>in this Court, <em>[ante, </em>p. 96.) In that, the intention was very clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b362-10\"> <em>Read </em>v. <em>Payne, 3 </em>Call. 225.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
