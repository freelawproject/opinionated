She took a fee simple in the moiety, which descended, after her death, to ' her heir at law.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ao0\">This was an appeal from a decree of the High Court of Chancery. The case was this ; <em>John Sher mer, </em>by his will, devised to his wife the use and profits of his whole estate, both real and personal, during her natural life, and after that whs ended, then the whole of his estate, exclusive of that already given to his wife, to be equally divided between whoever his wife should think proper to make her heir or heirs, and his brother, <em>Richard Shermer. </em>He further di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>rected, that his executors, as soon as the crops were after his wife\u2019s death, should sell and dispose of his whole estate, real and personal, as they might think most conducive to the receivers benefit,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-2\">The wife died in 1775, a few days after the testator, without making any disposition or appointment of her part of the estate. The executors sold the estate, agreeably to the will, and distributed one moiety thereof amongst the relations of Mrs. Shermer; for the recovery of which this suit was brought against the executors and distributees, by the present appellant, the son, heir, and executor of <em>Richard Shermer, </em>the brother named in the will. It was proved that the testator frequently said, he would leave his wife one half of his estate, to dispose of as she should please, and that most of his estate was acquired by his intermarriage with her. Upon a hearing of the cause, the bill was dismissed, from which this appeal was prayed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-5\">Ronold, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIS\">The principle upon which the appellant\u2019s claim is founded, is so fully explained, and so conclusively settled in the case of <em>Tomlinson </em>v. Dighton, 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>149, that it is unnecessary to add any thing to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b364-7\">\u2018 <em>Marshall', </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOH\">The devise to Mrs. Shermer, was intended to pass to her; the whole interest and absolute ownership in the moiety, given <em>to </em>her appointed heir. In last wills, it is not necessary that the testator should use technical words, in order to pass a fee ; for however inartificially he may express himself, yet if his intention can be discovered to mean a disposition of his whole interest in the thing devised, the Court will supply such words as may be necessary to effectuate that intention. Thus, if the devise had been to the wife, to dispose of <em>as she pleased, </em>she would most unquestionably have been entitled to the fee simple, because such a power is the eminent quality of such an estate. But the case <em>. </em>of <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Dighton </em>is relied upon to establish this principle, <em>viz. </em>that where an <em>express </em>estate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>iiife Is given, It cannot be enlarged by words of implication, though if the estate had been given generally, it might be otherwise. I shall contend, 1st, that die principle is not true, and 2diy, if it were, still die Itself is not like the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-3\">1st, The principle is fully contradicted by the case of <em>King </em>v. Melling, 1 <em>Ventr. </em>214, and the great variety of cases there cited. <em>Langly </em>v. Baldwin, 1 <em>Eq. </em>Ca. <em>Ab. 185.\u2014Blackbourn </em>v. <em>Edgley, </em>1 <em>P. Wms. </em>605.\u2014 <em>The Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>1 <em>P. Wms. </em>754. These cases clearly prove, that an express estate for life, may be enlarged by words of implication, if the testator\u2019s intention require it. The case of <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Dighton </em>is consequently founded upon a mistaken principle, and ought not to be regarded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-7\">But 2dly, If that case be law, it is unlike the present In that, the power of disposing is limited to particular children <em>% </em>in this, it is to the heirs general. The distinguishing feature of afee simple estate is consequently discernible in this case, and not in that. Again \u2014in that case, as well as in that cited from 3 <em>Leon. </em>71, the wife having made an appointment, the intention of the testator could not be frustrated, and consequently the question, turning merely upon the validity of the appointment, the nature, or extent of the wife\u2019s estate, was a point only incidentally decided, and therefore the opinion, as to that point, ought not to be considered as a binding authority. Again, it will not be denied but that, if an express estate for life had not been given to the wife, the latter words would have enlarged the estate into a fee simple. In this case, the Court, to effectuate the intention of the testator, will consider the life estate given to the wife, as applying, not to her moiety, but to the moiety which, after her death, is devised to the brother, and this will materially distinguish the present case, from that of <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Dighton, </em>and will bring it precisely within that part of the rule laid down by the Court, which makes the estate to the wife a fee simple.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-10\"><em>Washington, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV6p\">The case of <em>Tomlinson v. Dighton, </em>and the cases there cited, from 3 Leon. 71, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>and 1 <em>Mod. </em>189, are so conclusive upon the point now under consideration, that it can only be necessary for me to shew, that the objections made to them are not well founded. Those cases are built upon this well principle of the Common Law, <em>viz. </em>that an heir shall never be disinherited by implication, nor by words of uncertain and doubtful meaning. In last wills an estate of inheritance is permitted to pass by other words than those artificially appropriated to that purpose; but it is intention only, u hich governs in such a case; and where that intention can be clearly discovered, the Court will give such a construction to the words, hou ever inapt they may be,, as will fulfil that intention. Thus in the case of <em>Langly </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>the testator declared an intention, in one part of his will, to give an estate for life only; but it was equally clear, that he meant all the sons of the tenant .for life to take estates tail in succession, before the limitations over were to take effect. But the seventh and other sons, would not, by the rules of law, come into the succession, if the ancestor took only an estate for life; because, where the ancestor takes an estate for life, the heirs, or issue, by such names, cannot take as purchasers. So in <em>Shelley\u2019s </em>Case\u2014here then, are two contending intentions, both of them equally clear, though depending upon different claims for fulfilment. A provision for ail the children, was more likely to be the favourite intention of the testator, than the .nature, or quantity of the estate to be enjoyed by the ancestor. How then, ask the Court, is this prevailing intention to be effectuated? The answer is, by uniting the estate for life with that arising by implication, and thus enlarging that estate into an inheritance; by which means only, the whole issue could be provided. For. By such refinements do the Judges govern themselves in cases of that sort, and thus ingenious are they in inventing some subtle mode or other for carrying into effect the <em>will </em>of dead men, They metamorphose an estate for life, into an estate of inheritance, to promote this primary object, but, not otherwise. It is necessity only which could justify it, since, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>if this necessity did not require it, such refinements would amount to the <em>making, </em>not to the <em>construing </em>of wills. So too, the case of <em>The Attorney General </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>is founded upon the same principle with that just spoken of 5 except that in this, if all the issue had been provided for, yet the Court must have decided as they did; because, from two clauses in the will, (mentioned in a note in the Iasi edition of <em>P. Wms.) </em>the testator expresses his intention to give an estate tail, in words too plain to be misunderstood. But the Court never will convert an <em>express </em>estate for life into an estate of inheritance, by words of <em>implication, </em>unless compelled to do so by absolute necessity ; that is, where the intention is in the first place clear, and not merely a doubtful, or possible intention; and secondly, where that intention <em>cannot otherwise be effectuated. </em>This is the principle upon which I rely 5 it is laid down in all the cases, and is controverted in none. Those cited upon the other side prove it, and it is the very principle upon which they are decided. <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Dighton </em>does not oppose, but on the contrary, supports it, and yet it seems to have been supposed by Mr. <em>Marshall-</em>that the Judge declared, \u201c that an express estate for life could not be enlarged by implication.\u201d Taking it as a thing granted, that this position was there asserted, he proceeds to prove its fallacy, by citing <em>Langly v. </em>Baldwin, and the other cases relied upon for this purpose. But these cases, though they contradict the <em>supposed case </em>of <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Dighton, </em>are entirely consistent with that case, as it <em>really </em>is. The <em>Chancellor </em>there says, \u201c that where an express estate for life is given, with a <em>power to dispose, </em>the latter words shall not by implication enlarge the former into an estate of inheritance, but they shall be considered as a distinct gift, and as corning in by way of -addition.\u201d Now the difference between that, which the Judge is <em>supposed </em>to say, and that which he actually says is obvious. An express estate for life may be enlarged by words of implication, <em>if by no other means </em>the testator\u2019s intention can be complied v ith\u201e and therefore, in <em>Langly </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>it was done be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>cause there was no other way to effectuate the intention ; because, if the seventh and other sons could not take by descent, it was supposed they could not take at all : but they were clearly <em>intended to take ; </em>therefore <em>from </em>necessity, the ancestor took an estate of inheritance. But in the case of <em>Tomlinson </em>v. Dighton, the children of the testator might take by purchase, without doing this violence to the plain words of the will. Therefore no necessity existed for enlarging the estate for life, by words of implication,, for in that case the wife might, by exercising the power of appointment given to her, make the children take as purchasers. So upon this principle, the case before the Court, and all others, where a power of appointment is annexed to the express estate for life, will be found to differ from cases <em>\\\\ </em>here the issue are let in under words of implication, enlarging the estate for life into an estate of inheritance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-10\">The next question is, does the case of <em>Tomlinson </em>v. <em>Dighton </em>differ from the present ? The restriction of the power to dispose in that case, is noticed in the argument, and differs from this, thus far only, that if that passed a greater estate than for life, it was a conditionalfee, this an <em>absolute </em>one: if that only gave a power to dispose, it was'a limited one, this is unlimited. But as to intention, there is no difference. The testator might as well intend the one, as the other, and both are equally distinguished by the marks of ownership, if there exist any in either. But it is contended, that in that case, the wife had made an appointment, and therefore, as to the other point, it was merely an <em>obiter dictum. </em>But it is evident, that this was a material point in the cause, for if the wife took an estate in fee, it was unnecessary to decide the validity of the appointment, and therefore, this was a previous and important subject of consideration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b368-11\">The last argument relied upon, is, that the Court, to effectuate the testator\u2019s intention, will construe the express estate for life in this case, as applying only to the moiety, which after the wife\u2019s death, is given to the brother, and not to the other moiety devised to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>appointed heir; and upon this difference, it is supposed that the case of <em>Tomlinson </em>v. Dighton, does not apply. This argument, though specious, has no solidity when examined; for, I ask, where is that intention, which, without resorting to the construction contended for, will be defeated ? What is the intention ? To give an estate <em>for </em>life, for so are the express words of the will; in the next place, to limit the inheritance to the person, whom the wife should appoint. No person can doubt, but that this was the intention, because the words are too plain to be misunderstood. There is no room left for construction,- where there is no ambiguity in the expression. But can this intention, so expressed, be no otherwise effectuated, than by converting the life estate into a fee ? If it cannot, then I admit it must be done, and greater concessions ought not to be required, since all the cases cited against us, shew, that this bold attack upon the plain words of the testator, can only be warranted, where otherwise, the intention would be entirely defeated. To the question I answer, let the wife take an estate for life; let her exercise the power of appointing her heir or heirs 5 let such heir or heirs take the inheritance, and then the testator\u2019s intention is fulfilled. Is not this what we contend for ? and cannot all this be done, consistently with the rules of law ? where then, is the <em>necessity </em>of giving the wife a fee ? The heirs could have taken if she had <em>chosen </em>to name them, and if she did not choose to do so, but preferred leaving the estate to descend where the law would cast it; it cannot alter the case, or make the intention of the testator mean what was not meant, when that intention was expressed. That intention was either to give a <em>power, </em>or a <em>beneficial </em>interestf to the wife, in the inheritance, and this Court will decide at this day, as they would have done, had the question come on the moment after the testator\u2019s death. One would suppose from the argument on the other side, that the heirs of the wife could not possibly take, unless the wife Mas construed to take a fee, and that the Court were struggling to invent some mode, or other, to prevent this violence from being done to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>testator\u2019s intention. Whereas, there is nothing moro in the case, than that the wife has either neglected, or noi chosen to exercise the power she had, and there *'ors&gt; attempt is made, in order to repair the consequences of this omission, by sacrificing to that end, the established principles of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An0\">are some unworthy of notice, as tending to furnish additional proof of the intention. He gives to the wife, the <em>use </em>and <em>profits </em>of his estate for life, and says, \u201c <em>and after this is ended,\u201d </em>&amp;c. Now these words strike me to be as strong as the words, <em>and no longer, </em>in <em>Target </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>10 <em>Mod. </em>402. Again, the devise is not of the <em>estate Itself </em>but of the <em>use </em>and <em>profits </em>for life, which is another strong evidence of intention.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-6\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A-_\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">It is contended by the appellant\u2019s counsel, that Mrs. <em>Shermer </em>was, by the will, only tenant for life of a moiety, with a power to dispose of the fee ; and that not having executed that power, the estate descends to the heir of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"AaS\">In support of this position, several cases have been cited; but they seem to verify the saying of a Judge, &lt;\u00a3 that, in disputes upon wills, cases seldom elucidate the subject, which, depending on the intention of the testator, to be collected from th\u00e9 will, and from the relative situation of the parties, ought to be decided upon the state and circumstances of each case.\u201d To which I will add, that l have generally observed that adjudged cases have more frequently been produced to disappoint, than to illustrate the intention ; and T am free to own, that where a testator\u2019s intention is apparent to me, cases must be strong, uniform, and apply pointedly, before they will prevail to frustrate that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The cases produced, tend to prove that an express estate for life to the wife, with a power to dispose of the fee, shall not turn her estate for life into a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">In the case of <em>Target </em>v. <em>Gant, </em>the subject in dis-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>pule was a chattel, and the objection to the remainder was, that it was void, being limited on too remote contingency, being after an estate tail, which, it was said, the wife took, though dei'ised to her for life, being limited over on her dying w ithout issue. The Lord <em>Chancellor </em>said, that the estate tail in such a case, as to lands, was raised by implication, to favour the testator\u2019s intention, and he <em>w </em>ould not make the implication, in the case of chattels, destroy that intention. So that^ if this case apply at all, it proves that the testator\u2019s intention shall make such words either an estate for life, or an inheritance, as shall best promote that intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">In both the cases from 1 P. <em>Wms. </em>and 3 <em>Leon </em>where it was adjudged the wife took an estate for life, with power to dispose of the fee, the decision of the point was unimportant, since in both, the wife had <em>ex</em>ecuted her power properly and effectually.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In those, and all the cases, the question turns tipos a fee estate in lands ; here there is no doubt about the fee. It is in the purchaser from the executor, and the only question is, how the money shall go according to the will ? Whether this will make a difference, need not be decided, since, upon a view of the will, the intention is apparent that the wife should have the whole estate for life, and that, at her death, one half (except his specific bounty to her) should go to <em>her </em>family, and the other to <em>his ovrn. </em>Their relative situation, and his prior declarations, only shew such intention to be liberal and just.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">His words have been critically scanned 5 be does not give her a power to <em>dispose, </em>but to name the <em>person </em>or <em>persons </em>she might choose to succeed to her part, to whom the testator gives the money ; and it is doing-small violence to the words, even in their critica! meaning, to say, that by <em>suffering </em>her legal representatives to succeed her, she has <em>actually made them her heir or heirs, </em>as much so, as if she had pointed them out by an express devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">The decree affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> <em>Robinson's adm. </em>v. <em>Brock, </em>1 Hen. &amp; Munf. <em>233.
