November.</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b467-5\">In. <em>assumpsit </em>against an administrator issues are joined upon pleas of <em>non assumpsit </em>and <em>fully administered; </em>the jury, after retiring from the bar, without leave of court or consent of parties, separated and dispersed, and afterwards rendered verdict for defendant: Held, verdict ought for that cause to be set aside.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-6\">In an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>in the county court of <em>Hanover, </em>brought by <em>Hunn Co. </em>against <em>Anderson </em>administrator of <em>Howie, </em>upon the <em>assumpsit </em>of the intestate, wherein issues were made up upon the pleas of <em>non assumpsit </em>and <em>fully administered, </em>the jury found a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiffs moved the court to set the verdict aside, and direct a new trial, upon the ground, \u201c that, after the jury had retired from the bar, and before they rendered their verdict, they had left the jury room and dispersed over the courtyard, during a temporary recess of the court: but the court overruled the motion, and gave judgment for the defendant. The plaintiffs took exceptions; and prayed and obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>from the circuit court of the county; which reversed the judgment, set aside the verdict, and remanded the cause to the county court, for a new trial to be had therein. And then <em>Anderson </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b467-9\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUyf\">remarked that the bill of excoptions did not state, whether the jury had separated <em>before </em>or <em>after </em>they had agreed on a verdict: for aught that appeared, they might not have separated till after the verdict was agreed on. The court ought to take the case most strongly against the party who took the exception. The rules touching the conduct of juries, were formerly very strict; but they are now so modified, that the ease and comfort of the jury may be favoured, so far as indulgence is not dangerous to the fair administration of justice; and there are cases of acknowledged misbehaviour in the jury, for which they are liable to be fined, that will not vitiate their verdict, the party for whom it is given not being guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>any misbehaviour himself. The mere separation of the jury, in a civil case like this, ought not to affect the verdict, especially as it does not appear, that the separation took place before the verdict was agreed on. He cited Co. Litt. 227. b. 3 Com. Dig. Enquest. <em>F. </em>pp. 563, 4. 6 Id. Pleader. Verdict. S. 45. 46. pp. 259. 261. <em>Lester </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>3 Day 287. and <em>Howard, </em>v. <em>Cobb, Id. 310. </em>cases in which the verdict was set aside because of the separation of the jury, but it was separation before the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>1 Conn. Rep. 401. <em>Branden </em>v. <em>Grannis, </em>Id. 402. in note. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>M\u2019Connel, </em>1 Bibb 265. 7 Bac. Abr. Verdict. H. pp. 10. 12. and the case there cited of Ld. <em>St. John </em>v. <em>Abbot, </em>Barnes 441.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b468-5\"><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APh\">said it was misbehaviour in the jury to separate without leave of the court or consent of the parties, before verdict rendered; and, obviously, misbehaviour of a kind to expose a jury to improper influence. The only way to correct the evil of such misbehaviour, and to preserve the purity of jury trial, was to set aside the verdict. He cited <em>Pleasants </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>1 Wash. 156. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Cove, </em>1 Stra. 642. <em>Metcalfe </em>v. <em>Deane, </em>Cro. Eliz. 189. Id. 411. <em>Blaine </em>v. <em>Chambers, 1 </em>Serg. &amp; Rawle 169. He observed, that the law of <em>Virginia </em>was so jealous of <em>the </em>undue influence of conversations between the jury and others, that it expressly prohibited the sheriff from conversing with any juror, but by order of the court, after the jury have retired from the bar; 1 Rev. Code, ch. 75. \u00a7 16. p. 267.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b468-6\">\n<em>Per curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AqhE\">The judgment of the circuit court is affirm\u00e9d.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
