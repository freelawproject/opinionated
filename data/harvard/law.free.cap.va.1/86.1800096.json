The defendant filed a bill of exceptions to opinions of the circuit court given at the trial; which stated,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b98-11\">1. That the plaintiff, having first proved that the slave in question was, on the-day of March 1808, the property of <em>R. R. Keeling, </em>gave in evidence a deed of that date, executed by <em>Keeling, </em>and duly recorded, whereby <em>Keeling, </em>in consideration of his wife <em>Amey </em>having joined him in the sale and conveyance of lands of her own inheritance, conveyed the slave in question (among others) to the plaintiff, in trust, that he should permit <em>Amey, </em>the wife, to hold possession of the property, and to enjoy the profits, to her separate use, during her life; and after her death, in trust to the use of the children of the marriage, then born or afterwards to be born, during their minority; and after the youngest should attain to full age, in trust for such of the children as the wife should appoint, and in default of such appointment, to be equally divided among them. The plaintiff <em>then </em>proved, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>that <em>Mrs. Amey Keeling </em>during her lifetime, sold the slave in question to one <em>Pendred, </em>and died within five years next before the institution of this suit: <em>Pendred </em>died in possession of the slave: administration of <em>Pendred \u2019s </em>estate was granted to his widow: and she married <em>Henry Newsum </em>the defendant ; who having thus acquired the possession of the slave, sold him in his representative character, before the institution of this suit, to one <em>Bonney </em>for 450 dollars, who after-wards sold him to one <em>Adams. </em>But the plaintiff adduced no proof, either of a demand of the slave of the defendant, or any notice to him of the plaintiff\u2019s title, prior to the institution of the suit. Whereupon, the defendant\u2019s counsel prayed the court to instruct the jury, that unless such demand and refusal were proved, they should find for the defendant, because as he acquired possession of the slave lawfully, and had parted with it prior to any demand of the property, and without notice of any defect in his intestate\u2019s title, the evidence did not shew a tortious conversion of the slave to the defendant\u2019s own use, and the action did not lie against him. But, the court refused to give the instruction; and instructed the jury, that, if from the evidence, they believed there had been an actual conversion of the slave to the defendant\u2019s use, proof of demand and refusal was not necessary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-4\">2. The defendant\u2019s counsel then moved the court to instruct the jury, that the action could not be maintained against the defendant, he having acquired possession of the slave in his representative character, as above mentioned, and parted with it before the institution of this suit; but the court refused to give such instruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-5\">3. The defendant then offered in evidence the inventory and appraisement of <em>Pendred\u2019s </em>estate, and the account of his administration thereof, regularly settled; in order to shew, that the price he had obtained for the slave had been credited to <em>Pendred, \u2019s </em>estate, in his account of administration, and paid to the creditors of that estate; and that there was a large balance due on the account, to the defendant, as <em>the </em>admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>istrator. But the plaintiff objected to the introduction of this evidence; and the court (the lacts first above stated as to the plaintiff\u2019s title being admitted), sustained the objection and excluded the evidence; because the facts it was offered to prove, if proved, would not exonerate the defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s action, or affect his right to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b100-6\">To all these opinions the defendant filed exceptions, and applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-7\"><em>Stanard, for plaintiff in </em>error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXa\">This case presents the question, Whether an administrator, acquiring in that character a chattel of which his intestate died possessed, and selling it in the regular course of his duty, without notice of any adverse right, or of any defect in his intestate\u2019s title, be personally liable as for a wrongful conversion to his own use, at the suit of a person claiming title adverse to that of the intestate ? There is no adjudged case exactly in point. In the analogous case of an agent receiving property or money for his principal, and paying or transferring it to his principal, or devoting it to his use, if it afterwards appear, that the principal had no right, the principal and not the agent is liable. The possession of the slave, in this case, was cast upon the administrator by act of law: he was a mere fiduciary, and bound by the law to appropriate it to the use of his intestate\u2019s estate : and in selling it, without notice of doubt or defect in his intestate\u2019s title, and applying the proceeds in due course of administration, he was only discharging his bounden duty. The performance of his legal duty, was a just defence, and he ought to have beep allowed to prove the truth of it. If he had disposed of the subject, after notice of the adverse claim, such notice as a demand made would have given him, then he would have acted at his own peril, and been personally responsible for the conversion. But as no demand was made, and he had no notice of the adverse claim, his sale and application of the proceeds, was a conversion, not to his own use, but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the use of Ms intestate\u2019s estate. It was the intestate that made the wrongful conversion : and the action lay against the administrator in his representative character, so as to charge his intestate\u2019s estate, not against him, in his own right, to charge him personally. The equity of the statute (1 Rev. Code, c. 104. \u00a7 64.) gives <em>trover </em>against an executor or administrator for a conversi\u00f3n by the testator or intestate in his lifetime : And this was the proper remedy in the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b101-7\">The evidence of the plaintiff having been adduced, as set out in the bill of\" exceptions, and the court, being asked to instruct the jury, \u201c that the evidence did not shew a tortious conversion of the slave to the defendant\u2019s own use, <em>and that the action did not lie against him,\u201d </em>refused the instruction. The title shewn by the plaintiff is therefore properly examinable. <em>He </em>shewed no title. <em>For 1st, </em>the act of limitations began to run, from the date of <em>Mrs. Keeling\u2019s </em>sale to <em>Pendrad, </em>instead of the date of her death; <em>Pendred \u2019s </em>possession was, from the time of his purchase, adverse to the title of the trustee; and, if he held the slave five years, counting from the time of his purchase, such possession gave him title. <em>Newby </em>v. <em>Blakey, </em>3 Hen. Munf. 57. 2ndly, The plaintiff was a mere trustee, without power, in any manner or for any purpose, to alien the trust subject; but if he may maintain <em>trover </em>for this slave, and recover his value, he may thereby in effect alien him; for it is settled, that a recovery in trover, vests the title of the subject in the defendant of whom the value is recovered. The trustee, if he could maintain the action on his naked legal title, could only sue and recover damages <em>pro interesse suo; </em>but here he has recovered obviously the whole value. The <em>cestuis que trust </em>may also sue and recover damages <em>pro interesse suo; </em>and they too may recover the whole value again.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-10\">\n<em>Conway Robinson, for defendant in error.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A40\">The questions raised by <em>Mr. Stanard, </em>as to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s title to recover, and as to the just measure of da<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>mages, </em>are not Presented by the record. This is not a demurrer to evidence, or a special verdict, but a bill of exceptions to opinions of the circuit court on specific points; and as there was no occasion, so there was no attempt, to state more of the evidence, than what would suffice to shew the relevancy of the points moved, and the decisions given, at the trial. There was no general objection to the plaintiff\u2019s title, in tire circuit court: the objection was only, that his evidence did not shew a conversion to the defendant\u2019s own use, and that the action did not lie against him, <em>without proof of a demand and refusal.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-4\">The opinion first excepted to, was, that proof of demand and refusal was not necessary to maintain the action; no more. And, clearly, proof of demand and refusal, being only <em>presumptive </em>evidence of conversion, cannot be necessary, where <em>direct </em>proof of <em>actual </em>conversion is adduced. 3 Starkie on ev. 1492. 1496.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b102-5\">The other opinions of the court, stated and excepted to, amount in effect to this, that the facts, of the defendant\u2019s acquisition of the slave in his representative character, of his having parted with him in the same character, and <em>of </em>his having disbursed the proceeds of sale in due course of administration, before the institution of the suit, all combined, constituted no good defence to the action. The circumstance of the possession of the property having been parted with by the defendant, is surely of no avail: nay, that was the very act of conversion. The manner in which he acquired the possession, cannot be material to the only inquiries proper to the case $ namely, had the plaintiff just right to the property? and had the defendant converted it to his own use ? There is no instance, in which the manner of the defendant\u2019s acquisition of property belonging to another, has been allowed to justify or excuse a conversion of it. With regard to the application which the defendant made of the proceeds- of sale, the right owner cannot be affected by that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>to him the evil is iust as great, whether the defendant gave <em>J \u00b0 \u00b0 </em>the proceeds of his property to others, or retained them to himself. Neither can the defendant\u2019s want of notice of the defect of his intestate\u2019s title, avail him. It is the duty of every man, who sells property, no matter in what character or under what pretence, to see that it belongs to himself, and not to his neighbour. And if it be granted, that the administrator\u2019s conduct in this case was dictated by a sense of duty, and his motives and purposes fair, the personal loss he has incurred must yet be laid to his own fault or at least his misfortune, certainly not to any fault of plaintiff.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\"> The edition referred to is <em>Ingraham\u2019s, Boston, </em>1828.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b103-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZD\">The exceptions taken to the opinions of the court given at the trial, present the only points for the consideration of this court. The ingenuity of counsel, indeed, suggested several others; but we are compelled by the settled law of the court to say, that they do not arise upon this record. The distinction between a bill of exceptions and a demurrer to evidence, has been so often taken by this court, that it would be a waste of time to repeat it, and most mischievous to depart from it. This distinction clearly excludes from our view, the question made upon the act of limitations, Whether the five years of possession ought to run from the sale of the slave by Mrs. Keeling, or from her death ? It is not upon the record, and <em>non constat </em>what was the evidence. Neither can we, sitting in a court of law, take cognizance of the equitable rights of the children of <em>Mrs. Keeling: </em>that consideration is for another forum. Nor, as it seems to me, does it come fairly before ns, on this record, to decide, whether a trustee can bring <em>trover </em>for a slave ? Or, whether his damages should be for the full value, or nominal merely ? The plaintiff sues, not as trustee, but as owner of the slave; the jury has found a general verdict; and the evidence is not before us. True, in a bill of exceptions, taken by the defendant, to a refusal of the court to instruct the jury (not that a trustee could not maintain <em>trover </em>for a slave, but \u201c that unless a demand, and refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>was proved, the verdict must be for the defendant,\u201d) ther<em>e </em>is a statement of some evidence, and among other things, a deed of trust, which, it is said, conveyed the slave to the plaintiff; but what other evidence might have been before the jury, it is impossible to say.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">If, however, these questions were properly raised, I should feel no hesitation in saying, that a court of law looks only to the legal title, and that being in the trustee, he may assert it, by' any action which is given to the legal owner of property : nor can a court of law limit his recovery to nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab\">As to the instructions of the court, they seem to me intirely correct. Demand and refusal, is only evidence of conversion, and therefore not necessary under the facts of this case, where a conversion is proved by other evidence. In like manner, the defendant was liable to the action, though he received the slave as administrator, sold him as administrator, and disbursed the money as administrator, without the least notice of the defect of his intestate\u2019s tide. The right of the owner to sue for his slave, can never depend on such circumstances as these. The administrator, when he sells property as belonging to his intestate, acts at his peril. If he sells my property, he must answer to me for it, however he may have thought himself bound by law to sell, and however fairly he may have applied the proceeds to the debts of his intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The court was also right in rejecting the evidence offered by the defendant. What had the inventory, appraisement and settlement of his administration account, to do with the claim of the plaintiff? They were wholly irrelevant to the question, whether the'slave-was the property of the plaintiff or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">I think the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b104-9\">Green and Cabell, J. and Brooke, <em>President,</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKC\">declared their intire concurrence with the opinion of judge Carr; but</p>\n<author id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Coalter, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AXs\">said he was not prepared to say, as a g<em>ener</em>al proposition, that, where a testator or intestate has fairly purchased property, a horse for instance, from one who turns out afterwards not to be the true owner, and dies possessed of such property, having for a considerable time used it as his own, and it comes to the possession of his executor or administrator after his death, and he, without any notice or demand from the true owner, sells the horse, with the other perishable estate, and fully administers the whole personal fund, if in such case, <em>trover </em>he brought against the representative, for a conversion by <em>him </em>as an <em>individual, </em>the action can be sustained, so as to throw the loss on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">He added : I understand the law to be, that if a defendant come to possession of a chattel by finding, or in other lawful way, it is necessary for the plaintiff to prove a. refusal to deliver, unless the defendant shall have unlawfully intermeddled with the goods. If they be lost or taken from him, he is not guilty of a conversion, because he has not disposed of them as if they were his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Does the executor or administrator, <em>as an individual, unlawfully </em>intermeddle with the goods, in the case put? Can he be said to have converted them to his own use ? Is it an answer to this to say, that he has converted them to the use of the estate ? It will, no doubt, be a conversion in the testator or intestate, in the case put, for which, under the act of assembly, <em>trover </em>will lie against the executor or administrator, and may be a conversion by him <em>as executor or administrator, </em>and for which <em>trover </em>may lie against him <em>as such, </em>so as to charge the estate for the value : or an action for money had and received by the executor or administrator <em>as such, </em>so as to charge the estate; but the question is, whether, under our system of laws, in relation to executors and administrators, and especially since the party is not without his just remedy under the act giving <em>trover against </em>executors or administrators as well as <em>for </em>them, he can be charged <em>individually, </em>as for <em>a conversion to his own use, </em>unless demand and refusal, before he has sold, be proved ? When the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>goods come to the hands of the executor or administrator, the regular remedy is <em>replevin </em>or <em>detinue </em>for them. 1 Wm\u2019s. Saund. 216. a. note 1. The law makes it his duty to sell: he cannot resist the claims of creditors : he cannot demand, as to them, that the personal estate shall remain five years in his possession, so as to put to rest all .demands of this kind: he cannot resort back to creditors, since he cannot shew who has received the money arising from any particular chattel. Suppose he departs from the directions of the law as to selling, leaves the property to answer executions, and points out to the sheriff what has come to his hands, and he levies and amongst other things takes the horse in dispute and sells him, no notice being given; is this a conversion by him <em>individually ? </em>Yet this would be a conversion in the <em>finder </em>of goods, for they would go <em>to his use; </em>he would have disposed of them <em>as his own.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">If A. deliver goods, which afterwards turn out to <em>be the </em>property of B. to C. to deliver to D. and C. does so deliver them, having no notice that they are the property of B. is he guilty of a conversion of them <em>to his own use?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ALM\">The most analogous case which I can find to the supposed one now under consideration, is that in which I understand it to have been settled, that if a sheriff levy an execution on the goods of a bankrupt, and sell them after the act of bankruptcy, but before commission and assignment, he is not liable in <em>trover, </em>though the goods ceased to <em>be the </em>goods of the bankrupt, from the moment of the act of bankruptcy. But the plaintiff, at whose suit they were seized, is liable to the action; for though equally ignorant, they came thus to his use. Before assignment, the sheriff is presumed to be ignorant of the act of bankruptcy, and is acting in obedience to the writ, (how it would be if express knowledge of it was proved, is another question): hut after commission and assignment, which is public and notorious to all the country, he can no longer plead ignorance, and acts at his own peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Our legislature, by various statutes, has shewn a disposition to protect executors and administrators, who are honestly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>doing their duty, against <em>individual </em>loss. If a party does not know his own rights, why shall an executor or admmistrator of the adverse claimant, be presumed to know them? If from any cause, he be unable to make his rights known, even by a demand <em>in pais, </em>why shall his misfortune, if he lose his property, be visited on one equally innocent with himself?</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">But the present case is not considered as presenting the broad proposition laid down in the case above supposed. It presents the case of a slave conveyed in trust by a deed duly recorded (there being no objection to the deed, as not being duly recorded) and there is consequently <em>implied, notice, </em>at least, that the title was not in the intestate. This is not a case of demurrer to <em>evidence; </em>and we know not what was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Ail I mean to say in this case, is, that, as I am at present advised, 1 am not prepared to affirm the broad doctrines, which have been contended for; nor am I intirely prepared to disaffirm them. I wish the point, as it really is not involved in this case, not to be considered as settled by it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
