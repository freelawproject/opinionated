Johnson, by Francis Johnson, her husband and next friend, brought a suit against William Mitchell, acting executor of Thomas Mitchell, deceased, to recover a legacy which had been left to the said Barbara, by her father, the said Thomas Mitchell. By the will of the said Thomas, two thousand pounds were bequeathed to Thomas Johnson, in trust for the use and benefit of his daughter Barbara II. Johnson, during her coverture with Francis Johnson, and in case she should die during the life of the said Francis, then the legacy was to be equally divided among all the children of the said <em>Barbara; </em>but, if the said Francis should die, living the said Barbara, then, and in that case, she was to have the said legacy absolutely. Thomas Johnson, the trustee, refused to act,: whereupon the court of chancery, by consent of parties, appointed William Quarles, trustee, to receive the said legacy, upon his giving bond and security in the amount of 40001. conditioned to hold the said legacy, to be applied as the will directed. Upon the execution of the bond, approved by the commissioner, the chancellor decreed, that, \u201c as there was not heretofore any person Ie* &lt;s gaily authorised to receive the legacy in question, in- <em>\u201c </em>terest thereon should not be paid but from the date \u201c hereof,\u201d and that the defendant should pay the legacy aforesaid, to the said William Quarles, to be held by him in trust, for the said Barbara H. Johnson, as directed by the said testator\u2019s will, with interest thereon from the date of the decree, until paid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>From this decree the plaintiff appealed.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Acr\">Nicholas, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOQ6\">contended, that under the circumstances of this case, interest should have been allowed after a year from the qualification of the executor. ...
