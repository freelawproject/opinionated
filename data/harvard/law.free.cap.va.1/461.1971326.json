The variance is not material.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">This was a special action on the case, brought by the appellant against the appellees, in the County Court of <em>Westmoreland. </em>The declaration stated an agreement between the appellant and the appellees, that the former <em>should rent and furnish a house in Leeds </em>town, and entertain one of the appellees, two of their store keepers, and a servant, with meat and drink for one year, for which the appellees agreed to pay him, for the three first <em>2SI. </em>each, and for the last 8/.; and that, in consideration of the appellant\u2019s having undertaken to <em>rent and furnish a </em>house, and to entertain the said four persons as aforesaid, the appellees promised to pay, See. and avers performance on his part, &amp;c. The breach assigned, is in the non-payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of the stipulated sums. Plea, the general issue. The appellees, at the trial, moved for a non-suit, because the evidence did not correspond with the declaration, which being over-ruled, they filed a bill of exceptions, stating, \u201c that the plaintiff <em>did not prove </em>that any contract had been made between the plaintiff and defendants respecting the <em>renting of a house in Leeds town, </em>as mentioned in the declaration, on the contrary, it appeared, by a witness, that the <em>plaintiff had applied to the defendants </em>upon this subject, informing them, that he <em>had rented a house in Leeds town </em>for the purpose of taking boarders, and requested the defendants to board their assistants with him ; that there was no proof of any application having been made by the defendants to the plaintiff touching the board of the said assistants in the town of Leeds, before the offer was made as aforesaid by the plaintiff to the defendants, nor did it appear in evidence, that any other contract had been made between the parties, except such as is above stated. Whereupon, the defendants did object that no such contract as that laid in the declaration had been proved, and moved for a non-suit.The Court refused to non-suit the plaintiff, because it appeared that the price at which the assistants were to be boarded by the plaintiff was 83/. per annum. The jury found a verdict for the appellant, and upon an appeal to the District Court, the judgment was reversed, and a non-suit awarded, from which the plaintiff below appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-5\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-6\">The first question is, if the variance between the declaration and the evidence be material. 2dly. If material, whether the Inferior Court erred in the judgment which they gave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b482-7\">1st. The variance is certainly not a substantial one, since, whether the agreement was to <em>board, </em>or to <em>rent and furnish a house </em>and board, the appellant, in either case, was entitled to the stipulated sum, and no more is claimed. The renting and furnishing of a house were circumstances entirely unconnected with the services to be performed by the appellant, and for which alone he was to be paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>2d!y. The motion made was for a non-suit. It has been so repeatedly decided in this place, that a plaintiff cannot be compelled to suffer a non-suit, that the -judgment below will surely not be reversed, because that was refused, which this Court has declared ought not to have been directed. If the Court had given an improper direction, or opinion to the jury, it would be subject to the correction of this Court ? But that was not done. The Inferior Court decided properly upon the point submitted to them, and their judgment was, therefore, improperly reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b483-5\">Washington, for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-6\">If the contract laid be proved to be made upon a <em>different consideration </em>from that stated in the declaration, or on that and some other, the variance is fatal. <em>Bull. Ni. Pri </em>147. In <em>Gilb. Laxv of Evid. </em>183, it is laid down <em>u </em>that in all special actions on the case, the <em>allegata </em>and the <em>probata </em>must correspond ; for since in verbal contracts, where the identity is not clearly ascertained in the declaration, and where it cannot be otherwise known till the trial, if a latitude were allowed, that contracts might be considered as the same, which did not <em>substantially </em>differ, no man by the allegation could prepare for his defence/7</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b483-8\">These rules of law are in strict conformity with the real and substantial purposes of a declaration ; which are, 1st. To apprize the defendant of the nature of the charge j and, 2dly. To enable him, by a reference <em>to the record itself </em>to plead the judgment in bar to a second action, for the same cause. To discover whether the variance in this case be material or not, let me suppose that there had been at one time such a con.tract as is stated, and at another, such a contract as is proved, and this is at least a possible case. Suppose a judgment obtained upon the contract as stated, and another action brought some years after upon the contract as proved; could the former judgment be pleaded in bar ? Surely not. Again : Suppose the defendants had had a witness material for them as to the first contract, and another as to the second: when the plaintiff found the defendants prepared to meet him</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9pD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>upon the contract as laid, he had only to shift his ground <em>at the trial, </em>and prove the second contract, upon which he discovered the defendants were unPrePared. By strictly requiring a close correspondence between the allegation and the proof, the plaintiff can never be injured, because, knowing his own case, it must be his own fault if he misstate it. But Infinite mischief will ensue from breaking in upon the xule, since we are then at sea, at the mercy of nice and capricious distinctions, without any certain guide to direct us.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-5\">The variance is said not to be material, because, an either case, the appellant was entitled to 83/., and for this he has brought his action. But if the plaintiff state what he might with propriety have omitted, yet having stated it, he must prove it, for otherwise the cases are not the same. The case of <em>Bristow </em>v. <em>Wright </em>&amp; <em>Pugh., </em>2 <em>Dougl. </em>665, is a complete answer to this argument, and the doctrine is fully and ably stated by <em>Lord Mansfield.. </em>That was an action by a landlord against a Sheriff, under the Statute, for levying an execution on his tenant, without paying him a year\u2019s rent, which in the declaration was stated to be payable <em>annually. </em>On evidence it turned out, to be payable <em>quarterly, </em>and the variance was considered as fatal. Now this variance was quite unimportant to the Sheriff, since the action was brought for the years rent, and more could not have been recovered, whether it were payable in one way, or in the other. It was agreed, that the mode of payment was unnecessarily set forth, but being stated, it should have been proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-6\">Should it be argued, that in the case at bar, the declaration is broader than the proof, and therefore the variance favourable to the appellees, I answer, so it was in the case reported in 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>735, where the promise laid, was to deliver good merchantable wheat, and that proved, was to deliver good second sort of wheat, which was decided to be a fatal variance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-7\">Another variance equally material is, that the agreement laid, is to pay 25/. for three persons each, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number><em>8L </em>for a servant, and that proved, is to pay <em>a gross mm of S3h </em>,</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-3\">I consider the second point as being more difficulty and more important.\u2014The decision of this Court are relied upon, and it is contended, that however the case might have been, if the motion had been more regular, yet in the shape in which it was made, the judgment must be affirmed. But if the Court perceive from this record, that the appellant ought not to recover upon the principal point, it is strange to say, that he shall have the benefit of the judgment, because the appellees happened to make a <em>collateral motion </em>which was irregular.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-4\">Suppose for a moment, that this motion had not been made; how would the case have stood, if the appellees, instead of proceeding as they did, had demurred to the evidence ? If the variance be material, they must have prevailed. I then submit it whether In substance this be not a demurrer to evidence, whatever it may be in form ? An attention to the distinction between a bill of exceptions, and a demurrer to evidence will be important. The first is founded upon an objection to the <em>admission of improper testimony </em>the judgment of the Court, is, that the evidence is, or is not, proper, and if it be improper, a new trial is awarded. The latter admits the competency of the evidence, as well as the verity of it, but objects, that It is <em>insufficient to maintain the issue; </em>and in this case, the whole evidence must be stated, in order that the Court may decide whether it be sufficient or not. The judgment is <em>final, </em>either for the plaintiff or defendant, and the verdict, which is a conditional one, stands or falls with that judgment. Now apply this definition to the present case. All the evidence which was given is spread upon the record, and it is further stated, that certain other facts were not proved. But the fact not proved was the very thing essentially necessary to have been established in support of the issue. This Court then have it in their power to give a final judgment, and to say, either that the issue was, or was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>supported by the evidence. In the case of <em>Keel </em>&amp; <em>Roberts </em>v. Herbert, (ante, p. z03.) in this Court, where the pica w as <em>non-assumpsit within five </em>years, a bill of ex-cePtlons vvat&gt; filed, stating three depositions verbatim, from which it appeared that <em>those, deponents </em>djd not prove an <em>assumpsit </em>within five years. It was contended at the bar, that this, though a bill of exceptions in form, might be considered as a demurrer to evidence, since it stated the whole evidence. Your honor in delivering the opinion of the Court, observed that the question was, whether this was to be considered as a demurrer to e\\ idence ; which could never have been a question, if .the form was material to give the name. The cause was sent back for a new tria!, and I presume for this reason, that the whole case was not stated, for notwithstanding three witnesses might not have heard an <em>assumpsit </em>within five years, there <em>might have been </em>other witnesses exatnined who did. II then the motion for a non-suit had not been made, and this Court have found enough stated in the record to satisfy them, that judgment ought to be given for the appellees, what alteration will that motion make? The motion was merely <em>collateral </em>and the appeal is not from that, but from the <em>final judgment, </em>which I have endeavoured to shew was erroneous, and which is either to be affirmed, or corrected here. And if the final judgment be wrong, will this Court affirm it, because the counsel propounded an improper question to the Court ? This would be sacrificing substantial justice to considerations of mere form. But what is this Court now to do ? They must either give judgment for the appellant, award a new trial, or give judgment for the appellees. The first cannot be done, because it appears upon the face of the record that the appel? Jant ought not to recover. Will-they do the second ? If they do, it will be a vain thing, since it is evident that the appellant upon this declaration cannot ultimately succeed. But the Court may reverse the judgment of the District Court because it awarded a non-suit ; also the judgment of the County Court, and direct it to be entered for the appellees, upon the ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>that the appellant ought not to have recovered upon the \u2022\u201c*. Kfc-uce.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-4\">Marshall, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsP\">The case from <em>Ld. Raym. </em>is not like the present. The variance there was material, since the price of the wheat not being fixed, it would depend upon the quality of it, and therefore it was essential in fixing the <em>quantum </em>of damages which the plaintiff was entitled to recover, whether it were of the first, or of the second quality. But in this case, whether the agreement was, as it is stated in the declaration, or as it is turned out in proof, still the appellant was entitled to <em>8\u00bfL, </em>and to no more, nor less. If this action had been for damages, on account of the appellees\u2019 refusal to <em>hoard </em>the four persons with the appellant, the variance might have been material, since those damages ought in that case to have been proportioned to the inconvenience and loss which the appellant sustained, by providing himself with the means of accommodating the boarders.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-5\">Upon the second point, I would ask, whether it be possible to liken a bill of exceptions to a demurrer to evidence? They are different in form, in their consequences, and in the conduct of the parties. In the former the parties still proceed to a trial of the issue; in the latter, the jury are discharged immediately, or find a conditional verdict only. In the former, the question is brought before the Court upon the motion of the objecting party only; in the latter, by the act of both parties, since the demurrer offered by the one is joined by the other. In the former, either party has a right to the benefit of his exceptions before a S' perior Court; in the latter, the Court, if the case be clear, may refuse to compel the other party to join the demurrer, and leave the whole question to the jury. The judgment upon reversal, in the one case, is for a new trial; in the other it is final and conclusive. But the order of non-suit is not conclusive; the plaintiff is not obliged to submit to it, and if he do, he may re-institute his suit, and recover upon better evidence. But the final judgment is a perpetual bar. As to awarding a new trial, the Court is not bound to do it against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>die justice of the case; for if in this cause the appei lant should fail, it must be, not because the justice of the case is against him, but because of a mere slip in his attorney in stating it. <em>j </em>0</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b488-7\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AGh\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">This Court having decided, that the plaintiff cannot be compelled to suffer a non-suit, the counsel for the appellees acknowledge that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed, but he has insisted, that the bill of exceptions should be considered as a demurrer to evidence, and that the variance between the case stated, and that proved, being material, the Court ought to reverse the judgment of the County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AV3\">In the case of <em>Keel </em>&amp; <em>Roberts </em>v. Herbert, this Court decided against the doctrine of taking a bill of exceptions for a demurrer to evidence; but the counsel endeavoured to distinguish that case from this, on account of the w'hole evidence being stated in this, whereas there was in that only a partial recital of the evidence, and says that the reason which governed the Court in that case was founded upon this distinction. Whether this was the only reason <em>assigned </em>by the Court, I cannot ascertain, not having my notes with me; but the Judges recollect that their discussion went farther, and that they considered the two modes of proceeding as being so totally dissimilar, that the one could not be considered as answering the purposes of the other. On a demurrer to evidence, the Court may refuse to compel the other party to join, and may either direct the jury as to the sufficiency of the evidence, or in a clear case, may leave it to the jury to decide upon,- as the Court seem to have done in this case. We cannot therefore consider this as a demurrer to evidence. The counsel for the appellees then insists, that the variance between the declaration and the proof is so material, that this Court cannot give judgment for the appellant, or affirm the judgment of the County Court; since, in all special actions, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>plaintiff must prove his case precisely as he has stated k i that if he fail to do so, he cannot recover, ;,a should prove another contract entitling' him to the same relief, because such recovery would be no bar to a new suit founded upon such other contract The cases cited for this purpose do not apply to the present In those, the two contracts are entirely different from each other ; such as good wheat, stated, and good wheat, of a second quality, proved\u2014a lease reserving rent <em>annually, </em>stated, and reserving it <em>quarterlyt </em>proved. These were <em>different contracts, </em>and the substance of the one, was not comprehended in the other. We are not inclined to meddle with these decisions, nor by any means to extend them beyond their principles. But, in this case, the proof extends to all the substantial parts of the contract as laid, and what it does not reach was wholly immaterial, and might as well have been omitted as inserted. But If it could be material, yet the evidence being stated in the bill of exceptions, and a general verdict found for the appellant, he would be barred from a future action, and. the appellees would have it completely in their power to avail themselves of this recovery, by referring to the record. The appellant was to find the store keepers meat and drink for 83/.; to do this, he must have a house, and whether he then had one, or was to procure one, or whether they solicited him, or he them, for the contract, was wholly unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The judgment of the District Court must be re versed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
