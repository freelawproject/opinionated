A mere averment that the debt had not been paid to the <em>sm vivhtg </em>partner will not be sufficient.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b289-9\">A writ of <em>scire facias </em>need not set forth what goods, lands, &amp;e. have been acquired by the defendant, since the date of the judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b289-10\">It is not a good plea to a <em>scire </em>facias, that the defendant had transferred, conveyed, &amp;e. to the sheriiV, goods and chattels, lands, &amp;c. according to the act of Assembly, to a greater value, &amp;c. and that no proceedings had been had under the act of Assembly, against the said lands, &amp;c.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b289-11\">!Nor is it a good plea that the defendant had transferred, in like manner, various debts, &amp;c. and that the proceedings prescribed by the act of Assembly., &amp;c. to recover such debts, had not been had.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-12\">These were two writs of <em>scire facias </em>issued from the superior court of law of James City county, in the name of the administrator of George Lewis against George Lang, to revive two judgments obtained by Z. Litchfield and George Lewis against the said Lang.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-13\">After the rendition of the original judgment, Z. Litchfield, one of the plaintiffs, died; and on motion to the court, suggesting his death, it was ordered that an execution should issue, in the name of Lewis, the surviving plain, tiff. A <em>ca. sa. </em>was accordingly issued and served upon Lang, who took the oath of insolvency, and was thereupon discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-14\">George Lewis died, and Thomas James was appointed his administrator; who sued out the two writs of <em>scire facias </em>above-mentioned, suggesting, that since the discharge of the said George Lang, divers lands, tenements, goods and chattels, had been acquired by, or come to the possession of, the said George Lang.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The defendant pleaded four pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-3\">1. No such record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AtZ\">2. That he transferred, conveyed, &amp;c. goods and chattels, rights and credits, lands, &amp;c. according to the act of Assembly, to a value greater, &amp;c. and that no proceedings</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-5\">had been had, according to the act of Assembly, against the said lands, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-6\">3. That he conveyed, transferred, &amp;c. according to law, various debts, &amp;c. and that the proceedings prescribed by the act of Assembly, &amp;c. to recover such debts, had not been had.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">4. That he had paid the debt. In one of <em>the cases, </em>the defendant avers that he had paid the said debt, to the said <em>George </em>Lewis; in the other, he avers that he had paid the debt <em>generally.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-8\">To these pleas, the plaintiff filed replications and demurrers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-9\">1. To the first idea, he replied that there was no such a record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-10\">2. To the second plea, he demurred specially, and assigned the following causes of demurrer: 1. That the plaintiff was not bound to proceed against the lands, tenements and effects, if any transferred by the said George. Lang. 2. That the plaintiff was not bound to summon the persons, if any, owing debts. 3. That the said plea is double. 4. That the said plea does not aver, that there were lands and effects, and debts owing. 5. That the said plea is in other respects, uncertain, informal, and insufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-11\">The plaintiff also replied to the same plea, that there were not lands, tenements, and effects, sufficient in value, to satisfy his said debt, so transferred by the said defendant; and put himself upon the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-12\">3. To the third plea, the plaintiff replied, that there were not lands and tenements, goods and effects, and debts owing, and sufficient in value to satisfy his debts, so assigned and transferred by the said defendant, as in his said plea he avers; and of this he put himself upon the couutry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>To this plea, the plaintiff also demurred generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-3\">4. The plaintiff replied to the fourth plea, that the defendant did not pay <em>George </em>Lewis his testator, the sum recovered $ and concluded to the country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-4\">The defendant joined in the demurrers; and it is stated on the record, that issues were joined on the replications.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-5\">The court gave judgment, that the pleas of the defendant, were good in law, and overruled the demurrers of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">The issue \u201c no such record,\u201d was decided by the court on inspection, and adjudged in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">On the three other pleas, a jury was itnpannelled, and found a verdict in these words: \u201cWe of the jury, find</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-8\">ee for the plaintiff, the debt, damages and costs, in the writ \u201c of <em>scire facias </em>mentioned, and his costs in this behalf, if expended.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-9\">The court gave judgment, <em>\u201c that'the plaintiff may have</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\"><em>execution against the </em>defendant,\u201d <em>for the, debt, &amp;c. </em>and the defendant appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-11\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-12\"><em>Upshur, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-13\">The counsel for the appellant relied on the following points :</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-14\">1. That the writ of <em>scire facias </em>was defective, in not setting forth what goods, &amp;c. lands, &amp;c. had been acquired by the defendant, after the date of the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-15\">2. That the judgment of the court was right, on the plaintiff\u2019s demurrer to the second and third pleas of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-16\">3. That judgment having been given for the defendant on these demurrers, that judgment should have been absolute for the defendant, and that the court should not have gone on to try the replications tendered by the plaintiff to these pleas, the plaintiff having no right, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>demurring, to reply to <em>the </em>same pleas, and tender an issue both in fact and law; the right of filing several pleas being given to the defendant, and not to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-9\">4. That the defendant, not having joined issue, no trial could be had. The statement on the record, that \u201c <em>issues being joined, Sec.\u201d </em>is not sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">5. That the replication to the fourth plea, of payment <em>generally, </em>was defective, as it only stated that the debt had not been paid, <em>to the plaintiff\u2019s testator.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-11\">6. That the verdict was not good, as it did not find what lands, &amp;c. goods, <em>See. </em>had <em>been </em>acquired by <em>the </em>defendant, since his discharge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-12\"><em>7. </em>That the judgment was erroneous in awarding execution against the defendant <em>generally, </em>instead of awarding it against after acquired lands, &amp;c. goods, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-13\">On the part of the <em>appellee, </em>it was said, that as to the first objection, the mode pursued was the most convenient, and that no principle or precedent required an exact statement of the after-acquired lands, in the <em>scire facias ; </em>that it was impossible to ascertain at what time <em>personal </em>property was acquired; and as to <em>real, </em>the title papers being all in the hands of the defendant, <em>he </em>alone could know the date of its acquisition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-14\">As to the demurrers to the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>pleas, the court erred in over-ruling them, as the pleas presented no substantial bar to the recovery of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-15\">With regard to the union of <em>demurrers </em>with replications on <em>matters of fact, </em>it is justified by the spirit of the law, which allows every matter of <em>law </em>or <em>fact </em>to be pleaded. The same reason exists in the case of a <em>replication, </em>as in that of a <em>plea; </em>and this court have already decided, that a replication in chancery, does not over-rule a demurver.<footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There is a <em>similiter </em>in this case, which makes a complete issue. As to the <em>fifth </em>objection, <em>the fact </em>on which it is founded is denied, and must be decided by an inspection of the record.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>The verdict is quite sufficient. It is a <em>general </em>one, and , if it answers all the matters put in issue, it is good. It negatives all the facts set forth by the defendant in bis defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">The seventh objection is founded on an erroneous impression, that the judgment warrants the issuing of a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>against the defendant. The judgment must have relation to the <em>scire facias; </em>and that writ only demands execution of the <em>lands, </em>&amp;c. which have come to the possession of the defendant, since the original judgment.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b292-16\"> 4 Munf. 466, Eppes <em>vs. </em>Bagley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b293-6\"><em>January </em>27.</p>\n<author id=\"Arr\">Judge Brooke,</author>\n<p id=\"AGh\">delivered the opinion of the court, in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">In the first case:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The court is of opinion, that the superior court erred in permitting the plaintiff to reply and demur to the same pleas; yet, as these pleas allege no substantial bar to the action, and the issues in fact being all found for the plaintiff, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">In the second case:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The court would also affirm the judgment in this cases for the reasons assigned in the other case, but the replication to the plea of payment which is general, only negatives the payment to Lewis the surviving partner. On this ground, the judgment is reversed, and all the pleadings, except the pleas of payment and no such record, are set aside, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings, and a new trial awarded, to be had therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
