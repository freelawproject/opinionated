It being ascertained before the 1st January <em>1805, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>that <em>Beverley, </em>in consequence of some leases which he had made, would be unable to comply with this contract, the parties consented to modify it, by an agreement that <em>Tapp </em>should receive the rents for the year 1804, and lake a conveyance subject to the leases; and that he should have a credit of four years, instead of one year, for the excess of the purchase money beyond <em>\u00a3 </em>3 000. provided this sum should be paid on the 1st January 1805. In the latter part of the year 1804, <em>Beverley </em>contracted with <em>Boss, Grinnan, Mundel </em>and <em>Carter, </em>to sell them his patrimonial estate in the county of <em>Culpeper, </em>which included the land he had previously sold to <em>Tapp; </em>and on the 1st January 1805, he conveyed the whole estate to them, and took back a mortgage upon it, to secure the purchase money. He communicated to them, on the same day, by a memorandum in writing, that he had before sold to <em>Tapp, </em>a part of the land, not then surveyed, but supposed to contain 700 acres, at forty shillings per aero. On the 12th January 1805, the land having been surveyed, and found to contain 797-| acres, <em>Beverley </em>conveyed it to <em>Tapp, </em>and received from him <em>\u00a3 </em>3000. and took <em>his </em>bond for <em>\u00a3 575. </em>the residue of the purchase money, payable on the 1st January 1809, according to the modification of their contract. On the 19th March 1805, he paid to <em>Ross, Grinnan, Mundcl </em>and <em>Carter, </em>the <em>\u00a3 </em>3 000. he had received from <em>Tapp, </em>and took their obligation to convey the land to <em>Tapp, </em>and to take an assignment of <em>Tapp\u2019s </em>bond for the balance of the purchase money. It would seem, from the terms of this obligation, that they were not then informed of the change that had been made in the contract between <em>Beverley </em>and <em>Tapp, </em>as to the time of the last payment ; and <em>Beverley </em>swears that he did not communicate it to them. This obligation was soon afterwards delivered to <em>Tapp, </em>and <em>Beverley </em>tendered to <em>Ross </em>and his associates, an assignment of <em>Tapp\u2019s </em>bond for \u00a3575. payable on the 1st January 1809, as above mentioned; but they refused to receive it, on the ground that it ought to have been made payable on the 1st January 1806, according to the original con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>q.aCf; between <em>Beverley </em>and <em>Tapp, </em>which was the only one <em>J J </em>that had been made known to them, and on the basis of which they had consented to convey the land. Shortly after the ,1st January 1806, they instituted a suit in chancery against <em>Tapp </em>and <em>Beverley, </em>for the purpose of compelling aq immediate payment of the balance of the purchase money; but they were cast in that suit. They thereupon took from <em>Beverley </em>an assignment of <em>Tapp's </em>bond, brought suit upon it, and prosecuted it to a judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\"><em>Tapp </em>then exhibited a bill, in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>against <em>Beverley </em>and against <em>Boss </em>and his associates, claiming credit for the rents of 1804, and two discounts for debts contracted to him by <em>Beverley, </em>subsequent to the date of his bond to <em>Beverley, </em>and (as he alleged) before <em>Beverley's </em>assignment thereof to <em>Boss </em>and others; insisting on a specific execution by <em>Boss </em>and others, of their contract to convey to him the land he had bought of <em>Beverley, </em>before he should be held to pay them the purchase money; and praying an injunction to proceedings on the judgment at law, till these matters could be heard and adjusted in equity. The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">. <em>Boss </em>and his associates, in their answers, contest the two discounts claimed by <em>Tapp, </em>for the debts due him by <em>Beverley, </em>on the ground, that <em>when </em>those debts were contracted, <em>Tapp </em>had notice that <em>Beverley </em>had assigned to them the whole of the <em>debt </em>which <em>Tapp </em>owed for the land. And they filed with their answers, a deed conveying all their right in the land to <em>Tapp, </em>which they said they would deliver to him, when he paid the money. This instrument was executed by them all; but as to some of them, there were no subscribing witnesses; nor was it acknowledged or certified for record, in any of the modes prescribed by the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">Upon the coming in of the answers, the chancellor referred the accounts to a commissioner; who made a report, in which, rejecting the discounts claimed by <em>Tapp </em>for the debts due by <em>Beverley </em>to him, he gave him credit for 86 dollars, as of the 1st January 1809, for the rents of 1804, and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>1160 dollars paid by <em>Tapp </em>on the 1st January 1813, pending the suit in chancery; and stated a balance due from <em>Tapp </em>of 1192 dollars 65 cents with interest from 1st January 1813. And the commissioner reported, that this was the state of the account, which the defendants, <em>Ross </em>and others, admitted to he right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">The chancellor, upon the coming in of the report, perpe - tuated the injunction as to <em>seventy-four </em>dollars <em>only </em>(on account of the rents of J 804) to be credited as of the 1st January 1809, and dissolved the injunction as to all the residue. He made no provision in the decree, for perfecting and delivering the conveyance from <em>Ross </em>and others to <em>Tapp. </em>And he decreed that <em>Tapp </em>should pay the costs. <em>Tapp </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-8\">The case was argued here, by <em>Leigh </em>for the appellant, and <em>Stanard </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-9\">The question, whether <em>Tapp </em>was entitled to the two discounts he claimed, for debts contracted to him by <em>Beverley, </em>as against <em>Ross </em>and others, the assignees of <em>Beverley, </em>was a question of fact, depending intirely on the proofs; and on this point, his court concurred with the chancellor, and decided against the claim of the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-10\"><em>Leigh </em>objected to the decree, 1. that it dissolved the injunction as to the 1160 dollars, paid by <em>Tapp, </em>in part satisfaction of the debt, pending the suit in chancery, though the defendants themselves admitted that credit before the commissioner : and 2. that the court should have decreed the defendants, <em>Ross </em>and others, to make and deliver a conveyance of the land to <em>Tapp, </em>so perfected as to be admissible to record, before or at the time he should be called on to pay the balance of the purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-11\"><em>Stanard </em>answered, 1. that the payment made pending the suit in chancery, not being a subject of controversy (as it could not possibly have been) nor presented by the pleadings, could not properly have been noticed in the decree : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>2. </em>that the conveyance by <em>Ross </em>and others, having been <em>J . . </em>executed by those parties, and filed as a deed which they proffered to deliver, whenever <em>Tapp </em>should entitle himself to it by paying the purchase money, would be at <em>Tapp\u2019s </em>command the moment he paid the purchase money, and the chancellor might at any time direct that it should be delivered to him; and besides, <em>Ross </em>and others had only an equitable title, the legal title having been re-vested in <em>Beverley </em>and he having conveyed to Tapp.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AqK\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ai\">I am of opinion, that the commissioner rightly rejected the set-offs claimed by <em>Tapp, </em>as they were for transactions with <em>Beverley, </em>long subsequent to the time when <em>Tapp </em>knew, that whatever was due from him for the purchase of the land, was justly payable, not to <em>Beverley, </em>but to <em>Ross, Grinnan, Mundel </em>and <em>Carter; </em>and I approve of the statement of the commissioner in all respects. The chancellor approved of it also, and ought, consequently, to have made it the basis of his decree. But he has- not done so; for he perpetuated the injunction for' 74 dollars only, as of the 1st January 1809, and dissolved it as to the residue; thus letting loose the execution for the difference between 74 and 86 dollars, and also for the sum of 1160 dollars, paid pending the suit. This was clearly wrong as to the first mentioned sum, viz. the difference between 74 and 86 dollars, because the commissioner\u2019s report clearly shews, that <em>Tapp </em>was entitled to the 86 dollars. And I think the decree was equally wrong in not giving credit for the 1160 dollars. The fact of the money not havings been paid, until after the institution of this suit and the granting the injunction, might affect the question as to who should pay the costs of the suit, but it surely could not authorise the dissolution of the injunction as to money actually paid and no longer due. The injunction should have been perpetuated for all but 1192 dollars 65 cents with interest thereon, according to the statement of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>I am also of opinion, that the decree is erroneous in another respect. <em>Ross </em>and his associates did not stand in the situation of persons holding a mere equity, which may be released by parol or by act <em>in pais. </em>They had expressly bound themselves, <em>by </em>their written obligation of the L9th March 1805, to convey the land to <em>Tapp. </em>They must, under the circumstances of this case, be regarded as vendors of the land; and they shew, that they considered themselves bound to convey it with general warranty; for they exhibit with their answers, a deed conveying the land with general warranty, which appears to have been executed by all the parties. As to some of the grantors, however, there were no witnesses; nor was the deed acknowledged, in any of the modes prescribed by the laws regulating the recording of conveyances. A person bound to make a conveyance of lands, is bound to execute it in the presence of witnesses, or to acknowledge it in such manner, that the person to whom it is made, may have it recorded according to law. It was error in the court of chancery, not to provide for this, contemporarily with the dissolution of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">The decree should be reversed with costs, the injunction reinstated, and the cause remanded to be further proceeded in, according to the principles now declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">As to the costs in the court of chancery; the appellees voluntarily allowed all just credits ; and were willing, at all times, (after they took the assignment), to make the conveyance, provided the appellant wotdd pay the balance justly due. He forced them into the court of equity, to defend themselves against his unjust claims of set-off, and he should therefore pay the costs incurred in that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The other judges concurring, the decree was reversed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
