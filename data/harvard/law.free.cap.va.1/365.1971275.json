That the guardian of the plaintiff was in possession of the land for many years, and continued so, till he was turned out by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-10\">The District Court gave judgment for the defendant, from which this appeal was prayed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Washington, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b386-3\">The single question in this case is, whether <em>George Sisson </em>in 1736, could legally dock the intail, and convey to the ancestor of the plaintiff, under the law of 1748, which permits a person <em>seised </em>of an estate in fee tail, to dock the same by a writ of <em>ad quod damnum. </em>It will be objected, that <em>Sisson </em>legally divested himself of the estate during his life, by the deed of 1725, and consequently, that he was not <em>seised of an estate tail in </em>1736, so as to bar the same under the words, or under the meaning of the above mentioned law. In answer to this objection, I submit it, whether after so great a length of time, and under all the circumstances of this case, the Court will not presume a surrender by <em>Sisson </em>of his life estate, for the purpose of giving validity to the inquest and deed of 1736. In <em>England, </em>it is necessary for the tenant in tail, if he would suffer a common recovery, either to have a sufficient estate, and power, to enable him to do it by being tenant in tail in possession, or he must have the concurrence of the tenant of the freehold. The rule there is, that where a person has a right to suffer a recovery <em>omnia prcesumuntur rite et solemniter </em>acta, till the contrary appears; and a surrender of the life estate will be presumed, unless opposed by circumstances which contradict the presumption. 2 <em>Str. </em>1267. 1129. So in the case of <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>The Duke of Chandos, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>1065, this principle is laid down, and fully explained. In the case 2 <em>Str. </em>1129, the presumption was rebutted by the production of an <em>imperfect </em>surrender. In the case from 2 <em>Burr, </em>the presumption was sufficiently contradicted: first, on account of the tenant in tail having other lands which he might bar, and upon which the recovery might operate, without resorting to presumption, in order to bar the estate tail, whereof he was not in possession. Secondly, because it was not fortified by proof of possession under the recovery. But the principle is fully established and admitted in both cases. Now in the case under consideration, if the writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>and inquisition did not operate upon the land in question, it could not operate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>at all, but was a nullity : No imperfect surrender appears ; and seisin and possession is found in <em>Sisson </em>by the inquisition taken at the time, and upon the premises. Possession is also found in <em>Purcell, </em>under the deed of bargain and sale, founded upon the inquisition. <em>Acquiescence </em>on the part of the issue in tail appears : acquiescence on the part of <em>Northern </em>is found, by his son quietly delivering up the possession, and finally, these circumstances are fortified by length of time. A stronger case for presumption cannot be imagined.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-3\">Warden, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-4\">If the plaintiff\u2019s title be in any part of it defective, it is sufficient for the tenant in possession, however destitute he may be himself of right. The objections to the plaintiff\u2019s title are,</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-5\">1st. That the patent found by the jury is not a complete one, not containing any of he formal parts of a deed, but is a mere skeleton.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-6\">2d. From the patentee, it is transferred by <em>assignment, </em>which is not sufficient to convey a title to lands; the law of 1748 declaring, that no estate of inheritance in lands shall pass, alter, or change, from one to another, but by deed indented, See.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-7\">3dly. The inquisition is taken the 10th day of March, in the year 1636, and the writ of <em>ad quod </em>damnum, is dated the 3d day of <em>March, </em>in the 10th year of the reign of <em>Geo. </em>2., which is subsequent to the inquisition, and therefore it was taken without a writ to warrant it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-8\">4thly. The findings in the verdict are contradictory to each other. It is found that after 1725, and after 1737, <em>Northern </em>was seised, and yet it is found, that Purcell, after the deed to him was seised and possessed during his lile. Again\u2014-by the will of <em>Purcell, </em>the land is devised to his wife for life, who, the jury find, died in 1766 ; and yet that the guardian of the lessor of the plaintiff was turned out of possession in 1764.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b387-9\">5thly. As to the point which has been anticipated, I think it too strong to be gotten over. By the deeds of lease and re-lease to <em>Northern </em>in 1725, which contains a warranty, the tenant in tail deprived himself of</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>interest in the premises, and by discontinuing the tail, he no longer had any power under the law, to dock the intail, or to make the deed of 1737. The Court will presume a great deal to support a recovery, which is a matter of record, and of course will'be considered as having been rightly done, which they will not do, as to matters transacted in <em>pais. </em>This I consider as a full answer to the cases which have been cited.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-6\"><em>Washington, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1E7\">As to the first and second objections, the case of <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>(see <em>ante, </em>34,) where these points were much contested, is a complete authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-7\">3d objection. I have not time to examine whether Mr. <em>Warden </em>be accurate or not, in his calculation of dates; I am almost satisfied that he is not. But suppose it otherwise, I contend, that any inaccuracy in this respect is supplied by the verdict, which finds, that a writ issued, in <em>hese verba, </em>that in obedience thereto an inquisition was taken, and the deed recites both. Now the writ must <em>in fact </em>have issued before the inquisition was taken, and both must have existed before the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-8\">4th objection. If the verdict be so contradictory that no judgment could be rendered upon it, then the judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded; a decision which I did not expect to hear pressed for by the counsel for the successful party below. But though it might be my interest to consent to this, yet candor compels me to say, that I think the verdict may very well be reconciled, by the Court\u2019s presuming, what I have contended they ought, in order to support the deed of 1737, <em>viz. </em>that <em>Purcell </em>consented, that, if <em>Northern </em>would surrender his life estate, for the purpose of giving effect to the deed of 1737, he should enjoy the land during his life\u2014that <em>Northern </em>did so : in consequence of this, <em>Sisson </em>became seised again, (as the jury find he was,) and the intail being docked, <em>Purcell </em>became seised under the conveyance to him: after-wards <em>Northern </em>re-entered by curtesy, and held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>possession during his life\u2014and that his heir knowing all this, quietly delivered up the possession to <em>Purcell, </em>the right owner. These are the circumstances which I rely upon, to aid the presumption arising from length of time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-7\">The principal part of the fifth objection has been before answered. The form of the deed to <em>Northern </em>is relied upon. It is of little consequence what sort of conveyance was made, as to the point we are discussing. But if it were material, 1 would contend, that the deed of lease and release set forth in the record, is a statutary conveyance, as much so as a deed of bargain and sale; and that therefore neither could work a discontinuance, nor pass a greater estate than the grantor might lawfully part with. There might perhaps be a common law deed of lease and release at this day, but then the lease must not (as in this case,) be by bargain and sale, and recite that it is made for the purpose of enabling the lessee, under the Statute of Uses, to receive a release. \u2022 As to the warranty, the jury have not found assets descended upon the issue in tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-8\">I do not ask the Court to presume any thing, so as to supply <em>defects </em>in the writ, or <em>inquisition, </em>but merely a <em>fact </em>done in <em>pais, </em>as well in this case, as in that of a common recovery, <em>viz. </em>a surrender: so that the difference contended for does not weaken the authorities cited.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b389-9\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A-P\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">The question on the merits is, whether <em>George Sisson\u2019s </em>deed of lease and release to <em>Northern </em>in 1725, prevented the operation of the writ of <em>ad quod damnum </em>in 1736, and his deed to <em>Purcell </em>in 1737. This may very much depend upon the actual seisin and possession of the parties; as to which, the findings are uncertain, and directly contradictory to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">First, they find that <em>George\\Sisson </em>entered by virtue of his grandfather\u2019s will in 1698, and was seised and possessed, and being so seised and possessed, did in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>1736, sue out the writ, and in 1737, conveyed the land to <em>Purcell. </em>Afterwards they find, that in 1725 (an intervening period between 1698 and 1736,) the same <em>Sisson </em>conveyed the land to Northern, and that he was thereof seised and possessed, in contradiction to the former finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Again\u2014they find that by virtue of the deed of 1737, <em>Purcell </em>entered, and was seised and possessed, and was so seised and possessed at his death in 1761. After-wards it is stated that <em>Northern </em>was seised and possessed after 1737, and that his son after 1747, delivered up the possession to <em>Purcell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">These might be reconciled by a strained construction, so as to avoid a contradiction, but the Court do not think it right to proceed to.judgment upon so uncertain a verdict as to this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-15\">The judgment of the District Court must be reversed for these reasons, and the cause remanded for1 a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
