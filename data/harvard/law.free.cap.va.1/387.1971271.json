He was also entitled to a leasehold interest, for the term of <em>999 </em>years, in another tract of land lying in the same County, but of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>this last he was not possessed. He commenced a suit for the recovery of it, which abated by his death. His executors reviyed the suit after his death, and recovered the land. The appellee filed his bill in the High Court of Chancery, against the executors and residuary devisees of the testator, claiming the leasehold, as well as the freehold lands. The only question was, whether the leasehold land passed under the above clause to the appellee, or was comprehended in the residuary clause in the will. The <em>Chancellor </em>decreed in favor of the appellee, upon his giving bond, with condition, to pay the proportion of the debts due from the testator, for which this land is liable ; and also, an account of the rents and profits thereof, received by the executors. From this decree the executors appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-8\"><em>Warden, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-9\">The decisions, from the case of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Bartlett, Cro. Car. </em>292, down to the present day, have been uniform upon the subject; and they all establish this difference, that if the testator be entitled to both freehold and leasehold lands, and devise <em>all his </em>lands, the former only will pass ; but if he have leasehold lands only, then they will pass; for in the first case, the freehold lands m ill satisfy the words of the will. He cited <em>Swinb. on </em>Wills, 139. 318. Devise of all his lands and tenements, only the freehold lands pass. 1 <em>P. </em>Wms. 286. 3 <em>P. Wms. </em>26. 2 Atk. 450. 1 <em>Vern. </em>271.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-10\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-11\">If the weight of authorities were out of the wav, there could be no question, in cases of this sent, about the intention, which certainly is, to pass all the testator\u2019s land, whether freehold or leasehold. The cases cited, do not apply. They have all of them been decided upon some expression in the will, shewing an intention to pass only the freehold lands. In those cases, the testator either gives all his lands and <em>tene* ments, </em>or all his <em>freehold lands. </em>As for instance, in the quotations from <em>Swinburne, </em>the author explains those cases, and shews, that by the word <em>tenement, </em>the testator is considered as meaning <em>frank tenement </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>or freehold, and thereby limiting the general meaning of the word lands. In this case, the testator had but , one tract of land in <em>King </em>William, except the leasehold, and the devise being of <em>all his </em>lands, in the plural, it cannot be satisfied unless the leasehold land shall be considered as passing.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-3\"><em>Warden, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aunu\">The case of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Barlett, </em>is a devise of all his lands; and the word <em>tenements </em>is not mentioned. It is true, that the Court, in giving the opinion, put the case of a devise of all a man\u2019s lands and tenements, and this is conclusive to shew, that the insertion of that word makes no difference, since they would not have decided the case under consideration, and the case stated in argument, in the same manner, if there were any thing in the word <em>tenement. </em>But this case, upon intention, is stronger than any of those cited, because here the testator not being in <em>possession </em>of the leasehold land, it is not presumable that he meant to devise it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b409-4\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A0dg\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In the case of <em>Shermer v. Shermer's executors, </em>(ante, p. 266.) the Court declared their opinion to be, that where the intention of a testator is apparent, cases to over-rule that intention must be strong, uniform, and apply directly to the case before the Court, or else they would be disregarded. If in this case, the intention appeared clear that the leasehold land should pass, the Court would give a decision according to this principle, in support of the intention ; but we can discover no such intention. The rule is laid down in <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>by all the Judges, that where a testator, having both freehold and leasehold lands in a particular place, devises all his lands in that place, only the freehold lands shall pass. Subsequent Judges and <em>Chancellors </em>have stated the rule, and uniformly decided accordingly, although in one case, the <em>Chancellor </em>acknowledged, that the testator intended the leasehold land should pass.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Thus settled, it has become a rule of property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>which the Court cannot depart from, without disturbing perhaps many titles, enjoyed under this long established principle. In this will, there are no words, or circumstances, to shew an intention, which do not appear in the case of <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Bartlett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">The Court are therefore of opinion, that the leasehold land did not pass under the clause in question to the appellee, but is comprehended within the residuary clause to the wife and children of the testator, and they reverse the decree, and remit the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
