February</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b296-4\">The act of limitations is a good plea to a suit in equity, brought to recover money collected hy an attorney for the plaintiff, and not accounted for by him.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-5\">This was an appeal from the Staunton ehancery court. Many points were made in the <em>argument; </em>but, as the court only decided <em>one </em>point, viz.: the propriety of the plea of the act of limitations, this report will be confined to that part of the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-6\">McClure, as surviving partner of Hart, Miller, &amp;c. filed a bill against Ann Kinney, &amp;c. executors of Jacob Kinney, deceased, and the devisees of the real estate, to recover a sum of money which the complainants had put into the hands of the said Jacob Kinney, as an attorney, to <em>collect; </em>and which, they alleged, he had collected, and failed to pay over to the complainants. The bill prays, that- the real estate may be subjected to the payment of the debt, in the event that the personal estate should not be sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-7\">Two receipts are exhibited, signed by Jacob Kinney, and dated in 1802, in these words : \u201c Received Jacob Swoope\u2019s assumpsit for 35l. 15s. <em>5d. </em>in part of this <em>(l </em>execution and the other : \u201c Received Jacob Swoope\u2019s \u201c assumpsit for the within sum of 289\u00cd. 4s. <em>7d. </em>in full of the within execution.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-8\">The executors disclaim all personal knowledge of the transaction stated in the bill, but admit the hand-writing of Jacob Kinney, in the receipt above mentioned. They contend, however, that the money ought to be presumed to have been paid, as it was improbable that their testator should have retained so large a sum of money, from 1802 until 1812, (the time of the testator\u2019s death.) They also plead the act of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>The cause was sent to a commissioner, to ascertain the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, who reported <em>3221. 5s. 9d. </em>to be due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-4\">The deposition of Jacob Swoope stated, that he, being indebted to Kinnerly, (the person against whom McClure &amp; Co. had obtained judgment, by Jacob Kinney, their attorney,) he agreed with Jacob Kinney, as agent of McClure &amp; Co. to pay about 8 1000 on account of Kinnerly, and in part satisfaction of the judgment which McClure, Brydie &amp; Co. had obtained against the said Kinnerly <em>\u2022, </em>that Kinney knowing the affairs of Kinnerly to be desperate, agreed to take the said Swoope\u2019s notes, payable in four and live years, without <em>interest; </em>that the said notes were paid when due, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-5\">James Bullock deposed, that, in the year 1810, he was requested by William Brown, of the firm of William Brown &amp; Co. to examine in the clerk\u2019s office of Augusta county, and see what had been done with the bonds executed by Reuben and William Kinnerly, to McClure, Brydie &amp; Co., Brydie, Brown &amp; Co., or Miller, Hart &amp; Co.; and, if possible, to get the money for those claims, given to Jacob Kinney to collect, as an attorney, many years previous: that, upon examination, he found two or three of the executions returned satisfied, or nearly so, by Kinney himself, (as well as he recollects,) as far back as 1802: that he saw Jacob Kinney on the same day, and told him of the return made upon the executions, and demanded payment: that Kinney shewed the deponent his brother Chesley Kinney\u2019s bonds, (which he had taken on account of the said debts,) and offered to deliver them to the deponent in discharge of the said claims : that the deponent refused to accept them, hut said he would take, in discharge thereof, bonds of responsible men : that, to this, Kinney made no reply, and left the deponent abruptly : that, upon seeing Kinney again, he told the deponent that if his brother did not discharge the bonds at a very early period, he would j and that he would write to Mr\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>\u00aerown uPon the subject: that the deponent met Kinney some time afterwards in Charlottesville, and mentioned the subject of those debts again ; he replied they were not collected, but would be very soon; and that he had written jjr/Brown, apprising him of the transfer, and that he would pay the debt himself, if the money was not paid by his brother very shortly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-4\">Accounts were made up by the commissioner of the administration of the personal estate, and of the value of the real estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-5\">The chancellor decreed, that the complainant should recover of the defendants the sum of 322\u00cd. <em>5s. 9d. </em>with interest from the 27\"th of March, 1802; and as it appears that the executors have disbursed all the personal estate of their testator, &amp;c., and the court being of opinion, that the real estate of the testator is subjected, by his will, to the payment of the monies aforesaid ; it is therefore decreed, that unless the defendants pay to the complainant the said sum of money, on or before the 1st day of February next, so much of the real estate shall he sold, as will be sufficient to discharge the said debt, <em>See.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b298-6\">From this decree, the defendants appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-7\">Johnson, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-8\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-9\">It was said by the appellants* counsel, that this claim was barred by the act of limitations, unless the assumpsit to James Bullock, took the case out of its operation. He contended, that the testimony of Bullock did not apply to this claim ,* and, therefore, the act was left in full operation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-10\">The counsel for the appellee answered, that Jacob Kinney was a <em>trustee </em>for the clients, whose money he had collected, and therefore the act of limitations would not apply to the case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>To this it was replied, that an attorney did not come under the description of a <em>trustee, </em>within the meaning of the rule. The situation of attornies would be truly perilous, if the act of limitations did not apply to them. They and their posterity, might be made to account, at any distance of time, for all the monies collected during their lives, when all the evidences of payment may have been lost. An attorney cannot be considered as a <em>trustee, </em>because the proper action against them, is an <em>action on the case, </em>or a <em>motion </em>under the act of Assembly, and not a bill in equity to enforce the trust. A <em>sheriff </em>is not protected by the act, only because the debt is proved by record, or covered by his bond of office. An <em>executor </em>too is a trustee, because he has the legal estate, and the legatee must bring a suit in <em>equity. </em>These cases are wholly different from that of an attorney. The testimony of Bullock, does not apply to the case before the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><em>February </em>5.</p>\n<author id=\"AW1\">Judge Brooke,</author>\n<p id=\"A2C\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The court is of opinion, that the evidence in the record, is not sufficient to repel (he plea of the acts of limitations. The decree is, therefore, reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
