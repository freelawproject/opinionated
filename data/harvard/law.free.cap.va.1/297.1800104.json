The deed appointed the 20th day of the same month for the payment of the first debt, and the 25th for the payment of the last; and provided,, that the mortgagor should hold and enjoy the subject till he should make default of payment; and that, from and after such default, the mortgagees might \u201c enter upon, have, hold, possess and enjoy,\u201d the whole subject real and personal, \u201c and receive and take the rents, issues and profits thereof, without hindrance <em>he. </em>until the debts should be fully paid off and discharged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-10\">Shortly after the execution of the mortgage, several creditors of the mortgagor (the appellee <em>Pendleton </em>was one of them) sued out writs of <em>fieri facias </em>against him, and caused them to be levied on some of the mortgaged slaves 5 and the mortgagees, in October 1819, exhibited their bill against the mortgagor, and against the creditors whose executions had been so levied, setting forth their rights under the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>gage, praying an injunction to stay further proceedings upon the executions, a foreclosure of the mortgagor\u2019s equity of redemption, and a sale of the mortgaged subject to satisfy the debts thereby secured to the mortgagees. The injunction was awarded. Some of the defendants putin answers, impeaching the mortgage as fraudulent; others, and among them, <em>Long, </em>the mortgagor, made default. And on the hearing, May 18th 1822, the chancellor decreed that, unless <em>Long </em>should pay the mortgagees the debts due to them, respectively, and the costs of the suit, within <em>six months </em>from the date of the decree, his equity of redemption in the mortgaged subject, should be foreclosed, and that the marshal of the court should sell the whole of it, <em>for </em>cash, and after defraying expenses, pay the mortgagees the debts and costs due to them, and pay the surplus if any to the mortgagor; and make report of his proceedings in order to a final decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-4\">Under this decree, the marshal sold all the mortgaged subject in June 1823, when there was a crop of wheat, oats, indian corn, and tobacco growing on the land, which had been sown and planted by <em>Long, </em>who had been allowed to retain the possession of the land, and the slaves and stock upon it, till tire day of sale.

This proceeding gave occasion to the present controversy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-6\">For <em>Crews </em>immediately exhibited his bill against <em>Pendleton </em>and Mountcasile, setting forth all the proceedings in the other suit; that he had purchased the land at the sale, with the growing crops upon it; that the proceeds of the marshal\u2019s sales had fallen far short of the amount of the debt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>secured by the mortgage; that he had with his own means finished and gathered the crops, and that they were his property, though he intended to apply the net proceeds thereof towards the satisfaction of the balance of the mortgaged debts: and praying an injunction to restrain the sheriff from selling, under <em>Pendleton </em>and <em>Mountcastle\u2019s </em>execution, the crops on which he had levied it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-4\">The injunction was awarded the 28th October 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-5\">On the 30th, <em>Pendleton, </em>on behalf of <em>Pendleton </em>and <em>Mountcastle, </em>filed an answer, in which lie denied, that <em>Crews </em>purchased the growing crops at the marshal\u2019s sale in June 1823, and insisted that they were properly taken to satisfy their execution: and he alleged, that the land was sold by the acre; that <em>Long </em>had always been permitted to hold the whole subject, both before the marshal\u2019s sale and since, to have complete control of the crops, and to sell and appropriate them to his own use; that there was a fraudulent combination between <em>Long </em>and <em>Crews </em>to defraud <em>Long\u2019s </em>other creditors; and that the debt due to <em>themselves </em>was contracted by <em>Long </em>for supplies of cloathing <em>he. </em>for the mortgaged slaves, in the year 1819. Of these allegations, no proofs were adduced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b311-6\">On the 31 st, the chancellor dissolved the injunction. And from this order, <em>Crews </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b311-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApO\">The chancellor\u2019s order dissolving the injunction in this case, could not, possibly, have been founded on the imputation contained in <em>Pendleton\u2019s </em>answer, of a fraudulent combination between <em>Crews </em>and <em>Long, </em>to defeat the just claims of <em>Long\u2019s </em>other creditors; since there is no proof in the record, nothing to justify even a suspicion, of any such fraud <em>; </em>and, since, moreover, the chancellor\u2019s own decree of foreclosure (in the first suit) in which all parties have acquiesced without complaint, plainly evinced, that, in his opinion, this charge of fraud was wholly groundless.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azee\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Nor can it be supposed, that the chancellor dissolved the injunction, under the impression, that he had no jurisdiction to interfere, in that way, with the proceedings upon Pendle<em>ton </em>and <em>Mountcastle\u2019s </em>execution. The principle of <em>Bowyer </em>v. <em>Creigh, </em>3 Rand. <em>25. </em>does not touch this case. There, an execution at the suit of one creditor, was levied on chattels that had been conveyed by the debtor to a trustee, in trust to secure a debt due to another creditor, who asked the chancellor to stay proceedings on the execution by injunction : a complete legal title was vested in the trustee; and there was nothing to prevent <em>Mm, </em>or the <em>cestui que trust, </em>who had a right to sue in his name, from vindicating his rights <em>at law. </em>But, in this case, the legal title of the property taken in execution, was not in <em>Crews </em>or in any trustee for him: he was in a court of equity, asserting his equitable lien upon the subject; the chancellor had decreed a sale of it by his marshal, whose office was only ministerial, and <em>Crews </em>was only a purchaser at the sale, which yet remained to be confirmed. The title lay at the chancellor\u2019s own disposal. He was bound to protect the purchaser of a subject sold under his decree, in the possession and enjoyment of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b312-4\">The case, then, is to be decided on its merits. Was <em>Crews </em>entitled to the crops growing on the land at the date of his purchase from the marshal ? The sale was in June. The crops then growing had been sown and planted by <em>Bong, </em>but he did the work with the slaves &amp;c. that belonged, as well as the land, to the mortgaged subject. The crops of wheat and oats were reaped and secured by <em>Crews\u2019s </em>own means: the indian corn was in an early stage, the tobacco in the earliest stage of its growth; and as tp these, especially the tobacco, the labour and expense of tillage, must have been supplied, for the most part, by the purchaser. <em>Crews </em>must be regarded as a purchaser for cash: interest on so much of the debts due on the mortgage, as the proceeds of the sales discharged, ceased immediately. It is an established rule, that a purchaser under a decree in chancery, is entitled to be let into possession from the quarter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>day preceding his purchase, he paying his money before die following one; that is, where the subject yields rents payable quarterly: if the subject yield profits settled monthly, the purchaser is entitled to the profits from the beginning of the month in which he purchased, paying the purchase money in the course of that month. Sugd. law of Vend. 41, 2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Wren </em>v. <em>Kirton, </em>8 Ves. 502. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>Cooper\u2019s Ch. Ca. 32. There are cases, which may, at first view, seem at variance with this rule; but these turned on their own peculiar circumstances, and leave the rule undisturbed. Twiggy <em>v. </em>Fifield, 13 Ves. 517. <em>Ex parte Minor, </em>11 Ves. 559. <em>Crews </em>was a purchaser for cash, under a decree foreclosing a mortgage, wherein it is expressly provided, that, in default of payment of the debt, the mortgagees may enter on the. <em>real </em>and take possession of the <em>personal </em>subject, and thenceforth take the rents, issues and profits of the whole, till their debts shall he discharged; and the profits he claims, are chiefly the fruits of labour furnished by himself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b313-5\">The appellees cannot maintain their claim to lake these crops in execution, on the ground that their debtor <em>Long </em>was entitled to them as emblements. A mortgagor in possession is, in some sort, a tenant at will or at sufferance of' the mortgagee; but not a tenant at will entitled to emblements. Emblements are given by an equitable principle of the law, in order that the tenant may not be deprived of the fruits of his industry, by the sudden and unexpected determination of his tenancy: in this case, to give <em>Crews </em>the crops, is not to deprive <em>Long of </em>them; it is the application of them to the payment of <em>Ais </em>debts, and that in pursuance of his express agreement. But of whom was <em>Long </em>the tenant at will ? of <em>Crews </em>? of the marshal ? of the court ? <em>Crews </em>had resorted to the court, to assert his equitable rights; he thenceforth had no <em>will </em>to exercise; he was to take what the chancellor should mete to him. The marshal was a mere ministerial officer, who certainly had no power, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>express grant or tacit permission to constitute <em>Long </em>his tenant upon any terms. The court, which had the whole subject at its disposal, gave <em>Long </em>a precise term of six months from the date of its decree of foreclosure : that term expired November 18th 1822. If <em>Long </em>continued to sow, without regard to the duration of the term, he was not entitled to reap.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b314-4\"><em>R. C. Nicholas </em>and <em>Scott, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWO\">If <em>Crews </em>acquired by his purchase at the marshal\u2019s sale, a right to tire growing crop, upon which, after it was severed, <em>Pendleton </em>and <em>Mountcastle\u2019s </em>execution was levied, he might have maintained <em>trover </em>for the subject, whether his right was perfect or qualified, and recovered damages commensurate with his interest; or he might have forbidden the sale, in which case the sheriff would have proceeded to sell at his own peril, unless he took an indemnifying bond; and if <em>P. </em>and <em>M. </em>gave the bond, <em>Crews </em>might have recovered upon it full satisfaction for the injury. <em>Crews, </em>then, had an adequate remedy <em>at law; </em>and the authority of <em>Bowyer </em>v. <em>Creigh </em>is in point, and conclusive, that his case is not proper for relief <em>in equity.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-5\"><em>. </em>But, <em>Crews </em>acquired, by his purchase, no right to the crops growing at the time on the land. The rule of the english court of chancery, referred to by <em>Mr. Johnson, </em>can rarely be applicable, in this country, where lands are seldom let out upon leases, rendering a certain rent, payable at stated times; and can hardly, by any ingenuity, be adapted to the present case. This is a case that stands on its own peculiar circumstances. The decree of foreclosure gave <em>Crews </em>a right to require the sale of the mortgaged subject, immediately after the 18th November 1822; and <em>Long </em>was entitled to hold the subject, until the marshal should make sale of it under the decree. The. mortgagees had perfect control over the sale: the marshal was bound to proceed when they required him to do so, and was not bound to proceed until so required. <em>Long,, </em>then, was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>fact left in the possession and enjoyment of the subject from November to June, by permission of the mortgagees: he had their consent to employ, in sowing and planting the crop, the slaves &amp;c. which were mortgaged to them: he devoted to the tillage his own industry also, which was not mortgaged. The general creditors of <em>Long </em>have certainly a right to have the fruits of his industry applied to the satisfaction of their just <em>demands; </em>but these, with the acquiescence and by the permission of the mortgagees, have been inseparably mingled with the profits of the mortgaged subject. <em>Crews </em>is asking now, not only the profits of the mortgaged subject, but the profits of <em>Long\u2019s </em>industry. He does not ask, that his rights as purchaser of the subject, shall relate back to a quarter day from which <em>rent </em>began to accrue : he asks the court to attach those rights to the subject from the time when <em>Long, </em>with his own permission, sowed the crop.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b315-4\"><em>Long </em>was strictly entitled to the growing crops, as emblements. A mortgagor in possession, <em>after default of </em>pay<em>ment, </em>is a tenant at the will of the mortgagee: much more is a mortgagor in possession, after <em>a decree of </em>foreclosure, which the mortgagee may enforce when he pleases, tenans at will of the mortgagee. Why should not he, as well as any other tenant at will, he entitled to emblements ? The only reason suggested, is, that the proceeds of the growing crops are to he applied to the payment of the debts secured by the mortgage. But <em>Crews </em>claims the crops as his own; and it is only as a favour to the mortgagor, or the other mortgagees, that he declares his intention to apply them to the reduction of the debts. He cannot exercise his bounty at the expense of <em>Long\u2019s </em>other creditors. He can only claim as a purchaser at the sale : he cannot fortify that claim, by uniting with it his original claim as a mortgagee. If any other person had been the purchaser, could he have availed himself of <em>Crews\u2019s </em>sudden determination <em>o\u00ed Long\u2019s </em>tenancy at w:ll, and claim the growing crops ? If not, neither can <em>Crews,</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuHm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>If <em>Long </em>was entitled to the growing crops, the appellees execution was rightly levied on <em>them. </em>In all events, they are entitled to have the profits accruing from those crops, apportioned between <em>Long </em>and <em>Crews, </em>and to have <em>Long's </em>portion of them, applied to the satisfaction of their claim against him.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\"><em> Ingraham\u2019s </em>edition, <em>Philadelphia, </em>1820.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b316-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AnlJ\"><em>The </em>order <em>of </em>dissolution does not state the ground on which the chancellor proceeded : it must have been, either, 1. that he had no jurisdiction; or <em>2. </em>that there was fraud; or 3. that the purchase of <em>Crews </em>gave him no right to the growing crops.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Upon the ground of fraud, I can hardly suppose the chancellor acted. His decree in the first suit (acquiesced in by all, and to which the appellee <em>Pendleton </em>is stated to have been a party) had pronounced the mortgage fair, decreed their debts to the mortgagees, and ordered a sale. If the allegations in the answer of the use by <em>Long </em>of the crops, of his continued possession, and of a fraudulent combination between him and <em>Crews, </em>had raised suspicions in the mind of the chancellor, of the fairness of the transactions subsequent to the decree j he surely would not have taken these <em>allegations </em>(not responsive to the bill) as <em>proofs, </em>but would have given time for the taking of evidence. He would not have dissolved the injunction the very day after it was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">As to the question of jurisdiction (though few are more jealous of equity on this point than I am) I think there can be no doubt about it. The chancellor had decreed a sale of the mortgaged property: under that sale, <em>Crews </em>had bought, and received possession from the officer of the court: the whole matter was still pending. If the marshal had made his report, the court had not acted upon it. The order of sale did not authorise the marshal to make a deed to the purchaser, but merely to sell for cash, pay the debts due the mortgagees, and report his proceedings to the court. <em>Crews's </em>purchase did not give him the legal title till the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>chancellor should confirm the sale, and a' deed should be made to him. Till this was done, it was the bounden duly of the court, to protect the purchaser. In contemplation of law, the property was still in possession of the court. The application to the chancellor, then, was the natural and proper resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">With respect to the growing crops, the question does not seem to me to involve the general doctrine of emblements, Tout to depend on the particular contract of the parties. There can be no doubt, that if one sell his land without any reserve, all the crops, not severed, will pass to the purchaser. They are a part of the subject, and enter into the price. The contract between the mortgagor and mortgagees is, in effect, this: \u201cI convey you my land, slaves &amp;c. as a security for the debts J owe you ; I bind myself to pay you those debts by a given time, and if I fail, you may proceed, and get a decree for a sale of the subject; meantime, I remain in possession, use the slaves, and take the profits of the land 5 but, whenever you get a decree, you may immediately sell every thing.\u201d Under this agreement, if the mortgagor goes on and makes preparation for a crop, he does it with a full knowledge, that the land with the crop is subject to be sold, if the decree be obtained before he severs it. Nor does he lose any thing by this: for the crop on the land enhances the price; if by this increase, the debt be overpaid, he gets the overplus; if not, still the full value of his labour goes (as he had agreed it should go) to the payment of the debts secured by the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In this case, such a result seems the more just, as the crop was prepared with the mortgaged slaves, and as (the sale being in dune) a great portion of the labour in producing, gathering, and saving the crop, was performed by the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">The other judges concurred: and the decree was reversed, and the cause remanded, that the injunction might be reinstated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
