The declaration in its com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>mei1cemen^ describes the action to be \u00ab a plea of breach of covenant.\u201d It then states that the said Tripletts, by their writing obligatory, <em>covenanted and agreed, </em>for the hire of two negro men, to pay to the said Micou g 360, to be discharged by g 180, and to return the negroes well clothed. It concludes thus, <em>\u201c </em>and the said Micou, in fact \u00ab saith, that the said Tripletts, although often required, \u201c did not pay to him the said Micou, the sum of $ 180, \u00ab on or before the first of January, 1818, or return the \u00ab said negroes well clothed, as he stipulated to <em>do; </em>but \u00ab <em>his </em>said undertaking to perforin constantly refused, and \u201c still <em>doth </em>refuse; wherefore, an action hath accrued to \u00ab the said Micou to have of the said Tripletts, the penalty \u201c of g 360, and damages -g , and therefore be sues.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-4\">The suit abated as to Daniel Triplett by his death, and the appearance bail of the surviving defendant pleaded payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">On the trial, the jury found a verdict to the following effect: \u00ab that the surviving defendant hath not paid to the \u00ab plaintiff the debt in the declaration mentioned, as the \u00ab plaintiff by replying <em>hath alleged ; and </em>they do allow \u201c on the said debt, interest from the first day of January, \u00ab1818, till paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">The court gave judgment for g 360 and <em>costs, to </em>he discharged by the payment of g 180 with interest, &amp;c. and the defendant Philip Triplett obtained a supersedeas,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-7\"><em>Nicholas, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-8\"><em>Selden, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-9\">Two objections wTere made by the counsel for the ap_ pellant: 1. That the declaration is in <em>covenant, </em>and the proceedings in <em>debt: </em>That part of the demand which relates to returning the negroes well clothed, clearly belongs to <em>covenant, </em>and not <em>debt. </em>But the judgment is for the <em>penalty. </em>This can only be applicable to an action of <em>debt-</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number><em>2. </em>The verdict only finds, that the <em>surviving </em>defendant did not pay, without saying any thing of the <em>deceased </em>defendant.<footnotemark>(<em>a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aps\">For the appellee, it was said, that the declaration, tho\u2019 informal, was good after verdict. The character of the action is not fixed by the <em>conclusion </em>of the declaration, but by its general frame and structure. The averment of the breach relates to both the defendants. If the breach is co-extensive with the condition of the bond, it is sufficient. <em>Payment </em>is a good plea in covenant.<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> None of the cases support the objection to the verdict.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\"> See the eases of Buckner and wife vs. Blair, 2 Munf. 336 Green <em>vs. </em>Dulany, 2 Munf. 518.

The suit abated, as to one of the de~ fendants, and the appearance bail of the other defendant pleaded payment; to which there was a general replication. The verdict finds, that the surviving defendant bath not paid the debt in the declaration mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Passing by the objection, that the verdict does not respond to the charge for clothing, (it being most beneficial to the appellant,) the court is of opinion, that it is defective in this, that it does not negative the payment of the money by the deceased defendant, which, upon the plea, was within the issue. The judgment is therefore reversed <em>; </em>and this court proceeding, &amp;c. a new trial is awarded, and the cause sent back for further proceedings to be bad therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b283-11\"> Judge Cabell absent</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
