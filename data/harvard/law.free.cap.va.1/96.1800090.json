After the death of <em>the </em>grantees <em>James </em>and <em>John Christian, </em>(whereby the whole land survived to <em>Brown) Charles </em>and <em>John Christian, </em>sons of the grantee <em>John, </em>presented a petition to the governor, for the whole tract, as lapsed and forfeited for non-payment of quit rents. The general court, in April \u201974, gave <em>judgment for the </em>petitioners, that the lands were forfeited and re-vested in the crown, and ordered it to be certified to the governor. In October \u201977, the petitioners <em>Charles </em>and <em>John Christian, </em>conveyed and delivered possession of 933 acres of the land to <em>James Gresham. Gresham, </em>in August \u201987, <em>conveyed </em>and delivered possession of 433 acres, parcel of the 933 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>iteres, to <em>Thomas Powell; </em>he died in \u201988, intestate; and <em>Mrs. Camm, </em>and <em>Mrs. Warwick </em>were his daughters and heirs. The tract of <em>433 </em>acres was the land claimed in the ejectment. <em>Camm and wife </em>and <em>Warwick- and wife, </em>and those they claimed under, had been in possession of it from \u201974 till 1800, when <em>JYorvell </em>entered and ousted them. <em>JYorvell </em>had obtained a grant for land, including about 330 of the 433 acres, founded on a land office treasury warrant, entered in September \u201994, surveyed in November \u201995, and granted by patent dated November \u201997. Upon this state of facts, the district court gave judgment for the heirs of <em>Powell, Mrs. Camm </em>and <em>Mrs. Warwick; </em>and, on an appeal taken by <em>JYorvell </em>to this court, the judgment was affirmed, in May 1811, on the single ground, that the long possession, which had been held by the heirs of <em>Powell, </em>and those they claimed under, gave them title to recover in <em>ejectment. Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, &amp;c. </em>2 Munf. 257.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-4\"><em>Norvell </em>then brought a <em>writ of right </em>for the tract of 433 acres of land, against <em>Camm and wife </em>and <em>Warwick and wife; </em>upon the trial of which, the titles under which both parties claimed being exhibited, the circuit court instructed the jury, that, as the land had been once granted by patent in \u201955, though it had been adjudged forfeited and lapsed, by the general court in \u201974, and though no new patent had been granted to the petitioners, at whose suit it was so forfeited, yet it <em>was not toaste and unappropriated land, subject to be taken up by a treasury warrant; </em>and, therefore, the patent granted to <em>JYorvell </em>in November \u201997, was void. The jury, under this instruction, found a verdict for the tenants, and the court gave them judgment. <em>JYorvell </em>appealed. And a <em>special </em>court of appeals, in December 1818, held, that <em>JYorvell\u2019s </em>patent, being on its face fair and regular, could not be thus impugned, collaterally and by extrinsick evidence, but only by suit in equity to set it aside, or some other proceeding having <em>that </em>for its direct object; and that patent must prevail, except against an elder one: therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the judgment was reversed, and a new trial directed. <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, &amp;c. </em>6 Munf. 233.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AaT\">Upon the second trial in the circuit court, the tenants forbore to exhibit their title : they merely offered evidence of long and continued possession, in themselves and those under whom they claimed, payment of quit-rents Sic. to lead to the presumption of a patent prior to that under which <em>Norvell </em>claimed. And <em>Norvell, </em>first, to establish his own title, exhibited his patent of November \u201997, and another patent dated June 1813, with parol evidence to shew that those patents included all the land in controversy; and, then, for the purpose of repelling the presumption of a prior grant to those under whom die tenants claimed, or any of them, he gave in evidence the record of the <em>ejectment </em>first above mentioned, wherein the special verdict set forth the true state of the title under which the tenants claimed, and excluded all presumption of any patent prior to his own. And he set forth all the evidence, that adduced by the tenants as well as that adduced by himself, in a demurrer to evidence, which he tendered ; but the tenants refused, and the court would not compel them, to join in it. To this <em>Norvell </em>filed exceptions. Upon the evidence set forth in the demurrer to evidence, several questions of fact arose: Whether <em>Norvell'\u2019s </em>entries were made on the land held by the tenants ? Whether the patents under which he claimed, covered it ? &amp;tc. There was a general verdict and judgment for the tenants. <em>Norvell </em>again appealed. And another <em>special </em>court of appeals, in December 1823, declaring that the judgment of the former special court, 6 Munf. 233. was the law of, and no longer questionable in, this case, held that the circuit court ought to have compelled the tenants to join in <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>demurrer to evidence; and, therefore, reversed the judgment, and remanded the cause, with directions that the verdict should be set aside, and the tenants compelled to join in the demurrer. <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, &amp;c. </em>2 Rand. 68.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">In February 1824, the case of <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>(Id. 353.) was decided by the <em>regular </em>court of appeals; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>wherein the heirs of <em>John Christian, </em>in <em>ejectment </em>brought against <em>Whittington, </em>claimed 1000 acres of the 3926 acres of land, granted by the patent of September \u201955, to <em>James Christian, John Christian </em>and <em>William Brown: </em>they claimed under <em>John Christian, </em>the son of <em>John </em>the original patentee, and one of the petitioners, at whose suit the general court, in \u201974, had declared the patent of \u201955 forfeited. <em>Whittington </em>claimed under <em>JVorvell, </em>who claimed this tract of 1000 acres, under three patents, dated in \u201997, upon surveys made in \u201995 and \u20199(i, and who, and those claiming under him, had held the land ever since. In this case, then, the same questions arose, which were presented in the case of <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, </em>6 Munf. 233. and which were then decided <em>in favour </em>of <em>JVorvell: </em>Whether the land in question, having been granted in \u201955, and having been after-wards, in \u201974, adjudged forfeited and re-vested in the crown, was waste and unappropriated land subject to location on a treasury warrant ? if not, Whether, nevertheless, the commonwealth\u2019s legal title therein passed to <em>Norvell, </em>by virtue of the patents granted to him in \u201997 ? And the court upon the fullest consideration, decided botli points <em>against JVorvell : </em>it held, moreover, that the petitioners, at whose suit, in \u201974, the lands were adjudged forfeited by the original patentees of \u201955, and their heirs or assignees, were even now entitled, by right of preemption, to claim grants for the lands so forfeited, and that such grants, when issued, would relate back to the date of the original patents of \u201955.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfK\">Immediately, after the first decision of the <em>special </em>court of appeals in <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, </em>6 Munf. 233. <em>Warwick and wife </em>and <em>Mrs. Camm </em>(her husband was now dead) preferred their petition to the superiour court of chancery of <em>Lynchburg, </em>setting forth the rights under which they claimed ; charging, that <em>Norvell's </em>grant of November \u201997, embracing the tract of 433 acres (or part of it) claimed and held by him, was fraudulently, surreptitiously and illegally obtained, upon the false suggestion, that the land thereby granted was waste and unappropriated land, subject to loca<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tion and grant upon treasury warrant; and praying a <em>scire facias </em>and <em>certiorari, </em>to have the patent certified to the court, examined, and repealed. And, in May 1824, after the second decision of the <em>special </em>court of appeals in <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, </em>2 Rand. 68. remanding that case to the circuit court, and after the contrary decision in <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>Id. 353. they exhibited their bill in the same court of chancery, setting forth a <em>full </em>history of the controversies at law between <em>them, </em>and <em>Norvell, </em>and all the facts which had been developed in the progress of them; the pendency of <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>writ of right in the circuit court, then standing on his demurrer to evidence; the points presented by the demurrer; the principle settled by the judgments of the two <em>special </em>courts of appeals, in <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, </em>as the law of that particular case, no longer to be questioned, that Nor<em>vell\u2019s </em>patents cannot be impugned at law, but are only voidable in equity; and the direct opposite principle settled by the <em>regular </em>court of appeals in <em>Whittington v. Christian, </em>as the law of the land, that those patents are not only voidable in equity, but void at law: charging, that <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>patents of November \u201997 and June 1813 were obtained fraudulently, surreptitiously, illegally, and upon false suggestion : and praying, that the patent of November \u201997 might be examined and repealed by the chancellor; that, mean while, <em>Norvell </em>might be injoined from farther proceedings on his writ of right in the circuit court, till the subject could be examined and determined in equity; and that the court might order a new trial of the mise joined in the writ of right, wherein <em>Norvell </em>should be inhibited from using that patent in support of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">The injunction was awarded, the 21st May 1824.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Agr\"><em>Norvell, </em>in Ms answer, denied, that his patents had been obtained fraudulently, surreptitiously, illegally, and upon false suggestion. He stated some matters of fact, which (he said) had not been heretofore adduced, in the trials of the suits at law, and which evinced his innocence of any actual fraud; and he referred to the records of three other controversies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>he had had (besides those that had been brought by appeal to the court of appeals) concerning the validity and regularity of the patents he had obtained, for the lands included in the patent of \u201955 to the two <em>Christians </em>and <em>Brown, </em>all of which were determined in his favour; and, alleging that the plaintiffs <em>here, </em>were privies to the parties <em>there, </em>he insisted that those decisions concluded the main question, whether the lauds thereby granted to him, were'in point of law subject to location and grant upon treasury warrants. But, if this question were still open, he insisted, that the lands granted by the patent of \u201955, adjudged by the general court in \u201974 to be lapsed, forfeited, and re-vested in the crown, but not re-granted to the petitioners at whose suit the forfeiture was declared, were lands subject to location and grant upon treasury warrant, under the land laws, at the time the grants thereof to him emanated : in short, he controverted the opinion of the court of appeals, on this point, in <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-4\">This answer was filed the 9th May 1825, and on the 21st of the same month, <em>Norvell </em>moved the court to dissolve the injunction; on which the chancellor took time to advise till the next term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">A general replication to the answer, was put in at the rules, 25th May 1825; and commissions for taking depositions were awarded to both parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\">No depositions were filed by either.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">The plaintiffs exhibited the record of <em>Norvell's </em>writ of right against them, which contained the record of their previous ejectment against him. The defendant exhibited the record of a suit in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Richmond, </em>in which <em>John </em>and <em>Charles Christian </em>were plaintiffs and <em>Norvell </em>defendant, and in which some of the grants obtained by <em>Norvell </em>for parcels of the 3926 acres granted by the patent of \u201955, were impeached, and the lands claimed by <em>John </em>and <em>Charles Christian, </em>as in justice their property; and their hill was dismissed in September 1807. And that record contained two other records; the one of a <em>caveat </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>prosecuted by <em>Charles Christian </em>against <em>Norvell, </em>in <em>th</em>e district court of <em>Charlottesville, </em>to prevent the issuing of a grant to him of the very parcel of land (it appeared) for which he afterwards obtained the patent of November \u201997, validity of which was now controverted by <em>Warwick and wife </em>and <em>Camm, </em>which <em>caveat </em>was dismissed in September \u20199<em>7, </em>the other, the record of a <em>caveat </em>prosecuted by <em>Norvell </em>against <em>John Christian, </em>in the same district court, to prevent the issuing of a grant to him of the 1000 acres of land (it appeared) that was in controversy in <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, </em>on which <em>caveat </em>judgment was given for <em>Norvell </em>in April \u201999.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\">At the rules in September 1825, this cause was regularly set for hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-9\">And, at the ensuing October term, the chancellor made the following interlocutory order; \u201c This day came the parties by their counsel, and the court having maturely considered the premises and the arguments of counsel, doth order, that the injunction awarded the plaintiffs in this cause (<em>Warwick and wife </em>and Camm) on the 21st May 1824, to restrain the defendant (Norvell) his agents &amp;c. from further proceeding in the action instituted by him against them, in the circuit court of <em>Amherst </em>and by the judge of that court removed to the circuit court of <em>Lynchburg, </em>stand dissolved, as an act of this day, unless the plaintiffs shall at the next term of the circuit court of <em>Lynchburg, </em>confess a judgment for the 433 acres of land in the bill mentioned, as claimed by them, or so much thereof as may be comprised in the defendant\u2019s grant sought by the present bill to be repealed.\u201d From this order <em>Warwick and wife </em>and <em>Camm </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-10\">The cause was argued by <em>Johnson, </em>for the appellants, and <em>Stanard, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-11\">I. <em>Johnson </em>pressed the court, very earnestly, to enter into a consideration of tire merits of the cause, and put an end to this long protracted controversy. All the materials for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>forming a judgment upon the merits, were in the record, and were before the chancellor at the time he made the interlocutory order: the parties had filed no depositions in the long interval allowed them for the purpose; it was obvious, neither had any parol evidence to adduce; all their evidence was documentary, and contained in their exhibits. And though a motion to dissolve the injunction, was made at May term 1825, which the chancellor took time to consider till the next term, yet before the next term the cause had been set for hearing, and stood then for hearing: therefore, the chancellor ought to have taken it up as upon a hearing, instead of taking it up on the motion to dissolve the injunction. But, even if he was right in taking it up, <em>on the motion, </em>the motion itself presented the merits to him for decision; for <em>Norvell </em>had moved for a dissolution of the injunction, generally, not for a conditional dissolution unless judgment should be confessed in his action at law. If the chancellor might and ought to have decided the merits, this court may and ought to do so. Besides, this court has often, in cases where the merits of a controversy were really open to full view, though not in point of form regularly before it, availed itself of the opportunity to express its opinion upon them, and thus to put an end to further expensive and vexatious litigation'; and if this were ever proper in any case, it was proper in this. lie, therefore, proceeded to examine, succinctly, the main point in controversy, the regularity and validity of <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>patent of \u201997; and shewed, that the decision of <em>Norvell </em>v. <em>Camm, 6 </em>Munf. 233. determined that it was examinable, and might be annulled, in equity; and that the solemn decision of <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Christian, 2 </em>Rand. 353. condemned it as void.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-4\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABpz\">did not wholly decline the discussion of the merits; but he said, it was improper to discuss them; for they wore not now before the court. The chancellor had not considered them, or made any decree touching them. His order only settled a point of practice. The sole province of this court was to revise that order; its juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>diction was altogether <em>appellate; </em>and if, instead of revising the order the chancellor made, the order appealed from, this court should decide upon matters, on which the chancellor did not decide, but on the contrary carefully avoided the decision of, it would exercise original, not appellate, jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-4\">II. As to the conditional order dissolving the injunction, <em>Johnson </em>insisted, that the chancellor ought not, in such a case as this, to have imposed upon the plaintiffs in equity, 'the condition that they should confess judgment in the action at law. <em>Warwick </em>and <em>Camm </em>had a right to have the validity of <em>Norvell's </em>patent, upon which alone <em>he </em>could sustain his claim at law, examined in equity, where only it was examinable, without relinquishing any grounds of defence, wholly distinct from the merits of the patent, which might avail them at law. The bill in equity impeached <em>Norvell\u2019s </em>title: but the chancellor would not entertain them there, for that purpose, unless they would surrender their <em>own: </em>thus giving to a holder of a patent, impugned as surreptitiously and illegally obtained, the advantage of avoiding every other difficulty, and every objection to his claim, save only the objection to the regularity of the patent, and of avoiding to\u00f3, the merits of his adversary\u2019s independent claim of title; and laying a party seeking, upon equitable grounds, to prevent his opponent from using a <em>wrongful </em>patent against him at law, under the necessity of foregoing any and every rightful defence he might have, available to him at law, triable only at law, and wholly distinct from the matters preferred to the court of equity as grounds for relief. This was, in effect, to deny the plaintiffs their remedy in equity, not upon condition that they should wave their legal remedy for the same right, but that they should wave other rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-5\">If the matters preferred to equity for relief against proceedings at law, be the sole ground on which the party praying such relief, claims right, the chancellor ought to require him to abandon his defence at law, by a confession of judgment ; but if, besides the grounds for relief in equity, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>have distinct and substantive grounds of defence at law, not . i,- . cognizable m equity, he ought not to be required to confess judgment at law. Suppose one action of debt brought on several bonds, and the defendant to have complete defence at law as to all but one of the bonds, and, as to that, to prefer his bill in equity, alleging that it was obtained of him by fraud, and praying a discovery of the fraud, an inhibition to make use of the fraudulent bond at law, and a stay of proceedings at law till this matter can be heard in equity: must he, in order to entitle himself to this equity, confess judgment for all the debts claimed of him in the action at law ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">In the practice of the english chancery, where relief is asked against a claim asserted at law, and no defence available at law is pretended, the chancellor does not injoin the proceeding in the action to judgment: his injunction inhibits execution on the judgment when obtained. But when it is the object of the bill in equity, to obtain matter of defence to be used at law, the court stays the proceedings in the action at law. 1 Madd.

The chancellor\u2019s order of dissolution required <em>Warwick and wife </em>and <em>Camm </em>to confess judgment for that part of the land covered by the first patent: for the part of the land claimed under the last patent, <em>Norvell </em>was left to get judgment if and when he can. So, if this order be complied with, two judgments must be rendered at law; one for one parcel on the tenants\u2019 confession, and another for the other parcel, for the demandant or for the tenants, according to the judgment of the court as to the right; which would be irregular and anomalous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Are\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>Stanard </em>said, that as to the difficulty of rendering two judgments m the same action at law, there would be the same difficulty in suing out two executions on the same judgment, one immediately for the part as to which no relief was asked in equity, the other after the decree in equity, for the part as to which relief was sought there, if the decree should deny the relief. [<em>Green, </em>J. said, a question of this kind was considered in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Beck, </em>3 Rand. 316. and his opinion then was, that, upon a partial <em>cognovit actionem, </em>no judgment ought to be rendered till the whole should be tried, and then one judgment given as to the whole.] <em>Stanard </em>said, the chancellor had, in truth, done more for the plaintiffs than he ought, in allowing them to confess judgment in part: he ought to have required them to confess judgment for the whole.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akc\">The bill in this case was hot a bill for the discovery of matters to be used as a defence in the action at law; it was a bill for substantive relief in equity, upon equitable grounds, with a view to use, not facts discovered, but the relief obtained upon them in equity, as a defence at law. On bills for discovery of matter to be used on a trial at law, the proceedings at law may be stayed, till the discovery be obtained in equity; but in such bills, there should be no prayer for substantive relief; if there be, the bill is demurrable for that cause. On a bill for relief in equity against a claim asserted at law, there was no instance of an <em>injunction </em>awarded to prevent the plaintiff at law from proceeding to trial and judgment. And the authorities cited for' the appellants, all shewed, that whenever a party resorts to a court of equity, for substantive relief against a claim asserted at law, he must submit himself to the jurisdiction of the chancellor, <em>intirelp </em>and without reserve: if he ask relief in equity, <em>after </em>judgment at law, the chancellor invariably requires, as the condition of his interference, a release of errors at law; if <em>before </em>judgment, a confession of judgment, which is a release of errors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>He denied the propriety, in this case, of granting any injunction to prevent the plaintiffs at law from proceeding to trial and judgment, or, indeed, that there was any reason or occasion for one.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b119-3\">\n<em>Per curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AcY\">Although the cause was set for hearing <em>after </em>the motion to dissolve the injunction, and <em>before </em>the conditional order dissolving it (which is the order appealed from), the cause has not been heard in the court of chancery on its merits; and either party has yet the right to produce new evidence.

Chan. 132. Nor is there any thing in the peculiar circumstances of this case, to take it out of the rule. Indeed, it does not appear, that there was any cause for an injunction, except to restrain the defendant in equity, after judgment obtained by him at law, from turning the tenants out of possession, before the validity of the patent on which his legal title depended, shall he examined and decided on, in the court of chancery; and the relief, <em>after </em>the confession of judgment, will be as ample as in ordinary cases.
