The judgment creditors, <em>Mitchell, </em>and <em>Dunn, </em>the assignee of the judgment, and <em>Shiphard, </em>the executor, were made parties defendants; and the bill prayed that <em>Shiphard </em>should be ordered to render an account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>his administration; that the real estate remaining unsold, should be sold, and that the proceeds of the real, as well as of the personal estate, should be applied to the satisfaction of the debt, for their relief; that meantime, the creditors should be enjoined from proceeding to make sale of the plaintiffs as slaves; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-4\">The injunction was awarded May 23. 1826, upon condition that the plaintiffs should remain in custody of the officer, till otherwise ordered by the chancellor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\"><em>Dunn, </em>in his answer, insisted, .that the plaintiffs, if they had right, had a complete remedy at law, and therefore the case was not properly relievable in equity: and, further, that the will of <em>Campbell </em>did not emancipate the slaves in question; that the deeds of the executor were ineffectual to emancipate them, because they were not recorded according to the statute; and that if they were emancipated, they were yet subject to the testator <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>debts by the express provisions of the statute: that, as to the six years\u2019 freedom they had enjoyed, they claimed that state under <em>unrecorded </em>deeds which could not confer freedom; and, by failing to record the deeds, had contrived to remain in Virginia, unquestioned, contrary to the laws which forbid any slaves emancipated to remain here more than a year; their residence was a fraud upon the law; and if they were emancipated, they were for this cause liable to be sold by the officers of the commonwealth, for the benefit of the literary' fund: Nevertheless, if there was any other property of the testator <em>Campbell, </em>applicable to this debt, and sufficient for the payment of it, the defendant would gladly take his satisfaction out of that; but he knew of none.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-6\"><em>Mitchell </em>answered, that the judgment had been assigned to <em>Dunn </em>for valuable consideration; and insisted on the legal rights of the creditors of <em>Campbell, </em>to demand satisfaction out of his .property, whatever disposition he might make of it by his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-7\">At June term 1826, before the executor, <em>Shiphard, </em>had answered, the other defendants moved the court to dissolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>the injunction. Chancellor <em>Taylor </em>was of opinion, that the plaintiffs were emancipated by <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>will, which was duly recorded: that the executor\u2019s deeds of emancipation were only evidence of his solemn assent to this legacy of freedom: that the first judgment of <em>Mitchell </em>against the executor, was recovered in May 1821, after the actual emancipation, and was a judgment of assets <em>guando acciderint; </em>so that the creditors, as well as executor, then considered the plaintiffs free: that the creditors had allowed them to enjoy their freedom undisturbed for five years; and the time which had thus elapsed, if it was not in itself a complete bar to the proceeding of the defendants, yet taken in connexion with the statutes on the subject, and in aid of the other circumstances of the case, was a protection to the plaintiffs: and that the plaintiffs would have had a right to bo discharged upon <em>habeas corpus. </em>Therefore, he overruled the motion to dissolve the injunction, declared the plaintiffs free, and ordered, that they should he discharged; and, being under an impression that they had not been properly advised as to their duty to remove from the state, he gave them six months from the date of the decree, to remove &amp;tc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\"><em>Dunn </em>prayed an appeal from the decree, which the chancellor refused to allow; but on his petition, an appeal was allowed him by a judge of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b481-5\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOR\">contended, 1. That if the appellees claimed freedom under <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>will taken alone, the will was not so made or so proved as to confer freedom, since the statute required, that such a will, in like manner as any other instrument of emancipation, should be sealed and proved by two witnesses, meaning attesting witnesses. 2. That if the will was duly made and recorded, yet it did not of itself emancipate the slaves; it only directed the executor to emancipate them; and rightly left the act to be done by him, for it depended on the situation of the estate with respect to creditors to be ascertained by the executor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>whether any act of emancipation could avail. 3. That the appellees must claim under the deeds of the executor; and these deeds not being recorded, were wholly nugatory; <em>Givens </em>v. <em>Manns, </em>6 Munf. 191. <em>Lewis v. Fullerton, 1 </em>Rand. 15. But, 4. Whether they were emancipated or not, and if emancipated, whether by the testator\u2019s will, or by the executor\u2019s deeds, they were, by the express provision of the 54th section of the statute, liable for the testator\u2019s debts, and liable too, <em>to be taken in execution to satisfy them; </em>which differed this case from the common case of a specific legacy assented to by an executor and in the legatee\u2019s hands, which creditors could only reach with the aid of a court of chancery. 5. That, as to the lapse of time, that could not affect the case; there was no such lapse of time as barred the creditor\u2019s remedy against <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>estate, and these appellees were, so far as creditors are concerned, part of his estate, and liable for any claim for which any other part of it wa's liable. 6. He questioned the jurisdiction of the chancellor to intei-pose in such a case as this, where there was a plain remedy at law; since, if the appellees were emancipated, at all, whether by the will or by the executor\u2019s deeds, their right to freedom was a legal right, which required no assistance from equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-5\"><em>Scott, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asn\">said, that though a will emancipating slaves ought to be duly made and duly proved and recorded, yet it was to be made and proved like other wills; and, in <em>Virginia, </em>even a will of lands need not be attested by subscribing witnesses, if proved to be wholly in the testator\u2019s band-writing, as was the case here: the sealing of the act of emancipation, and the proof by two witnesses is only required where the emancipation is by deed. He insisted, that the appellees were emancipated by the will; for the will contained devises and bequests to them as free persons. The executor was only to give them the formal instrument, which should signify his assent to the legacy; and, as <em>he </em>ought to have had this instrument recorded, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>very defect was properly relievablo in equity, and was enough of itself to give the court of chancery jurisdiction, But there could be no question as to the jurisdiction: the chancellor may interfere to prevent a sale of slaves under execution, at the instance of the owner complaining that they are not liable for the debt; much more may he interfere to prevent the sale of persons claiming to be free. But these people, though completely and regularly emancipated, were yet liable to the claim of the appellant against their testator, unless by his own conduct he had lost his right to hold them subject to the claim. He first took a judgment against the executor <em>when assets, </em>in May 1821. Upon a <em>sci.fa. </em>suggesting assets, he recovered judgment <em>de bonis testatoris, </em>in November 1822; and, instead of diligently pursuing the executor, and charging him and his sureties with a <em>devastavit, he </em>waited till June 182G, and then levied his execution on these persons, who had been actually free ever since January 1820. Meantime, the executor, who ought to pay the debt, may have become insolvent; and the appellant who ought to have anticipated such insolvency by the diligence of his proceedings, ought to bear the loss of his debt, rather than that the appellees, who could take no steps against the executor, should sustain the loss of their freedom.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\"> The statutory provisions affecting this case, are the 53d and 54th sections of the statute concerning slaves, free negroes and mulattoes (1 Rev. Code, ch. 111. pp. 433, 4.) which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201c \u00a7 53. It shall be lawful for any person, <em>by his or her last will and testament, or by any other instrument in writing, under his or her hand and seal, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>attested and proved, </em>in the county or corporation court, <em>by two witnesses, </em>or <em>acknowledged by the party </em>in the court of the county where he or she resides, to emancipate and set free his or her slaves, or any of them, who shall thereupon be entirely and fully discharged from the performance of any contract entered into during servitude, and enjoy as full freedom as if they had been particularly named and freed by this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\"><em>\u201c </em>\u00a7 54. Provided, <em>nevertheless, </em>That' all slaves so emancipated shall be liable <em>to be taken by execution, to satisfy any debt contracted by the person emancipating them, before such emancipation is made.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b483-5\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ar07\">delivered the opinion of the court. It was, unquestionably, the intention of the testator <em>Campbell </em>to emancipate the appellees; and his will is sufficient for that purpose, although it is not sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">It is not important to inquire, whether the will, <em>ipso facto, </em>emancipated the appellees, or whether that object remained to be accomplished by formal deeds to be executed by the executor. For the mere intention of the testator that the executor should emancipate them, conferred a right to freedom, which, though it could not be asserted in a court of law, ought to be enforced in a court of equity. <em>Dempsey </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>Gilm. 333.</p>\n<p id=\"AqWh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>But the right to emancipate slaves is subordinate to the obligation to pay debts previously contracted, by the express provisions of the statute. Admitting, therefore, that the will, in this case, conferred as perfect an emancipation as any known to our laws, still the appellees remained liable to the payment of <em>Campbell\u2019s </em>debts; and although the assent of the executor to their emancipation, might possibly protect them from an execution at law (a point which need not he decided) in like manner as his assent to the bequest of a personal chattel, would exempt that chattel from a similar execution, yet the assent of an executor to any legacy, can never defeat the right of a creditor to pursue, in a court of equity, the assets of a testator, in the hands of the legatee, if necessary for the payment of his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">In this case, therefore, an account ought to be taken of the assets, both real and persona], of <em>Campbell, </em>(for we are of opinion, that the will subjected the real estate to the payment of his debts), and of the administration thereof by the executor; and if it shall appear that the debts of the testator can be satisfied without resort to the value of the appellees, then the appellees should be considered and declared free; hut if that cannot be wholly accomplished, then the appellees should be sold for such term of years as may he sufficient to raise the adequate fund; as was directed in the case of <em>Patty </em>v. <em>Colin, </em>1 Hen. Munf. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The decree of the chancellor is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded to be proceeded in according to the principles here declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
