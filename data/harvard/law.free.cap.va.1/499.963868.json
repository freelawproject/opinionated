It was attested by highly respectable and intelligent witnesses, and immediately placed upon record. Eighteen years after-wards, a bill was filed to impeach this conveyance, by a creditor whose debt originated some years after the conveyance was made, and who, it appeared, had notice of the conveyance when not more than a fourth of the debt had been contracted. The bill alleged, that at the time of the conveyance the grantor was very much involved, and largely indebted to many persons. But in the opinion of the court it was proved that he was then, and for several years afterwards, able to meet all his engagements; the owner of property to a considerable amount; in good credit and extensive business; having the command of large sums of money, and not indebted except to a single individual, the debt to whom was not large, considering the grantor\u2019s estate.

Taylor </em>of the third part, and the president, directors and company of the bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>of the fourth part, wherein it was recited that <em>Patton </em>stood indebted to the president, directors and company of the bank of <em>Alexandria </em>in the sum of 8920 dollars 62 cents, with interest on 8864 dollars 74 cents from the first of April 1823, and on the residue from the date of the deed (September the 29th 1824), being the amount of sundry loans of money and discounts theretofore made by the bank for his use and accommodation, for the security of which, in part, the said <em>Patton </em>had theretofore conveyed in trust to the said <em>Herbert </em>a part of the lands therein after described. It was farther recited, that the bank had agreed to forbear and give further day of payment for the said debt to the said <em>Patton </em>for the term of 3 <em>years; </em>and if, at or before the expiration of the said term, <em>Patton </em>or his representatives should pay to the bank or its assigns one full third part of the said debt with interest thereon, then the bank or its assigns would allow the further term of two years, making five years from the date; and if, at the end of the said five years, <em>Patton </em>or his representatives should pay one half of the balance, the bank would allow the further term of two years, or seven years from the date, for the payment of the residue : and that <em>Patton, </em>on his part, agreed to give farther and more effectual security for the payment of the said debt to the bank. Whereupon it was witnessed that <em>Patton </em>and wife and <em>Herbert </em>(for such interest as he had therein) conveyed to <em>Auld </em>and <em>Taylor </em>the three tracts of land mentioned in the deed of the 27th of April 1811, and also another tract of land, in trust to permit <em>Patton </em>and wife and their representatives to retain possession and to receive the rents and profits thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>without account, according to their respective interests therein at the time of the execution of this deed, until default should be made in any one of the payments; and if there should be a failure to make payment of the anc^ interest in the manner before mentioned, in trust that <em>Auld </em>and <em>Taylor </em>should sell the premises (or so much thereof as might be necessary to satisfy the whole amount of the debt and interest remaining unpaid, with all reasonable costs of sale) in the manner set forth in the deed. No sale was to be made of the <em>Spring bank </em>tract of land until the other two tracts should have been first sold and the proceeds thereof ascertained to be insufficient. And the deed was in trust that if <em>Patton </em>should pay off the whole amount of the debt, charges of insurance, and interest; or if the same should be raised, with expenses of sale, from the sale of the other tracts ; or if the same should in part be so raised, and the said <em>Ann Clifton Patton, </em>or any one of her children, or any one on his or their behalf, should pay to the bank the balance which should be due, then the parties of the third part should thenceforth hold the said tract of land called <em>Spring bank </em>to the sole and separate use of the said <em>Ann Clifton </em>for her life, free from the power and control of her husband, and after her death to the use of such child or children of the said <em>Robert </em>and <em>Ann, </em>then born or thereafter to be born, and for such interests and estates, as the said <em>Ann, </em>by any instrument of writing under her hand, attested by two or more credible witnesses, or by her last will and testament or letter of appointment attested as aforesaid, notwithstanding her coverture, might direct and appoint; and in default of such appointment, to the use of the right heirs of the said <em>Ann </em>according to the statutes regulating descents.

Two justices of the peace of <em>Fairfax </em>county took the acknowledgment of <em>Patton, </em>and also the privy examination and acknowledgment of his wife; and the deed with their certificates was admitted to record in the office of <em>Fairfax </em>county court on the 25th of October 1824.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-5\">On the 22d of March 1825, the president, directors and company of the bank of <em>Alexandria </em>commenced a suit-in the superior court of chancery formerly holden for the <em>Fredericksburg </em>district.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b533-6\">Their bill, which was filed at June rules 1825, set forth the deeds herein before mentioned; described <em>Patton </em>as being, at the time of executing the deeds of March 1807, \u201cvery much involved, and indebted to many persons to a considerable amount;\u201d and mentioned the deed of the 27thof April 1811 as being \u201cin trust to secure a debt of 2000 dollars to the bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>and to secure any further loans that the bank might make to <em>Robert Patton </em>junior.\u201d It avers that the debt of 8864 dollars 74 cents, secured by the deed of the 29th of September 1824, is still due to the bank with interest &amp;c. and states that the plaintiffs are advised that the tract of land called <em>Spring bank, </em>and the other lands conveyed by that deed, are liable for the said debt, but their claim to have the tract called <em>Spring bank </em>subjected to the payment of their debt is resisted, upon the ground that it had been previously conveyed by <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart, </em>by the deed of the 21st of March 1807, to <em>Ann Clifton Patton </em>for life, and after her death to her children, one of whom only was <em>in esse </em>at the date of the deed, to wit, <em>Eleanor Patton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>who afterwards intermarried with <em>George Mason. </em>The \u00b0 \u25a0 complainants contend that the deed <em>from Patton </em>to <em>San^erson </em>anc^ <em>Stewart, </em>being a voluntary deed without consideration, and made with the sole view to a settlemeni; upon the wife and family of the said <em>Patton, </em>and that too at a time when he was largely indebted to many persons, must, as to' the complainants, be considered fraudulent, null and void; that the deed from <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>to mrs. <em>Patton </em>and her children is null and void, because no such settlement as was contemplated by the parties could be made without the interposition of a trustee, and as a settlement after marriage, without any contract precedent to the marriage, it cannot be supported against any creditor, either prior or subsequent; that at all events, whatever might be its effects as to the subsequent creditors, it is void in law as to any purchaser, either prior or subsequent; and that as to the complainants, who claim both as creditors and purchasers, both deeds are fraudulent and utterly null and void. <em>Robert Patton </em>and <em>Ann C. </em>his wife, <em>Mary S.

Th\u00e9 bill prays, that <em>Robert Patton </em>may answer and say whether the deed from himself to <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>was not voluntary and without consideration, and with a view to have the property settled upon his wife and children, and whether, at the date of the said deed, he was not largely indebted to many persons f that the said deed, and the deed from <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>to mrs. <em>Patton </em>and her children, may, as to the complainants, who are both creditors and purchasers, be decreed to be null and void, and that the land called <em>Spring bank </em>may be made or left subject to the just and legal liens and incumbrances, which the complainants have upon it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>At May rules 1826, the defendants <em>Robert Patton </em>and <em>Ann C. </em>his wife filed their answer. In this they admit that the facts stated in the bill, so far as they relate to the deeds for the tract of land called <em>Spring bank, </em>are true, and that the deed from <em>Patton </em>to <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>was voluntary, and without other consideration than what appears on the face of it, except as follows\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-3\">They state that <em>Patton, </em>in 1804, contracted an engagement for marriage with <em>Ann C. Reeder </em>(now <em>Ann C. Patton), </em>and being about to embark for <em>Europe, </em>made a will which he left with his brother <em>James Patton, </em>since deceased, wherein he devised the <em>Spring bank </em>land, which he had recently purchased, to the said <em>Ann G. Reeder, </em>together with 5000 dollars, and sundry slaves and household furniture; and not having received the conveyance of the said land, he desired his said brother to cause it to be made to the said <em>Ann C. R.eeder, </em>which however he failed to do. That after his return from <em>Europe, </em>to wit, in 1805, he was married, and the conveyance of <em>Spring bank </em>was subsequently made to himself. That while in <em>England, </em>he became acquainted with the house of <em>Thomas Pinkerton, </em>then a contractor with the british government for the supply of flour, bread, peas and beans in the british <em>West India </em>islands, and entered into an engagement with the said <em>Pinkerton </em>to forward such supplies monthly from the <em>United States </em>to the <em>West Indies, </em>to meet the contract of the said <em>Pinkerton: </em>in the profits of which engagement, he gave his brother <em>James Patton </em>a large share. That soon afterwards <em>Pinkerton </em>failed, and he <em>(Robert Patton) </em>again visited <em>England, </em>and made a similar arrangement with the firm of <em>Ingles, Ellico Co. </em>which latter business was conducted by himself alone, and was continued until 1809, when that house also failed, leaving him to take up bills of exchange to a large amount, as he had done to a considerable extent in the failure of <em>Pinkerton. </em>The said de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>fendant <em>Robert Patton </em>states, that during the greater portion of the period occupied by these transactions, he believed his circumstances to be good and prosperous, and it was during that period that the deeds of March were made; but he admits that when those deeds were made, he did owe sundry debts, some of them of considerable amount, and among them a debt to <em>John Laird </em>of <em>Georgetown, D. C. </em>amounting to 678 pounds 11 shillings and 9 pence sterling, with interest from the 31st of December 1806. He states that he is under the impression that a part of the sum obtained from the complainants was paid to <em>Laird, </em>in part of his debt; and adds, \u201c It is with grief and mortification this defendant must own that to this moment he remains indebted to the said <em>John Laird </em>a part of that debt.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-7\">At June rules 1826 an answer was filed for the other defendants (except <em>Mason </em>and wife) by guardian <em>ad litem. </em>The guardian states in the answer, that he has no doubt the claim of the complainants <em>for </em>8864 dollars 75 cents with interest, on <em>account of moneys </em>advanced and loaned by them, is a just and fair claim ; and that he has understood that the said <em>Robert Patton junior, </em>at the time the deed to <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>was executed, was indebted to <em>John Laird </em>in a considerable sum of money, and perhaps to other persons also. Both the deeds of March 1807, he says, \u201c appear to be very vaguely and inartificially drawn, and to have a very precarious effect.\u201d . Whether the interest vested in the children is such a one as a court of. chancery will hold valid against creditors and purchasers, he is not advised ; but he states his belief that the said <em>Robert Patton </em>has it in his power to substitute property of equal value for that sought by the complainants to be subjected to the payment of their claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b536-8\">At October rules 1826, <em>Mason </em>and wife filed their answer. They state, that personally they know nothing of the facts : that they have always been informed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>believe that the deed to <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>was a fair and <em>Iona fide </em>deed, and not intended to defeat or injure any creditors whatever: that they do not know whether <em>Robert Patton junior </em>was indebted at the time, but they have been informed and believe that his debts at that time were not considerable, and have all been long since paid. They admit that <em>Eleanor Ann </em>was the only child then <em>in esse.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-4\">All the answers were signed and sworn to; that of <em>Patton </em>and wife by each of them; that for the infant defendants by <em>Nathaniel S. </em>Wise, who was then their guardian <em>ad litem; </em>and that of <em>Mason </em>and wife by each of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-5\">On the 24th of April 1827, the suit abated as to the defendant <em>Robert Patton </em>by his death. Whereupon, for reasons appearing to the court, the order appointing <em>Wise </em>guardian <em>ad litem </em>was set aside, and <em>Ann C. Patton </em>was appointed in his stead : and on the motion of the defendants <em>Ann C. Patton </em>and <em>Eleanor Ann Mason, respectively, by counsel, leave was </em>given to the said <em>Ann C. Patton </em>to answer <em>de novo </em>for herself and the infant defendants, and to the defendant <em>Eleanor Mason </em>to file a separate answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-6\">At March rules 1828, answers were filed. The answer of <em>Ami C. Patton </em>for herself, and of the infant defendants by her as their guardian states, that the conveyance to <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>was made in accordance with a long cherished wish on the part of <em>Robert Patton junior to provide for his </em>wife and children a security against the vicissitudes of fortune, by setting apart for them a small portion of his property : and it mentioned the will made by <em>Robert Patton junior </em>on the eve of embarking for <em>Europe, </em>and the instructions given by him to his brother in relation to the conveyance of the <em>Spring ba,nk </em>tract of land, in like manner as they are mentioned in the former answer. It was his intention, she said, at the time of making the will, that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>should complete the improvements at <em>Spring banlc, </em>and reside there; and that property, and the improvements^ then making, were understood among their families and friends to be settled upon her. The answer further states, that at the time of the deeds of March 1807, <em>Patton </em>was not at all involved; that he was in the possession of much real property besides the <em>Spring banlc </em>estate, and that he had the command of much money, ground rents &amp;c. solely his own; that he was at that time engaged in prosperous mercantile enterprise, and concerned in shares of many vessels, besides having other considerable resources. The respondents aver that it was a conviction honestly entertained by him, that he could make provision for his wife and children, to the extent of the property comprised in the said deeds, without the slightest injustice or hazard of loss to his then creditors. They admit that he was at that time indebted for some shop and mechanics\u2019 accounts contracted after the commencement of the year 1807, which were paid (as \\yas usual then and for many years after) when presented at thg close of the year, and that he also owed a debt to <em>John.Laird, </em>part of which, amounting with interest to about 1200 dollars, still remains unpaid. Every debt which he owed at that time, with the exception of that to <em>Laird, </em>they aver has been paid. Why that was not paid they cannot state, but presume it was because <em>Laird </em>did not want the money. It could not be, they say, from the incompetency of the <em>faf'Robert Patton jr. </em>to discharge the same, if <em>Laird </em>BacFrequired and pressed it. They mention that in the bf 1826, <em>Humphrey Pealce </em>as agent for the bank, persuasi\u00f3n, and by threatening an immediate sale the other lots at the then reduced prices of land, import\u00a3u?ed-\"and at length induced the said <em>Robert Patton fmmr.Co </em>answer, or to allow him to draw an answer, to the complainants\u2019 bill, and to state that he owed sundry debts besides the debt to <em>Laird, </em>which statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>they say was without foundation, except.as just mentioned in relation to the shop and mechanics\u2019 accounts. They deny that any part of the money received from the bank was ever applied to pay <em>Laird; </em>that debt having, as they allege, been reduced from other sources. They state that the transactions of the said <em>Robert Patton junior </em>with the bank did not commence until January 1809, and that he did not receive any accommodation on his own paper for a considerable time after; and the credit given him was upon his own responsibility, without contemplating any claim or charge upon the <em>Spring bank </em>estate. The deeds of March 1807 were never intended to be kept secret; the attorney of the bank was one of the subscribing witnesses to the same, and they were well known to the friends and acquaintances of the said <em>Robert Patton junior </em>in the town of <em>Alexandria </em>(where he carried on his business) some of whom were directors of the bank. And the respondents insist that both law and justice condemn such a claim as is made here by a subsequent creditor or purchaser, especially when the credit is given and the purchase made with a full knowledge of the voluntary conveyance, as they are informed was the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-8\">The answer of <em>Eleanor Ann Mason </em>states, that she was an infant at the time the deeds of March 1807 were made by her father; but she declares her belief that they were <em>bona fide </em>and upon just and good consideration, and were not made, as alleged in the bill, to defraud his creditors, or any other persons. that her father was then possessed of a <em>lar,~ \" J </em>personal estate ; that if he were at all inde to a very small amount compared with the ac of his estate; and that all the debts he then has been informed and believes, have been si She calls for proof of the allegation that he was time very much involved and indebted. She charges that the debts claimed to be due to the complainants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>were contracted long after the execution of those deeds, and that at the time they were contracted the complainants had full knowledge of the existence of the said deeds, and of the interests and estates created by the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A-xQ\">The deposition of <em>John Laird </em>was taken the 12th of March 1828.

To this he answered, that previous to the year 1807 he understood the said <em>Patton </em>owed a debt to <em>John Laird, </em>which he understood was about 2000 dollars. To another question, he made this answer: \u201c In the spring of the year before mr. <em>Patton </em>died, I was consulted by him, stating he had been importuned by the bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>the plaintiffs, to make an answer to a bill (that they had dictated) that he was indebted to persons in a considerable amount previous to March 1807, and upon such an answer they would give him longer indulgence. I told him, if he did make such an answer, and I was ever called upon in a court of justice, I should most certainly contradict him ; that I knew his circumstances at the time, and well recollected our conversation when he executed a deed to one <em>Stewart </em>and myself for the est\u00e1te of <em>Spring ba.nlc, </em>and that he only owed the debt due to mr. <em>Laird, </em>as before stated. He was in expectation, by getting indulgence, to be enabled to pay off the debt due to the bank of <em>Alexandria </em>from some other resources.

While therefore it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>may be, that but for this assignment the court would direct the appeal to abate, because or there being no person in existence having right to claim, yet there would be an obvious impropriety in directing such abatement here. It was never doubted, in the case of the bank of the <em>United States, </em>that the transfer made by it before the expiration of its charter, prevented its rights from being extinguished. The only question is as to the remedy.' Now the general rule in equity is, that where a right in litigation is assigned, the assignee is entitled to continue the suit. 2 Madd. Ch. Pr. 519. And there is no <em>reason' why the </em>rule should be different in an appellate court. In ordinary cases, where the assignor dies, and has a representative, there is no necessity to notice the assignment. In this case, one of two modes should be adopted ; either the fact of the expiration of the charter should not be noticed, or there should be some process or rule on behalf of the assignees. Otherwise an acknowledged right will be defeated. For if the appeal abates, there can be no remedy in a court of original jurisdiction, the decree of the court below being against the corporation. That decree may be clearly erroneous, but unless the error be corrected in the appellate court, no relief can be given the assignees elsewhere. Nor is there necessity for legislation. This court has plenary power over its process and proofs, without any farther legislative act. Its power to award all reviving and other process is recognized by the act in 1 R. C. 1819, p. 194. ch. 64. \u00a7 17. without any limitation as to the nature of the process. It may be for every requisite purpose. Id. p. 192. \u00a7 11. And by the act of 1831 it was provided that all process consequent upon appeals should be regulated by the laws and usages then in force and in practice. Sess. Acts 1830-31, p. 53. ch. 11. \u00a7 31. Supp. to Rev. Code p. 149. The judges may direct the form of writs in such manner as they shall deem advisable. 1 R.

There is analogous legislation. No suit in equity now abates by the death or marriage of the plaintiff, but it may, on motion without notice, be conducted in the name of the heir, devisee, executor or administrator of the deceased plaintiff, or the husband of the <em>feme </em>plaintiff Sess. Acts 1825-6, p. 15. ch. 15. \u00a7 2. Supp. to Rev. Code p. 130. No suit at law or in equity in the name of a curator or committee of an estate will abate by the grant of letters testamentary, or of administration, on that estate. Sess. Acts 1839, p. 42. ch. 66. \u00a7 1. In <em>Paradise's adm'rs </em>v. <em>Cole &amp;c. </em>6 Munf. 218. a suit at law against a committee was revived against the administrators of the insane person\u2019s estate. How shall the court of appeals effect the object in this case ? A <em>scire facias </em>is frequently at law in the nature of an action, <em>Winter &amp;c. </em>v. Kretchman, 2 T. R. 45. and in equity is analogous to a supplemental bill or bill of revivor. It may state the fact of marriage, death, devise, descent or bankruptcy, involving issues of law or fact. And though it is not usual, yet there is no reason why an assignee may not have a <em>scire facias, </em>even in an appellate court. Bankruptcy is a case of assignment by operation of law. 1 Bac. Abr. title Bankrupt, letter F. And in a case of bankruptcy, a <em>scire facias </em>is frequently requisite. The rule is, that a <em>scire facias </em>lies where a new person is to be benefited or charged. 2 Tidd\u2019s Pract. 1166. There may in this case be no necessity for a <em>scire facias; </em>but if so, a refusal to abate the appeal is proper. There is no valid objection to establishing the fact of assignment by evidence out of the record. The court may examine such evidence and pass upon it, on the principle recognized in <em>Erskine </em>v. <em>Henry &amp;c. </em>6 Leigh 384, 5. and <em>Hite's heirs </em>v. <em>Wilson &amp;c. </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 268. And when it finds the fact of the assignment established, it may suffer the appeal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>continue in the name of the corporation. There is no <em>. </em>. . , . . necessity, in any case, to revive m this court: where there is no revival here, any further proceedings whic<em>h </em>, are requisite may be had in the court below, after the decision here. In <em>England, </em>if the plaintiff in error die after errors assigned, it does not abate the writ; and in no case does the writ abate there by the death of the defendant in error, whether the death happen before or after the errors assigned. 2 Tidd\u2019s Pract. 1219, 20. 2 Archb. Pract. 1204. According to our practice, the assignment of errors is in the petition for the appeal. If in <em>England, </em>where an appellant becomes bankrupt, and is thus divested of his interest in the subject and his capacity to sue for it, the proceedings may nevertheless be conducted in the appellate court in his name, there can be no valid objection, where a corporation is appellant and the charter expires pending the appeal, to permitting the proceedings to be continued in the corporate name. The decision in <em>Buckner &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>2 Munf. 336. is a strong one against the necessity of any revival in the court of appeals; for the provision in 1 R. C. 1819, p. 498. ch. 128. \u00a7 38. that if a party die between verdict and judgment, the judgment shall be entered as if both parties were living, is obviously intended for the court below, and cannot dispense with a revival in the appellate court, if such revival would have been necessary in case the death had occurred after judgment. Where, too, a party dies after his cause is argued in this court, there is no revival here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-8\"><em>C. Johnson on </em>the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjhO\">In the case of <em>Rider </em>v. <em>The Union Factory, </em>there was no right to reverse the decree, because it could have been of no consequence to reverse it. But here it is suggested that there has been an assignment, and the assignees assert their right to have the correctness of the decree against the validity of the claim enquired into. Can it be possible that the right derived from the corporation while it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>existing, is extinguished because the charter has expired ? And if the right be not extinguished, what is the remedy proposed for it by the counsel on the other side ? There must be some peculiar defect, if in such a case there be no remedy at all. [Stanard, J. Suppose the decree of the court below had been in favour of the bank, instead of against it, and an abatement were entered here ?] That shews conclusively the unsoundness of the position taken on the other side; for in such a case, the appeal being abated, the decree would remain in force, and might be carried into execution upon a bill by the assignee. When the fact of assignment is urged against the motion to abate, the court may receive and decide upon all evidence adduced in regard to the fact. This is a jurisdiction which arises out of its very existence, and which it must have for the preservation and protection of its powers. When, however, the fact of assignment is ascertained, there is no necessity for a revival in the court of appeals : no law requires <em>it; </em>the law is only permissive. From the terms of the act in 1 R. C. 1819, p. 497. ch. 128. ^ 38. it is manifest tha| it does not apply to the appellate court; and if it did apply, the act provides that the suit shall not abate. Our statutes not requiring a revival, the argument from the english practice is conclusive. There, after a plaintiff in error becomes bankrupt, the assignees still go on with the writ of error in the bankrupt\u2019s name. <em>Kretchman </em>v. Beyer, 1 T. R. 463. And this appeal may proceed equally well in the name of the corporation. If there were any difficulty upon a <em>supersedeas </em>to a judgment at law, there can be none upon an appeal from a decree in equity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b547-5\"><em>Harrison </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3Ja\">A perfect stranger to the record claims to come here and take advantage of new matter, only available by an original bill. This court has no right to create a new remedy, not given by the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>law or by statute. Any proceeding in the court below , . . ' . . by a new party, introducing new matter, would necessarily be by an original bill. On what principle is it that the assignees claim to come here, and be relieved fr\u00b0m the necessity of proceeding as they would have to do below ? How can they be heard here <em>ore tenus </em>and by evidence, when they could not be heard in that way below ? It is true, this court has a right to enquire into matters necessary for the continuance of its jurisdiction. But it can only decide between living parties; its orders and judgments are void in case of death. The cases cited on the other side do not involve the question of right. Here the court is called upon to exercise a new original jurisdiction, and determine upon the validity of a new right claimed to have arisen since the decree of the court below. Suppose the appellant were a natural .person, and were dead without a representative; would the court take notice of one claiming to be his assignee ? In <em>Tolson </em>v. <em>Elwes, 1 </em>Leigh <em>436. it </em>was held that a motion against a sheriff for money made under execution, by the party entitled to it, could not be sustained, because he was no party to the record. If the subject recovered were real estate, and the party recovering had died without heirs, could the court take jurisdiction for the appellant ? At common law, in cases of abatement, it was necessary there should be a new original, or new action. And now, in personal actions or suits, if there be no personal representative, the case must abate. The judgment of this court would be a nullity, after the extinction of the corporation : it could not be revived by any process, nor entered in the court below ; if the decree bp reversed, the court below must treat the reversal as a nullity. The <em>scire facias </em>suggested would be an original bill in the nature of a supplemental bill. There is no instance of a <em>scire facias </em>for a stranger, except in bankruptcy. In bankruptcy, the assignees have a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>to use the name of the bankrupt. But if the bankrupt dies before judgment, the revival must be in the name of his personal representative.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AsVV\">Stanard <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AbP\">The appellees, alleging that the appellants as a corporation have become extinct pending this appeal, by the expiration of the term of their incorporation, have moved for an order directing the abatement of the appeal. In opposition to this it is suggested, that during the corporate existence of the appellants, they made an assignment of their rights in the subject involved in this case; and on behalf of the assignees it is insisted that the appeal should not be abated, but should be heard and decided in the names of the parties to the appeal, or that if the expiration of the charter of the appellants preclude the hearing of the case, and to that hearing a revivor in the name of some existing person, legal or natural, be necessary, process of revivor should issue in the name of the assignees. The appellees, without conceding the fact of the assignment, contend that the case cannot proceed but in the names of existing parties, and must be abated unless it can be revived in such names; and that it cannot be revived in the names of assignees claiming to be such by act <em>in pais; </em>that of such fact this court cannot take judicial cognizance, as it is matter for supplemental bill in the nature of an original bill. Without ascertaining the fact of the assignment (for it would be useless to enquire into that fact if the appellees be right) the questions arising on the motion have been discussed, and the opinion of the court sought on the matters of law and practice they involve, leaving the fact for further investigation, should the opinion of the court on the matters of law and practice render such investigation necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">The questions, then, for solution on this motion are, 1. Is it indispensably necessary to the hearing and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>cisi\u00f3n of an- appeal, that it should be revived in the name of existing parties, legal or natural ? 2. If not, can the court enquire into a fact <em>in pais, </em>to shew that such appeal ought to proceed to hearing and decision without su\u00b0k revivor 5 and is the fact of assignment to parties who cannot revive, sufficient to shew that the appeal ought to be so proceeded in ? 3. If such revivor be necessary, may the parlies claiming as assignees be allowed to revive ?</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Proceedings in error have never been subjected to the rules that govern the proceedings in the original suit, in respect to abatements and revivors.</p>\n<p id=\"AzJ\">Until the statute of 1806 was passed, an original suit was abated by the death of either party before interlocutory judgment, and could not be continued by or against the representative; and prior to the statute of 1792, the case had been the same even where the death occurred after interlocutory judgment. (See 1 Rev. Code of 1819, p. 497. ch. 128. \u00a7 38. and 1 Rev. Code of 1814, p. 153. [110.] ch. 76. \u00a7 20.) But appeals and writs of error did not abate by the death of either party. The other party, or the representative of the deceased, might in such case revive the appeal or writ of error, by <em>scire facias. </em>And the general rule of practice in this court required such revivor preliminary to the hearing and decision of the case. But even this general rule of practice did not require such revivor at the time of the judgment or decree of this court, if the death had occurred subsequent to the argument. And if an appeal was taken from a judgment in favour of a party dead at the time of the judgment, no process from this court was required to make the representative of the decedent a party by name to the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">I have no doubt that the practice of this court was settled in analogy to proceedings in error in <em>England, </em>with modifications however of that practice, which considerations of convenience suggested. According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>to the practice in <em>England, </em>the proceedings in error abated if the plaintiff in error died before the assignment of errors. If the plaintiff\u2019s death occurred after the assignment of errors, then the defendant was bound to join issue on the assignment, and proceed to have the judgment affirmed, if hot erroneous; and this without a <em>scire facias </em>against the representatives of the plaintiff in error. But the death of the defendant in error did not abate the writ, whether it happened be-f re or after assignment of errors. If before, then the plaintiff in error might make the executors or administrators parties by <em>scire facias ad audiendum errores, </em>and thereby compel a joinder in error. But if the defendant died after the assignment of errors, the case proceeded until judgment of the court of error, as if the defendant were living. 1 Arch. Prac. 216. and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">According to our practice, some of the predicaments provided for by the english practice did not occur; for by it, in all cases now, as in all cases before the organization of the courts under the new constitution where the <em>supersedeas, </em>writ of error or appeal was allowed on application to the court of appeals or a judge thereof, the errors are assigned at the time of the allowance of the <em>supersedeas, </em>writ of error or appeal: and had our practice been framed in strict conformity to the english practice, no <em>scire facias </em>would have been necessary on account of the death of either party after the case got into this court. Our practice however, as before stated, has required a <em>scire facias </em>against or in favour of the executor or administrator-, on the death of either the plaintiff or defendant in error. But this must necessarily be confined to those cases in which it is practicable to sue out such <em>scire facias, </em>and admitted of exceptions even where it was practicable, as in the case of death between the hearing and judgment. We then ascertain that the objection to proceeding in error unless there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>be existing parties, legal or natural, at the time of hear-and judgment, is not insuperable.</p>\n<p id=\"Atx\">The extinction of one of the parties without any legal representative or succession, would, if standing al\u00b0ne&gt; forbid further proceedings, because all such proceedings must, from the very fact of such extinction, be wholly abortive. And were this case so situated, the case of <em>Rider </em>v. <em>The Union Factory, </em>7 Leigh 154. is a distinct and precise authority in favour of the motion. But here a suggestion is made, that the rights involved in this case passed by assignment to living persons before the legal extinction of the party on the record, and that if this case- be proceeded in, and those rights be sustained by the judgment of the court, such judgment will not be abortive, but may be enforced by and for the assignees : and the question is, can this court take notice of the fact of assignment,-as a consideration to influence the exercise of its discretion to proceed, though the assignees are not or cannot be made parties by <em>scire facias </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">If such an assignment has been made, I do not doubt that the right, legal or equitable, which passes to the assignees by it, is in no degree impaired by the subsequent dissolution of the corporation that made the assignment. As such a right may be in the assignees by virtue of the assignment, the power of this court to make a provisional enquiry whether the fact of assignment exists, as a guide for its action on the question propounded by the motion, is inherent in the very nature, of the power that the motion proposes to call into action; if that fact being ascertained should influence the.exercise of the discretion to which the motion is addressed, provided such right would be jeoparded by one course, and no right on either side be compromised by the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Suppose this appeal should be abated ; then the error (if any) in the decree of the court below is not open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>to the correction of this court, and the counsel on neither side has suggested a mode by which it can be corrected, or the judgment of the appellate court be had on it. I should very reluctantly sanction the united propositions, that the case cannot proceed here without revivor, that it cannot be revived and must be abated, and that the error, (if any) in the decree cannot be corrected by any proceedings that the party whose rights are or may be affected by it, may institute. Look to the consequences of the maintenance of these propositions. They leave the decree of the court below in full vigour, however erroneous it may be, and deny the application of the correcting hand of this court, or any other, to the error. Suppose the decree had been for a large sum of money in favour of the then existing but now dissolved ^corporation, and that after the decree, and before or after the allowance of the appeal, the corporation still existing had assigned the decree. The dissolution of the corporation pending the appeal would furnish the same inexorable necessity for the abatement of the appeal as now exists. Such abatement would leave the decree in force, and the appellants liable to be charged with it by the assignees, in like manner as though no appeal had been allowed : the decree might be enforced at the instance of the assignees, and the parties charged by it might have no means of correcting the error, however gross. Such a consequence infers the unsoundness of the argument or pretension that leads <em>to it. </em>Without saying that there is no other remedy to protect the rights that may arise out of the suggested assignment, against the effect of the error (if there be one) in the decree, the most compendious means of giving that protection is to permit the case to proceed without notice of the dissolution of the corporation appellant, if that be within the power of the court: and I am satisfied that that power exists.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aqi\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The other judges concurred.

I had occasion to examine the principles upon which, under the statute against fraudulent alienations, conveyances are treated as fraudulent and void in regard to <em>creditors; </em>and to express the opinion, that the statute of 13 Elizabeth, ch. 5. from which so much of ours as relates to that subject is substantially taken, looks mainly to the intent with which the act is done, and if that be fraudulent avoids it, not only as against creditors who are actually, but also against those who might be disturbed, hindered, delayed or defrauded ; thus treating creditors as a class of persons entitled to the protection of the law, and embracing not only those existing at the time, but moreover subsequent creditors: that where there are no existing creditors, the fraudulent intent, if conceived, must of course be prospective, with a view to future indebtedness; but that where directed against existing creditors, it operates also in relation to those subsequently arising, a fraudulent intent as to one or more creditors being fraudulent as to all: that upon the question of fraudulent intent, the courts have of necessity resorted to a legal presumption arising out of the general nature of the case, and to marks or badges of fraud furnished by the particular circumstances: that the legal presumption is founded upon a comparison of the consideration for the conveyance, with that which constitutes the just claims of creditors ; and though voluntary conveyances are not mentioned in the statute, their true character and effect are necessarily involved in its application: and that the legal presumption of an alleged fraudulent intent arises where the conveyance is voluntary, though meritorious, if the grantor be indebted at the time, but is <em>only prima facie, </em>and may be repelled or confirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>by the particular circumstances of the case; but is rendered conclusive, if the debts be unsecured, by a degree of indebtedness 'amounting to or approaching insolvency. For the reasoning and authorities that were relied on to sustain these propositions, I must refer to the reported case; and I recur to them now with the view of ascertaining how far they are applicable to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">In the present case, it will be seen from an inspection of the bill, that it does not-charge a fraudulent intent against the plaintiffs or any other subsequent creditors of the grantor; nor even a fraudulent intent in point of fact against his creditors existing at the time of the settlement: but, merely averring that the settlement was voluntary, and made when the grantor was greatly indebted, relies upon the supposed inevitable conclusion, that in point of law it is fraudulent and void against the plaintiffs and all his other creditors, whether prior or subsequent to the conveyance. The bill, moreover, does not even allege that the plaintiffs have in fact been disturbed, delayed or hindered in the recovery of their demand; and all the circumstances of the case shew that no such impediment has been occasioned by the settlement in question. On the contrary, the delay has been altogether voluntary on the part of the plaintiffs, and occasioned by the course of conduct which they have thought proper to pursue in relation to the subject. The bill, in stating the original debt to the plaintiffs, goes no further back than the 27th of April 1811, the date of the deed of trust executed by <em>Patton </em>and wife to <em>W. Herbert, </em>to secure any sum or sums of money then, or which thereafter might be, due from <em>Patton </em>to the president and directors of the bank: which deed conveys the <em>Spring banlc </em>tract of land, embraced in the settlement in question, and also two other tracts of land, one of them conveyed to <em>Patton </em>by <em>Hepburn </em>in April 1809, and the other conveyed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>him by <em>Scott </em>and others in June 1810. It appears from the recital of this trust deed, that the bank had already been secured on the same account, by <em>Patton\u2019s </em>conveyanee in trust to the same <em>W. Herbert, </em>about a month previously, of 2000 dollars worth of stock in the <em>Farmers </em>bank of <em>Alexandria, </em>and other property; in lieu of which he was permitted to substitute the security last furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">I think there can bo no doubt, that at the time of the making of this trust deed of the 27th of April 1811, the plaintiffs had notice of the deed from <em>Patton </em>to <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart, </em>and the deed from them to mrs. <em>Patton </em>and her children, the former of the 20th and the latter of the 21st of March 1807; which two deeds constitute the voluntary settlement now impeached. The property, real and personal, which was the subject of that settlement had, at the date of the trust deed, been conveyed to the trustee <em>W. Herbert, </em>by an absolute deed of the 10th of April 1811, executed by <em>Patton </em>and wife, but not perfected by the privy examination of the latter, which deed expressly refers to the deed from <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart. </em>In all probability, the deed of the 10th of April was intended to divest the right acquired by mrs. <em>Patton </em>under the settlement, in order that it might be reconveyed by <em>Herbert </em>to <em>Patton, </em>and by him conveyed in trust for the bank; for we find that such a reconveyance was made by <em>Herbert, </em>but by some mistake is posterior in date to the trust deed. However this may be, it is manifest that <em>Herbert, </em>the trustee, had notice of the settlement: and without relying upon the legal inference from that fact, of notice to the bank, the fact itself, taken in connexion with the due recordation of the deeds of settlement, and the attestation of them by several eminent professional gentlemen of the town of <em>Alexandria, </em>one of whom is also a witness to the trust deed, renders it extremely improbable that the plaintifFs were ignorant of the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>of those deeds; and every doubt upon the subject must be removed by the silence of the plaintiffs, who make no pretence of such ignorance in their bill, though it r \u2022 would have been a material circumstance, if the voluntary settlement had been concealed from them, and they induced to trust the grantor upon the faith of property embraced therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The bill gives no information of the intermediate dealings between the plaintiffs and Patton, from the date of the trust deed of the 27th of April 1811, until the procurement of that of the 29th of September 1824, executed by <em>Patton </em>and wife to <em>Colin Auld </em>and <em>Robert J. Taylor </em>as trustees, conveying the same property, to secure the amount therein stated to be due from <em>Patton </em>to the bank, of 8920 dollars 60 cents principal, with some interest. After this delay of the plaintiffs in the prosecution of their original demand, of between 13 and 14 years, a further, and, I would think, unusual forbearance for a bank towards its debtor was stipulated by the terms of the last deed <em>; </em>which gave indulgence for the whole debt for three years, with the privilege of extending it, in part, to seven, by paying up one third at the expiration of the three years, and one half of the remainder at the expiration of five. This new indulgence, thus made the subject of contract, though granted without any additional security, was not, it seems, without a new consideration intended to enure to the benefit of the plaintiffs. There is abundant reason to believe it was connected with an arrangement, by which the debtor was to act in concert with the bank, for the purpose of getting rid of any futur^ adverse claim on the part of the grantees in the settle-j ment in question. It will be seen from the provisions of1 the last incumbrance, that it was not contemplated the settlement should be wholly avoided, but only postponed to the lien of the bank, and subject to that lien, rendered more effectual to the grantees; for it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>stipulated, that <em>Patton </em>and his wife, and their representatives, should retain possession and receive the rents and profits of the property conveyed, without account, \u201c <em>according to their respective interests therein at the time of the execution of this deed;''\u2019 </em>and also that no sale should <em>J </em>. be made of the <em>Spring bank </em>tract of land (the one embraced in the deeds of settlement) until the other two tracts should have been first sold, and the proceeds thereof ascertained to be insufficient; and moreover that if <em>Patton </em>or his executors &amp;c. should, at any time before sale made, pay off the whole amount of the debt &amp;c. or if the same should be raised from the sale of the other tracts, or in part so raised, and mrs. <em>Patton </em>or any of her children, or any one in their behalf, should pay the balance which should be due to the bank, then that the trustees should thenceforth hold the <em>Spring bank </em>tract to the sole and separate use of mrs. <em>Patton </em>for her life, free from the power and control of her husband, and after her death to the use of the children of herself and her husband, with a power of appointment on her part of their respective interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">This suit was instituted on the 22d of March 1825, about six months after the execution of the last trust deed, and two years and six months before the expiration of the stipulated forbearance. The bill contains no specific prayer for the sale of the property by a decree of the court. Though it states that \u201cthe just claim of the plaintiffs to have the tract of land called <em>Spring bank </em>subjected to the payment of their debt, is resisted on the ground that it had been previously conveyed\u201d by the deeds of settlement, it does not state by whom such resistance is made, or that any obstacle is thereby presented to the enforcement of the trust by the trustees. If it were proper to infer such an obstacle from that loose statement, as existing in regard to the <em>Spring bank </em>tract, none such could have existed in relation to the other two tracts, and no reason is as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>signed for hot subjecting them to sale in the first in- ... ,. , , stance, nor is it alleged that those two tracts were not of sufficient value to. produce the amount due, or that <em>Patton </em>had refused or was unable to make payment, or ^at any legal measures had been resorted to for the purpose of coercing it. And the only specific prayers in the bill (besides those merely formal) are, that <em>Patton </em>may say in his answer, \u201c whether the deed of the 21st of March 1807, from himself to <em>James Sanderson </em>and <em>William </em>Stewart, was not entered into without consideration, and with a view to have the property therein mentioned settled upon his wife and children ; and whether at the date of that deed he was not largely indebted to many persons: and that the said deed, and the deed of the same date from the said <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>to mrs. <em>Ann Clifton Patton </em>and her children, may be decreed, as against your complainants, who are both creditors and purchasers, fraudulent and null and void; and that the land called <em>Spring bank </em>may be made or left subject to the just find legal lien and incumbrance, which the bank of <em>Alexandria </em>or you? complainants have upon it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Thus it will be seen that the object of the suit was not to coerce payment of the debt, but to render the incumbrance therefor paramount to the title of the grantees in the settlement. This was not in conflict with the individual interest of the grantor; and on the other hand he could not, either at the date of the incumbrance or in the progress of the cause, resist the wishes of the bank on this subject, without forfeiting all claim to further forbearance, though he might hope that an extended indulgence might enable him to relieve himself from his difficulties, without ultimate injustice to his family. We see from the bill, drawn with a studied avoidance of offensive imputations, that the plaintiffs sought to obtain from him an admission which they thought would subserve their purpose; and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>answer shews that they were not disappointed. He does admit in his answer (filed for himself and wife) that at the date of the voluntary settlement, \u201c he did owe sundry debts, some of them of considerable an admission too broad, as will be presently seen, for the facts of the case, and against the making of which he was warned by the witness <em>Sanderson, </em>who swears that he was well acquainted with his circumstances at that period, and that he told him, that if called upon as a witness, he would have to contradict him. An answer was moreover procured from a guardian <em>ad litem, </em>for the infant grantees, who had been appointed on the motion of the plaintiffs, which is of an extraordinary character; for the drift of it is to impugn rather than sustain the rights of those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">This state of the case was quite unfavourable to the grantees, and no active defence was made on their part until the death of <em>Patton, </em>when a new aspect was given to the cause. The guardian <em>ad litem </em>was removed by an order of the court, and mrs. <em>Patton, </em>then <em>sui juris, </em>appointed in his stead; and she was permitted to answer <em>de novo, </em>as well for herself as the infant defendants : and mrs. <em>Mason, </em>the only adult amongst the children, and who had formerly answered with her husband, by leave of the court filed her separate answer. And the parties, for the first time, proceeded to the examination of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The foregoing views have not been presented for the purpose of shewing that if the plaintiffs have made out their case upon the merits, by establishing the settlement of 1807 to be fraudulent and void against the creditors of the grantor, relief should be denied them because of a defective structure of their bill, or of the course of conduct they have pursued, either before or since the institution of this suit. My purpose has not been to go into the consideration of any such questions ; but merely to deduce, from the facts I have stated, the two following propositions:</p>\n<p id=\"At7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>1. The plaintiffs not having charged in their bill that the settlement was made with a fraudulent intent in point of fact, they must prove the averments relied on by them as warranting the conclusion that the transac*\u2019011 was fraudulent and void by intendment of law; and instead of relying upon a <em>prima facie </em>presumption from mere indebtedness, to throw the burthen of proof on the opposite party, ought to establish such an extent of indebtedness and inadequacy of resources, as will serve to shew that the grantor, at the time of the settlement, was in a condition amounting to or approaching insolvency.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">2. The plaintiffs having notice of the voluntary settlement, and instead of resorting to legal proceedings for the purpose of placing themselves in an attitude to complain of being delayed, hindered or defrauded thereby, <em>(Colman </em>v. <em>Croker, </em>1 Ves. jun. 160.) having, by taking their first incumbrance, assumed the settlement to be fraudulent; and instead of <em>proceeding to </em>enforce that incumbrance, as they were authorized by its terms to do, within a reasonable time, so as to give those claiming under the settlement an opportunity to assert and prove its validity, having continued to indulge and deal with the grantor for a number of years; and having thereafter taken a second incumbrance on the same property, by which they bound themselves to extend still further forbearance; and having, by a combination with the grantor, enlisted him against the interests of his own family, whose disabilities required his protection; these circumstances furnish a strong presumption against the pretensions of the plaintiffs, which ought to be overcome by unobjectionable and plenary proofs on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">If these propositions be correct, the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 cause, in their character of creditors, will require but a brief consideration. Let us first dispose of the admissions in the pleadings on the part of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>fendants. If the admissions in the answer of <em>Patton </em>... ... .... , be evidence against his grantees, as to which, m such a case as this, I express no opinion, still I can give no weight to them, for reasons already suggested. As to the separate answer of mrs. <em>Mason </em>and the previous joint answer of herself and husband, they put the most material allegations of the bill in issue. But there is an admission in the answer of mrs. <em>Patton, </em>filed for herself and as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for the infant defendants, which seems to require a cursory notice. After denying that her husband was involved in debt at the time of the settlement, and alleging on the contrary that he was in unembarrassed and prosperous circumstances, and able to meet all his engagements, she admits that he owed at that time a debt to <em>John Laird </em>of <em>Georgetown, </em>on which a balance still remained due, including interest, of about 1200 dollars. This admission she does not profess to make on her own personal knowledge, and we need not enquire how far it was correct; for though it might conclude her in her lifetime, and her representatives after her death, it could not affect the other grantees, as they do not claim under her; and it cannot be used against them as having been made by their guardian <em>ad litem, </em>for no rule is better settled than that an answer of an infant by guardian cannot be read against him at all, for any purpose. 2 Madd. Ch. Pract. 278. Mitf. Plead. 314. 315. 1 Stark. Ev. Pt. II. p. 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Let us now briefly advert to the evidence which has been examined in relation to the degree of the grantor\u2019s indebtedness, and the extent of his resources. And it is remarkable that the testimony establishes only a single debt as due from him at the date of the settlement, to wit, a debt of <em>\u00a3 </em>678.11. sterling money, to the above mentioned <em>John Laird. </em>It was material for the plaintiffs to prove, if they could, not only that this debt was subsisting at the date of the voluntary settlement, but that it has ever since continued; for their right to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>peach the settlement depended, under the circumstances of the case, upon the question whether it was fraudulent and void against creditors then existing. Now, if it was fraudulent and void against such creditors, though it follows that it would also be liable to be so treated by subsequent creditors, and that the mere fact of the debtor afterwards paying off the demands of the former would not render the transaction valid as to the latter, yet it would be a circumstance entitled to weight upon the question of fraud. That the debt to <em>Laird </em>remained unpaid, if such was the fact, the plaintiffs had not onty the complete power to prove, but it lay directly in their way to prove it; for they examined <em>Laird </em>as a witness in their behalf; and he deposed that <em>Patton </em>owed him about the year 1806, and several years after-wards, the debt above mentioned. But there they suffered the examination to rest; and the reasonable inference from his deposition surely is, that the debt was in some way discharged, some years after 1806; the more especially when we <em>couple with his </em>evidence the presumption arising from the great lapse of time, and his failure to assert a demand. It is not easy to account for the language of his deposition, and his quiescence, but by the supposition that the debt has been either paid or secured to him. Such may not be the fact, but it is the legitimate deduction from the evidence, which cannot be repelled by the admissions above noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">But if it were even granted that the debt to <em>Laird </em>still remains unsatisfied, the evidence is far from establishing that <em>Patton </em>was at the time of the settlement insolvent or greatly embarrassed in his circumstances. On the contrary, I think it is proved that he was then, and for several years afterwards, able to meet all his engagements; the owner of property to a considerable amount; in good credit and extensive business; having the command of large sums of money-; and unindebted except to mr. <em>Laird, </em>who would seem to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>been a most indulgent and even careless creditor. The plaintiffs have introduced a good deal of evidence, for the most part of a loose, indirect, and unsatisfactory description, tending somewhat to shew that the grantor, from the nature of his engagements and connexions in business, had reason to apprehend a disastrous turn in his affairs ; from which it has been argued that the purpose of the settlement was to make some provision for his family and himself against the misfortunes which afterwards fell upon him. But this evidence is too vague and inconclusive to justify the imputation of fraud, the more especially upon a bill which charges no fraudulent intent in point of fact. And though there are circumstances in the matter, the manner and the details of the settlement, calculated to attract the vigilance of suspicion, and which have been laid hold of and handled by the appellants\u2019 counsel with great address and ability, they will be found upon examination to be more imposing than substantial. It is manifest that there was no secret trust in favour of the grantor, nor even an immediate benefit secured to the grantees; and no disguise as to the nature and effect of the conveyances. The deed to <em>Sanderson </em>and <em>Stewart </em>was avowedly without consideration, and merely to avoid the formal difficulty of a direct conveyance from the husband to the wife ; and their conveyance to her, being without the intervention of a trustee, of course subjected the property, during the marriage, to the marital rights, dominion and control of the husband, and, to the extent of her estate in the subject, to the legal process of his creditors. His continuance in possession was not inconsistent but perfectly compatible with the title; and the use and enjoyment of the property, even of those portions of it which would necessarily be consumed in the use, (subordinate however to the remedies of his creditors) was a legitimate incident of his limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>interest. In this respect the case of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Proctor, </em>9 Mass. Rep. 393. was far stronger than this; for there the continuance in possession of the grantor, he being the rather and natural guardian ot the infant grantee, wa\u00ae not considered indicative of fraud, though otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the deed. The circumstance, therefore, that the deed was to the wife and children, instead of a trustee for them, is not a mark of fraud, but the reverse; since if a fraud was contemplated, it must have been in securing the property to the grantor\u2019s family after his death, against his creditors, without intermediate advantage to himself; a design which, though not impossible, must be admitted to be of but rare occurrence. A circumstance, moreover, not without its weight in estimating the fairness of the transaction,\u2019 is the due and prompt recordation of the deeds, <em>(Sexton </em>v. <em>Wheaton, </em>8 Wheat. 251.) besides the attestation of them by highly intelligent and respectable witnesses; thereby precluding the idea of intended concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The foregoing views of the question have led me to the conclusion, that the pretensions of the plaintiffs in their character of creditors cannot be sustained. It remains for me to notice their pretensions in the character of. purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">The plaintiffs, as incumbrancers, can stand upon no higher ground than absolute purchasers who have paid a full consideration and received a direct conveyance of the property. There is no charge in the bill that they were induced to become incumbrancers by the fraud of <em>Patton, </em>or that they had not notice, at the time, of the settlement he had made upon his wife and children. The naked question is therefore presented to this court, for the first time, whether a voluntary conveyance of that kind is fraudulent and void in regard to a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration, who had notice thereof at the time of his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Our statute against fraudulent alienations is eontained in the 2d section of the \u201c act to prevent frauds and perjuries,\u201d 1 R. C. p. 372. ch. 101. and is a condensation into one joint enactment, of the most important provisions as well of the statute 27 Eliz. ch. 4. in regard to purchasers, as of the statute 13 Eliz. ch. 5, in regard to creditors. In the construction however of our statute, it must be considered distributively; there being material points of distinction arising out of the difference between the two subjects, to wit, frauds against creditors and frauds against purchasers. Fraudulent conveyances in relation to purchasers must in the nature of things be exclusively prospective, as they cannot be directed against existing interests, but only against those thereafter to arise. The indebtedness of the grantor at the time of the convej'ance is, as we have seen, a material circumstance in reference to even subsequent creditors. But I regard it as wholly immaterial in reference to subsequent purchasers. There is, it is true, a <em>dictum </em>of lord <em>Mansfield to </em>the contrary in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Routledge, </em>Cowp. 713.; and in <em>Holcroft\u2019s </em>case, Dyer 294. in note, (cited in Atherley on Marriage Settlements, p. 199. note 1.) the circumstance of the grantor\u2019s freedom from indebtedness is relied on; and so that idea is expressed in Style 446. (cited in 9 East 63.) and is adopted by baron <em>Gilbert </em>in his Law of Evidence, p. 307. But a moment\u2019s reflection will serve to shew that the grantor\u2019s indebtedness can only be material in regard to creditors; for a fraudulent purpose against them can have no connexion with, or tendency to promote, a fraudulent purpose against a subsequent purchaser. Besides, the reason why a voluntary conveyance is ever regarded as fraudulent against creditors, is, that it withdraws the grantor\u2019s property from their preeminent demands; whereas the grantor owes no duty to a purchaser till the relation between them is about to arise; and then his only duty is to abstain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>from selling to him what he had previously conveyed away to another. It is the violation of this duty which constitutes the fraud against a subsequent purchaser; and not the mere intent with which the voluntary conveyance is made; for though that is a prominent matter in the statute, it is obviously idle unless it be accomplished, as there must be a purchaser to be defrauded, as well as an intent to defraud; which concurrence amounts to actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Thus, according to my reading of the statute, the purchaser must be actually defrauded; and how that can be where he has notice of the prior voluntary conveyance, is altogether beyond my conception. <em>Quod non decipitur qui scit se decipi, </em>is a maxim of law, as well as of common sense ; and the disregard of it by the expounders of the law can result in nothing but unqualified mischief. What protection can it afford to a purchaser with notice, to avoid the previous conveyance, except against the consequences of his own officious intermeddling ? Was that the mischief intended to be provided for ? Most assuredly not. The spirit of the statute is to set aside conveyances by which subsequent purchasers are deceived, and would otherwise be injured ; and such is the fair import of its language. It was enough to make void the accomplishment'of a fraudulent design on the part of the vendor, directed against the purchaser, and to sacrifice to that object the rights of the voluntary grantee, however innocent of all participation in the covinous purpose. In this result the statute goes beyond the common law, which recognized a conveyance to an innocent grantee, if made for a good consideration, such as natural affection, as paramount to the claim of a subsequent purchaser for a valuable consideration, though without notice. But it goes no further. It could never have been contemplated to sacrifice the innocent grantee, without \u2022necessity, to protect a purchaser who could only be in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>jured by his own folly or his own injustice. As to a purchaser without notice, the deceitful act of concealing the previous voluntary conveyance may well be referred back to an original fraudulent design on the part of the vendor when he made the conveyance : but when there is no effectual concealment, there is no room for such relation; and if the conveyance be held void, it must be upon the idea that the statute was directed not only against all fraudulent, but against all voluntary conveyances, however fair and meritorious, and was intended to enable the grantor to revoke his grant at pleasure, by means of a combination with a subsequent purchaser. If such had been the intent of the legislature, why was it not directly expressed, instead of leaving so important and comprehensive a provision to a vague and circuitous implication ? And why should the courts strain the words of the enactment, upon the imagination of a policy not only absurd but mischievous ? It is easy to perceive that the effect of such a construction is to defeat the just expectations of innocent grantees, and of their families and creditors, and to destroy their vested rights and lawful enjoyment, whenever the grantor, from passion or caprice, or the undue influence or improper practices of others, may be induced to reca\u00ed the provision or advancements he has made, not only upon a meritorious consideration, but in obedience to a sacred duty. I am not prepared for such a result, unless driven to it by an irresistible pressure of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The precise proposition, be it observed, which we are called upon to decide is, that a voluntary settlement of real estate, made, without actual fraud, by the grantor upon his wife and children, is by operation of the statute to be deemed conclusively fraudulent and void, against a subsequent purchaser from him for a valuable consideration, with full notice of the prior conveyance. The negative of this proposition, as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>marked by lord <em>Ellenborough </em>in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>9 East 63. where he reviews the cases, is expressed in some of those nearest to the statute of 27 Elizabeth, but the affirmative has been held by numerous decisions, and must now be regarded as the settled doctrine of the english courts; though a construction condemned by lord <em>Mansfield </em>in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Routledge, </em>Cowp. 705. and opposed to the opinions of lord <em>Hale, </em>lord <em>Rolle, </em>chief baron <em>Gilbert </em>and chief justice <em>Eyre, </em>as observed by <em>Spencer, </em>J. in <em>Verplank </em>v. <em>Sterry, </em>12 Johns. 555. and which is disapproved, though submitted to, by lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>lord <em>Thurlow, </em>and sir <em>James Mansfield, (Doe </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>above cited; <em>Evelyn </em>v. <em>Templar, 2 </em>Bro. C. C. 149. and <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Martyr, </em>4 Bos. &amp; Pul. N. R. 335.) and controverted by several respectable writers; 1 Fonbl. Eq. 280. n. Alherley on Marriage Settlements, p. 196. 197. 198. An examination of the cases will serve to shew, that while the weight of authority decidedly sustains the affirmative construction, it <em>strongly </em>impugns its correctness; for in most if not all the later cases, the judges yield merely to what they consider the current of adjudication, and though without a struggle, yet not without evident disapprobation or regret. The ruling motive with them is entitled to commendation : they are unwilling to disturb an established error, lest by so doing they should disturb the titles to estates. I think we may safely refuse to adopt it, for the like reason. In <em>Virginia, </em>so far as my information extends, there is no reason to apprehend that any estates are held by so frail a tenure as the expectation of the adoption of an unreasonable and unjust principle, which has never yet received the sanction of our judicial tribunals, nor the approbation of the legal profession. The structure of.our society and the habits of our people have led to the surrender and distribution by parents, while living, of. portions of their estates amongst their children; and when these are perfected by conveyances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>duly registered, the grantees become known to the world as both ostensible and real owners of the property, enjoying all the rights and incidents of ownership. This state of things would be most mischievously affected, both retroactively and prospectively, by the establishment of the doctrine in question: whereas in <em>England </em>the evil has been greatly mitigated by the practice of marriage settlements, in our country as yet almost unknown. It is difficult to believe that our legislature, when they were engaged in 17S5, shortly after the consummation of our independence, in condensing and abridging the english statute, thought they were adopting a construction of it not then <em>established </em>by the english courts; the more especially when we find that by the omission of the preamble, and part of the enacting clause, they have stricken from the advocates of the affirmative proposition their most plausible argument, by which the latter have made the proviso to mean directly the contrary of what it expresses. The proviso of the statute 27 Elizabeth, and of our statute, excepts out of the operation of the act conveyances made \u201c for a <em>good </em>consideration and <em>bona fide,\u201d </em>while the preamble of the english statute speaks of purchases for <em>money </em>or other good consideration, and the enacting part declares that fraudulent conveyances shall be void against purchasers for <em>money </em>or other good consideration. And from this it has been argued (see Atherley on Marriage Settlements 190. 191.) that by the words \u201c good consideration\u201d in the proviso must be understood <em>valuable </em>consideration. I need not consider the weight of this argument, which makes the proviso a mere nullity. It is enough for our purpose, that it has no foundation to rest upon in our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">The decisions of the english courts since our separation from the mother country, though entitled to great respect, are not obligatory here. The cases prior to that period are certainly not in harmony; and <em>Spencer, </em>J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>states, in <em>Verplank </em>v. Sterry, 12 Johns. 555. (though in opposition to the idea of chancellor <em>Kent, </em>as reported in the case from the court below under the name of <em>Sterry </em>v. <em>Arden, 1 </em>Johns. Ch. R. 270.) that the preponderance *n we\u2018ght and number is decidedly adverse to th\u00e9 doctrine which now prevails in the courts of <em>Westminster </em>hall. However that may be, in <em>Cathcart &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>5 Peters 264. chief justice <em>Marshall, </em>delivering the opinion of the court, says: \u201c There is some contrariety and some ambiguity in the old cases on the subject; but this court conceives that the modern decisions establishing the absolute conclusiveness of a subsequent gale to fix fraud on a family settlement made without valuable consideration\u2014fraud not to be repelled by any circumstances whatever\u2014go beyond the construction which prevailed at the american revolution, and ought not to be followed. The universally received doctrine of that day unquestionably went as far as this: A subsequent sale without notice, by a person who had made a settlement not on valuable consideration, was presumptive evidence of fraud, which threw on those claiming under such settlement the burthen of proving that it was made <em>bona fide. </em>This principle, therefore, according to the uniform course of this court, must be adopted in construing the statute of 27 Elizabeth as it applies to this case.\u201d Let this last proposition be conceded, though I express no <em>opinion </em>bow far a purchaser might be affected by a culpable negligence in not searching the registry, especially when coupled with open possession on the part of the grantee ; still it can avail the appellants nothing in the present case. Apply the presumption to the appellees here; and if my views are correct, it is completely repelled by the fact of actual notice on the part of the appellants when they took their incumbrances.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">For the reasons above stated, I am of opinion that the appellants have not sustained their pretensions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>whether in the character of creditors, or in the character of purchasers; and, therefore, that there is no error in the decree of the circuit court dismissing their bill.</p>\n<p id=\"A_y\">Allen, <em>J. </em>and Cabell, <em>P. </em>concurred. Brooke, <em>J. </em>was absent at the time of the decision : but the president stated that he was authorized by him to say, that if present he would also have concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-5\"> <em>Note by the reporter. </em>The case of the <em>State Bank of North Carolina </em>v. <em>Cowan &amp;c. </em>8 Leigh 238. was an action of debt brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>by the bank, in 'which the circuit court gave judgment for the defendants, and the court of appeals in April 1837 reversed that judgment and rendered judgment for the bank. After the judgment of the court of appeals, execution issued in favour of the bank against the defendants <em>Cowan, May, Smith </em>and <em>Jones, </em>which was levied on the goods of <em>May, </em>and he gave a forthcoming bond with surety, which was forfeited. When a motion was made on the forfeited forthcoming bond, the defendants produced evidence shewing that the charter of the bank had expired pending the appeal, to wit, on the 1st of January 1835, and on this ground asked the court to quash the forthcoming bond, and the execution under which it was taken. But it appearing that the judgment on which the execution issued was entered in the circuit court on the 12th of May 1837, in pursuance of the judgment of the court of appeals, and that the execution was in strict conformity to that judgment, the circuit court overruled the motion to quash, and rendered judgment on the bond. On a <em>supersedeas </em>to this judgment, the court of appeals (judges <em>Brooke, Stanard </em>and <em>Allen </em>concurring) reversed the judgment of the circuit court, and entered judgment quashing the execution and forthcoming bond. <em>Baldwin, </em>J. dissented, on the ground that it was incompetent to the defendants to shew that the charter had expired at a period anterior to the judgment of the court of appeals. The three other judges, not regarding that judgment as ascertaining the continued existence of the corporation at its date, <em>held </em>that the execution issued illegally in favour of a corporation whose charter was shewn by the evidence to have expired. This decision was in May 184-3, and the case will be found under the name of <em>May &amp;c. </em>v. <em>The State Bank of North Carolina, </em>in the reports of that period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> Judge <em>Stanard </em>had been counsel for the appellees, and was unwilling to sit in the case when its merits were to be considered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
