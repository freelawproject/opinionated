These two slaves then brought this suit in the superior court of chancery for the <em>Richmond </em>circuit, against the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>with the will annexed of <em>Frances T. A. Binford, </em>claiming their freedom under her will; and the cause coming on to be heard at the January term 1844, the court made a decree declaring them to be free. From this decree the administrator obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASQ2\">The appellees claim their freedom under the seventh clause of the will of <em>Frances T. A. Binford; </em>and the question is, are they embraced in it. The cardinal rule in the construction of wills, is the intention of the testator. In this case the testatrix, when she made her will and at her death, owned slaves then in her possession, and she owned an undivided interest in slaves, held by another person for life. It was uncertain when this interest would come into possession, or which of the slaves, or whether any of them, would ever belong to her. By the second clause of her will, she directs <em>all her negroes </em>to be hired out until her debts and legacies are paid, and by the seventh clause she directs that <em>all her negroes </em>be liberated, after the debts and legacies are paid. She uses the same language in both clauses, and in the last, she liberates her slaves after the object provided for in the second clause, is accomplished. Thus the description of the persons intended in each clause, is the same, and the reference in the seventh to the objects of the second, shews that the same persons are intended in both. But the second clause cannot refer to her portion of the dower slaves, because it was entirely uncertain when they would come into possession, or whether it might not be necessary to sell them in order to a division among the parties interested in them. Although, therefore, the terms of the seventh clause of the will are general enough to embrace the interest in the dower slaves, these general words will be restricted to effect the intention of the testator. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>1 Wash. 53; <em>Philips </em>v. <em>Melson, </em>3 Munf. 76.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-4\">The will fixes the time for the emancipation of the slaves at the period, when the debts and legacies are paid; hut these dower slaves might not then be in possession, as in fact they were not, for years afterwards. How then can she be supposed to refer to them ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>These slaves must claim as legatees under the will, and they must, therefore, he in a condition to take as such at the death of the testatrix. But, at that time, the testatrix had no title to these particular slaves, but only a joint undivided interest with others, in the whole of the dower slaves, and it was not, and could not be known then, which of them would be allotted to her. At that time, then, these persons were not in a condition to take any benefit under the will, and their subsequent allotment to the representative of the testatrix, cannot relate back so as to give them a capacity which they did not then possess.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-4\"><em>Minor, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfpI\">It is obvious, from the will of <em>Frances T. A. </em>Binford, that she intended to dispose of her whole estate; and she shews her intention that her relations shall not enjoy it. And the question is, has she accomplished that intention, or has she died intestate as to her interest in the dower slaves then in the possession of <em>Mrs. Price.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-5\">The interest of the testatrix in these dower slaves, was a vested interest. The slaves were in being, and her interest in them certain, and that interest has since come into possession, and the slaves are her slaves and now in the possession of her representative. If they pass by the will, then, it is clear they are emancipated, as she has liberated <em>all her negroes.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-6\">It is said that the general words of the seventh clause, is to be restricted by the second. In the second clause of the will, the object of the testatrix is to provide for the payment of her debts and legacies from the hires of her slaves, and of necessity that provision must be limited to the negroes in possession, but not to the negroes in possession at the death of the testatrix; but if the life estate of <em>Mrs. Price </em>had terminated before the debts and legacies were paid, then the slaves derived from that source would have been embraced in the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>vision for paying the debts and legacies. But in the seventh clause of the will, the object of the testatrix is the liberation of her negroes, and she uses terms broad enough to include all, whether in possession or reversion. Though, therefore, the same terms are used in both clauses of the will, the fact that the general words are restricted, in the second clause from the necessity of the case, where the testatrix had one object in view, it does not follow, that they must be so restricted in the seventh clause, where such necessity does not exist, and where the object is wholly different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-5\"><em>As </em>to the objection that it might have been necessary to sell the dower slaves in order to a division, it is enough to say that the court would not have permitted them to be sold if they could be divided, and in fact they have not been sold, but have come to the possession of the representative of the testatrix.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-6\">But it is said that these appellees were not in a condition to take at the death of the testatrix, and, therefore, they are not now entitled to the benefit of the provisions of this will. It is true that a will of personalty speaks as at the death of the testator, and in this respect, it has a larger scope than wills relating to real estate. But these slaves are not after-acquired property; but at the death of the testatrix she had a vested interest in them; and although they afterwards came into possession, they came by virtue of a title existing before her death. In Powell on Devises, <em>22 </em>Law Libr. 58, it is said that a reversion in fee will pass by general words in a will, though there be other real estate in possession which would answer the general words: and it will pass though it is not probable that the estate will ever come into possession. <em>Chester </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>3 P. Wms. 56, cited by <em>Powell; Ridout </em>v. <em>Pain, </em>3 Aik. 492; <em>Church </em>v. <em>Mundy, </em>15 Ves. 396. This court has held that slaves may be emancipated after a life estate, and that under the will, children born after the testator\u2019s death, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>during the life estate, were entitled to freedom under the words \u201call his slaves.\u201d <em>Erskine </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>9 Leigh 188.
