The judgment o\u00ed a competent court, will be considered right, until <em>regularly </em>reversed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\">.Appeal from the superior court of law of Brunswick county. The facts were these : Thornton Jett became the appearance bail of Robert Wallace, in a suit brought by Robert M. Walker, against the said Wallace. Judgment was obtained against the principal and <em>bail\", </em>and an execution issued against the goods and chattels of the said Wallace and Jett. The forthcoming bond recites in the condition, that an execution had issued against Wallace only. This bond being forfeited, notice was given by the plaintiff, that he would move for judgment; hut the plaintiff himself moved the court to quash the bond <em>\u2022, </em>which was accordingly done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">This bond being thus quashed, Walker issued a new execution against the goods and chattels of Jett, appearance bail as aforesaid of Wallace, which was levied on two negroes, and a forthcoming bond taken. Jett gave notice to Walker, that he should move the court to quash the last mentioned execution and forthcoming bond, the said execution having issued illegally. Upon hearing this motion, the court over-ruled <em>it; </em>and Jett filed a bill of exceptions, setting forth the foregoing facts, and appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-9\"><em>Wickham </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_p\">relied on the case of <em>Beale </em>vs. <em>Wilson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as an express authority, to shew that the order quashing the first forthcoming bond was erroneous; and if so, the second execution must have been improperly issued.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOn\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\n<em>Leigh, contra,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZy\">contended that as Jett was no party to the judgment on the first forthcoming bond, he could not appeal from that judgment. It was <em>res inter alios acta. </em>But, if he could appeal from that judgment, he has not done so in the present case. The judgment appealed from, is the judgment on the <em>second </em>forthcoming bond <em>\u00a1 </em>and the proceedings on the <em>first, </em>are only brought to the view of the court incidentally, by a bill of exceptions in a different suit. The judgments of <em>competent </em>courts, are not to be reversed in this indirect mode. But, even if these principles are erroneous, the judgment of the superior court quashing the first bond, was perfectly correct. The execution was issued against the goods of Wallace and Jett, but the execution mentioned in the condition of the bond, is one against the estate of <em>Wallace only. </em>This Variance clearly vitiated the bond, and <em>left the </em>appellee at libei\u2019ty to take out a new execution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-7\">. <em>Wickham </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b223-10\"> 4 Munf. 880.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b224-8\">Judge Brooke,</author>\n<p id=\"A7H\">delivered the opinion of the court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The supersedeas in this case, upon an inspection of the record, is found to extend only to the judgment overruling the appellant\u2019s motion, to quash the second execution and forthcoming bond. The court, therefore, not deciding whether the appellant, even if there was error in the first judgment, would be entitled to a supersedeas, is of opinion that there is no error in the second judgment, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Judge Cabell was absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">NOTE.\u2014After the decision in this case, Wickham intimated that he should apply for a supersedeas, to the judgment quashing the first forthcoming bond; hut Judge Brooke informed him, that the judges had tasen that subject into consideration, and had determined, if such a motion should be made, to refuse it; on the ground of the variance, between the execution and the forthcoming bond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
