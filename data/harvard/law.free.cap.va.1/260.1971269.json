The declaration on this bond lays the breach on the defendant\u2019s <em>neglecting to bring suits for the recovery of the </em>debts, &amp;c. The variance is not material, particularly after verdict\u2014if it was material, the defendant might have demurred.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\">This was an action of debt, brought by the appellee in the County Court, upon a bond given by the testator of the appellant, with condition, that the said <em>John Hawkins </em>would faithfully collect,fon commission, certain debts due to the appellee by bonds, (as by list annexed,) and would pay the amount so collected, and return an account of his collection, and also surrender up all bonds not fully paid, when required, (except such as might be lodged with clerks, or with lawyers, to bring suit on,) the obligor agreeing, to perform the duty of a collector, and in all things relative to the business, to act for the benefit of the obligee to the best of his skill. The defendant pleaded, that he had performed the conditions of the said bond. To this the plaintiff replied, protesting that the defendant had not performed the conditions of the said bond, and assigned as a breach that the said <em>Hawkins </em>did not well and truly collect the several sums of money due on the bonds contained in the list, to the said writing obligatory annexed, nor use his best endeavours to collect the same without delay,; but that he omitted to make timely application for those debts, and <em>neglected to bring suits for their </em>recovery, though often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>requested so to do, as also to render an account of his collection; but that on the contrary he refused to account, or to pay the whole of the moneys collected at any one period, and at all times retained a considerable part thereof, as well as of the bonds, Stc. To this the defendant rejoined generally. The jury found a verdict in favour of the plaintiff for <em>51., </em>which was set aside by the Court, and a new trial awarded. The second verdict was in favour of the defendant, which being also set aside, the jury upon the third trial, found for the plaintiff 914/. in damages. The defendant then moved for a new trial, which was over-ruled. The judgment was affirmed upon an appeal to the District Court of <em>Richmond, </em>where judgment was entered for the damages and costs of that Court, to be levied of the goods, &amp;c. of the testator, in the hands of the executrix, if so much she had, if not <em>then of her mun proper goods. </em>From this judgment, the executrix appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-3\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-4\">The objection relied upon in the District Court, went principally to the number of new trials awarded by the County Court, but I do not consider that as a point which can be insisted upon.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">I shall coniine myself to the variance between the breaches assigned, and the condition of the bond upon \u2022which the suit is founded; and if it should be considered as material by the Court, it will, of course, be fatal to the judgment. The rule of law Is well established, that if any one of the breaches assigned be for the non-performance of a duty, which the obligor hath not undertaken to execute, and general damages are assessed, the verdict is bad. One of the breaches in this replication is, that the testator <em>did not bring suits upon the bonds put into his </em>hands, and there is no part of the condition of his obligation which Imposes this as a duty upon him. If I am right in this objection, the judgment of the County Court must be reversed,</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-6\">The next error which I think the record exhibits, <em>h </em>In the judgment of the <em>District Court. </em>The executrix is condemned to pay the <em>damages </em>out of her <em>orw </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>estate, </em>in case of a deficiency of assets. I do not re-any precedent of this Court upon the point, and, therefore, if I am not precluded by any such from ma]cjng the objection, I shall contend upon principle, as well as upon the Act of Assembly, that the damages ought not, in any event, to be paid by the executrix. Nothing could be more unjust and unreasonable, than to punish an executor for his endeavours to preserve his testator\u2019s estate from the effects of a judgment, which he may suppose to be erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">It would seem to be a duty imposed upon him, from the very nature of his office. He would, (I conceive,) be highly reprehensible were he to submit to a decision, (perhaps ruinous to creditors and legatees,) in his opinion erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-6\">The damages upon reversal are given in lieu of all damages or interest, which makes them a part of the <em>debt </em>due from the estate, and should, therefore, be chargeable upon the same fund as the principal. '</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOe\"><em>Monoid, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-8\">I admit the law upon the first point to be as Mr. <em>Marshall </em>states it; but I deny the application of it the present case. By the condition of this bond, <em>Hawkins </em>undertakes <em>to use his best endeavours to collect the debts, </em>and if coercive measures were necessary for that end, he was bound to make use of them. It was an essential part of his duty, which he was as much bound to perform, as he was to demand payment of the debts. So that the breach, though not assigned in the very words of the condition, is in strict conformity with the meaning and spirit of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-9\">\u00c1s to the second objection, if it were to prevail upon the ground of the hardship, it might go a great deal farther than Mr. <em>Marshall </em>expects ; for it certainly is not more unjust that the executor should, out of his own pocket, satisfy the damage occasioned by his own act, where his testator\u2019s estate is insufficient, than in cases where he is charged for a false, or perhaps unskilfully drawn plea.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-10\"><em>Marshall, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArH\">The right of a collector to institute suits indiscriminately, and thereby to sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ject his principal to the possible payment of costs, must depend upon the special authority given him. A collector may certainly be clothed with such powers\u2014-or a man may collect, and yet not possess them. If they are meant to be delegated, it is easy to express such intention, and words of exclusion cannot be necessary. The agreement of the obligor to return all bonds not in suit, proves nothing against me, because <em>Berkley </em>might chose to direct the institution of suits himself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b283-3\">Lyons, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7R\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">The variance between the condition of the bond and the breach assigned, is not <em>material. </em>Agreements are always to be construed according to the evident intent of the parties, appearing from the deed itself, without a rigid adherence to the letter. This rule is laid down in the case of <em>Freshwater </em>v. <em>Eaton , Str. </em>49, and is certainly a correct one. It is plain, that the intention in this case was to vest in the collector a power to bring suits, and that the exercise of such a power was necessarily involved in the under - taking on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The case of <em>Bache et al </em>v. <em>Proctor, Dougl. </em>382, Is stronger than the present. The condition <em>o\u00ed </em>the bond was, to render a fair, just, and perfect account, in writing, of all sums received. It was deter - mined that the obligor was guilty of a breach of the condition, by neglecting to <em>pay over </em>such sums. Besides, the objection in this case comes after a verdict. The defendant, if he had considered the varianee material, might have demurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b283-10\"> <em>Buster's ex. v. </em>Wallace. 4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 88</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
