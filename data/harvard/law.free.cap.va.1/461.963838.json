Brown </em>his surety therein. The decree was affirmed by the court of appeals, (see <em>Templeman </em>v. <em>Fauntleroy, </em>3 Rand. 434.); after which, <em>Brown </em>the surety, having made an arrangement with <em>Fauntleroy </em>by which he procured from him a transfer of the decree, sued out execution upon it against <em>Templeman, </em>on which the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>25 68 dollars 40 cents was made by the sale of property \u00b0f <em>Templeman, </em>and applied to the discharge of the decree on the 28th of May 1827, leaving the balance then due 882 dollars 8 cents, being less than the amount of damages and costs incurred by the appeal, which was 1079 dollars 6 cents. <em>Brown </em>then caused an action to be instituted on the administration bond of <em>Templeman, </em>in the name of <em>Fauntleroy </em>as relator, against <em>George Glascock </em>administrator of <em>Richard M. Glascock, </em>who was one of <em>Templeman!s </em>sureties therein, in which action a judgment was recovered against the defendant for 882 dollars 8 cents, the balance remaining due as aforesaid on the decree, with interest from the 28th of May 1827 till paid, and the costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-5\"><em>Glascock's </em>administrator thereupon filed his bill in the superior court of chancery for the <em>Fredericksburg </em>district, against <em>Brown, Fauntleroy, </em>and the justices to whom the administration bond was taken (nominal plaintiffs in the action at law), setting forth the foregoing <em>facts, insisting </em>that <em>Brown, </em>as surety in <em>the </em>appeal bond, was bound to indemnify the sureties in the administration bond against the decree appealed from, and therefore praying that all proceedings on the judgment might be injoined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-6\">The injunction was awarded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\"><em>Brown </em>answered, controverting the claim of equity asserted by the plaintiff in his bill, and insisting on his right to enforce <em>the </em>judgment. As to the other defendants, the bill was taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-8\">- At the final hearing on the 28th of June 1833, the circuit superior court of law and chancery for <em>Spotsylvania </em>county (to which the cause had been transferred) decreed that the injunction be perpetuated with costs. From which decree <em>Brown </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-9\"><em>C. </em>and <em>G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2l\">said, the court below had perpetuated the injunction upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>authority, no doubt, of <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, 2 </em>Vern. 608. and the cases in this court decided upon the same principle. But this case was plainly distinguishable from all of them. In <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddoclc, </em>the original surety was bound in an obligation for the payment of an ascertained sum of money acknowledged to be due from the principal; and the undertaking of the bail to the action against the principal was strictly an additional security acquired by the creditor for the same debt. Here the surety in the administration bond was not bound for the payment of <em>a debt </em>to <em>Fauntleroy, </em>or any other creditor of the decedent; his obligation was only for the administrator\u2019s performance of his duty by faithfully administering the assets, and the extent of his responsibility was measured by the amount of assets which the administrator might misapply. In case of such misapplication, the surety would at all events be liable to those entitled to the estate, whether <em>Fauntle7-oy </em>succeeded or failed in his claim. When the administrator appealed from the decree in favour of <em>Fauntleroy, </em>the surety in the appeal bond undertook to satisfy the amount of that decree with damages and costs, in case of affirmance. His responsibility was to be measured by the decree alone; that of the surety in the administration bond by the amount of assets misapplied, without any reference whatever to the amount of the decree. <em>Glascock </em>and <em>Brown, </em>then, being subjected to liabilities different in amount, which were to be enforced upon wholly different events, and for the benefit, it might be, of different persons, could not be regarded as occupying the same mutual relation as the successive sureties in <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock. </em>They were in no sense sureties for the same debt. Again, in <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, </em>the demand against the principal was for his own individual debt, which he must have known to be justly due, and the interposition of the bail enabled him, it may be, to protract a vexatious litigation, and certainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>deprived the creditor and the original surety of that * security for the payment of the debt which was afforded by the imprisonment of the debtor. Here, the princidebtor is an administrator, charged in his official, not jn jjjs individual character, with a demand the justice of which he could not personally know; and the due performance of his official duty justified if it did not absolutely require him to take the opinion of the court of last resort as to the validity of the claim against the estate, and for that purpose to <em>give the </em>bond and security demanded of him. And it cannot be said that any security which the sureties in the administration bond possessed has been withdrawn from them by the appeal, or their rights in any wise impaired thereby. Notwithstanding the appeal, they had at all times their remedy under the statute or by bill in equity, to exonerate themselves from responsibility or secure the assets of the estate. The principle of <em>Parsons v. Briddock </em>ought not to be farther extended, since its operation is to throw the whole burthen <em>on one </em>surety in exoneration of another. No case has hitherto occurred, in which the court has actively interposed to charge a subsequent for the benefit of a prior surety, by taking from the subsequent surety a legal advantage fairly obtained, even though both of them were strictly sureties for the same debt, which it has been shewn that <em>Glascock </em>and <em>Brown </em>are not. <em>Brown </em>has fairly obtained the advantage of a judgment at law against <em>Glascock, </em>ascertaining a <em>devastavit </em>by the administrator <em>Templeman, </em>for which <em>Glascock </em>as one of his sureties is legally responsible : he seeks no aid of equity, but merely asks that the court will leave him to the undisturbed prosecution of legal rights, which he insists it was nowise against conscience for him to secure.\u2014As to the principle on which sureties for the payment of money are held to be exonerated by a new contract giving indulgence to the principal debtor without their concurrence, it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>have no application to this case, though the intromission \u2022 of the surety in the appeal bond were considered to produce the same effect on the rights of the prior sureties, as a new arrangement entered into by the creditor himself with the administrator would have. It would be most mischievous to deny the creditor the privilege of making such arrangement unless at the peril of discharging the sureties in the administration bond. Those sureties have no right to interfere with the question whether the debt claimed be justly due or not, or to call upon the administrator to pay it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b493-6\">Barry, for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoV\">argued, that the decree against <em>Templeman, </em>being personal, ascertained that he had in his hands assets sufficient to discharge the claim of <em>Fauntleroy, </em>and properly applicable to that purpose. If he failed to make the application, the sureties in his administration bond would become responsible. The effect of the decree, therefore, was to make them sureties for the payment of an ascertained sum of money due from <em>Templeman </em>in his individual character to <em>Fauntleroy. </em>Being thus invested with the character of ordinary sureties for the payment of a debt, they were consequently invested with all the rights appertaining to such sureties. <em>Glascock, </em>as one of these sureties, thus acquired in equity a right to the benefit of all additional securities for the debt, obtained by <em>Fauntleroy </em>the creditor in the prosecution of his claim against the principal debtor. The obligation of <em>Brown </em>in the appeal bond was such additional security: and therefore <em>Brown </em>was in equity liable to discharge the debt for the relief of <em>Glascock. Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, 2 </em>Vern. 608. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Morley, </em>11 Ves. <em>22. M\u2019Mahon &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Fawcett &amp;c. 2 </em>Rand. 514. <em>Douglass v. Fagg, </em>8 Leigh 588. <em>Givens &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Nelson\u2019s ex\u2019or &amp; al. </em>10 Leigh 382.\u2014Further, the sureties in the administration bond had a right to pay off the decree, and take a cession of the creditor\u2019s rights in the same for their indemnity. The effect of giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the appeal bond was to suspend the remedies of the ^ *\u25a0 *\u25a0 creditor, and consequently those of the sureties, to enforce payment of the decree from <em>Templeman </em>the prindebtor; an effect which, had it been produced ^y act 0f the creditor himself, would in equity have discharged <em>Glascoclc </em>the surety. This effect having been produced by the voluntary act of <em>Brown </em>in becoming surety in the appeal bond, he could acquire no right in equity to enforce payment from <em>Glascoclc </em>the first surety; particularly when the whole balance unpaid by the principal debtor, and sought to be recovered from Glascoclc, consists of <em>damages </em>incurred by the appeal, and so is an accretion of the debt resulting from theSnterference of <em>Brovm </em>himself. It is conceded that an arrangement by a creditor of a decedent with the administrator, for forbearance of suit, will not in general have the effect of discharging the sureties in the administration bond. But it is otherwise when the administrator has become liable <em>for </em>a <em>devastavit, and </em>the responsibility of the sureties has become direct to the particular creditor; which is the case here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b494-6\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AKsl\">delivered the opinion of the court as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The court is of opinion that the sureties in an administration bond are not to be regarded as sureties for the debts due from the estate, but for the due application of the assets that may come to the hands of the administrator, and that the remedies of such sureties to be relieved from or indemnified against their responsibilities are provided by statute, and such remedies are not impaired or delayed by an appeal of the administrator from a judgment or decree charging him to any one creditor in respect to such assets. The result of any such appeal does not affect the measure of the responsibility of the sureties in the administration bond, because whether the appeal be or be not successfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>prosecuted, the responsibility of the sureties, being measured by the assets, is not enlarged or diminished. If the administrator succeeds in such appeal, the assets would be liberated from the claim of the particular creditor, but would still remain liable to other creditors, or to legatees or distributees, and the sureties would remain liable for the application of them to such other creditors, legatees or distributees: if the administrator fails, the liability of the sureties still remains restricted to the measure of the assets, and if those assets be not sufficient to pay the costs and damages on the appeal, in addition to the judgment or decree appealed from, the sureties could not be made responsible therefor. The court is further of opinion that as the sureties have been charged by the judgment at law with the amount of the decree, damages and costs, it must be intended that assets to that amount were in the hands of the administrator, for the due application of which the sureties were responsible; and it cannot be material whether that responsibility be made subservient to the claim of the creditor in this case, or, by a liberation from that claim, left chargeable by other creditors, or legatees and distributees : that the principle of the case of <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Briddock, </em>and other kindred cases, does not warrant the claim of sureties such as the appellee, to be substituted to the remedy of the creditor on the appeal bond ; and that the decree in this case, founded on such supposed right of substitution, is erroneous. Therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Decree reversed with costs, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
