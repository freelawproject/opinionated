Held, no such lien exists.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-8\">This case was slated by Allen, J. at the time of delivering his opinion, to be as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-9\">In the year 1792, <em>Stephen Jett, </em>the owner of the equitable title to certain lots in the town of <em>Christiansburg, Montgomery </em>county, (the legal title to which was to pass through tho trustees of the town, and was then outstanding in the original patentee or his representatives,) executed to <em>William </em>and <em>Gilbert Christian </em>his title bond, by which he bound himself to make or cause to be made to them a conveyance for three fourths of two lots, as soon as the trustees could make a title to the original purchasers, and also bound bimself to deliver possession to the <em>Christians, </em>within a few weeks. Though <em>Gilbert Christian </em>was mentioned as a joint purchaser with <em>William, </em>it seems to have been determined in a subsequent controversy, that <em>William </em>was entitled to the whole benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of the contract. <em>William Christian </em>appears to have obtained possession of the <em>property, </em>and leased it to one <em>Bratton. ' </em>On the first of November 1794, whilst the property was held by the tenant of <em>Christian, </em>articles of agreement were entered into between <em>Christian </em>and <em>Booth, by </em>which <em>Christian </em>sold the property to <em>Booth </em>for \u00bf\u00a3250. to be paid in property at a future day, and bound himself <em>to </em>give security, upon the payment of the purchase money, for the making of a conveyance as soon as a title could be procured from the trustees. The agreement further provided that <em>Booth </em>should get possession as soon as <em>Bratton's </em>lease expired, and be entitled to any rent which might be due from <em>Bratton </em>at the end of his term. This contract -was not complied with. <em>Booth </em>did not deliver the property to be paid, by the day agreed on, and <em>Christian </em>did not give security for the title. Some payments were made, and on the 9th of April 1795, another arrangement was entered into between the parties. By this it was agreed, that upon full payment of the balance of the purchase money, or immediately afterwards, <em>Christian </em>should assign to <em>Booth </em>the title bond of <em>Jett; </em>but <em>Booth </em>was not to have possession until a lease to one <em>Miller </em>(probably a purchaser from <em>Bratton) </em>had terminated. And upon <em>Christian's </em>compliance with this agreement, he was to be exonerated from all further responsibility.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-4\">At this stage of the transaction, <em>Booth </em>was not entitled to possession of the lots, or to a conveyance <em>for </em>them, or even to the equitable right held under <em>Jett. </em>The possession was held <em>by </em>the tenant of <em>Christian, </em>and until <em>Booth </em>paid <em>Christian </em>the balance of the purchase money, he had no right to call for an assignment of the title bond. His interest consisted of an executory contract, which authorized him, upon the payment of the purchase money, to demand a transfer of a title bond. He never did pay the balance of the purchase money; the bond was not assigned to him, nor did he acquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>possession of the lots. The extent of his interest was i _ never enlarged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqN\">Whilst his claim remained in this condition, on the 25th of March 1797, he sold it to <em>Isaac Rentfro, </em>and bound himself to give up to <em>Rentfro </em>all the bonds and receipts relative thereto, and to make him all the right he had received or should receive by virtue of his purchase from <em>Christian, </em>for a sum to be adjudged by certain persons named. On the same day, <em>Rentfro, </em>by a distinct article (which recites that he had purchased of <em>Booth </em>the lots which <em>Booth </em>bought of <em>Christian, </em>the price of which was to be ascertained by valuers) bound himself to pay the sum to be ascertained as aforesaid, after deducting what might be due to <em>Christian, </em>in good land in <em>Tennessee, </em>by the 29th of December next ensuing the date of the contract. <em>Rentfro </em>never got possession of the property : it was still held by <em>Bratton </em>or <em>Miller, </em>under the lease. On the 17th day of April 1797, <em>Rentfro </em>sold his interest in the subject to <em>John </em>and <em>Roswell Johnston, </em>and bound himself to give them possession as soon as it could be obtained from <em>Bratton, </em>and to make them such right as the holders of the legal title should make to other purchasers, or give them <em>Jett's </em>title bond for such right. The <em>Johnstons </em>paid the purchase money agreed to be paid by them to <em>Rentfro, </em>obtained possession of the lots, and, on the 17th of July 1802, procured from <em>Jett </em>an order on the trustees for a deed. After continuing in possession several years, they sold to <em>Page, </em>the present owner, who afterwards obtained a deed from the trustees ; having previously been in possession, and paid to the <em>Johnstons </em>the whole of the purchase money. He has held possession ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-7\">The lots seem never to have been valued under the contract between <em>Booth </em>and <em>Renfro; </em>at least there is no evidence of such valuation in this record. <em>Booth, </em>however, went to <em>Tennessee </em>to get the land which <em>Rent-fro </em>was to pay; from which it may be inferred that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>some valuation was made, or that the parties had agreed on a price; since it would have been useless to go for the land, until the price of the lots had been ascertained. Why the land was not paid, does not distinctly appear, nor is it material to enquire. It is certain, from the admissions of all parties, that no land was paid. Rentfro, in his answer to a bill filed by one <em>Glenn, </em>asserting a claim under <em>Gilbert Christian to </em>a moiety of the property, says that the contract was changed; that instead of the <em>Tennessee </em>lands, he conveyed to <em>Christian </em>100 acres of land in <em>Montgomery </em>county, in discharge of some claim which <em>Christian </em>held on <em>Booth; </em>and there still being a balance due from him to <em>Booth, </em>the latter directed him to pay it over to <em>Christian, </em>which he did. This answer, filed in <em>another </em>case, is no evidence of the facts set out in it; but it serves to explain the testimony of <em>William Christian, </em>who says he received from <em>Renfro </em>100 acres of land and 40 dollars in money, for <em>Booth. </em>Another witness, <em>John Gardner </em>(one of the trustees) says, that <em>Renfro </em>insisted he had paid for the lots, and <em>Booth </em>that he had not. And one of the subscribing witnesses states, he has every reason to believe that <em>Renfro </em>did pay, as he was not to get possession until he paid; that possession was transferred to the <em>Johnstons, </em>his vendees, at his request, and the witness never heard any thing else than that he had paid. <em>Renfro </em>seems to have been a man in good circumstances, and in 1798 he sold his property, or a portion of it, and removed to Kentucky, where he died in good circumstances in 1817. <em>Booth </em>was a poor man, and he absconded from his creditors and removed to <em>Kanawha </em>county, where he died in 1801, leaving a widow (who died about four months after him) and several children, the eldest about 12 years, the youngest 13 months old. In 1827, administration on <em>Booth's </em>estate was granted by the county court of <em>Montgomery ; </em>and in the month of August 1827, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the administrator filed this bill, alleging that the purchase money was never paid by <em>Rentfro ; </em>that the subsequent holders were purchasers with notice; and that the property in their hands was subject to the vendor\u2019s lien for the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-4\">The cause came on to be heard before the circuit court of <em>Montgomery, </em>the 26th day of May 1836, on the bill, the answers of <em>Page </em>and of <em>John </em>and <em>Roswell Johnston, </em>an order of publication against <em>Renfro's </em>heirs, which appeared to have been duly executed, the depositions of witnesses, and the exhibits. Whereupon the court was of opinion, that <em>Page </em>was not a purchaser without notice, and therefore that the lots in his possession were liable for the purchase money and interest, due from <em>Rentfro </em>to <em>Booth's </em>administrator; and the price of the said lots at the time of the sale by <em>Booth </em>to <em>Rentfro, </em>not having been fixed and ascertained by the persons to whom it was referred, and they having since died or removed, the court decreed that a commissioner take an account, ascertaining and stating the value of the said lots at the time of the sale thereof by <em>Booth </em>to <em>Rentfro, </em>and how much of the purchase money, if any, had been paid, and the balance due, with interest thereon from the 25th of December 1797.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-5\">From this decree an appeal was allowed, on the petition of <em>Page </em>and <em>John </em>and <em>Roswell Johnston.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-6\">The cause was argued by <em>Preston </em>and <em>C. Johnson </em>for the appellants, and by <em>M'Comas </em>and the <em>attorney general </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b193-7\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT-\">The first objection which presents itself is the staleness of the demand, and the impossibility of doing justice at this distance of time. The court is called upon to investigate, by the dim lights furnished by this record, transactions which occurred thirty years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>before the institution of this suit. The cases on this subject are fully reviewed and commented on in <em>Carr's adm'r &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Chapman's legatees, </em>5 Leigh 164. and <em>Hayes &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Goode &amp; al. </em>7 Leigh 452. The presumption of' satisfaction is not the only consideration which operates on the court in refusing to entertain such a bill. In <em>Hercy </em>v. <em>Dinwoody, 2 </em>Ves. jun. 87. it was contended that the case was not open to the presumption of satisfaction, because, the matter being in suit, the defendants could not discharge themselves by a payment or settlement <em>in pais. </em>The master of the rolls admitted this, but said\u2014\u201cFor the reasons given in <em>Deloraine </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 633. independent of the question of satisfaction, but on account of the very neglect, and the mischief and disturbance that may arise to families,\u201d (and I may add, to subsequent purchasers,) \u201cthough the presumption of satisfaction is not so strong, yet the <em>laches </em>and neglect may make it a matter of public policy that the party guilty of it shall abide the consequences.\u201d Here the property has passed into the hands of third persons, who have paid their purchase money; and whatever may have been the fact, there is certainly no proof that they had actual notice of this claim when the deed was procured from the trustees. The aid of a court of equity is now invoked against them, at a time when the truth is no longer attainable. Was there ever a valuation ? From <em>Booth's </em>trip to <em>Tennessee to receive </em>the land, the inference is strong that there had been: but we have no evidence of it. Was the contract changed, as <em>Renfro </em>alleges ? The evidence of <em>Christian, </em>that he received from <em>Renfro </em>100 acres of land and 40 dollars, for <em>Booth, </em>would seem to shew that it had been. But what that contract was, and whether it had been complied with (as <em>Rentfro, </em>according to the testimony of <em>Gardner, </em>asserted, though <em>Booth </em>denied it,) we know not, and, <em>from </em>the proofs in the record, cannot ascertain. The first step must be taken in the dark, and no ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>vanee can be made without the hazard of injustice. It may be the misfortune of those asserting this claim, that such obscurity involves the transaction. But even if they were exempt from the imputation of <em>laches, </em>it would not be the province of a court of equity to relieve them at the risque of doing injustice to fair purchasers. <em>Booth </em>however, if his claim was a valid one, had ample opportunities to assert it during his lifetime. He failed to do so; permitted his vendee to remove from the country fullhanded, though his own embarrassments should have urged him to enforce his claim, if in truth it had not been adjusted ; and he himself subsequently absconded from his creditors, without giving them (so far as we see) any intimation of this claim as a means of satisfying their demands. Under these circumstances, he could not be exempted from the imputation of culpable neglect. I think that on this ground alone,-\u2014the impossibility, from the lapse of time and the obscurity of the transactions, of arriving at the truth of the case, the court should have dismissed the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\">I am equally satisfied that if the claim bad been asserted in proper time, the vendor\u2019s lien did not attach. What did <em>Booth </em>dispose of? Not the property : to that he had no claim. Under his contract of the 9th of April 1795, he might have become entitled to an assignment of <em>Jett's </em>title bond, and to the possession of the property, upon the payment of the balance of the purchase money to <em>Christian. </em>But he never paid that <em>balance; </em>it was not paid until the contract was made with <em>Rentfro; </em>and upon its being paid by <em>Rentfro, Christian </em>assigned to his vendees, the <em>Johnstons. </em>Suppose, upon the payment of this balance by <em>Rentfro, Christian </em>had refused to surrender or assign <em>Jett's </em>title bond; what would have been the remedy ? <em>Rentfro </em>could have sued at law for the breach of contract in failing to assign the title bond : he had his election to adopt that course, and it would have been out of <em>Booth's </em>power to control him. What <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>then becomes of the supposed lien for purchase money? It will not be pretended that it would attach on the personal subject. The contract transferred a right of action, and nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">It has been contended in argument, that there was an express contract for the lien, and that this is proved by the statement of <em>Taylor, </em>in the suit of <em>Glenn </em>against <em>Christian. </em>To that suit <em>Booth </em>was no party. The record would be no evidence against him, and cannot be used for him. But even if the statement were evidence, it proves no such contract. That is inferred from the fact that the papers were deposited with <em>Taylor. </em>But that deposit, I feel satisfied, had reference alone to the transactions between <em>Christian </em>and <em>Booth. </em>They had attempted to settle and ascertain the balance due. By the agreement of the 9th of April 1795, <em>Christian </em>was not to assign until he was paid; and the papers were no doubt deposited with a view to the delivery when he should be paid. And accordingly, when <em>Rentfro </em>did pay the balance, <em>Christian </em>transferred his interest held under <em>Jett\u2019s </em>title bond, to <em>Rentfro\u2019s </em>vendees.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">I think the decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The other judges concurred on both grounds. Decree therefore reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
