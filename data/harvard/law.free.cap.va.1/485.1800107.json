And he referred to the acts of May 1778, ch. 17. 9 Hen. Stat. at Large, p. 468. May 1779, ch. 20. October 1781, ch. 40. 10 Id. pp. 85. 501, 6. May 1782, ch. 39. \u00a7 3. 11. 11 Id. pp. 66, 8. which statutes, he said, gave this power to the hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>tings court: and these acts had never been repealed. But, supposing that the bond was not good as a statutory bond, another question would still remain, whether it was not a good and obligatory bond by the common law, as well to the surety as the principal? The surety ought not to be allowed to deny the obligation of the bond, since, by joining in it, he had enabled his principal to get the public money in his hands and convert it to his own use. There were many cases, in which bonds taken as statutory bonds, had been held not to be good as such, and yet good and obligatory by the common law both upon principal and surety. <em>Johnstons </em>v. <em>Meriwether, </em>3 Call 523.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AV6F\">\n<em>B. Browne,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AH6\"><em>contra, </em>submitted that the statutes referred to by the <em>attorney general </em>were not permanent laws, being enacted for the particular occasion. And, he said, as there was no existing law at the time this bond was executed, authorising the sergeant of the hustings court to collect public taxes, or the court to appoint a public collector for the city, or to take a bond from him, the bond was null and void as to the surety at least. <em>Branch </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Call 510. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Lee, 3 </em>Call 421. <em>U. States </em>v. <em>Morgan, 3 </em>Wash. Circ. Court Rep. 10. Then, supposing the bond in question not good as a statutory bond, how could it be good under the common law? The bond is taken to the governor and his successors: if not put in suit during the term of office of the governor to whom it was made payable, no suit could ever be brought on it; for, surely, the governor\u2019s successors could not maintain the action without express authority of law. This alone was conclusive. But as the collector was appointed, so the bond was taken, by the hustings court, contrary to the policy of the law; which has ever been to confine the collection of the public revenue, to officers appointed by the law itself; sheriffs, or coroners, or collectors appointed under special circumstances in the manner prescribed by law. This was an unauthorised interference of the hustings court in the collection of the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>revenue; and it would be of mischievous consequence to give any countenance to such a practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\"><em>This court </em>concurred with the chancellor, and affirmed the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
