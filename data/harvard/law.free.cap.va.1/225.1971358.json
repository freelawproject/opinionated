The prayer of the bill is, that the appellee may be let in to have the effect of an execution issued against the estate of the said <em>H.

But it is to be recollected, that the English cases are for many reasons too high toned to apply in this country. The bankrupt laws, which forbid one creditor from being preferred to another, have excited a desire in the Courts of that country, to make the same principle as general as possible; and consequently a jealousy is entertained against all conveyances which give such a preference: and thus it is, that small circumstances are caught at, to set them aside'\u2014again, in that country, deeds respecting personal estate are not registered, and of course, possession is the highest evidence of property. But by our law, mortgages of personal property, and of slaves, are required to be recorded; see the act of 1748, c. 1. So that there is not the same danger of fraud, as to subsequent purchasers and creditors, in this, as in that country. . That the consideration in this case was <em>bona </em>fide, is completely established; and if so, all the arguments of inconvenience which can be urged, may be repelled by the maxim, <em>caveat </em>emptor, which strictly applies to this case\u2014he cited 2 <em>Term Rep. </em>875\u20143 <em>Atk. </em>44.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-11\">Marshall, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-12\">Whether the reason assigned, why the <em>English </em>cases do not apply in this country be a substantial one or not, will depend upon the just construction of the act of 1748, which is certainly very obscurely expressed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-13\">The first clause of that law declares, that no lands, tenements or hereditaments, shall alter, pass, or change, whereby any estate of freehold shall be made to take effect, unless the same be recorded in the General Court, or Court of that County, where the land shall lie, within a certain time.\u2014Now, this clause cannot possibly apply to <em>slaves, </em>because the deed is to be recorded in the <em>County where the land lies. </em>The fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>clause declares, that all deeds of trust, or mortgage, must be recorded <em>according to the directions of this act. </em>But the directory part of that act, as to the <em>place </em>of registration, is applicable to land only, for the reason before given.\u2014But, if slaves are meant by the law, then by analogy to land, this deed ought to have been recorded in <em>King William </em>County Court, because the slaves were in that county at the time the deed was made, and when the execution was served upon them. So that either a mortgage of slaves is not comprehended within the law, or if it be, then this deed has been registered in an improper County.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-3\">Lyons, J.\" requested Mr. <em>Marshall </em>to read the <em>tenth </em>section of the law, which requires, that a memorial of all mortgages, containing the number and names of the slaves,-and the description of the personal estate, if any be mortgaged, shall be registered in the General Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\">Marshall.\u2014I contend, that if the law apply to a mortgage of slaves, the deed in question was not recorded in the proper County.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">It is also an important question, whether the mortgagor of personal property can retain the possession of it. The <em>English </em>cases lay it down, that a security upon personal property is not properly a mortgage', but a pledge or deposit, and remains in the pawnee\u2019s possession. What influence the custom of this country, (which is otherwise,) may have upon this point, I will not pretend to determine. But, if all these be against me, I rely with confidence upon the many badges of fraud which attend this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">In the first place, consider the <em>connexion </em>between the parties ; a mortgage by a son to the father. <em>The time ; </em>just previous to the affairs of <em>Herbert Clayborn </em>becoming desperate, and whilst his creditors were pressing him. A conveyance, too, of <em>every thing </em>he possessed, down to a knife case, with a sweeping clause, that nothing might be omitted. It is remarkable, too, that only that species of property is conveyed which might be resorted to by his creditors ; for his real estate (not encumbered,) was considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>ble, and is not conveyed. If the transaction were <em>fide, </em>would he deprive himself of all the com\u00bb forts of life, and of the means of deriving profit from his lands ? Or would he not rather have retained a part of his personal, and, in its room, substitute some of his real estate ? All the cases agree, that a total disposition of a man\u2019s estate, or the remaining in possession, are certain badges of fraud. There is also something remarkable in the consideration stated, to wit, that the father and <em>Braxton, </em>in 1777, had formed a commercial connexion\u2014the father\u2019s capital was 6000/. In 1782, it is decided to have been a losing business ; and yet, in 1780, the father sells the profits of this trade to the son for 3000/. sterling, which is the consideration of the mortgage. But again : In 1784, the son makes an absolute conveyance to his father for 1788/. 18.?. after which, it must be agreed that the son\u2019s retaining the possession is so strong an evidence of a secret trust, as not to be fairly accounted for. The property continues in his possession when the execution is served, he receives the crops, disposes of them, converts the cattle, hogs, &amp;c. to his own use, and, in short, exercises the most complete ownership over the whole.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-6\">Warden, on the same side.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-7\">No case can come more completely up to <em>Twine\u2019s Case </em>than this. The conveyance is general, and possession is retained by the mortgagor. In <em>Powell on Mortgages, </em>(p. 1 to 66,) it is laid down, that the possession of .personal property, which is mortgaged, should remain with the mortgagee; or, if it do not, the reason should appear from the <em>nature and import of the mortgage.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP_\">So, where a supercargo on a voyage mortgaged, by way of <em>bottomry </em>and <em>hypothecation, </em>the vessel and cargo, and proceeded on the voyage and sold the cargo, and bought other goods with the proceeds, and so bartered it two or three times; this was determined not to be fraudulent, because, from the very nature of the transaction, it was understood that the supercargo was to make the most of the property. But where in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>a mortgage of personal property, it was stipulated that the mortgagor should retain the possession and receive the profits, it was adjudged fraudulent against creditors\u2014so that, even an express agreement to retain possession, will not save such deeds from being fraudulent, unless the <em>transaction itself </em>necessarily accounts for and justifies it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-3\">Marshall.\u2014There is but one possible way of construing the Act of Assembly so as to make all its parts consist together, and, at the same time, to effect the purpose for which deeds ought to be registered. The first section of the law directs, that deeds of land shall be recorded in the General Court, or Court of the County, in which the land lies. The 4th section directs, that all mortgages shall be recorded according to the directions of that Act. The 9th and 10th sections declare, that for the purpose of giving notice to purchasers of lands, slaves, &amp;c. of prior incumbrances, memorials of all deeds of lands, slaves, &amp;c. shall be registered by the Clerk of the General Court; and the Clerks of the different County Courts are also directed to furnish the Clerk of the General Court with memorials of all deeds recorded in their respective Courts, which are also to be registered in the General Court. If, then, the deed be of <em>lands and slaves, </em>it ought to be recorded in the General Court, or Court of the County <em>where the land </em>lies\u2014if of <em>slaves </em>only, then in the General Court. In this way only will there be complete notoriety of all deeds. If it may be recorded in the County where the mortgagee lives, a purchaser must first know who is the mortgagee, before he can know to what County Court to apply. If it may be recorded in any County, then, if the Clerk should fail to send forward the memorial to the General Court, the registration will afford no notice whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-4\">The President requested Mr. <em>Marshall </em>to read the Act of 1758, respecting the fraudulent gifts of slaves, observing, that this question might perhaps be determined by analogy to that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>Marshall.\u2014That Act relates t\u00f3 a <em>positive </em>gifts, the Act of 1748 to mortgages\u2014that, to conveyances <em>xvithout </em>consideration\u2014this, to conveyances with consideration. The deeds spoken of in that law may be proved by two witnesses. Those mentioned in this law must be proved by three. That is passed ten years after, and has no reference to this; there can, therefore, be no analogy between them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-10\">Campbell, for the appellant in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-11\">This case depends entirely upon principle, and its own peculiar circumstances\u2014no aid can be derived from <em>English </em>cases, because the reason which has produced them in that country, do not exist in this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-12\">I contend, 1st, That the deed in question is valid under the act of 1748; and 2dly,That the circumstances attending the transaction cannot invalidate it upon the principle of. fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-13\">First, the law of 1748, is not creative of the right to mortgage personal property, because it existed at common law; but it directs the manner of giving notoriety to such deeds. The notice intended, is to be obtained by referring to the registration of the memorials of them in the General Court. It is therefore unimportant, in what county they are recorded, since the General Court is the place where information is to be obtained, respecting the county in which the deeds were recorded. And if the officer, whose duty it is to forward these memorials, fail to do it, the parties are not thereby to suffer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-14\">Secondly, Before the <em>English </em>cases are considered, let us recollect how this subject stood at the time when <em>Twine\u2019s Case </em>was decided, and it will be found, that the facility with which secret conveyances might be made, rendered it proper for the Judges to exercise a strictness, (in order to defeat every attempt to commit a fraud) which would have been unnecessary, if a mean had been adopted, whereby.creditors and pur-' chasers might have guarded themselves against it. This inconvenience 'produced the Statutes of <em>Elizabeth </em>respecting fraudulent conveyances. The preamble recites the mischief which resulted from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>possession remaining in one person, whilst the property was transferred to another, whereby creditors, and purchasers, were <em>defrauded, </em>and the Judges stretched as far as they well could, to carry this Statute into full effect The cases referred to in <em>Powell </em>furnish a satisfactory reason for the distinction between real and personal property, continuing in possession of the mortgagor. In the first, purchasers may obtain notice, by recurring to the vicinage in cases of feoffments, or to the records in cases of bargains and sales. But in the latter, possession is the highest evidence \u00b0of property. Attend to the difference between the Statute of <em>Elizabeth </em>and our law. The former only punishes the fraud, which it did not attempt to prevent $ the latter prevents its commission, by directing the deeds to be recorded. The principle of <em>caveat emptor </em>therefore, cannot with propriety apply in England, because there is no possible mode by which a purchaser can guard himself against prior secret <em>conveyances; </em>it is otherwise in this country.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-3\">Under all the inconveniences above pointed out, <em>Twiners Case </em>came forward. The conveyance was absolute, and was of all his property. No inventory of the particular articles <em>\\ </em>and want of notoriety is there stated as the foundation of the decision. This is the case of a mortgage, which from its nature imports, that the possession is to remain with the mortgagor. There is a specification of the property conveyed, and an appraisment annexed. As to the inconveniences arising from the want of notoriety, see 2 <em>Blac. Com. </em>338. <em>342.\u2014-Pow. on Mort. </em>2 <em>Ed. </em>p. 286 290.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-4\">If, then, possession, remaining with the mortgagor, be not in this country an evidence of fraud, what are the other circumstances relied upon? <em>Relationship </em>\u00ab\u2014if the transaction be otherwise fair, the preference given by a son to a father can be no evidence of fraud. <em>The </em>time\u2014Since there are no bankrupt laws, or principles growing out of them in this country, which prohibit a debtor from preferring one creditor to another, the circumstance of time is unimportant, if it Be antecedent to the <em>execution </em>delivered\u00bb But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>strongest proof that this transaction was real, and not colorable, is, that in April, 1784, <em>II. Clayborn </em>mortgaged his land (which his creditors could not have touched) to his father, Harrison, and <em>William P. </em>Clay* born, whose claims were found to exceed the value of the property first mortgaged. If he found himself 'safe in the power of a father, would he also have thrown himself upon the mercy of strangers, if the transaction had not been real <em>?</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b254-9\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"Au0\">pronounced the following opinion and decree, viz.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u201c The deed of mortgage, dated the 1st of February, 1783, from <em>Herbert Clayborn </em>to <em>Augustine </em>Clayborn, in the decree mentioned, if made for a valuable and <em>bona fide </em>consideration, was not void by reason of <em>Herbert </em>Clayborn, the mortgagor, retaining possession of the slaves and other estate thereby mortgaged to the said Augustine, as the said deed was duly recorded, and that therefore the consideration should have been enquired into, and accounts taken and settled between the parties, before the deed was declared void on that principle, which could not be properly done in this suit, as <em>Charles </em>Harrison, one of the mortgagees, is not a party. But this Court is of opinion, that as the said <em>Augustine </em>suffered the said <em>Herbert </em>to retain the possession of the slaves, and other estate, on which the appellees\u2019 execution was levied, after the sales in <em>October </em>and <em>November, </em>for which bills of sale were made, (as referred to in the answer of the appellant, and filed among the exhibits in this cause,) releasing the equity of redemption, and conveying the absolute property in the estate thereby conveyed and confirmed to the said Augustine, which bills of sale were not recorded until the 14th of <em>April, </em>1785; that they were fraudulent and void as to the appellee, and neither the said sales, nor the prior mortgage which had ceased to operate, did protect the estate, (then sufficient to satisfy his demand) from his execution, and that there is no error in the decree for the payment of the appellee\u2019s debt and costs. <em>\u00e9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
