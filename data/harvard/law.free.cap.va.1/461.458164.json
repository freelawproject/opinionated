No objec. tion is made to the regularity of the bond in the court of chancery. An appeal is taken to the Court of Appeals. In that court, an objection is made, ' for the first time, to the bond. The objection comes too late ; but if it had been made in the court of chancery, that court could only have dismissed the appeal <em>nisi, or </em>have laid the party under- a rule <em>to give </em>a proper bond, in a reasonable time.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-8\">This was an -appeal from the chancery court of Green-brier, which reversed a decree of the county court of Greenbrier sitting in chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-9\">A suit was brought in the county court, by <em>Samuel Brown </em>against <em>John Matthews </em>and others, which was decided in favor of the said Brown. On petition to the chancellor, an appeal was allowed on the usual terms of giving bond, &amp;c. A bond was accordingly given ; but it was in fact a <em>certiorari </em>bond, instead of an <em>appeal </em>bond. In the court of chancery, no notice whatever was taken of this error | but the chancellor entertained the appeal* and finally reversed the decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>An appeal was taken to this court by Brown.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b475-4\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzRU\">contended, that there was no appeal from the county court to the court of chancery, as no appeal bond had been given, or if it were given, the bond was not good, being only executed by a surety. He said, that the court of appeals would look into the regularity of the steps in taking an <em>appeal; </em>and that this case was not like that of a court of original jurisdiction, where a party has a day given him to plead. He must take advantage of an error in this way, or in none.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><em>May </em>22.</p>\n<author id=\"AOX-\">Judge Brooke,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar3\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The court is of opinion, that if the bond was such a bond as seemed to be supposed by the bar, the objections taken to it, would not avail. But the bond in the record, is a <em>certiorari </em>bond, and not an <em>appeal </em>bond. If objected to in the court of chancery, that court would not have finally dismissed the appeal. The taking an improper bond, being the mistake of its clerk, the most it could do, would be to dismiss it <em>nisi, </em>or <em>to lay the </em>party under a rule to give a proper bond in a reasonable time. In this court, the objection comes too late. The appellant Brown, who was the appellee in the court of chancery, having not only omitted to make the objection there, but by putting in a plea, admitted that the appeal was regularly before that court. On the merits, the court is of opinion to ailim the decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
