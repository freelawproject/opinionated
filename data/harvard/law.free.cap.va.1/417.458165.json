The case was in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-11\"><em>Bowman </em>purchased of <em>Hayes </em>and Bumgardner, a tract of land lying on the South river, near Waynesborough, on which there was a valuable mill-seat. The deed from Hayes and Bumgardner to Bowman, conveys the land to the \u00ab middle of the river.\u201d This tract had formerly belonged to <em>Estill, </em>being part of a larger tract lying on both sides of the river. Estill conveyed the land in question <em>to </em>trustees, describing it as \u201c lying on the <em>west side of the iSouth river, and bounded by the river,\u201d </em>&amp;c. The land being sold under this deed of trust, Hayes and Bumgardner became the purchasers, and the trustees conveyed to them, <em>to the middle of the river ; </em>and they conveyed to Bowman, as before-mentioned, by the same description. Bowman gave his bonds to Hayes and Bumgardner for the purchase money; which were assigned to other persons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AkCP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Bowman applied to the county court of Augusta for leave to build a mill and erect a dam across the river; but was opposed on the ground, that no part of the bed of the river was either in him or the commonwealth. It w as contended, that although Hayes and Bumgardner had conveyed to him one-half of the bed of the river, no part of it bad been conveyed by Estill to them. This controversy was depending at the time of Bowman\u2019s filing his bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-4\">Suits were brought against Bowman on his bonds for the purchase money, which had been assigned by Hayes and Bumgardner to various persons <em>\u2022, </em>and judgments were obtained. Bowman filed a bill of injunction to arrest the judgments, and made Hayes and Bumgardner, and the assignees of the bonds, defendants. The injunction was granted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">The several defendants then filed their answers, alleging various grounds of equity, which, as they are not noticed in the decision of this court, it is unnecessary to mention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">The chancellor decreed, that the injunction should be dissolved as to the defendant <em>Moffitt, </em>(one of the assignees) the complainant having waived his equity, if he had any against him : that, as to the defendant <em>Ramsay, </em>(another of the assignees,) he must submit to whatever equity attached to his bond in the hands of <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Bumgardner, </em>the original obligees ; and the complainant being entitled <em>to </em>recover of them, whatever damage he may have sustained by the loss of his mill-seat in consequence of the defect of title in any part of the bed of the water-course, an issue at law was directed, to ascertain the damage which Bowman had sustained by the defect in his title to one-half of the bed of <em>the </em>water-course aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">The jury returned a verdict, that Bowman had sustained damage to the amount of g 2000, by reason of the defect in his title above-mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>The court decreed, that the injunction as to Ramsay, should be made perpetual, and his bond for 144\u00cd. delivered up to be cancelled,* and that the representative of James Hayes, (who had died,) and Jacob Bumgardner, should pay to the plaintiff $ 1,216, that being the balance of damages assessed by the jury, after deducting therefrom, the aforesaid sum of 144\u00cd., with interest thereon, from the time when it was due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-3\">The defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-4\"><em>Call, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b431-5\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-6\">It was said lor the <em>appellants, </em>that Bowman had a good title to the middle of the bed of the river, and therefore, there was no ground for his injunction. The deed from Hayes and Bumgardner, conveyed to the middle of the river in express terms; and although the deed of trust from Estill described the tract as \u201c lying on the west <em>\u201c </em>side of the South river, and bounded by the river, &amp;c.,\u201d yet the principles of law would extend the conveyance to the <em>middle of the river, </em>in such a case as this. It is a well established principle, that the proprietor of land contiguous to a stream not navigable, is entitled to half the bed of the <em>stream.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If it should be objected, that Estill owned both sides of the liver, and only conveyed the land <em>bounded by the river, </em>the answer will be that such a conveyance, by the authorities referred to, includes one-half of the bed of the river.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-7\">In reply, it was said, that admitting the general principle, it would not embrace a case like the present, where Estill was originally the proprietor of both sides of the river, and only conveyed the land on one side, <em>bounded by the </em>river\u2022 He certainly had a right to convey as much or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>as little as he pleased; and the words which he has used, are as explicit as possible, to shew his intention to cohvey only to the river bank.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b431-8\"><em> </em>Hargrave\u2019s Law Tracts. p. <em>5. </em>Davis\u2019s Rep. p. 152,155.

There can be no reason assigned, why this rule, so just in relation to grants by the commonwealth, should not equal/y apply to conveyances by individuals. If it be the wish of the grantor not to convey the bed of the stream or of any part thereof, it is easy for him to exclude it, <em>by </em>the use of words, proper for that purpose. In the absence of such words, the moiety of the bed of the stream, passes by the conveyance. On this principle the court is of opinion, that the moiety of the bed of the river, passed by the deed of trust aforesaid, and by the deed under which the appellee Bowman claims; and that the said appellee, had no right to resist the payment of the bonds given by him for the purchase money. The decree of the chancellor is therefore reversed, the injunctions dissolved, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Judge Brooke absent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
