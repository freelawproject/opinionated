The bill is filed nine years after the dissolution of the partnership, and after the death of the other partner, Held, that the circumstances of this case do not shew such <em>laches </em>on the part of the plaintiff as to deprive him of the right to have an account.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-11\">This was a bill filed in the superior court of law and chancery for the county of <em>Fauquier, </em>by <em>Samuel A. Marsteller, </em>against the administratrix of <em>Samuel Weaver, </em>for the settlement of a partnership account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b415-12\">In 1824, <em>Marsteller </em>and <em>Weaver </em>formed a partnership for the purpose of conducting a mercantile establishment in the county of <em>Prince William. </em>The business was managed by Weaver, and was continued until 1826, when the partnership was dissolved. At the time of the dissolution of the partnership, there were numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>outstanding debts due to the firm, and <em>Weaver </em>retained the books, and proceeded to collect the debts, some of which were collected as late as 1828. He died in 1831, when his widow qualified as his administratrix, and coliected two or three small debts due to the firm, and in a few months afterwards transferred the books of the partnership to <em>Marsteller. </em>There had been no settlement of the partnership transactions during the lifetime of <em>Weaver. </em>After his death, an attempt was made by <em>Marsteller </em>and the agent of the administratrix to settle the accounts, which failed, and in 1835, this suit was instituted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-4\">The bill stated that the partnership was by parol, and after setting out the terms, and the facts as above stated, alleged that <em>Weaver </em>had made collections which he had not entered on the books; that the plaintiff had made propositions to <em>Weaver </em>in his lifetime, for a settlement of the partnership accounts, which he had declined, and that he had endeavoured to obtain a settlement with the administratrix, which she had refused. He, therefore, prayed for a settlement of the accounts, and for the payment of the balance which might be found due to him, out of the assets of Weaver, in the hands of his administratrix.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b416-5\">The administratrix of <em>Weaver </em>pleaded the statute of limitations as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and also filed an answer, in which she insisted that the plaintiff ought not to have an account, because of his <em>laches </em>in prosecuting his claim. That it had been delayed until <em>Weaver </em>was dead, who was the only person beside the plaintiff who knew the terms of the <em>partnership; </em>that she was not acquainted with the affairs of the firm; that evidence had been lost, and, therefore, that the estate of her intestate would be subjected to gross injustice, if an account should be directed. She also filed with her answer, an account rendered by the plaintiff to <em>Weaver, </em>in his lifetime, which she insisted was a stated account, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>and which being more than five years before the mstitution of the suit, was barred by the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASGA\">Witnesses were examined, who proved the facts as given above, and then the cause came on to be heard in December 1836, when the court overruled the plea of the statute of limitations, but dismissed the bill on the ground that the plaintiff had unreasonably delayed to prosecute his claim. From this decree, <em>Marsteller </em>obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-8\"><em>G. N. Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMBQ\">This case does not vary materially from <em>Coalter </em>v. <em>Coalter, </em>1 Rob. R. 79. The suit was not brought for more than nine years after the dissolution of the partnership; and no excuse is stated in the bill for the delay. On the contrary, the bill states, that he had proposed a settlement of the accounts to <em>Weaver, </em>which he declined. This refusal of <em>Weaver </em>informed him that it was necessary to sue if he wished a settlement, and yet he delayed for years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b417-9\">The plaintiff is chargeable with culpable negligence. In <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>9 Leigh 393, it was held, that every claimant should exhibit his claim so promptly that the account may be settled without injustice to the other party. To the same effect is <em>Caruthers </em>v. <em>Trustees of Lexington, </em>12 Leigh 610; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>5 Leigh 164, and <em>Goode </em>v. <em>Hayes, 7 </em>Leigh 452. Here is nine years delay without excuse; the death of <em>Weaver, the </em>only person beside <em>Marsteller </em>who knew any thing about these transactions, the administratrix knowing nothing of the accounts, whilst the books, according to the shewing in the bill, will not enable the parties to make a settlement ; and this suit delayed until <em>Marsteller </em>has got possession of them, with all the papers belonging to the partnership, and in addition to all these, the partnership was by parol, and no person but <em>Marsteller </em>can say what the terms of the partnership were.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A4q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Bouldin, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae-F\">The case of <em>Coalter </em>v. <em>Coalter, </em>does not apply where there are open, current and unsettled accounts between the partners. In that case, there was nothing to shew that there was any outstanding claim of any kind for more than five years before the suit was brought. Here the whole partnership effects were in the hands of <em>Weaver. </em>There were mutual accounts between the parties, and at his death the books shew balances then due the firm, whilst it is proved he made collections in 1828, and that his administratrix made collections as late as 1831. Even at law there were such mutual accounts as, upon the principle decided in <em>Catling </em>v. <em>Skoulding, </em>6 T. R. 189, would take the case out of the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-4\">Although there does not appear to be any inflexible rule as to the time in which a claim for an account may be prosecuted, yet the usual period, in the absence of circumstances which may enlarge or limit it, seems to be about twenty years. In <em>Brownell </em>v. <em>Brownell, </em>2 Bro. Ch. R. 62, the court refused to open an account which had been settled, after eleven years, but allowed the plaintiff to surcharge it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b418-5\">Where the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has a claim to an account, it will not be refused, unless by his <em>laches </em>he has placed the defendant in a condition to suffer irremediable mischief, if the account should be ordered. It is not denied, in this case, that the plaintiff might have instituted his suit within five years from 1828, and this period extended beyond the death of <em>Weaver: </em>so that neither law nor equity required <em>Marsteiier </em>to sue in his lifetime. The death of <em>Weaver </em>is not to be attributed as <em>laches </em>to the plaintiff. If the books of the partnership do not afford the materials for a fair adjustment of the accounts, that is the fault of <em>Weaver, </em>who kept them, and not of <em>Marsteiier, </em>and surely the death of <em>Weaver </em>has not deprived his administratrix of any knowledge which the books would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>give her. These difficulties arise out of the case, and would have existed if the partnership had been dissolved the day before <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>death. This is not a claim of which she was kept in ignorance by the plaintiff; on the contrary, she is early informed of it; she expresses a desire that it should be settled; her agent attempts to settle it, and failing in that attempt, she must have expected this suit.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AZp\"> Judge <em>Stanard </em>had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b419-4\">Baldwin,</author>\n<p id=\"AMe\"><em>J. </em>delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The court is of opinion that the appellant is not barred by the statute of limitations, nor by <em>laches </em>and lapse of time, from obtaining a settlement of the partnership and other accounts in the proceedings mentioned, and such relief as he may thereupon shew himself entitled to ; and, therefore, that said circuit court erred in dismissing the appellant\u2019s bill, instead of directing such settlement to be had before a commissioner. The decree is therefore reversed, with costs, and the cause remanded to be further proceeded in, according to the principles above declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
