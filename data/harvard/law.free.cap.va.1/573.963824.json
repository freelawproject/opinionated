Affidavit was duly made that the defendants sued as absent debtors were out of the commonwealth, and both the bill and endorsement on the <em>subpoena </em>shewed, in the usual manner, that the object of the suit was to obtain a decree for the sale of the lands and tenements belonging to the absent debtors, to satisfy the debt appearing to be due from them, and to restrain the defendants in this commonwealth from paying, conveying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>away or secreting the debts by them owing to, or the <em>effects </em>in their hands of, the said absent debtors. The usual order of publication was made against the absent debtors, and the same being duly published and posted, and the cause matured for hearing also as to other defendants, the case came on to be heard the 24th of January 1842, on the bill and exhibits. On consideration whereof, the court, without deciding any other question at that time, was of opinion that the lands and tenements sought to be subjected ought to be under the direction of the court, in the hands of a receiver, so that the same might be finally disposed of in such manner as to the court might seem just; and the court therefore, until its further order, appointed <em>Gustavus A. Myers </em>receiver of the rents and profits of all the said lands and tenements, with the powers set forth in the order. Afterwards, on the motion of the plaintiffs, leave was given them to amend their bill and make new parties, and the cause was sent to the rules. The amended bill was accordingly filed, making defendants thereto, besides others, <em>John Bacon, Alexander Symington </em>and <em>Thomas Robbins. </em>On the 23d of June 1842, on the motion of the absent debtors and of the said <em>Bacon, Symington </em>and <em>Robbins, </em>they were permitted to file their answers, on giving security for costs *, the order providing, as usual, that the attachment sued forth in the cause was not to be thereby discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b602-4\">In this state of the case, to wit, on the 29th of June 1842, the defendants who had so filed their answers moved the court to discharge the attachment, upon the ground that the proceeding against the debtor corporation is not authorized by the act of the 11th of February 1819, in 1 R. C. p. 474. ch. 123.

St. at large p. 220; 1777, 9 Hen. St. at large p. 396.) clearly relate throughout to natural persons, and not to bodies politic or corporate. The preamble recites, that <em>\u201c </em>whereas creditors have experienced great difficulties in the recovery of debts due from <em>persons residing without the jurisdiction </em>of this commonwealth, but who have efleets here sufficient to satisfy and pay such debts; for remedy whereof,\u201d &amp;c. The first section then enacts, that \u201c upon affidavit that such defendant or defendants are out of the country, or that upon enquiry at <em>his, her </em>or <em>their </em>usual place of abode, <em>he, she </em>or <em>they </em>could not be found, so as to be served with process ;\u201d in all such cases the court may make any order, and require surety if it shall appear necessary, to restrain the defendants in this country from paying, conveying away or secreting the debts by them owing to, or the effects in their bands of, such absent defendant or defendants, &amp;c. The fourth section still more clearly contemplates natural persons, since a foreign corporation surely cannot <em>return and appear openly, </em>and cannot have an <em>\u201cheir, </em>executor or administrator.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b603-5\">It is to be remarked, that the first general law giving this process was passed in 1744, when no corporations, except <em>quasi </em>corporations, such as towns, counties or boroughs, existed in the colony of <em>Virginia </em>at any rate, if they did in any other of the colonies; so that it is impossible to conceive that the legislature contemplated them at that time. The subsequent laws, as observed above, use the same terms as are to be found in the law of 1744; and it cannot fairly be contended that those terms in the present law can be enlarged by interpretation, so as to embrace objects not contemplated by the legislature in the preceding laws, in the absence too of any expression properly applicable to such objects. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>If corporations had been intended to be embraced, would not the legislature, who must be presumed to be acquainted with the technical terms which would convey their meaning, have expressly included <em>\u201c </em>bodies P0^*0 or corporate\u201d in the law ? When such artificial bodies are contemplated, those terms are used by them. For example, in the act (Supplement to Rev. Code, p. 332. ch. 313.) \u201c to amend an act more effectually to prevent the circulation of notes emitted by unchartered banks,\u201d an act of great importance and intended to check a great and growing evil, while the first section prohibits any <em>person </em>or <em>persons </em>from committing the acts specified therein, the second section explicitly prohibits \u201c any body politic or corporate\u201d from committing similar acts. Surely if, under the words <em>\u201cperson </em>or persons,\u201d the legislature conceived that artificial persons would be included, they would not have deemed it necessary to use another term in the second section.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b604-4\">This question has never been decided in <em>Virginia, </em>it is believed. But in <em>New York, </em>(where, under the words of the law, 1 New R. L. 157. ch. 49. \u00a7 23. it might with much more propriety be contended that corporations were included, than it can be under our statute,) the supreme court decided that the attachment against absent debtors would not lie against the estate of a foreign corporation; for that <em>that </em>law applied to <em>natural </em>persons only, and not to bodies corporate. <em>M\u2019Queen </em>v. <em>The Middletown Manufacturing Company, </em>16 Johns. Rep. 5. The 23d section of the <em>New York </em>law enacts that the real and personal estate of <em>any debtor, </em>who resides out of the state and is indebted within it, shall be liable to be attached and sold &amp;c. It was contended in that case, in support of the attachment, that a corporation might be a <em>debtor, </em>as well as a natural person ; but the court- decided as above stated. Now it is conceived that if the term \u201c debtor,\u201d taken in connexion,with the other provisions of that law, was not deemed suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>ciently comprehensive to embrace corporations, it can be with still less reason contended in this case, that the words <em>\u201cperson </em>or persons\u201d are more so. Great inconvenience and embarrassment might be produced, if an opposite construction should prevail. Our banks provide funds at different points, to enable them to draw, and to conduct their business with safety. At a period of suspension of specie payments recognized by the legislature, if a holder of their paper should apply to any of them to redeem their notes, upon refusal they may be required to endorse on the notes the time such demand is made, and from that period they become an interest-bearing debt. Provided with such endorsement, the creditor proceeds to some point out of this commonwealth, where he is apprized that the bank has funds, and he attaches them. The most ruinous consequences might ensue, although the institution thus affected is actually protected by the laws of <em>Virginia </em>in the suspension out of which these consequences have arisen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b605-4\">The case of <em>Bushel &amp; another </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth Insurance Company, </em>15 Serg. &amp; Rawle 173. will be relied on upon the other side. It appears from the report of that case, that the court was not unanimous. <em>Tilghman, </em>chief justice, was sick and gave no opinion, and the only opinions pronounced are those of <em>Rogers, </em>J. and <em>Duncan, </em>J.\u2014the latter dissenting from the former. Of these two opinions, we rely with great confidence on that of judge <em>Duncan, </em>whose reasoning, it is humbly conceived, is infinitely stronger, and certainly more consistent with the legitimate powers and duties of judicial tribunals, than that of his brother judge, who is driven first to construe the law of foreign attachments as a remedial law, when in truth it is an innovation on the common law and should be construed strictly, and then to declare that the law has undergone changes to suit the times, not by legislative enactments, but by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number><em>\u201c silent legislation of the people </em>themselves1''\u2014a species of , , . . , / <em>r </em>, r . . legislation certainly unknown to us, and not existing, that we are aware, in any community of laws upon earth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJe\">^ necessary to give this remedy against foreign corporations, the legislature, and not the courts alone, have the power to do so; and we humbly conceive that it is better to leave it thus, than (in the language of judge <em>Duncan) </em>for the courts to \u201c make laws as we go along, put them on the judicial anvil, and with the judicial hammer give them a different shape, and fashion them according to our own notions of right and wrong.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b606-8\"><em>Robinson </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4s\">Such construction ought to be put upon a statute as may best answ'er the intention which the makers had in view; for <em>qui hceret in litera, hceret in cortice. </em>Bac.

Ibid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b606-9\">In the case of <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Amedy, </em>11 Wheat. 393. the prisoner was indicted under an act of congress making it felony to destroy a vessel with intent \u201c to prejudice <em>any person or persons </em>that hath underwritten.\u201d The underwriters in that case being a corporation, it was insisted that a corporation was not a <em>person </em>within the meaning of the act. But the supreme court of the <em>United States </em>overruled the objection. Mr. justice <em>Story, </em>in delivering the opinion of the court, (p. 412.) said, \u201c If there had been any settled course of decisions on this subject in criminal cases, we should certainly, in a prosecution of this nature, yield to such a construction of the act. But there is no such course of decisions. The mischief intended to be reached by the statute is the same, whether it respects private or corporate per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>sons. <em>That corporations are in law, for civil purposes, deemed persons, is unquestionable. </em>And the citation from 2 Inst. 736. establishes that they are so deemed within the purview of penal statutes. Lord <em>Coke, </em>there, in commenting on the statute of 31 Eliz. ch. 7. respecting the erection of cottages, where the word used is \u2018 no <em>person </em>shall,\u2019 &amp;c. says this extends as well to persons <em>politic </em>and <em>incorporate, </em>as to natural persons whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-4\">The authorities cited and opinion delivered by the supreme court of <em>New York, </em>in <em>The People </em>v. <em>Utica Insurance Company, </em>15 Johns. 382. are to the same effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-5\">It was formerly argued in this court that the statute against usury (1 R. C. 373.) did not apply to corporations. By the first section of that statute, the legislature had declared that no <em>person </em>should take for the loan of money above the specified rate, and that all contracts for payment of any money <em>so </em>lent, on which higher interest was reserved, should be void. By the second section, any <em>person </em>taking above the legal rate was made subject to a forfeiture of double the money lent. And by the third section, a borrower was authorized to exhibit a bill in chancery against the lender, and compel <em>him </em>to discover upon <em>oath </em>the amount lent. Though the language thus used, strictly construed, was applicable only to natural persons, and the statute was one of a penal character, this court <em>held </em>nevertheless, (three judges concurring,) that a contract with a corporation on which it reserved more than the interest specified was void. <em>Stribbling </em>v. <em>The Bank of the Valley, 5 </em>Rand. 141, 2. 148, 9. 189. Judge <em>Cabell </em>said, (p. 190.) \u201c The term * person\u2019 used in the law is unquestionably sufficiently comprehensive to embrace corporations, and it must be held to embrace them unless there be something in the law shewing the legislative intention to restrict its application.\u201d The other two judges not putting the case on so broad a ground, he agreed with them that even if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>it were true that corporations could not <em>he punished </em>under secon(i section, the contract must be vacated under the first section. For, said he, \u201c the great object was to protect the fleeced borrower, and that object re&lt;lu*res ^at the provision as to vacating the contract should apply to <em>artificial </em>as well as <em>natural </em>persons.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-4\">In <em>The Bank of the United States </em>v. <em>Deveaux, </em>5 Cranch 61. the supreme court <em>held, </em>that under the clause of the constitution giving the federal courts jurisdiction of \u201c controversies between <em>citizens </em>of different states,\u201d those courts could take jurisdiction of a controversy between a <em>corporation </em>and a <em>citizen.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b608-5\">So far, this question has been considered upon those authorities which, it might be inferred, would take the view the most favourable that could be taken for the other'side; the decisions being all of them upon <em>penal </em>statutes, except in one instance, and that a case of constitutional pow\u00e9r.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab4\">It is, however, much more plain that corporations are embraced in the statute now under consideration, than in the cases which have been cited. While in those cases the statutes were generally <em>penal </em>statutes, and to be construed <em>strictly, </em>this, it is manifest, is a <em>remedial </em>statute, and to be construed <em>liberally. </em>It is laid down that a statute made for the suppression of a fraud, or to give a more speedy remedy for a right, ought to be construed liberally, because such construction is for the furtherance of justice. Bac. Abr. tit. Statute, Let. I. \u00a7 8. If this be so, surely a statute which gives a remedy where there was none before, and gives it in a case in which a remedy is necessary for the furtherance of justice, mst be construed liberally. Such is the nature of the statute under consideration. It is clearly remedial. And such a construction, we are told, ought to be put upon a remedial statute as will tend to suppress the mischief intended to be remedied. Bac. Abr. tit. Statute, Let. I. \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>What was the mischief that this statute intended to _ remedy r It was, that debtors residing out of this commonwealth had effects here sufficient to satisfy debts, and yet their creditors remained unpaid. The mischief is the same, whether the debt be due from corporation or from a natural person ; and the remedy must be coextensive with the mischief. If, for the prevention of fraud and the furtherance of justice, the remedy be necessary and proper in the one case, it is equally necessary and proper in the other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-6\">Although then the expression in the preamble, <em>\u201cpersons </em>residing without the jurisdiction of this commonwealth,\u201d had been adhered to in the act itself, it would nevertheless have been proper to consider corporations as embraced within the act. The argument that they are not persons would have been entitled to no more weight than it received in <em>Beaston </em>v. <em>The Farmers Bank of Delaware, 12 </em>Peters 134, 5. In the language of the court in that case, \u201c corporations are to be deemed and considered as <em>persons, </em>when the circumstances in which they are placed are identical with those of natural persons expressly included in such statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b609-7\">But when we come to the enacting clause, we find the language much more comprehensive. The suit is not confined in terms to persons, but may be \u201c against <em>any defendant or dfendants </em>who are out of this country, and others within the same, having in their hands effects of or otherwise indebted to such absent defendant or defendants, or against any such absent defendant or defendants having lands or tenements within the commonwealth.\u201d And there is no difficulty in holding a corporation created by another state to be a <em>defendant </em>out of this commonwealth. Nay more, it is, in the language of the preamble, a defendant <em>residing </em>without this commonwealth. For, as is said by the court in <em>The Bank of Augusta </em>v. <em>Earle, </em>13 Peters 588. \u201c a corporation can have no legal existence out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>boundaries of the sovereignty by which it is created. ft exists only in contemplation of law and by force of the law ; and, where that law ceases to operate and is no longer obligatory, the corporation can have no exis\u00a3ence* ft mus\u00a3 <em>^we% </em>\u00a3he place of its creation, and cannot migrate to another sovereignty. But although it must live and have its being in that state only, yet it does not by any means follow that its existence there will not be recognized in other places; and its existence in one state creates no insuperable objection to its power of contracting in another.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-5\">When, by our laws, we permit a corporation created by another state to make within the scope of its powers a contract here, and to sue for and recover debts and effects here, it would be strange indeed if no suit could afterwards be maintained here against the corporation, to subject such debts and effects to the satisfaction of a debt justly due from it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b610-6\">The words of several clauses of the statute have been commented on by the counsel on the other side. Similar comments were made in the case of <em>Beaston </em>v. <em>The Farmers Bank of </em>Delaware, and proved of no avail. True it is, that in the present case affidavit could not be made, that upon enquiry at the defendants\u2019 usual place of abode they could not be found. But neither could that be done in the case of a natural person who never had his abode in the commonwealth. Against such a person, as against a corporation, the affidavit would be, that the defendant or defendants are out of the commonwealth. In the language of the court in 12 Peters 135. the fact that the corporation \u201c cannot be brought within all the predicaments stated in the statute proves nothing, if it-can be brought within any one or more of them.\u201d It was argued in that case, that a corporation could not be a deceased debtor with an insufficiency of assets in the hands of executors or administrators; that its effects could not be attached as those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>of an absent, concealed, or absconding debtor (p. 124.) But the court held the argument insufficient; and its judgment is a condemnation of that now urged under the fourth section of our statute. If a corporation created by another state cannot \u201c appear openly within this commonwealth,\u201d so as to be served with a copy of the decree, the consequence simply is, that the bar arising from the lapse of twelve months after such appearance, without petitioning for a rehearing, will never exist against a corporation ; but such corporation, not appearing in a suit against it, will only be barred after the lapse of seven years from the time of the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-5\">The argument, that when the law first passed giving this remedy, no corporations existed here except those for municipal government, militates against the purpose for which it is used. For, while it accounts for the absence in the act of such words as \u201c bodies politic or corporate,\u201d it does not shew in the least that the lawmakers would have been unwilling to comprehend corporations. Such words as bodies politic or corporate, it is said, are now used when the legislature means to comprehend them; and an instance is given of their use in a statute. It is sufficient to say, that the statute referred to is of a <em>penal </em>character and of <em>modern </em>date.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b611-6\">The view taken of this question has been more extended than would have been deemed necessary but for the decision of the supreme court of <em>New York </em>in the case of <em>M\u2019Queen </em>v. <em>The Middletown Manufacturing Company, </em>16 Johns. 5. In that case the conclusion of the court upon the whole act of <em>New York </em>was, that the legislature intended to authorize proceedings under it against natural persons only. Since that decision, a motion has been made in the supreme court of <em>Pennsylvania </em>to dissolve an attachment, on the ground that a foreign corporation is not within the act of that state of 1705, nor liable to attachment by the custom of <em>London. </em>And after a very full investigation of the subject, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>court has come to the conclusion <em>(Rogers </em>and <em>Gibson, </em>now C. J. concurring) that foreign corporations are liato foreign attachments. 15 Serg. &amp; Rawle 173.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b612-4\">It is argued that inconvenience and embarrassment might result from holding that a remedy exists under our statute against a corporation created by another state. And the reason assigned is, that effects in another state of one of our banks might be attached in that state, at a time when the bank is protected by our laws. This will still be so, no matter what the decision in the present case. No decision of this court can, for example, prevent a proceeding in <em>Pe?msyhania </em>by foreign attachment against a corporation created by this or any other state. No such decision can prevent such a proceeding now in <em>New YorJc. </em>For, since the decision in 16 Johns. 5. the legislature of <em>New YorJc </em>has passed a statute giving a remedy in that state against a foreign corporation by attachment. 2 R. S. 459. \u00a7 15. and p. 375 of 2d edi. \u00a7 15. cited in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>19 Wend. 46. Such a statute, passed by the legislature of so commercial a state, is the best possible refutation of all the arguments advanced to shew that good policy forbids the existence of such a remedy.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b612-5\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AoI\">The preamble of the act directing the method of proceeding- against absent debtors recites, that creditors have experienced great difficulties in the recovery of debts due from <em>persons </em>residing without the jurisdiction of the commonwealth. Under this law, the plaintiffs in the court below sued out their foreign attachment against the bank of the <em>United States; </em>and the question is presented, whether the attachment lies against this corporation of another state ?</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The remedy given by this statute is an innovation upon the common law, and, as has been frequently observed by the judges, liable to great abuse. The legislature, foreseeing that an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>kind might be abused, have been careful to regulate it, and to provide sufficient security to indemnify the absent defendant for any damage improperly sustained. This court, in <em>Kelso </em>v. Blackburn, 3 Leigh 306. held that the mode pointed out must be pursued, and the tions of the statute strictly conformed to. But though the court is watchful in exacting a compliance with the terms of the law, this does not change its character. The sfatute is remedial. It gives a remedy where none existed before. This is admitted by judge <em>Carr, </em>who always looked upon the proceeding with jealousy. He remarks in <em>Kelso </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>that the law was founded on the necessity of the case, lest there should be an absolute failure of justice. If the statute was necessary to suppress a mischief, and is remedial, the cases to which it extends must be ascertained by those rules of construction which are applied to the interpretation of all remedial statutes. Such statutes are to receive a liberal construction : they are to be so construed as may best answer the intention of the <em>maker; </em>and where a statute introduces a new remedy, the interpretation should be such as will tend to suppress the mischief and be in furtherance of justice. In cases arising under this act, it has received a liberal construction and been extended beyond the letter. The preamble mentions the difficulties experienced in the recovery of debts <em>due. </em>This would seem to confine the remedy to the case of a debt then payable, and for the recovery of which an action could then be maintained if the defendant were within the commonwealth. But in <em>Williamson &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Bowie &amp;c. </em>6 Munf. 176. it was decided that the attachment would lie to secure a note executed by the absentee and endorsed by the attaching creditor, although, at the time of suing out the attachment, the note had not been paid and was not <em>then due.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The first section requires an affidavit of nonresidence, or of ineffectual enquiry at the usual place of abode, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Taking this in connexion with the fourth section where the act speaks of the defendant\u2019s <em>returning and appearing openly, </em>it might be argued from the literal import of the terms, that the remedy was confined to those defendants who had at one time been residents and subject to the jurisdiction of the commonwealth. But in <em>Peter </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>1 Leigh 285. it was determined, that a claim arising on a contract of bailment made out of <em>Virginia, </em>against a nonresident, is a claim for debt for which the foreign attachment lies; thus applying the remedy where the defendant had never been subject to the jurisdiction of the commonwealth, where the contract was made without the state, and where the plaintiff\u2019s demand was not liquidated, but sounded in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">It has been suggested that the law can be applied to those cases only, where the defendant would, if within the jurisdiction of the commonwealth, be liable to be sued; and that this cannot be predicated of a foreign corporation, for it can have no legal existence without the bounds of the sovereignty which created it. The fact might be conceded, and yet the consequence does not necessarily follow. There is nothing in the act restricting it to defendants who could be sued if within the commonwealth. The law extends to all nonresidents. Whilst they continue without the state, they never could be subject to the jurisdiction of the commonwealth ; and the law was passed to enable the creditor to reach their effects, because they would not submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the state. And can it make any difference in the operation of the act, whether the jurisdiction of the commonwealth is prevented from attaching by the defendant\u2019s remaining out of the state, or because he can never come within it ? If the defendant is a nonresident, (to whatever cause owing) so as to be without the jurisdiction of the commonwealth, and has effects subject to its jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the case is made out to which the law was intended to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"AKJ\">If this were an act to force an appearance,\u2014to pel the defendant, by attaching his effects, to appear to an ordinary action, it might be contended with much force, that the act could apply to such defendants only as would be liable to suit if within the jurisdiction of the state. The law might be considered as ancillary to the ordinary proceeding, a mere substitution of one form of process for another; and being but an incident to the principal subject, ought not to be construed as extending to cases where without it the court could not take jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">This was the difficulty in the cases referred to, decided in <em>Pennsylvania </em>and <em>New York. </em>In the former state they have no chancery court. The case of <em>Bushel &amp;c. </em>v. <em>The Commonwealth Ins. Co. </em>15 Serg. &amp; Rawle 173. was a proceeding at law. It appears from the report of the case, that by their statute the defendant was authorized to appear upon putting in bail to the action. Natural justice demands that in all such laws a provision should be made to enable the absentee, on certain conditions, to appear and controvert the justice of the claim set up against him. This law did contain such a provision; but it was one of which the absent defendant, being a corporation, could not take advantage. A recognizance of special bail could not be acknowledged for it, as the condition to surrender the body was impossible. It was therefore insisted that the law could not be so construed as to embrace corporations. But even in that case the objection was overruled and the jurisdiction sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The supreme court of <em>New York </em>in <em>M\u2019Queen </em>v. <em>The Middletown Manu. Co. </em>16 Johns. Rep. 4. gave a different construction to their statute against absconding or absent debtors, and held that the attachment authorized by that act did not lie against a corporation. The 23d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>section of their act used the phrase \u201c every debtor who resides without the state.\u201d These words, if they bad alone, would have comprehended corporations. But the court, taking the 23d in connexion with other sections of the act, held that natural persons only wereincltided. For this construction reliance w'as mainly placed on the 21st section, which provided that the debtor might supersede the attachment, upon giving security <em>to appear and plead to any action of law or in equity </em>brought against him in the state within six months. This supposed that the defendant would, if within the state, be subject to an ordinary suit. In requiring security to be given to appear and plead to any such action, the makers, it is to be presumed, meant to confine the remedy to such defendants as could place themselves in that predicament,\u2014subject themselves to the jurisdiction of the courts. In the case of a foreign corporation, there was no person upon whom process could be served, and therefore no mode of instituting an action against it. For, in the language of the supreme court of the <em>United States </em>in <em>The Bank of Augusta </em>v. Earle, 13 Peters 588. \u201c a corporation exists only in contemplation of law and by force of the law; and where that law ceases to operate and is no longer obligatory, the corporation can have no existence. It must dwell in the place of its creation, and cannot-migrate to another sovereignty.\u201d Though there had been no conflict in the opinions of the two courts referred to, and both had decided under their laws that the attachment did not lie, the decisions would not have affected the construction of our statute. The law in each case contemplated a legal proceeding in the ordinary tribunals and in the accustomed mode.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Nothing of the kind is found in our act. The whole jurisdiction is confided to a court of equity. The proceeding is a bill for relief. The defendant may appear: this a corporation can do by attorney. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>can discharge the attached effects by giving security to <em>r , , </em>, \u2022 <em>i \u2022 r </em>portorm the decree : such security may be given ror a corporation by a third party, or it can deposite the amount in court. And whether the defendant appears and answers or not, the court hears the case upon the proofs and pronounces a final decree. In <em>Beaston </em>v. <em>The Farmers Bank of Delaware, </em>12 Peters 134, 5. the court say that corporations are to be deemed and considered as persons, when the circumstances in which they are placed are identical with those of natural persons included in the statute. The circumstances in which they are placed by our act are identical with those of the natural person who continues without the state. The same opportunity, and to the same extent, is afforded to each for defending the suit; and after the seven years have expired, the decree is conclusive as to both, without the service of a copy, or any thing more being done. None of the reasons which created a doubt under the laws of <em>New York </em>and <em>Pennsylvania </em>apply : no action at law, no ulterior proceeding in the accustomed mode is provided for or contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Upon principle, and in view of the construction given to the act in the cases occurring under it, the jurisdiction, I think, may be maintained. But if this were more doubtful than it seems to me it is, there are other grounds upon which the jurisdiction may be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">For <em>civil </em>purposes, corporations are in law deemed <em>persons. The United States </em>v. <em>Amedy, </em>11 Wheat. 393. This proposition has not been controverted. In the case of <em>Beaston </em>v. <em>The Farmers Bank of Delaware, </em>above cited, the question arose whether the act of congress giving priority in certain cases to the <em>United States </em>extended to corporations ? The words of the act arc, \u201c When any revenue officer or other <em>person </em>becoming indebted &amp;c.\u201d The court decided that corporations were included. So in <em>Stribbling </em>v. <em>The Bank of the Valley, </em>5 Rand. 132. the word <em>person </em>in the law against usury was held to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>embrace corporations. The only doubt has been whether that word would be so construed as to embrace them within the purview of penal statutes : and in the case of <em>The United States </em>v. <em>Amedy, </em>the court, upon the authority of lord <em>Coke </em>in <em>2 </em>Inst. 736. decided, that under the act of congress making it felony to destroy a vessel with intent to prejudice any <em>person or persons </em>that hath underwritten, corporations were comprehended by the words <em>person or persons. </em>The word being <em>sufficiently </em>comprehensive to embrace corporations, \u201c it must be held to embrace them\u201d (in the language of judge <em>Cabell </em>in <em>Stribbling </em>v. <em>The Bank of the Valley) </em>\u201c unless there be something in the law shewing the legislative intention to restrict its application.\u201d Were it necessary, this construction might be supported by a reference to the enacting clause. The language there is, \u201c a suit in chancery against a defendant or defendants out of the state;\u201d terms sufficiently broad to include every party, whether natural or artificial, capable of being sued. A corporation is as much within the mischief as a natural person. It is capable of contracting, of holding effects. There is nothing in the law restricting the remedy to natural persons ; and the terms being sufficiently extensive to include corporations, the jurisdiction, it seems to me, is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">I am for affirming the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b618-5\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">dissented, and stated that <em>Brooke, </em>J. who had had the benefit of the argument and had examined the case, authorized him to say, that if he could have been present at the decision, he should also have dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">But Baldwin, <em>J. </em>and Cabell, <em>P. </em>concurring with <em>Allen, </em>J. the order was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
