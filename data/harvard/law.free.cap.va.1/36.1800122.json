That, <em>before the marriage, and in contemplation thereof, M\u2019 Coole </em>the father wrote him a letter, wherein he promised him-a place called <em>The Falling Waters, </em>being a piece of land parcel of the tract on which <em>Ml Coole </em>lived, and though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>this letter was lost, its contents could be proved; and that, upon his mentioning, <em>at breakfast, the second morning after the marriage, </em>in the presence of his father-in-law and of the family and of the defendant among the rest, that he had to go to <em>Front Royal </em>(in another part of the same county), <em>to confirm a contract he had begun </em>with one <em>Vanmeter </em>for a tannery, in which business he intended to engage with prospect of great advantage, the father-in-law said, he need not do that, for he would give him the piece of laud called <em>The Falling Waters, </em>to be his property (describing the boundaries), and moreover, that he and his son <em>John </em>would help him to improve it. That <em>JVC Coolers </em>declared motive was, to prevent his daughter from removing to a distant residence. That, in consequence of these promises, Darling-<em>ton </em>relinquished his beneficial contract with <em>Vanmeter, </em>for the <em>Front Royal </em>tannery; was shortly afterwards put by his father-in-law in possession of <em>The Falling Waters, </em>being a piece of land, designated by metes and bounds, containing about thirty-five acres; built dwelling houses on it, sunk vats for a tannery, and improved, held and enjoyed it as his own, until <em>JVC Coole, </em>his father-in-law, died in 1815, having by his will devised it to his son, the defendant. And that, though JIT\u2019 <em>Coole, </em>the father-in-law, had never made him any conveyance of the land according to his promise and agreement; yet he had laid off the boundary lines, in the presence of the defendant, his son and now his devisee; and had often declared his willingness to make such conveyance.' The bill prayed a specific execution of the alleged promise and agreement of <em>J\\C Coole, </em>the father, to give and convey the land to <em>Darlington; </em>and that <em>JVC Coole, </em>the son and devisee, might be compelled to convey it accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-3\">The defendant, in his answer, denied all the allegations of the bill, both as to the <em>promise </em>of <em>M'Coole, </em>the father, <em>before Darlington's marriage, </em>and the <em>agreement after the marriage, </em>to give him <em>The Falling Waters. </em>He said, that his father, shortly after <em>Darlington\u2019s </em>marriage, told him he might have the land in question, as a temporary accommo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>^at*on ^01\u2019 h's iamily, assisted him in building on and improving it, and suffered him to enjoy it, during his own life; but neither made him any gift of it, nor ever intended to do so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aia\">It was also alleged in the answer, and <em>proved, </em>that, upon <em>Darlington's </em>marriage with <em>M' Coole's </em>daughter, his father-in-law gave him such personal property as he advanced to his other daughters on their marriage: that he afterwards contributed the greater part of the labour and expense of the buildings (which were log-houses) and the other, improvements, put on <em>The Falling Waters: </em>that <em>Darlington's </em>first wife, the daughter of <em>M'Coole, </em>died in 1805, leaving one daughter, who was immediately taken into her grandfather\u2019s family, and treated and brought up as one of his own children, and was provided for by her grandfather\u2019s will, equally with his own daughters: and that <em>Darlington </em>had married a second wife, by whom he had several children.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">Of the <em>letter, </em>alleged in the bill to have been written, be.fore <em>Darlington's marriage, </em>by <em>M'Coole, </em>the father, to rhim, promising to give him <em>The Falling Waters, </em>there was no proof whatever. Neither was there any <em>positive </em>proof of the <em>agreement </em>alleged in the bill, to have been made, <em>at breahfast, the second morning after the marriage; </em>and the members of the family, being examined as witnesses, declared they had heard nothing of the kind. But several witnesses deposed, that <em>M\u2019 Coole, </em>the father, had pointed out the boundaries of the land, and frequently said <em>he had given it to Darlington; </em>and that <em>Darlington </em>had held and enjoyed it as his own, during <em>M' Coole's </em>life. <em>Vanmeter </em>deposed, that, having a valuable tannery at <em>Front Royal, </em>with a large stock on hand, he had entered into a contract with <em>Darlington, before his marriage, </em>to carry on the business in partnership, each to contribute equal stock, and to carry on the business at joint expense and for joint and equal benefit; that he thought, at the time/it would be a very profitable business; that <em>Darlington </em>had a tract of land, by the sale of which he could have contributed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>share of in-put stock, by the time it would have been wanted, because of the large stock <em>Vanmeter </em>had on hand; but <em>before Darlington\u2019s marriage, </em>he (Vanmeter) received a letter, purporting to be written by <em>John M\u2019 Coole </em>the elder, though he did not know that it was in fact written by him, being unacquainted with his handwriting, in which he stated, that he had himself made <em>Darlington </em>an advantageous offer, and urged <em>Vanmeter </em>to release him from the contract concerning the <em>Front Royal </em>tannery; which <em>Vanmeter, </em>in consequence of that letter, agreed to do, though very reluctantly. And <em>Lewis M\u2019 Coole, </em>a son of the elder <em>M\u2019 Coole, </em>deposed, that <em>Darlington, </em>shortly after his marriage went to <em>Front Royal; </em>and the witness was told by his father, that <em>Darlington </em>had made a contract with <em>Vanmeter, </em>provided he could furnish a sufficient sum of money to pay for half the stock of the tannery on hand; his father said, he had not the money to furnish him; he hated to part with his child to go that distance; and he thought it would be better to give them a piece of land on <em>The Falling Waters. </em>His father, after the death of <em>Darlington\u2019s </em>wife, said he had never made him a deed, and never intended it; but he would probably give the land, or the value of it, to his child.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\">The chancellor dismissed the bill: and <em>Darlington </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXj\">insisted, That the agreement between the elder <em>M\u2019 Coole </em>and <em>Darlington, </em>that the former would give him the land in question, if he would relinquish his contract with <em>Vanmeter, </em>was proved, by the fact, that <em>Darlington </em>had made a beneficial contract with <em>Vanmeter, </em>and gave it up; by <em>M\u2019 Coole\u2019s </em>declaration to his son <em>Lewis, </em>that it would be best to give him this land; by his frequent declarations to others, that he had given it to him; and by the fact, that, even after his daughter\u2019s death, and after <em>Darlington\u2019s </em>second marriage, he had permitted him to enjoy the property without the least disturbance. And, he said, the relinquishment by <em>Darlington, </em>of his beneficial contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>with <em>Vanmeter, </em>was a valuable consideration performed on his part, which made the agreement obligatory on <em>M\u2019Coole \u00bf </em>and this performance of the agreement by <em>Darlington </em>on his part, and the possession of the land, given him by <em>M\u2019 Coole </em>immediately, and enjoyed for so many years, took the case out of the statute of frauds.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b52-5\"><em>Nicholas and Leigh, </em>for tire appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANT\">submitted, that there was no <em>agreement </em>proved; that, taking the plaintiff\u2019s own evidence, waving all criticisms to which it was obnoxious, and disregarding the evidence adduced on the other side, the most that could be pretended, was, that <em>M\u2019Coole </em>had <em>promised, </em>or rather <em>had intended, to give </em>the land, as an advancement to his daughter, with the view of having her <em>settled in his </em>neighbourhood. But, if there was an <em>agreement, </em>there was no consideration, no such act performed by <em>Darling-ton, </em>no such loss incurred by him, as made it obligatory on <em>M\u2019 Coole, </em>in law or in equity, to fulfil the promise, under any circumstances; much more, to convey to <em>Darlington, </em>after his wife\u2019s death, property, which he could only have intended to give, if at all, as an advancement and provision for her. According to his own shewing in the bill, he had made no contract with <em>Vanmeter: </em>he was only engaged in a <em>treaty </em>with him: and the evidence, narrowly examined, proves there was nothing more.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\"> He did not sit in the cause, because he had decided it in the court of chancery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b52-6\">Brooke, <em>President,</em></author>\n<p id=\"Apz\">delivered the opinion of the court? The appellant, in his bill, without noticing the death of his first wife, or the existence of his daughter by her, or his second marriage and his issue by that marriage, claims for himself, a conveyance in fee of the land on which he had settled, on two distinct grounds; first, a <em>promise </em>made him by his father-in-law, <em>by letter before the </em>marriage; and, secondly, an <em>agreement after the marriage, </em>to give the land to him, in consideration of his relinquishing a valuable contract he had made with <em>Vanmeter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Of the <em>letter before the marriage, </em>there is no proof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>As to the <em>agreement after the marriage, </em>tlie evidence, taking it most favourably for the appellant, is, that M'<em>Coole gave </em>him the property in question, as far as he could give it to him by parol, and by putting him in possession of it; hut there was no consideration for this gift, beyond the parental motive to advance his daughter, and to have her settled in his neighbourhood. There was, in fact, no concluded contract between the appellant and <em>Vanmeter. </em>The hill itself states, that the contract with <em>Vanmeter </em>was inchoate only; and although an attempt was made to prove by <em>Van-meter, </em>that it was concluded, and that he reluctantly absolved the appellant from it, in consequence of a letter from <em>M \u2019 Coole, </em>soliciting him to do so; yet he did not know, that the letter was from <em>M\u2019 Coole, </em>and it is lost. It seems clear, from the evidencie of <em>Vanmeter </em>and <em>Lewis M\u2019 Coole, </em>taken on the part of the appellant, that, according to the statement iu tlie hill, <em>Darlington\u2019s </em>contract with <em>Vanmeter </em>was inchoate only, and depended on the appellant\u2019s advancing money to the value of half the stock in <em>Vanmeter\u2019s </em>tan-yard, and for the employment of half the hands, and the payment of half of all oilier expenses; which would have required a large sum of money, such as the appellant could have by no means commanded, but by selling a tract of land which he held. So that, if he gave up any thing in consequence of <em>M\u2019 Coole\u2019s </em>promise, it was an uncertain speculation. The improvements on <em>The Falling Waters, </em>were of a character to induce no pecuniary expenditure; and, such as they were, <em>M\u2019 Coole </em>is proved to have contributed two-thirds the labour of making them; and the appellant\u2019s portion of the labour of making them, was more than compensated by the use of the property for thirteen years, or more, free of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">In such a case, when the donor has received nothing, and the donee lost nothing; when the chief motive of the gift, a provision for the donor\u2019s daughter, is annihilated by her death; and when the father has discharged the moral obligation to provide for her issue; there is nothing to call into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>action the powers of a court of equity. There is neither a valuable nor a meritorious consideration; without one of which, a court of equity will not aid a defective conveyance, much less enforce a bare agreement, even if it were in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-3\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
