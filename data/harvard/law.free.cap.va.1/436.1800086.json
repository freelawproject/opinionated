And Carr., <em>J. </em>intimated an impression, hut not a decided opinion, that <em>debt would not lie: </em>but the point was not decided, nor did the other judges give any opinion concerning it. The case eventually turned on the question, Whether <em>Elwes, </em>for whose benefit the execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>tion was sued out, as appeared by the indorsement upon it, . . 7 . <em>,7, </em>coidd mamtam the motion, <em>%n ms own name f</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-5\"><em>Harrison </em>insisted, that, as the statute giving this sumrnary remedy, at once dispenses with the ordinary course of the common law, and inflicts a heavy penalty in the form of interest allowed on the debt, it ought to be construed strictly. The statute gives the motion to <em>the creditor at whose suit the execution shall issue,. </em>Now, <em>Wallaek, not Elwes, </em>was that creditor. He alone was the plaintiff on the record: he alone could maintain debt or <em>scire facias </em>on the judgment: and if a forthcoming bond had been taken, it must have been made payable to him; and he alone could have moved for an award of execution upon it. That the execution was indorsed \u201c for the benefit of <em>Elwes,\u201d </em>could not help the case. It did not appear, that that indorsement was made <em>by Wallaek </em>or <em>by his </em>direction, and it might have been the act of <em>Elwes </em>himself; and if it was the act of <em>Wallaclc, </em>it was not an assignment of the judgment or of the execution to <em>Elwes; </em>and indeed, neither of them was by law assignable, nor could a court of law take any notice of such an assignment. If the <em>return </em>afforded any foundation at all for such a motion, there could be no doubt, that <em>Wallaek </em>might have made it; and if so, the judgment for <em>Elwes </em>could present no bar to a future motion by <em>Wallack.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b451-6\"><em>Patton </em>said, that though originally <em>choses in action </em>were held not assignable either in law or equity, yet the broad ground was soon taken, that all such assignments were good in equity; and then it was held at law, that though such assignments do not transfer the legal title, they transfer every thing else; that they authorise the assignee to sue in the name of the assignor, and the assignor cannot control the proceeding; that the assignor\u2019s legal right is merely subservient to the equitable right of the assignee. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Micheson, </em>4 Rand. 268. Our statute gives the assignee of a bond or note a right to sue in his own name; but it does not chango the nature of his title, for his title is still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>not a <em>legal </em>but only an <em>equitable </em>one. <em>Ibid. </em>In the present case, the court must intend, that the indorsement on the execution, that it was for <em>Elwes\u2019s </em>benefit, was made by the clerk; and that, in making it, he was governed by the record, which shewed that the suit had been prosecuted for his benefit; for such is the constant practice and course of business. And then, as <em>Elwes </em>was the creditor in fact, at whose suit the original writ was purchased, so he was the creditor at whose suit the executions issued. Certainly, the sheriff was bound to take notice of the indorsement, and to account to <em>Elwes </em>for the money. If <em>Wallach </em>had a right to control the execution, or to receive the money made upon it, the right of an assignee to proceed in the name of the assignor to recover the debt assigned, is reduced to nothing. <em>Elwes </em>was <em>\u201c </em>the party to whom the money was payable,\u201d in the strictest sense of the statute in question; the party to whom the injury accrued by the failure of the sheriff to make the payment, for which the statute gives the summary remedy. Could the statute have been intended to give the remedy, not to the party injured, but to the plaintiff on the record who is not injured? The statute does not give the motion to the <em>plaintiff </em>on <em>the </em>record, but to the <em>creditor at whose suit the execution issues. </em>Let its language be scanned: whenever the return is such as to entitle the <em>plaintiff </em>to an action of debt, then, not the <em>plaintiff, </em>but <em>the creditor at whose suit the execution issues, </em>whoever he may be, may move against the delinquent officer. This motion was not a proceeding to enforce the execution of <em>Wallack\u2019s </em>judgment; the execution was consummate; and the motion was made to recover the money of the sheriff, for his default, by the party to whom the injury accrued.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\"> The statute provides, that <em>\u201c </em>if any sheriff, under sheriff or other officer, shall make return upon any writ of <em>fieri facias </em>or <em>venditioni </em>exponas, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>he hath levied the debt, damages and costs, as in such writ required, or any part thereof, and shall not immediately pay the same <em>to the party to whom, the same is </em>payable\u2014or shall malte any other return upon any such execution, as will shew that such sheriff, under sheriff or other officer-, hath voluntarily and without authority omitted to levy the same, or as would entitle <em>the plaintiff </em>to recover from such sheriff or other officer, <em>by action of debt, </em>the debt, damages or costs, in such execution mentioned, and such sheriff or other officer shall not immediately pay the same <em>to the party to whom it is payable </em>or to his attorney\u2014then, or in either of the said cases, it shall and may he lawful <em>for the creditor, at whose suit </em>such writ of <em>fieri facias, venditioni exponas </em>&amp;c. shall issue, upon a motion made in the next succeeding general court, or other court from whence such writ shall issue, to demand judgment against such sheriff, under sheriff or other officer, or the securities of either of them, or their legal'representatives, jointly, for the money or tobacco mentioned in such writ, or so much as shall be returned levied on such writs of <em>fieri facias </em>or <em>venditioni exponas, </em>with interest thereon, at the rate of 15 <em>per cent, per ann. </em>from the return day of the execution, until the judgment shall be discharged &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b452-6\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZ-\">At common law, we know, <em>choses in action </em>were not assignable; nor could courts of law formerly take any notice of the <em>equitable </em>where it was distinct from the <em>legal </em>right. Courts of equity, however, held those assignments good, and enforced them; and, in later times, courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>of law have so far relaxed, as, in some instances, to notice the equitable right. Thus, they-will not suffer the assignor, whose name is used by the assignee in suing, to dismiss or in any way control the suit. Again, if the real owner of the debt, though not plaintiff on the record, be indebted to the defendant, the court will allow the defendant to set-off this debt against that for which he is sued. Thus the law stands in <em>England, </em>where there is no law permitting the assignment of <em>dioses in action. </em>But the courts of law have never gone so far as to suffer the assignee to institute a suit in his own name. (I am not speaking of bills of exchange assignable by the law merchant, or of promissory notes made so by the statute of <em>Anne, </em>but of mere <em>dioses in action </em>as contradistinguished from commercial paper.) Our statute declares \u201c assignments of bonds, bills and promissory notes, and other writings obligatory whatsoever, valid, and that the assignee may sue in his own name\u201d &amp;c. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 125. \u00a7 5. p. 484. It will be seen at once, that judgments and executions are not embraced by this statute: they, therefore, remain as at common law. And it may be laid down, as a general proposition, that in no proceeding to carry a judgment or execution into effect, can the name of the transferree he substituted for that of the plaintiff upon the record. But this proposition, deduced from the general principles of law, is still more clearly and strongly established by the particular statute under which this motion is made j by the words of which, the motion is given <em>to the creditor at whose suit the execution shall issue. </em>This, it seems to me, can mean no other than the plaintiff on the record. I think, therefore, this motion could not be maintained in the name of <em>Elwes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">This point being sufficient for the reversal of the judgment, it is not necessary to give an opinion on the other points discussed at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The other judges concurred, and the judgment was reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
