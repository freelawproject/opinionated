The judgment of the County Court was reversed in the District Court \u00a7 from which the plaintiff below appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-10\">Mar shall, <em>far the </em>appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7\">contended, that only part of the issue having been found, the whole verdict mus\u00ed be set aside. He cited <em>Co.

The jury should have found that the defendant did, or did not, detain the fifth slave. This is exactly like the case of <em>Custice v. Posey </em>in the old General Court <em>% </em>which was an action of <em>de\u00fanue </em>for three cows, and the jury \u00a1having only found a verdict as to two, the verdict was set aside. But the judgment of the District Court in this case is also erroneous, in not awarding a <em>Venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">Both judgments therefore must be reversed, and \u00bfhe cause remanded to the County Court, to be tried anew.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
