These executions were put into the hands of the sheriff of the county. <em>Joseph Waller, </em>the principal, had, at the time, personal property in his possession, amply sufficient to satisfy the whole amount of debt. And the sheriff went to his house, three days before the return day, for the purpose of levying the executions on <em>his </em>property then and there, with the avowed design to take it into his own keeping, when <em>Joseph Waller </em>prevailed on the creditors to give him a short indulgence; and they, at his instance, without the consent or knowledge of <em>Curtis Waller, </em>the surety, gave written instructions to the sheriff, <em>not to levy the executions till they should see him. </em>These were the terms of the instructions; the creditors not <em>binding </em>themselves to suspend proceedings for any time, but giving a mere indulgence to be determined at their own pleasure. In consequence of the instructions thus given him, the sheriff forbore to levy the executions, and made return on them, <em>Not executed by order of the plaintiffs. </em>Very shortly afterwards, June 7th 1822, <em>M\u2019Kenny\u2019s </em>executors sued out new writs of <em>fieri facias; but, </em>after these new executions were put into the sheriff\u2019s hands, <em>Joseph Waller </em>removed the greater part of his effects out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the county and beyond the reach of the process; so that the sheriff could not find enough of <em>Ms </em>property, to satisfy the amount of the three executions. What lie could find of it, he took; and then, for the residue of the debt, he levied the process on the property of <em>Curtis Waller, </em>the surety.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">Upon this state of facts, <em>Curtis Waller </em>insisted, that he was, in equity, discharged from his liability for the debts? by reason of the indulgence given by the creditors to his principal, without his consent or knowledge, at a time when the principal\u2019s property was, in effect, as he alleged, in the sheriff\u2019s hands, and could not have been exempted from the executions then in force, or withdrawn beyond the reach of future process, without the voluntary permission and order of the creditors to the sheriff. And he presented his bill to the court of chancery of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>setting forth this equity, and praying, that <em>.M\u2019Kenny\u2019s </em>executors should be enjoined from further proceedings on their executions against <em>Mm.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">The chancellor granted the injunction: the executors of <em>M.\u2019Kenny </em>answered the bill: depositions were taken by both parties, and the circumstances of the case, as above stated, were clearly proved: and, upon the final hearing, the chancellor decreed that the injunction should be made perpetual. <em>M\u2019Kenny\u2019s </em>executors appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-8\"><em>Harrison, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab4Z\">cited <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Crummey, </em>2 Rand. 328. and <em>Hunter\u2019s adm\u2019rs. </em>v. <em>Jett, 4 </em>Rand. 104.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-10\"><em>Briggs, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL8\">said, that this was a peculiar case, and ought to be decided upon its own circumstances. Here, the property of the principal, and that amply sufficient to satisfy the whole debt, was, in effect, in the sheriff\u2019s hands: and he was only prevented from taking it into his own keeping, by the express instructions of the creditors; who, of their own accord, relinquished their hold upon it, and thus gave the principal debtor the opportunity, of which he availed himself, to put that \u25a0 very property beyond the reach of future process. Tt surely could not be said, in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>case, as was said in <em>Peel </em>v. <em>Tatlock, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 422. that the favor shewn by the creditor to the principal, <em>.did not work an injury to the surety. </em>The injury was palpabl<em>e </em>and certain.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b448-7\">Coalter, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AZic\">delivered the resolution of the court, that, according to the principles of the cases decided by this court on this subject, there was no ground whatever on which the decree could be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The decree was reversed, the injunction dissolved, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
