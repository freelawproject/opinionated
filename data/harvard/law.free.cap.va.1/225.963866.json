The work to be done by each is agreed upon between them, and they commence its execution: but the carpenter, from misfortune in business, becomes unable to comply with his portion of the agreement. Thereupon a new agreement is made, that the carpenter shall cover in the house, and that for the work he has done, and for covering the house, he shall be allowed the value thereof, and receive that amount in land out of the tract. The carpenter nevertheless fails to cover in the house, and the bricklayer has this part of the work done. Held, 1. that by the new agreement, the carpenter\u2019s interest in the land is such proportion thereof, as the amount of work then done, and under that agreement to be done by him, was of the original price of the land; and <em>2. </em>that this proportion is charged to the bricklayer with the value of the work which under that agreement ought to have been, but was not, done by the carpenter.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b253-7\">The carpenter makes a deed of trust conveying his interest in the land to secure two persons, sureties for him in a bond, one of whom is the bricklayer. Being afterwards taken in execution at the suit of other creditors, the carpenter is discharged as an insolvent debtor, and his interest in the land is sold by the sheriff, and purchased, at the price of 50 cents, for the bricklayer. The bricklayer afterwards declares that the carpenter shall have such benefit from the land as his work entitles him to, and upon applying to his cosurety in the bond to contribute to the satisfaction thereof, states that he does not mean to keep the land for what it sold for; that he wants no advantage of that kind. The cosurety makes contribution. Eleven years afterwards, upon a bill in equity being filed by the carpenter, the bricklayer insists that the sale by the sheriff is valid. Held, the carpenter is entitled to redeem the interest sold by the sheriff; and a decree should be made for partition of the land, so as to assign him his due proportion, holding the same chargeable with such amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>as may be ascertained to be due the bricklayer, after crediting for the yaiUe of the work done by him that ought to have been done by the carpenter, the sum paid by him in discharge of his suretyship, and the 50 cents paid the sheriff, and debiting him with such portion of the rents and profits as the interest of the carpenter in the land entitles him to.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">On the 2Sth of February 1818, articles of agreement were entered into between <em>James M'Dowell Moffett </em>of the one part and <em>Dabney Cosby </em>and <em>William Lambert </em>of the other part, whereby it was witnessed that <em>Moffett </em>had bargained and sold to <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert </em>a tract of land in <em>Augusta </em>county. Possession of the land .was to be immediately delivered, and <em>Moffett </em>bound himself to convey the land to <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert </em>on demand. In consideration of which, <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert </em>bound themselves to pay to <em>Moffett </em>the sum of 5600 dollars in manner following, to wit: 4455 dollars as full consideration for certain building agreed to be done by <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert </em>for <em>Moffett; </em>and the residue to be paid in six equal instalments, commencing on the first day of October 1820; the payment of the said instalments, and the performance of the said contract on the part of <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert, </em>to be secured by a lien on the land sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">About the same time, to wit, in March 1818, articles were entered into between <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert, </em>the former of whom was a bricklayer and the latter a carpenter, by which, after reciting the purchase of land from <em>Moffett </em>for 5600 dollars, for part of which they were to do work and for the residue whereof they had given their joint bonds, it was set forth, that <em>Lambert </em>was to find all his own materials, locks, nails, glass &amp;c. and do his part, for 2055 dollars, and that <em>Cosby </em>was to do the brick work and plaistering, and find his own materials &amp;c. for 2000 dollars, and that the painting, which was estimated at 400 dollars, was to be done at their joint expense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>On the 12th of November 1819, a new agreement was made between <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert, </em>whereby, after reciting the preceding contracts, and setting forth, that from unexpected misfortune in business, <em>Lambert </em>had become unable to comply with his portion of the agreement, it was agreed that <em>Lambert </em>should proceed forthwith to cover in the dwelling house mentioned in the contract, in the true spirit of the contract, and then be released from any further obligations imposed on him thereby; and that, for the work he had theretofore done agreeably to contract, materials furnished, and covering in the dwelling house, he <em>Lambert </em>should be allowed their value, and receive that amount in land, out of the tract before mentioned. <em>Cosby </em>agreed, on his part, to perform all the covenants of <em>Lambert </em>in the agreement aforesaid, except as before excepted, and to receive, as full compensation therefor, the residue of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-4\">On the 16th of November 1819, <em>William Lambert </em>made a deed of trust to <em>Erasmus Stribling, </em>conveying his interest in the land to indemnify <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Abraham. Lambert </em>in consequence of their having become bound, on the 9th of November 1819, as sureties for <em>William Lambert </em>in a bond to <em>Silas H. Smith </em>for 585 dollars 20 cents, payable one half on the 9th of November 1820, and the residue one year thereafter, with interest from the date of the bond.

At the time of his being discharged as an insolvent debtor, to wit, on the 27th of December 1820, <em>Lambert </em>made a deed to <em>J. M\u2019Nutt </em>sheriff of <em>Augusta </em>county, conveying, besides a moiety of another tract of land in <em>Augusta, </em>his interest in the tract conveyed by <em>Moffett. </em>This deed was admitted to record a few days after its date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>On the 26th of February 1821, a deed was made, purporting to be between <em>James M\u2019NuU </em>sheriff of <em>Augusta </em>county, of the one part, and <em>Henry J. Tapp </em>of the other part, wherein it was set forth that <em>John Churchman, </em>a deputy for <em>M\u2019Nutt, </em>had, on a court day, advertised the lands conveyed by <em>Lambert </em>to the sheriff, and had afterwards, pursuant to the advertisement, and to the act of assembly, proceeded to sell the same, and that <em>Henry J. Tapp </em>became the purchaser of <em>Lambert\u2019s </em>interest in the second tract conveyed by the deed, at 50 cents, (the other tract, to wit, that first named in the deed, not being sold for want of bidders). Thereupon the deed witnessed that <em>M\u2019Nutt </em>sheriff as aforesaid, by his said deputy, in consideration of the said sum of 50 <em>cents, </em>conveyed to <em>Tapp the said Lambert\u2019s interest in </em>the said tract of land acquired by <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Lambert </em>from <em>Moffett. </em>The deed stated in the conclusion thereof, that <em>M\u2019Nutt </em>sheriff as aforesaid, by <em>Churchman his </em>deputy, had thereunto set his hand and seal. And it was accordingly signed, \u201c <em>James M\u2019NuU S. </em>A.

He said it was not intended to take any advantage of <em>Lambert.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-8\">In 1822, judgment was entered in the county court of <em>Augusta </em>against <em>Cosby </em>on the bond to <em>Smith, </em>wherein <em>Cosby </em>and <em>Abraham Lambert </em>were co-obligors with <em>William Lambert. </em>An execution having issued the 8th of April 1822, returnable to May court following, <em>Cosby, </em>on the 15th of May, addressed a letter to <em>Abraham </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>Lambert, </em>urging him to contribute promptly to the satisa faction of the judgment, and concluding in these terms: \u201c <em>William </em>has sent word to me to know if I meant to keep his part of the land for the amount sold for. I have said, no, I did not. I repeat the same to you. I want no pitiful advantage of that kind, and I request you not to let me suffer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-7\">For part of the bond to <em>Smith, </em>to wit, 100 dollars, <em>Cosbij </em>was principal debtor. For the residue thereof, he and <em>Abraham Lambert </em>were cosureties. The latter contributed, on the 5th of August 1822, on account of the debt, the sum of 229 dollars 39 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-9\">On the 20th of January 1823, <em>Cosby </em>addressed a letter to <em>Lambert, </em>commencing thus : \u201c I am endeavouring to prepare my <em>Moffett </em>accounts for a general settlement, and I wish you to say how long you consider me bound for the hire of your boys, whether from the time they quit <em>Moffett\u2019s </em>work, or whether until they were free.\u201d After some other remarks, he says, \u201c I shall have the painting done this spring, and endeavour to settle as shortly thereafter as possible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-11\">Having paid off the creditors at whose suit he took the oath of insolvency, <em>Lambert, </em>in November 1833, exhibited a bill in the circuit court of <em>Augusta </em>against <em>Cosby, </em>wherein, after setting forth the contracts of February and March 1818 and of November 1819, he stated, that his affairs requiring him to remove to <em>Shenandoah </em>county, he found it inconvenient to cover in the dwelling house, and <em>Cosby </em>consented to relieve him from that part of his engagement, and employed a person to do that part of the work. That the work done and materials furnished by the complainant amounted to a considerable sum ; and he exhibits an account of the same. That the complainant had been under the necessity of taking the oath of insolvency, and his interest in the land had been sold by the sheriff. That the complainant had no notice of the sale, and was not present when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>it occurred. That he does not know whether it was conducted in the mode prescribed by law, and he requires evidence on the subject. That <em>Cosby </em>became the purchaser of the complainant\u2019s interest for the paltry sum of 50 <em>cents, </em>though no one knew its real value better than himself. That since the sale, <em>Cosby </em>has disclaimed all intention of keeping said property from the complainant, but has never made him any compensation. That the complainant was for a considerable time prevented from seeking redress against <em>Cosby </em>in a court of justice, by his the complainant\u2019s embarrassed circumstances, the distant residence of <em>Cosby, </em>and the hope, encouraged by his repeated declarations, that he would adjust the matter amicably. The prayer of the bill was, that the complainant\u2019s account for his work, materials, and other advances about the buildings; might be stated and settled before a commissioner; that the last contract between him and <em>Cosby </em>might be specifically executed; that <em>Cosby </em>might be compelled to surrender and convey <em>to </em>him a due <em>proportion of the </em>land, if to be had, and if not, to pay in money what is due the complainant, with interest thereon; and for general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-4\">The cause coming on to be heard upon the bill taken for confessed, and exhibits, the court made an order referring the accounts between the parties to a commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\"><em>Cosby </em>afterwards filed his answer, denying that he ever consented to release the plaintiff from the contract of the 12th of November 1819, and stating on the contrary, that the plaintiff, without his consent, violated it, and left him to have the building covered and the work completed in the best manner he could, \u2022whereby he was subjected to great disappointment and loss. The answer controverted the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s account, and stated the conviction of the defendant that on a fair and full <em>settlement </em>the plaintiff <em>wonld be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>largely his debtor. The lapse of time and loss of evi- , ,. , . . ... dence, the defendant feared, would render it impossible to make such a settlement; and he insisted upon the statute of limitations. The plaintiff, he contended, could not claim under the contract, but only on a <em>quantum meruit, </em>so much as his work &amp;c. were worth ; and such a claim, the defendant insisted, was clearly barred. He further objected to the jurisdiction of equity, insisting that the plaintiff could only proceed at law. The answer did not admit that the plaintiff was prevented from sooner impeaching the sale by any of the causes mentioned in the bill, but required proof of the same. The defendant averred that the sale was fair ; alleged that the interest of <em>Lambert </em>sold for its full value ; and insisted that the sale was in every respect legal and valid, and that after such a lapse of time, it ought not to be disturbed. He stated, that he had long been under the impression that he was the purchaser at the <em>sale; </em>but it appeared by the records that <em>Henry J. Tapp </em>became the purchaser, and that the sheriff conveyed to him; and the heirs of <em>Tapp, </em>he said, should therefore be made parties. The defendant acknowledged that he had hitherto claimed and possessed the land, and stated that he was sure <em>Tapp </em>never intended to claim any interest in it. He supposed that <em>Tapp, </em>being a friend and near connexion of his, happening to be at the sale, bought the land to protect his the defendant\u2019s interest. The defendant denied having disclaimed to hold under the purchase without settlement or remuneration. He supposed that he might have said, that if the complainant would settle fairly and pay the money due, he was willing the complainant should take a fair proportion of the land. But no such declaration, he urged, could give the complainant any right, since he declined acting upon it when a fair settlement was practicable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>The commissioner made a report, stating a balance due the plaintiff of 425 dollars 35 cents, with interest from the 5th of August 1822, and that if the plaintiff should be considered entitled to interest on his claim anterior to the 5th of August 1822, then the balance on that day would be 548 dollars 59 cents, bearing interest from that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-3\">It appeared by a certificate of the clerk of <em>Augusta </em>county court, that <em>Coshy </em>and wife, on the 5th of May 1824, conveyed to <em>Samuel Todd </em>100 acres, part of the tract conveyed by <em>Moffett.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-4\">The cause came on to be heard the 26lh of November 1836 ; and there being no exception to the report of the commissioner, the court affirmed the same, declared that the plaintiff was entitled to recover agreeably to the second statement therein, and further declared that as the defendant had sold and conveyed the land, or part thereof, the said plaintiff had a right to receive compensation in money. Thereupon the court decreed that the defendant pay to the plaintiff the sum of 548 dollars 59 cents, with interest thereon from the 5th of August 1822 till paid, and the costs of suit; subject however to a deduction of 50 cents, the price at which the land was sold by the sheriff of <em>Augusta </em>county, with interest thereon from the 4th monday in January 1821, which sum of 50 cents was to be retained by the defendant without prejudice to any claim thereto on the part of the representatives of <em>Tapp. </em>And the court declared that the decree was without prejudice to any claim on the part of the plaintiff to subject the land in the hands of the purchaser or any other person, if payment could not be coerced from the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">On the petition of <em>Cosby, </em>an appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-6\"><em>Michie </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtVU\">By the statute 1 R. C. p. 538. \u00a7 34. the interest of <em>Lambert </em>in the land became vested in the sheriff of <em>Augusta </em>county. Being so vested, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>whatever sale the debtor could have made, the sheriff might make; whatever interest the debtor could have passed, the sheriff might pass. The sheriff may do more than the debtor. He may part with an interest which the debtor could not dispose of; for example, where the debtor has made a deed valid between the parties. Not only does the statute authorize the sheriff to sell and convey, but it requires him to do so, and it provides no other means of making the interest available. The 3-5th section prescribes, it is true, another remedy for the recovery of money due or personal property belonging to the insolvent, in the possession of another ; but it extends no farther. Other interests in property, the sheriff is compelled by the imperative terms of the statute to sell. He is under no obligation to go into equity to ascertain the extent of liens thereon. <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Long &amp;c. </em>6 Rand. 764.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-5\">II. The suit is not brought until more than 12 years after the conveyance to <em>Tapp. </em>It is an application to rescind a contract made and executed, which will not be done if the case be clear of fraud. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>3 Rand. 504. <em>Shelly </em>v. <em>Nash &amp;c. </em>3 Madd. C. R. 125. Here there is no ground for the imputation of fraud, except the ground of inadequacy of price. But that is no badge of fraud where the sale is by auction. Still less should it be so considered here, where the sale is by a sworn officer. The objection of lapse of time is not obviated by the proof of <em>Cosby's </em>declarations: they were connected with a settlement which then might have been easily made, but could not be made now. He had claims then, the evidence of which is now lost.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">III. The plaintiff has not convened the heirs of <em>Tapp, </em>\u25a0who may claim under the sale, nor the sheriff, who, if there be misconduct, is the party that has been guilty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao5\">IV. The effect of the decree js to make <em>Cosby </em>a purchaser of the land in spite of himself. This operates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>unjustly, because of the great fall in the price of land since 1818. Interest too is allowed from the time the work was done on the estimated value of the work; whereas the annual rent or value of the land, instead of amounting to <em>sixper cent, </em>would not be more than three. The court should at most only have decreed to <em>Lambert </em>land in proportion to his work and materials.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-6\"><em>John B. Baldwin </em>and <em>Robinson for </em>appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3J\"><em>If, </em>according to the agreement of February 1818, <em>Moffett </em>made a conveyance, <em>Coshy </em>and <em>Lambert </em>acquired the legal title to the land, and were joint tenants thereof. If no such conveyance was made, still they had an equitable title, and whenever turned into a legal title, it must necessarily be in the two jointly and equally. <em>Moffett, </em>under his contract, could convey no other. He was not to look to the proportions in which they separately performed. Their performance was to be secured by a lien on the <em>land; </em>and no matter which failed, the lien equally existed on the whole. If the case had stood on the agreement of February <em>ISIS, </em>and <em>Cosby </em>had paid more than half the consideration money, his claim against <em>Lambert </em>would have been for so much money paid and advanced, \"with an implied lien on <em>Lambert's </em>part for whatever <em>Cosby </em>had paid exceeding his half. The agreement of March 1818 does not materially change the condition of the parties. Had it been carried out, both parties would still have been equal owners of the land. In respect to the 55 dollars, <em>Lambert </em>would have had a claim against <em>Cosby, </em>and a lien on <em>Cosby's </em>part of the land. Or if one paid what was intended to be paid by the other, still it would have been the same case of a claim for so much money paid, with an implied lien therefor. But on the 12th of November 1819 a new agreement was made. <em>Lambert, </em>having already done work and furnished materials, was, upon the principle of this last agreement, entitled to a proportion of the land; and if he proceeded to cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in the dwelling house, that proportion would be increased, He was thus entitled to a proportion of the land, when, on the 16th of November 1819, he made the deed of trust to <em>Striding. </em>After making that deed, he took the oath of insolvency, and made a deed to the sheriff, who sold his interest in the land. That sale was improper and illegal, being of a contingent interest of uncertain extent. An equitable and contingent interest in goods is not permitted to be sold under a <em>fieri facias. Claytor v. Anthony, </em>6 Rand. 285. The same reason applies to a sale by a sheriff of an insolvent\u2019s interest: and the statute ought not to be construed to require the sale of such an interest. The construction should be, that the sheriff is to sell that which is a fit subject for sale, not <em>dioses in </em>action, nor equitable and contingent interests. It is conceded <em>that dioses in action </em>ought not to be sold, and the reason assigned is, that in respect to them a remedy is prescribed by the 35th section. But that section gives no remedy against debtors out of the commonwealth ; and such debts, it would be necessary to contend, are to be sold. This cannot be. Were a merchant to fail, having debts due him from numerous consignees abroad, it could never be endured that such debts should be sold at public auction. The opinions of the judges who W\u2019ent farthest in <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Long </em>(6 Rand. 747. 753.) only ascertain that the sale and conveyance by the sheriff will pass the <em>legal </em>title, like the sale and conveyance of any other trustee ; not that the same will be sanctioned by a court of equity, when the sale ought not to have been made, or has not been made in a proper manner. The difference between the two tribunals has more than once been recognized in this court. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>King, </em>6 Munf. 358. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>6 Munf. 367. Here, besides that a deed of trust had been made, and the interest in the land might be subject to that deed, that interest was itself of an uncertain extent, depending on the value of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the work clone and materials found. That value ought to have been ascertained in a suit against <em>Cosby, </em>before any sale was made. The nature of the interest, and the price for which it was sold, furnish of themselves sufficient reasons for not allowing <em>Lambert\u2019s </em>rights to be diminished by the sale. But however it might be otherwise, there is no room for question after the verbal declaration of <em>Cosby, </em>and his letter of the 15th of May <em>1822. After buying subject to the </em>lien created by the deed of trust for the amount of the debt due <em>Smith, </em>and getting relieved from part of that debt by saying he would take no advantage of the sale, he cannot be permitted to take that advantage now. If the sale for 50 cents was fair when subject to the whole amount of that debt, it is very different now.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-4\">II. The suit being for land, no time short of that which would bar an ejectment is a bar here. Besides, it does not lie in <em>the </em>mouth <em>of Cosby to object that the </em>suit has been unreasonably delayed : for it was as much incumbent on him to bring suit for an adjustment of the accounts with <em>Lambert, </em>and partition between them, as it was incumbent on <em>Lambert. </em>This, too, is not a case in which <em>Cosby </em>has been sleeping in security, and is now surprised with a claim. His verbal declaration, and his letters of May 15, 1822 and January 20, 1823, shew that it is not. The last of the bonds to <em>Moffett </em>did not become payable until the <em>1st of October 1825, and </em>until those bonds were paid, the due proportion of each could not be ascertained. Add to this the embarrassed circumstances of <em>Lambert, </em>the fact of the schedule creditors being so long the parties in interest, and the other circumstances mentioned in the bill, and all ground of objection because of the lapse of time is removed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b264-5\">III. Though the conveyance to <em>Tapp </em>is in the name of <em>M\u2019Nutt </em>as grantor, it is not executed by him, nor by any person as his attorney in fact, but by his deputy. It therefore conveys no legal title. Still, if <em>Cosby </em>had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>simply stated that <em>Tapp </em>purchased, there might have been some reason for making him a party. But according to the answer of <em>Cosby, Tapp </em>did not acquire either the legal or equitable title : whatever title he acquired was <em>Gosbifs. </em>And the enquiry here should simply be in relation to <em>Lambert\u2019s </em>rights, as between him and <em>Cosby.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-4\">There can be no occasion for making the sheriff a party. He had merely an equity after the deed of trust should be satisfied, and that equity was in him for the benefit of creditors who are now satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b265-5\">IY. .Perhaps, in strictness, <em>Cosby </em>should have had a decree giving him a portion of the land, bearing the same proportion to the whole land as 790 dollars 86 cents to 5600 dollars (which would be about a seventh), and a due proportion of the rents and profits, and compelling him to pay the balance due on the deed of trust. But <em>Cosby </em>has sold part of the land ; and it is because he has gotten into possession, and done acts which interfere with a fair division of the land, that the circuit court considered itself authorized to decree money instead of land. He ought not to be permitted to object that his vendee is not interfered with. And even though his liability shall be held to be for the value of the land, yet that value ought to be shewn by him ; and not being shewn to be less than when the contract was made with <em>Moffett, </em>the objection is not open to him that the value is actually less.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-7\"><em>C.

As to debts and personal effects in the possession of another, particular provision is made; but as to every thing else, there must be a sale. The sheriff is a trustee, as completely as if made so by the contract of the parties, in which case there is no doubt a sale might be made. If creditors perceive that injury will be done, they may go into equity within the 60 days, and ask that the sale be enjoined ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>and the court, in any case in which the direction of the law ought not to be followed, will give relief. But where there is no injunction, it is the duty of the sheriff to sell. There is no analogy between this case and that of a <em>fieri facias. </em>That issues against the goods and chattels of the debtor; and the sheriff cannot take goods which are not legally the debtor\u2019s. He cannot take goods in which the interest of the debtor is merely equitable. But here the sheriff is owner of the estate, whether legal or equitable. If the sheriff might have sold, he did sell; and no fraud is alleged. There are no' materials even, from which to ascertain that the equity of redemption was worth more than the 50 cents for which it sold. There is no evidence shewing the value of the land, except that which shews the price contracted to be paid for it. That was in 1818, when property was at an inflated value. Since that time, it has never been worth 50 <em>per cent, </em>of what it sold <em>for </em>then.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-4\">II. The lapse of time is a valid objection, under the circumstances. <em>Cosby's </em>statements only bound him in case <em>Lambert </em>should come forward in a reasonable time and shew the state of the accounts. <em>Lambert </em>shews no good reason for not having then come forward and settled; and now it would be difficult to settle properly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-5\">III. <em>Tapp's </em>heirs ought <em>to be </em>parties, to ascertain whether they are interested or not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">IV. Nothing is said in the bill about a sale of any part of the land, and the only evidence on the subject is a certificate of a deed having been made for 100 acres. There being no proof of a sale of the residue, the sale of the 100 acres is no obstacle in the way of doing ample justice. In ascertaining <em>Lambert's </em>share of the land, we have not merely to look to the value of his work and materials; but what <em>Cosby </em>had to pay for covering in the house must be added thereto, and after giving <em>Lambert </em>a part <em>of the land in proportion to the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>combined amount, there will be an incumbrance on <em>Lambert's </em>part of the land in favour of <em>Cosby, </em>for the amount paid by the latter for covering in the house, and also for the balance due on the deed of trust.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">He had been counsel for the appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b267-3\">Stanakd, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AYP\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The court is of opinion that under the agreement of the 12th November 1819, <em>Lambert's </em>original interest in the land was reduced to such proportion thereof, as the amount of the work then done and under that agreement to be done by him, was of 5600 dollars, the original price of the land ; and had he done the work to be performed by him, the proper partition of the land would have been in the proportions aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The court is further of opinion that the failure of <em>Lambert </em>to do the work, did not (at least for his benefit) charge the said proportion of the land on the partition thereof; but the effect of that failure, and the doing of the work <em>by Cosby, </em>left <em>Lambert's </em>proportion of the land unchanged ;\u2014chargeable however to <em>Cosby </em>for the amount of the value of said work which <em>Lambert </em>ought to have done, but which, on his failure, was done by <em>Cosby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The court is further of opinion that notwithstanding the surrender of <em>Lambert's </em>interest in the land when he took the oath of insolvency, and the sale thereof by the sheriff, and purchase by <em>Tapp </em>for <em>Cosby, </em>the subsequent transaction, especially the demand by <em>Cosby </em>of contribution from his cosurety for the debt to <em>Silas II. Smith, </em>which was an incumbrance on <em>Lambert's </em>share of the land by virtue of the conveyance of <em>Lambert </em>to <em>Stribling </em>for the indemnity of the sureties for that debt,\u2014coupled with the assurance that the land, notwithstanding the sheriff\u2019s sale, was still redeemable by <em>Lambert, </em>and the receipt of contribution from that surety, entitled <em>Lambert </em>to redeem, on paying all that was justly chargeable thereon in favour of <em>Cosby.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The court is further of opinion that such right of redemption was all that <em>Lambert </em>could justly claim, and the court below had no authority to convert this into money demand, and by subjecting <em>Cosby </em>to a decree for such money demand, make him a purchaser of the equity of redemption against his will, and that too at a price fixed without enquiry into its value at the time of the decree, or any evidence of such va'lue.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The court is further of opinion that the alleged sale by <em>Cosby </em>of one hundred acres of the land was no effectual impediment to a partition, so as to assign to <em>Lambert </em>his due proportion of the land ; that the proper relief to him would have been a decree for such partition, holding the share allotted to him chargeable with the amount that might be ascertained by account to be due <em>Cosby; </em>that amount to be ascertained by crediting <em>Cosby </em>for the amount of the work done by him that <em>Lambert </em>ought to have done under the said agreement of the 12th November 1819, and the payments of <em>Cosby </em>in discharge of the said debt to <em>Silas M. Smith, </em>and the 50 cents, the amount of the purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and debiting him with the just proportion of the rents and profits that the interest aforesaid of <em>Lambert </em>in the land entitled him to; and subjecting the said share of <em>Lambert </em>to sale, to satisfy the amount so ascertained to be due <em>Cosby, </em>if the same should not be paid in a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The court is further of opinion that in fixing the value of the work done by <em>Lambert, </em>with a view to the ascertainment of his share as aforesaid of the land, respect should be had, as far as practicable, to the standard furnished by the prices that may have governed the original contract, rather than the current prices of other work of the like kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The court is further of opinion that as the sheriff sold to <em>Tapp, </em>and no conveyance appears to have been made by <em>Tapp </em>to <em>Cosby, Tapp\u2019s </em>heirs ought to have been par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ties. Though the record affords strong ground for the inference that <em>Tapp </em>purchased for <em>Cosby, </em>the proceedings in this case, if <em>Tapp\u2019s </em>heirs be not parlies, would not bind them, or be evidence against them ; and if the case were to proceed to decree without making them parties, an ostensible title would be left outstanding, to the assertion of which the decree in this cause would be no bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Therefore the court doth adjudge, order and decree, that the decree be reversed with costs, and that the cause be remanded for farther proceedings in conformity with the foregoing principles.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
