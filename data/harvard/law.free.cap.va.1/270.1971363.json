He was libelled and condemned by the name of <em>Jack Robin-eon, </em>and being sold under the sentence, was purchased by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ilie plaintiff. The defendant got possession of him under a warrant issued in virtue of the Act of Assembly, passed in 1782, c. 8, <em>Rev. Laws, </em>p. 157. Decided that the sentence and sale were not binding upon the former proprieioi\", as he was ixo party to the suit, and the slave was not libelled by the name lie had usually borne. <em>Miter, </em>if the condemnation had been by a foreign Admiralty Coux-t.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-3\">The above slave was not a lawful prize, the jui-y not having-found that he belonged to an inhabitant of <em>Great Britain, </em>or that he was taken in war.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-4\">Though <em>equitable </em>rights may, in favor of a fair <em>bona fide </em>purchaser, for valuable consideration, and without notice, be lost by a sale ; <em>legal </em>rights never can, unless there can be fraud.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b291-5\">In <em>detinue, </em>the jux-y found a verdict for the plaintiff, if the Law upon the facts <em>agreed to be stated, </em>be for him, otherwise for the defendant.\u2014Before they were agreed, the defendant died, and a <em>scire facias </em>issued to his executor's, to show cause why the facts should not be agreed. The executors appeared and agreed a case. This will bind them, though they might have refused to agree a case, and have insisted upon abating the suit.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-6\">This was an action of <em>detinue </em>for a negro, called <em>Jack </em>Robinson, alias <em>Taliver, </em>instituted by the appellants, and determined in the District Coui't of Suffolk. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, if the law, upon the facts <em>agreed to be </em>stated, be for him, if not, then for the defendant. Before these facts were agreed, <em>Thomas Pierce </em>the defendant died, and a <em>scire facias </em>issued against the appellee, his administrator, to shew cause, why the said facts should, not be agreed, and the matter of law thereupon argued. The appellee appeared, and the parties agreed the following case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-10\">That on the clay of July, 1779, the <em>Bishop, </em>an enemy\u2019s vessel, was taken on the high seas by the <em>General </em>Washington, an <em>American </em>vessel, belonging to citizens of the ^ <em>United States. </em>That the slave in the declaration mentioned, was on board the <em>Bishop </em>at the time of her capture, and was then known on board by the name of <em>Jack Robinson. </em>That the vessel and cargo, together with the slave, was brought into <em>Virginia, </em>and condemned as lawful prize, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>purchased under the sentence of the Court, by the plaintiffs. That the slave in question, was once the property of the testator of the defendant, known by the name of Taliver, and so continued, until the year 1777, when he ran off from his master, and got on board a <em>British </em>vessel. That the slave, <em>Jack Robinson, </em>was taken from the possession of the plaintiffs in <em>September </em>1783, by the defendant, in pursuance of a warrant, granted according to an Act of the General Assembly, passed in 1782,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> entitled, \u201c An Act for the recovery of slaves, horses, and other property, lost during the war,\u2019\u2019 and that he still detains him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-3\">If the Court shall be of opinion, that by the sale of the slave under the sentence aforesaid, the defendant lost his property therein, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiffs, otherwise for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Al-x\">The District Court gave judgment for the defendant, from which the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-6\"><em>Lee, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-7\">The only difficulty, on the part of the appellants, is created by the special conclusion of the jury, which would seem to confine our title to the purchase made <em>under the sentence of a Court, in a suit, to which Pierce was no party. </em>And yet hard, at first as it may appear, that the rights of third persons.should be affected by judgments, as to them, <em>ex parte, </em>yet, it is better that a private injury like this should be sustained, than a public inconvenience produced, by discouraging persons from purchasing under the judgments of Courts having competent jurisdiction : a consequence to be certainly expected, if the title of the purchaser could afterwards be questioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-8\">The appellants claim a right to the slave in question, under the Acts of Congress passed in 1775, and 1776, making slaves the subject of lawful prize.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-10\">^ It appears from the facts agreed in the cause, that the enemy did not acquire the slave in dispute, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>plunder, in which case only, the property, by the law of nations, is changed. On the contrary, it is agreed, that the testator\u2019s right was not divested by any act of his own.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-4\">But if the slave had actually been seized by the enesny, in action, the recapture would revest the property \u00bbb the original owner, by the right of postliminium, which extends to all kinds of property taken in war, except moveables ; and these, on account of the uncertainty in <em>identifying </em>them, are never restored. It is true, that slaves are not mentioned in any modem eases, because they are a property unknown in the greatest part of <em>Europe. </em>But <em>Vaitsl </em>states, that amongst the ancients, the right <em>ofpostliminium </em>extended to them. However, a discussion of this point is rendered unnecessary, by the special conclusion of the verdict\u2014I shall proceed then to consider the title of the appellants, as derived under the sentence and sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-5\">There is no principle more clear than this, that in Courts of Common Law and Equity, those only can be affected by their judgments or decrees, who are parties <em>to </em>the suit, or those who claim under them. I acknowledge that the sentence of a Court of Admiralty is binding upon all persons, who are in possession of the property, or who claim under those who are ; because., parties interested are not known, and consequently not named\u00bb But in this case, <em>Pierce </em>was neither in possession himself, nor did he claim under any person who was s his title was adverse to that claimed by the enemy and the captors\u00bb</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-6\">If there be a decree for the sale of mortgaged property, it was never contended, that the rights of third persons, not parties to the suit, could be thereby affected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-7\">I shall not acknowledge the. authority of the resolutions of Congress, which have been read, because, that body were clothed with no powers to legislate for the respective States but if they were, these resolutions, being no more than private regulations, and not being found, cannot be noticed! by the Cota*.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARWq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>I will beg leave to submit to the consideration of the Coort another point, which, though not connected with the merits of the cause, is certainly very inlp0rtant. The suit was abated by the death of Pierce, and ought to have been so entered/ <em>Detinue </em>will not lie against an executor, for a conversion, or in consequence of a detainer by the testator, nor unless the property afterwards come into the possession of the executor. The judgment is for the slave, if to be had, if not, the value. Now the executor cannot perform one of the alternatives, if he never had possession of the property. <em>Bro. Ab. 227\u2014Cowp. Rep. </em>371, in which it was determined, that the action would not lie against the executor, for a finding and conversion by the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-6\">The jury therefore, should either have found, or the parties have agreed, a detainer by the appellee. It may perhaps be contended, that the Act of 22 Geo. <em>II, </em>c. 5, \u00a7 5, which declares, that the death of either party between verdict and judgment, shall not abate the suit, furnishes an answer to this point. But that law must mean, a <em>perfect </em>verdict, and not such a one as might be set aside, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded, or which either party, by refusing to agree the facts, must render ineffectual. Neither can I admit, that the appearance of the executor, and his actually agreeing the facts, will alter the case; because, he only did what the writ of <em>scire facias </em>commanded him\u2014besides, this agreement can extend no farther than to the facts themselves, and cannot cure the errors before committed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-8\"><em>Lee, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3x\">The Act of Assembly which Mr. <em>Wickham </em>has read, seems to apply strictly to this case, because it speaks of verdicts <em>generally, </em>without distinguishing between perfect and imperfect verdicts. But if this were an imperfect verdict, the Court, upon the trial of the <em>scire facias </em>would direct a new trial, and not an abatement. The intention of the law was to prevent the operation of the act of limitations.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-11\">Rev. Laws, Page 157, Ch. 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b295-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>The President</author>\n<p id=\"ALr\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">The first question to be considered in, whether the suit ought to have abated by the death of the original defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The Act of Assembly declares, that the death of either party, between verdict and judgment, shall not abate the suit, but that judgment shall be entered, as if both parties were living.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It is contended that this is no verdict, and, therefore, not provided for by the law. It is true, that verdicts must be certain in themselves, or such as may be made so by reference to that which is certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">It is common for them to refer to records, or to other papers equally certain. On a demurrer to evidence, a conditional verdict, dependent upon the opinion of the Court as to the demurrer, is common and proper. So a verdict, to depend upon the opinion of the Court, on a case stated on the record, is an usual and legal proceeding. Cases agreed, are sometimes substituted in the room of special verdicts. But it is very novel to find both in the same record, and connected together. Even this might have been unexceptionable, if the verdict had referred to a state of facts <em>before agreed to. </em>But to supply the uncertainty of a verdict, by referring to that which, so far from being certain, did not exist for five years afterwards, cannot possibly be right. Suppose the parties had refused to agree a case, or had, in reality, disagreed about the facts; this might well have happened, and what could have been done ? The Court could not coerce them to agree upon a case, nor could any thing be substituted in its room.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">We can find no cases determined in <em>England, </em>upon the Statute of the 8th and 9th <em>Will. </em>3, c. 11, (from which our law was copied,) like the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Upon principle, we have no doubt, but that the administrator was not bound to cure the uncertainty in the verdict by agreeing to a state of facts, of which he might be totally ignorant, because his intestate, having more knowledge of them, had consented to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>That he might, therefore, have abated tbe suit, if he chosen it, is clear. But he certainly might wave this advantage, and prefer a trial upon the merits, This he has done, by agreeing to a state of facts. But, then, the cause must rest upon the agreed case, independent of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Upon the merits, there is not much difficulty. The. condemnation in the Court of Admiralty, could not bind the intestate, who was no party to the suit. If the sentence of a foreign Court of Admiralty had condemned this slave as a prize to the <em>British, </em>we should ha^e regarded it, though <em>Pierce </em>had been no party; because it would not have been in his power to have become a party. \u00a1So, if in this case, <em>Pierce </em>had put in his claim, and it had been decided against him, that decision, whilst unreversed, would have bound this and all other Courts. But the slave in question was libelled and condemned by the name of <em>Jack Robinson, </em>instead of that by vvbHi he was always called; and, therefore, <em>Pierce </em>could not be <em>presumed </em>to have had notice that his interest was inv olved in the suit, so as to enable him to assert his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The first resolution of Congress, which passed on the 25th of <em>November, </em>1775, authorises vessels commissioned by that body to capture and make prizes of all armed vessels belonging to the enemy, employed in the war, and of all transports carrying troops, warlike, or naval stores, or provisions, and directs the distribution of the prizes.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">The next resolution, which passed on the 23d of <em>March, </em>1776, extends the right of capture to ail vessels, and to all goods, wares, and merchandise, <em>belonging to any inhabitant of Great Britain ; </em>but slaves are not mentioned. Whether they should be considered as goods, 8tc. within the meaning of this resolution, or whether they are to be classed with the lands, or ships and cargoes, so as by the rules of <em>postliminium, </em>to require the sentence of a Court of Admiralty to change the property, or whether they are to be considered in the light of moveables, and the property in them changed by capture, without condemnation, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>questions which the Court think unnecessary to consider, since it is not stated that the slave belonged to an <em>inhabitant of Great </em>Britain, so as to bring the case within the resolution of Congress ; neither is it stated that he was taken <em>in war by the </em>enemy, and re-captured, so as to bring it within the exception in the Act of Assembly, passed in 1782. It appears that he was the property of Pierce, and, being such, ran off, and was found on board an enemy\u2019s vessel, where no person claimed a right to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The sale, therefore, in the present instance, could not divest the right of the original proprietor, however inconvenient this doctrine might prove to purchasers, for though equitable rights may, in favor of fair <em>bona fide </em>purchasers, for valuable consideration, and without notice, be lost by a sale, legal rights never can, unless there be fraud; as in the case of a prior mortgagee standing by, whilst another is throwing-away his money by purchasing the mortgaged premises, without giving notice of his prior incumbrance\u2014-in cases of legal righto, the principle of <em>caveat emptor </em>properly applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Judgment affirmed. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\"> <em>Green </em>v. <em>Price, </em>1 Munf. 453. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Stone, 2 </em>Munf. 315. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>4 Munf. 551.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
