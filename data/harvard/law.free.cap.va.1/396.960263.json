These partners were also indebted to <em>Charles Ellis </em>in the sum of 1203 dollars 5 cents, for which he recovered a judgment at the fall term 1835 of the superior court of law and chancery for the county of <em>Nelson, </em>and thereupon sued out execution, on which they were taken and committed to jail, and on the 27th of October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>they took the oath of insolvent debtors on both execu-j t i t lions, and were discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAV\">Previous to this time, <em>Christian Sf Stratton </em>and <em>Charles Christian </em>had jointly rented a tract of land in the county of <em>Nelson </em>of a certain <em>Lafayette Neville </em>for the year 1835, for which they were to give him 300 dollars; and <em>Charles Christian </em>and <em>E.

By this deed, which was signed by <em>Charles Christian, </em>it was provided that they should remain in possession of the property until the bond became due, and take the profits thereof to their own use, and might collect the debts and apply them to the purposes of the trust. This deed was admitted to record on the day of its date, in the clerk\u2019s office of the county court of <em>Nelson.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-9\">On the 22d of August, in the same year, <em>John II.

This deed was also admitted to record on the day of its date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-10\">In November 1835, <em>Lewis Webb Sf Co. </em>filed their bill in the superior court of law and chancery for the county of <em>Nelson </em>against <em>Christian Sf Stratton, Thomas </em>the trustee in the first deed, <em>Charles Christian, </em>and the parties to the second deed, in which they charged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>the deed of the 17th of August was fraudulent; that <em>Christian Sr Stratton </em>were not indebted to <em>Charles </em>Christian, and that the deed was made for the purpose of defrauding their creditors; and admitting the validity of the second deed, they asked that it might be enforced, and that any balance remaining, after satisfying the trusts thereof, might be applied to the satisfaction of their claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ap7\"><em>Thomas </em>the trustee answered, denying any knowledge of a fraudulent purpose by the parties to the first deed, and saying that he had not received any part of the trust fund; and the <em>cestuis que trust </em>in the second deed also answered, stating their claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">In October 1835, and previous to the institution of the suit of <em>Lewis Webb Co., </em>a suit had been instituted in the same court, in which <em>Anderson </em>the high sheriff of the county of <em>Nelson </em>at the time that <em>Christian Sr Stratton </em>took the oath of insolvent debtors, <em>Charles Ellis </em>and <em>Webb Sr Co. </em>were made plaintiffs, and the defendants were the same persons mentioned as defendants in the bill of <em>Webb Sr Co. </em>The charges in the two bills as to the deed of the 17th of August were substantially the same, but in this case, the deed of the 22d of August was also charged to be fraudulent; and the plaintiffs prayed an injunction to prevent the parties to the first deed from collecting or receiving the debts, or disposing of the property thereby conveyed, and that it might be put into possession of the plaintiff <em>Anderson, </em>as the high sheriff, to be sold and applied to the payment of the debts due the plaintiffs <em>Ellis </em>and <em>Webb Sr Co.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">The judge below granted the injunction, and made an order, directing that the property should be put into the possession of the plaintiffs, upon their giving bond, in the penalty of 2000 dollars, to answer to the defendants for any damages they might sustain by reason of the granting the injunction, if the same should be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>solved, unless the trustee Thomas, or <em>Christian &amp;f Stratton, </em>or some one for them, should enter into bond, in the same penalty, to have the property forthcoming to abide the future order of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-4\">All the defendants answered this bill. The answer of <em>Thomas </em>was similar to that filed in the suit of <em>Lewis Webb Sj' Co. Charles Christian </em>answered, saying that the bond for 4000 dollars was given to cover moneys loaned to <em>Christian Sf Stratton, </em>or for which they were jointly responsible to <em>Neville </em>for the rent of the land and articles purchased from him, or for which he was liable as their surety, and that it was agreed at the time the bond was executed, that if the indebtedness of <em>Christian &lt;$f Stratton </em>to him, from all these sources, did not amount to 4000 dollars, they were to have credit on the bond for the balance. <em>Christian Stratton </em>answered to the same effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-5\">The defendants <em>Thomas, </em>and <em>Christian Sf Stratton, </em>having failed to give the security required by the judge\u2019s order, the sheriff of <em>Nelson </em>took possession of all the partnership effects of <em>Christian 6f Stratton </em>which could be found, and of the property on the farm rented by them and <em>Charles Christian. Neville </em>then filed his bill in the same court against the plaintiffs in the former suits, and the parties to the deed of the 17th of August 1835, claiming satisfaction of the rent due him, out of the property taken from his land; and by consent of all the parties, the sheriff made sale of the property in his possession. The amount of the sale of that part taken from the farm was 439 dollars 21 cents, and that of the partnership effects of <em>Christian Stratton </em>amounted to 281 dollars 78 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-6\"><em>Ellis </em>alone answered the bill of <em>Neville. </em>He contested his claim, and insisted that if the plaintiff was to be satisfied his rent out of the proceeds of sale in the hands of the sheriff, the creditors of <em>Christian Stratton </em>should be substituted to his rights on the bond of <em>Charles Christian.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ArR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>The three causes came on together to be heard on the \u00bfay 0p ]y\u00a1;ay 1837, when the name of the plaintiffs <em>Levjis Webb Sf Co. </em>was struck out of the second suit, as having been inserted without authority, and <em>they </em>were made defendants therein. And then the court decided, first, that the deed of the 17th of August 1835, was fraudulent and void; second, that the deed of the 22d of August was <em>bona fide </em>and valid; third, that <em>Ne-ville, </em>the plaintiff in the third suit, was entitled to be hrst satisfied for the amount due to him for the rent of jjjg iand; out of the proceeds of the property taken from thence; fourth, that <em>Ellis </em>and <em>Webb Sf Co. </em>were entitled to be substituted to the rights of <em>Neville </em>against <em>Charles </em>Christian, for <em>the </em>amount of <em>his bond, </em>for <em>which </em>said <em>Neville </em>was decreed satisfaction out of the effects of <em>Christian Sf Stratton </em>found on the demised <em>premises; </em>fifth, that <em>Webb Sf Co. </em>were entitled to priority over Ellis, their <em>ca. sa. </em>being first levied. The court, therefore, decreed, that the plaintiff Anderson, out of the proceeds of sale and collections in his hands, should pay to <em>Neville </em>300 dollars, with interest from the 1st of January 1836, till paid, and his costs; that he should pay to <em>Ellis </em>his costs up to the date of the decree, and that he should pay the residue in his hands to <em>Lewis Webb Sf Co. </em>And the court farther decreed, that <em>Charles Christian </em>should pay to <em>Lewis Webb Sf Co. </em>the sum of 300 dollars, with interest from the 1st day of January 1836, till paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-4\">From this decree, <em>Charles Christian </em>obtained an appeal to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b424-5\"><em>G.

Story on Partnership, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 361, p. 513; 6 Ves. 126; Gow on Partnership, ch. 5, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 2, p. 293.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b425-4\">\n<em>Grattan,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7ko\">for the appellees <em>Webb &amp; Co. Charles Christian, </em>it is admitted, was liable to <em>Neville </em>for the rent due, as one of the tenants. All the property taken by the sheriff, from the demised premises, was conveyed by the deed of the 17th of August 1835, as the property of <em>Christian if Stratton; Charles Christian </em>executed that deed, and thus acknowledged that the property was the property of <em>Christian if Stratton, </em>and he is estopped now from saying that it belonged to the partnership. When, <em>then, Neville </em>was paid his <em>rent </em>out of the proceeds of that property, the debt of <em>Charles Christian </em>was paid out of the property of <em>Christian if Stratton. </em>It is admitted that the court erred in decreeing against him for the whole amount of his bond. The decree should have been for a sum equal to his portion of the debt due to <em>Neville </em>for the rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-5\">The court was right in decreeing the balance of the proceeds of the property to be paid to <em>Webb if Co. </em>Although <em>Charles Christian </em>spoke in his answer of debts of the partnership, there is not a particle of proof in this record, that the partnership owed a dollar, except for the rent to <em>Neville; </em>and, as, according to the deed of August 17th, and <em>Christian's </em>admissions in that deed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the property, of which the proceeds were then, in the hands \u00b0f the sheriff, was the property of <em>Christian Sf Stratton, </em>it was properly applied to the payment of their debts.

Christian </em>and <em>E. P. Stratton </em>in partnership, were liable, in the first place, for the stipulated rent of 300 dollars, and the surplus of such proceeds to the claims of the creditors of the partnership in the tenancy, including any one of the partners who might be creditor by over advancements, or otherwise, before they could be charged by the creditors of <em>Christian Sf Stratton, </em>and that the payment of that rent, out of the proceeds of said furniture, crops and stocks, was properly decreed; but that the court erroneously decreed the surplus of those proceeds to the creditors of <em>Christian Sf Stratton, </em>in disregard of the rights of the creditors of the partnership in the said tenancy, and still more erroneously considered the creditors of <em>Christian Sf Stratton </em>entitled, by substitution, to charge the appellant on his bond to <em>Neville </em>for the rent, and subjected him to a decree in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>favour of the creditors of <em>Christian Sf Stratton, </em>for an amount equal to the rent paid out of the tenants\u2019 effects on the demised tenement, and decreed costs to <em>Ellis, </em>by whom the claim of substitution had been made.</p>\n<p id=\"AXJt\">The court doth, therefore, adjudge, order and decree Tiat so much of the decree as is herein declared to he erroneous, be reversed and annulled, and that the appellees <em>Webb Co. </em>and <em>Ellis </em>pay to the appellant the costs expended in the prosecution of his appeal in this court, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings, in conformity with the foregoing opinion and decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
