The defendant promised to make the lease, and for many years received rents from <em>S. </em>and then turned him out of possession. <em>S. </em>then sued <em>M- </em>upon his bond, and recovered damages; and on a suit by <em>JD. </em>against the plaintiff, the same damages were recovered from the plain<em>tiff'; </em>that pending the above suit, the defendant promised <em>JD. </em>to indemnify him and the plaintiff' against the suit of <em>S. </em>The consideration stated in this declaration is sufficient to maintain the action against the defendant for breach of his promise to indemnify.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b382-11\"><em>D. </em>was a competent witness for the plaintiff in the above action, as he was indemnified by his recovery against the plaintiff; and the promise of the defendant to indemnify, though made to <em>JD., </em>was intended for the plaintiff, it being made in answer to a letter from the plaintiff' on the subject of saving him harmless.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-12\">This was an action on the case brought by the appellant against the appellee in the County Court. The declaration contained two counts: the first a <em>special one, </em>stating that the plaintiff\u2019s testator was authorised by the defendant\u2019s father to lease out certain lands, of which he was seised in tail. That he made a lease, to one <em>Dillon, </em>of a parcel of the said land for three lives; that <em>Dillon </em>assigned the same to Sisson, and that <em>Field </em>and <em>Dillon </em>gave their bonds to <em>Sisson, </em>with condition to procure for him a lease from the defendant, (on whom the estate tail had, by that time, descended,) on the usual terms of his former leases, and that the defendant promised the said <em>Sisson </em>to make him a lease. That the defendant for many years received rents from <em>Sisson, </em>and then turned him out of possession $ that <em>Sisson </em>sued <em>Dillon </em>upon the bond, and recovered damages, and that <em>Dillon </em>after-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>wards, upon motion, recovered over against <em>Field; </em>that, whilst the suit was depending, the defendant, in consideration of the premises, promised <em>Field </em>to save the said <em>Dillon, </em>and the said <em>Field, </em>harmless, on account of the said bond and suit aforesaid, and of their engagements to <em>Sisson, </em>The breach assigned is, that the defendant has failed to indemnify, Sec. The second count was for money laid out and advanced for the defendant\u2019s use. Verdict for the plaintiff. An exception was taken to the evidence of Dillon, who proved, that he carried a letter from <em>Field </em>to the defendant upon the subject of his indemnifying the said <em>Field, </em>and that, immediately after reading the letter, the defendant promised that <em>Field </em>should not suffer on account of his contract for the said lease, &amp;c. The judgment of the County Court was reversed in the District Court of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>from which this appeal was prayed,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-3\"><em>Williams, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-4\">It is unnecessary to inquire, whether the first count be sustainable or not, although I have no doubt that it is. The second count is certainly a good one, upon which the plaintiff below might well recover. The only question, then, will be, whether the inferior Court did right in admitting the evidence stated in the bill of exceptions ? The witness was certainly disinterested, and his testimony was properly left to the jury, who were the only judges of the weight to be given to it. They were satisfied that it supported the claim of the plaintiff, and found for him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-5\"><em>Washington, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b383-6\">The first count certainly cannot be sustained, because the consideration stated, being altogether past, it was not sufficient to support a valid promise. The undertaking of <em>Field, </em>either as it respected the lease, or his bond to <em>Sisson, </em>was not induced by the request, knowledge, or permission, of the defendant. Both had been given, before <em>Spotswood </em>was consulted upon the subject. The responsibility which <em>Field </em>drew upon himself, was the result of his own conduct, unauthorised by the defendant, and no new motive ap-</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>pearing to induce the undertaking of the defendant, is clearly a <em>nudum pactum. </em>The acceptance of rent by the defendant might possibly have amounted to a confirmation of the lease, and might have subjected the defendant to the action of <em>Sisson </em>for ousting him from the possession. But the present is a different action, brought by a different person, and for a different cause. If the first count be without consideration, the second cannot be supported, because the money paid by <em>Field </em>could not be for the defendant\u2019s use, and the whole case appears in the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b384-6\">As to the exception, my objection is, that the promise being made to <em>Dillon, </em>and not to <em>Field, </em>the latter could not bring this suit, and avail himself of that promise. 1 <em>Esp. </em>105.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b384-7\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A_C\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The bill of exceptions furnishes no ground for reversing the judgment of the County Court. <em>Dillon </em>was a disinterested witness, he having been indemnified by his recovery against <em>Field, </em>and the promise, though made to him, was intended for <em>Field, </em>it being given in answer to the letter of <em>Field </em>upon the subject of saving him harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">As to the want of consideration in the first count, which has been relied upon at the bar, the Court is of opinion that there is nothing in the objection. A tenant in tail might, at that time, have made leases for three lives, under certain restrictions prescribed by the Act of Assembly ; but if he could not, yet surely he might promise to make a lease, and might be compelled to pay damages for breach of such a promise. In this case, it is evident that he did make such a promise, and received rent in consequence of it, which was a sufficient consideration to uphold the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">The judgment of the District Court must be reversed, and that of the County Court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
