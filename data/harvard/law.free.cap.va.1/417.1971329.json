A verdict was rendered against <em>Johnson </em>for 15/., and the defendant <em>Boswell </em>was found <em>not guilty. </em>Upon the motion of <em>Johnson alone, </em>a new trial was awarded, and a verdict was afterwards found for 60/. against both defendants. A motion in arrest of judgment being made by <em>Boswell, </em>and over ruled, both defendants applied for, and obtained a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment of the Court, rendered upon the last verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b437-9\">The plaintiffs in error, beine: both dead, it was sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>mitted to the Court, whether a new supersedeas, or writ error, should be awarded; or whether a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the former ought to issue; and, in the latter caae? whether it should be revived in the names of the executors of both plaintiffs, or of the survivor only. The Court being of opinion, that a <em>scire facias </em>should issue in the names of the executors of both the plaintiffs, the counsel for the defendant consented to revive without a <em>scire facias </em>actually issuing, and now the cause came on to be argued, upon the objections to the judgment of the District Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-6\"><em>Washington, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-7\">Insisted, that where one defendant is acquitted by the verdict, the Court cannot grant a new trial upon the motion of the other defendant, and referred to the following authorities, 2 <em>Str. </em>813. 12 <em>Mod. </em>275. 2 <em>W Black. Rep. </em>1030. 3 <em>Salk. </em>362.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-8\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-9\">The rule contended for, considered as a general one, cannot upon principle be sound. It is possible, that the jury may erroneously find a verdict against the wrong defendant. They may, in writing their verdict, by mistake, .convict the defendant, whom they intended to acquit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-10\">In such a case, it would neither be just nor reasonable, that the Court should not have a power of setting aside' the verdict. And if there be <em>a possible </em>case, where it would be proper to set aside such a verdict, it is enough for my purpose, because this Court presuming, as they ought, every thing in favor of the judgment of the Inferior Court, will not reverse that judgment, unless the record exhibit such a case, as to authorise them in saying, that the Inferior Court decided erroneously. If the Inferior Court might, or might not award a new trial, according to the circumstances of the case, the party attempting to impeach their decision in granting it, ought to have spread upon the record those circumstances, which might satisfy this Court, that this was a case in which the verdict ought not to have been set aside.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxP8\">As to the authorities which have been cited, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>would premise my observations upon them with this remark: That upon no subject have the varied so materially, as upon that of new trials. It is considered as a part of practice, and to be controuled by the Court in such a manner, as best to answer the ends of substantial justice ; and if the <em>English </em>Courts have considerably changed the doctrine of new trials, so as to render it more perfect, and more consistent with the real principles of justice, why may not this Court exercise the same power over the subject, if they are satisfied, that the rule now contended ft r '\u2022&lt; unreasonable ? The cases from <em>Strange </em>and <em>Blackstone </em>are merely <em>obiter </em>opinions. 3 <em>Salkelcl </em>is not authority \u25a0\u2014in the case from 12 <em>Modern </em>the Court say, they cannot grant a new trial <em>except against all, </em>which rather proves, that they might grant it against all, if the justice of the case required it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AWu\"><em>Washington, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akf\">It is to be observed, that the motion for a new trial in this case was not made by the plaintiff, but by one of the defendants. If this were permitted, the acquitted defendant being out of Court, it would be in the power of the other, without any authority, to put the successful defendant into jeopardy again, by stating a hardship as to himself, when the other defendant might not be present, nor have it in his power to shew that the verdict as to him was proper. I hold it to be sound law, that the Court cannot set aside a verdict but upon motion, and this motion was not made by the plaintiff, nor by <em>Boswell, </em>but by <em>Johnson, </em>who had no more authority to make it for <em>Boswell, </em>than a stranger would have had ; and surely it would have been as much an error to set aside the verdict upon the motion of a stranger, having no authority, as if the Court had done it without any motion at all. So that the authorities cited, which stand uncontradicted, are fortified by the strongest reason. But if they were not, I trust that law is bottomed upon more solid and certain gounds, than the mere opinion of the Judge upon what is right, or wrong; reasonable or otherwise; and known only when that opinion is pronounced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b440-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>If the rule, which is so firmly settled by the authorities before referred to, can be varied or destroyed, according to the opinions of different Judges who may decide upon it; with equal propriety may they unsettle every other rule of law, which does not meet their approbation\u2014a position big with mischief! The principle decided in the case from <em>Salkeld </em>though not directly determined in <em>Strange </em>and <em>Blackstone </em>is fully recognized, and admitted to be well founded.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ARI\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"Avt0\">The cases cited prove, that in trespass against two defendants, if one be found guilty, and the other be acquitted, a new trial cannot be granted on the motion of the convicted defendant; and a majority of the Court are of opinion, that the rule is not without reason, since the plaintiff being satisfied, it ought not to be in the power of the convicted defendant to bring his co-defendant into jeopardy again, by obtaining a new trial. Upon authority the rule is fixed. One Judge doubted as to the reason of it, since the ground of new trials being to attain real justice, if the Court perceive that injustice has been done in the acquittal of one defendant, upon principle it would seem right to grant a new trial, from whomsoever the motion might come. And as to authority, the same Judge is of opinion, that though uniform decisions, which establish the rules of property, ought to be adhered to, yet he does not view them as sacred in points of practice, which may be varied, as experience shall evince their convenience or inconvenience. But the Court are unanimously of opinion, that though in general the subordinate Courts need not state the facts on which they ground their opinion for a new trial, yet, in this case, where they granted it against an established rule of practice, they ought to have disclosed the circumstances which induced them to depart from that rule. We are also of opinion, that the District Court erred in awarding a new trial, without payment of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The judgment, and all proceedings from the granting of the new trial inclusive, is to be reversed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>costs. Judgment to be entered against <em>Johnson </em>for the damages assessed by the first verdict and costs, and to be entered for <em>Boswell </em>for his costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
