The bill sets forth, that a certain John Johnson, about fifteen or twenty years ago, was seised and possessed of a tract of land in the county of Goochland: that he died and directed by his will all Ms lands to be sold and the money to be divided amongst his children and appointed John Guerrant junr. and William Webster his executors : that the said executors so d the land, in pursuance of the directions of the testator, and Gideon Hatcher became the purchaser, and gave a bond for the purchase money, with Thomas Hatcher as Ms surety : that no conveyance was ever made by the vendors of the said land ; so that a lien is still retained by the representatives of the said Johnson, and the purchase money was never paid by Gideon Hatcher in his lifetime, nor by his representatives since his decease : that the estate of Gideon Hatcher is totally inadequate to the payment of the purchase money aforesaid 5 and they fear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>^ie es^e \u00b0f their testator will be compelled to satisfy the without the.interposition of the court of chancery.

That it was in general true, that where a vendor retains the legal title, hf has a lien upon the land sold. But, this lien may be waived by various acts, indicating the intention of the parties, that it should no longer exist. Taking bond and security is strong evidence that the vendor did not rely upon his lien j and when a great length of time is suffered to elapse, without the assertion of a title on the part of the vendor, coupled with uninterrupted possession by the vendor, there is no room to doubt that the vendor has waived his lien. In this case, all these circumstances are found. More than twenty years have elapsed since the sale was made to Gideon Hatcher. He has been in possession from that time until the sale under the commonwealth\u2019s execution, when we first hear of a claim by the executors of Johnson. During all this period, he was suffered to remain the ostensible proprietor of the land and to obtain a credit with the world, on that supposition. By analogy to the case of mortgages, the equity of redemption would be barred by twenty years without any attempt to foreclose.<footnotemark>(<em>a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If an <em>actual </em>mortgagee standing by, loses his right, how much stronger is this case, where Johnson had only an <em>equitable </em>mortgage? 2. The commonwealth ought to be made a party. She is a creditor, and ought not to lose her rights by the conduct of the executors of the appellee, in suffering an oflice judgment to go against them, without defence. 3. The decree ought not to have given relief beyond the penalty of the bonds. 4, There is no proof that the bonds were executed for the purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b68-5\">On the part of the appellees, it was said that a surety stands in the place of the creditor, when he has paid money for his principal <em>\u2019,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and by a well known rule of equity, he may guard himself against a future mischief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>by throwing the burthen at once on that fund where it must ultimately fall, ff the executors of Johnson had a claim upon the land, and if the executors of T. Hatcher would have had the same lien upon paying the purchase money, a court of equity will subject the land in the first instance, and thus prevent a circuity of action. As to the lapse of time affording a presumption that the lien was abandoned, this presumption may be rebutted by circumstances ; and the partial payments by Gideon Hatcher, from time to time, are amply sufficient to produce this effect. JSTo evil has resulted to Gideon Hatcher by the appellees suffering judgments by default; since they had not paid the money, and judgments must inevitably have been obtained, if they had defended the suit. The executors of Johnson asserted their claim as soon as it could be done, by forbidding the sale tinder the commonwealth\u2019s execution. There was no necessity for making the commonwealth a party, as there is no evidence of her claim, except the assertion of the appellant, which, being new matter, requires other proof. The claim of the appellees being prior in point of time to that of the commonwealth, ought to be first satisfied; and then, if any surplus should remain, the commonwealth \u00a1nay obtain satisfaction, according to the title which she may establish.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b69-4\">Judgments have been already obtained against the appellees, and the, appellants ought unquestionably to in- ' demnify their innocent sureties, although those judgments may exceed the penalty of the bonds.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b69-5\"><em>Upshur, </em>replied.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>\u0430) </em>2 Bro.
