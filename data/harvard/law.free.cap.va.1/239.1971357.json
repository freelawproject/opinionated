The object of the bill is to recover a compensation for certain lands devised to the plaintiff by his father, <em>William Eustace, </em>and afterwards recovered from him at law by some person having a better title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">This claim is founded upon a clause In the will of the said <em>William Eustace, </em>the father, by which he desires, that in case the land given to his son <em>William </em>should be recovered from him, his son <em>John, </em>(the testator of the defendants, to whom he devised the principal part of his estate,) should purchase it for his said son William\u00bb In 1742, the recovery was obtained^ and the testator of the defendants died in 1785\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-8\">This suit was instituted in 1788, and the bill accounts for the delay in bringing the suit, by charging that the testator of the defendant amused the plaintiff until his death with promises of providing for him by his will. Some proof of such a promise, as well as an acknowledgment by <em>John Eustace </em>of the plaintifPs forbearance, appear in the record. The defendant, in his answer, principally relies upon the length of time. Exceptions were taken and filed by the defendant, on account of the Gourds refusing to receive the answer of Mrs. <em>Eustace, </em>who is stated in the exceptions to have qualified as executrix <em>o\u00ed John Eus</em>tace, since the institution of this suit</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The County Court directed the value of the land in 1742, and the back rents, to be ascertained by Commissioners, and decreed the amount thereof to the plaintiff, the present appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-8\">This decree was reversed in the High Court of Chancery, and an appeal was taken from thence to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-9\">Washington, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-10\">The first objection which occurs to the decree of the County Court is, that there is not such testimony in the cause, as could warrant a recovery upon any principle. The will of <em>William Eustace, </em>the elder, is not made an exhibit, nor admitted by the defendants in their answer ; neither is there any other evidence of the recovery stated in the bill, but a judgment in ejectment against <em>John </em>Eustace, an infant, of <em>some </em>land; but whether of <em>that </em>devised by the will of William, the father, does not appear.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-11\">But I rely principally upon the length of time which-has elapsed since the recovery stated in the bill. Substantial . justice and wise policy demand that, in all cases, whether legal or equitable, there should be a period beyond which no such claim should be litigated. Such a length of time as creates a presumption of payment, or of satisfaction made, is considered as much an equitable bar in this Court as if it came within any positive act of limitation. In the case of <em>Standish </em>v. Radley, 2 <em>Atk. </em>177, where portions, which became due in 1673, were sued for in 1717, Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>determined that such a lapse of time, creates a strong presumption that they had been paid, and amounts almost to the proving of a negative to induce the Court to believe them still unpaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-12\">So, in the case of <em>Smallman </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>2 <em>Atk. </em>71, an annuity devised by will, was considered as being barred by length of time, on the presumption, though forborne to be sued for ten years only. See also, <em>3 Atk. </em>105. 226. 1 <em>Harr. </em>Cha. Prac. <em>375.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-13\">Marshall, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b260-14\">I admit that length of time, which induces a presumption that the claim has been satisfied, will ere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>y\u00edu an equitable bar. But this presumption may be repelled by testimony accounting for the delay, and, in this case, there is a sufficient reason assigned and proved for the appellant\u2019s not asserting his right at an earlier day. it appears that the testator of the appellee had been long married, without having'children-\u2014 that lie acknowledged his brothers lenity, in not coercing satisfaction of his claim, and promised to make him an ample provision at his death.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-4\">There is no room, then, to let in a presumption of payment, upon which alone this equitable bar can be net up.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b261-7\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AOZ\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The Judge who pronounced the decree of reversal in this case, seems to have considered no other question but the presumption against the demand, on account of its antiquity. It is undoubtedly true in general, that a right, for a length of time unasserted, is subject to a presumption of its having been satisfied sufficiently strong to defeat it. But it is equally true, that this presumption may be opposed by circumstances accounting for the forbearance. In this case, we think a sufficient reason for the delay is assigned and satisfactorily proved. The decree of the Chancellor is, therefore, erroneous, and must be reversed. As to that of the County Court, we have felt some difficulty 3o deciding what ought to be done with it; it cannot be .sustained upon any principle. The will not having been made an exhibit in the cause, and the only evidence of a recovery of the land in question, being a judgment of the General Court against <em>John Eustace </em>for <em>some </em>land, (but <em>xvhat </em>land does not appear,) the decree was certainly made without sufficient testimony to warrant it. In the next place, Mrs. <em>Eustace </em>ought to have been made a party, so soon as it was known that she had qualified as executrix to her husband <em>John </em>Eustace. Her answer might have disclos'd something important of her own knowledge. The Court ought to Iiavo directed an <em>issue., </em>to try whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>any, and what part of the plaintiffs land, had been recovered, as well as the value and profits thereof, which being in the nature of damages, ought to be ascertained by a jury, and not by commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">The decree of that Court, therefore, must also be reversed, as well as the proceedings subsequent to the answer. The plaintiff to have leave to amend his bill, so as to make Mrs. <em>Eustace </em>a party defendant, and the cause to be sent back to the County Court, to be there proceeded in.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b262-13\"> <em>Cooke v. </em>Wise, 3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 495. <em>Roberts's widow et al. </em>v. <em>Stunton, </em>2 Munf. 138.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
