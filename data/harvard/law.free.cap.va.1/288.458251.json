That is a good limitation by way of contingency with a double aspect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b303-13\">The first difficulty to be encountered in supporting this construction is, that life estates are not <em>expressly </em>given. But this circumstance is immaterial, if it is manifest that the issue were intended to take as purchasers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>As estates <em>expressly </em>given for life, shall be <em>enlarged </em>to estates of inheritance, when it is necessary to effectuate a <em>general intention </em>in favor of the issue, which would otherwise be defeated <em>; </em>so estates in the first instance indefinitely limited, or limited in terms importing estates of inheritance, shall be <em>reduced </em>to life estates, when it is manifest from the subsequent words, that the testator intended the issue to take as purchasers. In <em>Low </em>vs. <em>Davis,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Doe </em>vs. <em>Lamming,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> estates tail </em>were expressly given in the first instance $ but the subsequent words plainly shewing that the issue were intended <em>to </em>take as purchasers, they were held to be only life estates. Nothing can be more manifest than that the testator, in this case, intended his son <em>Custis, </em>and his other children, to take <em>life estates </em>only, in the land allotted to them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5d\">1. There is a restriction upon the power of alienation, applying in terms to <em>his children </em>only, and not to their <em>issue, </em>indicating that the children were to take limited estates, but that estates of inheritance were to commence in their issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-6\">It may perhaps be said, although it is inconsistent with a <em>fee simple </em>estate in the children, it is perfectly consistent with an <em>estate tail. </em>But this is not a just inference; for in that case, it should have extended to the issue, which it does not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-7\">2. The issue were plainly intended to take in remainder, and not through the parent. The limitation is to Custis <em>or </em>his lawful issue living. For, although in the first part of the will, it is to Custis <em>and </em>his lawful issue living, yet the testator has, in <em>that </em>clause, referred to a subsequent one, as more fully explaining his intention, in which the limitation is as stated above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-8\">The word <em>or is </em>used <em>disjunctively, </em>making not one, but successive limitations of the same estate, and plainly shewing that the issue were intended to take <em>after, </em>and not <em>through, </em>the parent. And if so, the reasoning in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>Wilde\u2019s case,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>applies with force. In this respect, this case differs from the <em>University of Oxford </em>vs. <em>Clayton,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which Lord Northington determined, that by a devise to A, and the issue of his body living at the time of his death, and for want of such issue to B, A took an <em>estate tail, </em>because it appeared from the will, that the issue were intended to take by descent, and not in remainder. In addition to which it may be remarked, that w ords of limitation were wanting, which are not necessary here, and that the decision has met with the disapprobation of the profession, <footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-4\">3, The limitation in this case is not to issue <em>indfinilely, </em>but to issue <em>living at the time of the </em>death, which qualification shews, that the testator used the term <em>issue </em>as a special <em>designatio personae. </em>That issue <em>living at the death, </em>is what the testator meant by the term <em>issue living, </em>is manifest, because he has so expressed it in the principal clause; and although there is much perplexity in the clause, it is impossible to give any other sensible construction to his words. If he did not mean <em>issue living at the death, </em>and did not mean to take in the issue <em>indefinitely, </em>(which is manifest,) then, living when ? or how long ? No answ'er can be given but the first; <em>living at the death.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-5\">4. The limitation over is amongst the <em>survivors </em>of his children; which circumstance is conclusive, that he did not intend an indefinite failure of issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-6\">If the foregoing views be correct, the limitation to <em>Custis, </em>however it may have been expressed, is equivalent to an estate to him for life; remainder to his issue living at the time of his death <em>; </em>if none, such remainder to the survivors of the children of the testator. If so, the case of <em>Warner </em>vs. <em>Mason,</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is an express authority. If is, in fact, less strong than this case. There wras some ground for contending in that case, that the limitation, by way of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>con^nSen^ remainder, was too remote, and that the life estate must fall before the remainder could vest. Not so here; for the limitation over in this case, being upon a failure of issue living at the death, must take effect <em>eo instanti </em>that the life estate determines.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-4\">There are two other clauses in this will, which it may be necessary to notice. The first is, that in which, when providing for a forfeiture by alienation, he directs the forfeited parts to be divided amongst his surviving children, if they should be living, or to their lawful issue, in case of such parent\u2019s death, and so on to their lawful issue, so long as there is a child or grand-child to represent him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\">. It may be said, that this clause affords an evidence of his intention to prevent the estate from being alienable, so long as there was a child or grand-child to represent him, and if so, to give an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">But this is not the just construction. He intended merely to provide, that in the event of a forfeiture by any of his <em>children, </em>to whom alone the restriction is extended ; that the issue of a deceased child should, in the division of that part, represent the parent; not that a grand-child should not have the powrer of alienation as to that part of his estate, which had devolved upon him, after the death of his parent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-7\">The other clause is, that in which he limits the estate to his wife, where all his children and <em>their issue </em>may become <em>extinct; </em>and it is the only one which affords any evidence of his intention to give an estate tail to his children, and cannot be permitted to outweigh the indications of a contrary intention, afforded by every other part of the will. The court will rather construe it to mean, a limitation to the wife, upon the failure of <em>such </em>issue, as is intended by the preceding clause, the precedents for which construction are numerous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-8\">Besides, cross-remainders had before been <em>expressly </em>limited amongst his children, and the court, in such case, will never <em>imply </em>them, which it must do, if this clause is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>held to enlarge the estates of the children to estates <em>tail.</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b307-4\"><em>Wickham, R. Taylor, </em>and <em>Upshur, </em>for the <em>appellee.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-5\">A preliminary objection was made by the appellee\u2019s counsel, that the plaintiffs in ejectment had misconceived their action, as tiiey had not a right of entry. The necessity of such a right is an undisputed principlej and, if questioned, can easily be established by a multitude of authorities. The right of entry was <em>tolled </em>in this case, by the death of William Eyre, and the transmission of the estate by devise, to Littleton Eyre, the present defendant. It may be objected that the right of the appellants did not accrue until the death of Custis Kendall. To this it maybe answered, that if Custis Kendall w&gt;uld have been barred, the appellants, who are remainder-men, must be equally barred. The appellants are reduced to this dilemma. If the estate of Custis Kendall was a fee-tail, (as vve say,) the right of the appellants is barred, both by the descent cast, and by the statute converting it into a fee-simple. If, as the appellants contend, the estate of Custis was a <em>life-estate, </em>then the condition against alienation was good, the estate became forfeited by the conveyance in 1797, the right of action vested in them at <em>that </em>time, and the right of entry is <em>tolled, </em>as well by the length of time, as by the descent cast. So that, <em>quacunque via, </em>the appellants could not maintain an ejectment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b307-6\">Upon the merits. It is evident, from a minute scrutiny of every part of this will, that the testator intended to create an estate, which the law would not permit. He designed, to annex conditions, which should attend <em>the </em>estate indefinitely, and for this purpose has used words, which, according to long established principles, can only create an estate tail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>That <em>Custis Kendall </em>look an estate tail, results from the devise to him and <em>his lawful issue living. </em>If the word <em>living </em>be omitted, there could be no doubt on the subject. What effect then has the addition of that word ? <em>Living </em>has relation to a particular <em>state </em>or condition, and not to any particular <em>time. </em>It is merely the antithesis to <em>dead. </em>But suppose it relates to-a particular <em>time. </em>To what time ? The date of the will ? Surely not; for <em>Custis Kendall </em>had never been married. Did it relate to the death of <em>Custis Kendall ? </em>This construction is disproved by the subsequent clause, which, the testator himself says, is explanatory of all the rest, \u201c <em>or where any of my children </em>\u201c <em>die without lawjul issue living, or die without leaving \u201c such issue at the time of their death, in either case,\u2019\u2019 </em>&amp;c. In this clause, he provides both for the event of his children dying without issue living <em>at the time of their death, </em>and for the event of their dying without issue, <em>indefinitely. </em>Did it refer to the death of the <em>testator ? </em>The clause last quoted is equally fatal to this supposition, as one member of it speaks explicitly of his children dying without leaving issue, at the time of <em>their </em>death. If they are purchasers, (as the appellant contends,) and the devise applies to the death of the <em>testator, Custis </em>and his children would take as <em>tenants in common ; </em>which would be as little conformable to the wishes of the appellant, as to the evident intention of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-9\">The only remaining supposition is, that the testator intended an <em>indefinite failure of issue.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b308-10\">Again. The devise to his wife, after all his children <em>and their issue </em>may become extinct, affords another proof that the testator meant an <em>indefinite failure </em>of issue. For, if his children should die, leaving issue, and that issue should die, living the wife, it can hardly be supposed that he intended to deprive his wife of the enjoyment of the estate. In such an event, the testator would have produced a partial <em>intestacy, </em>which he certainly did not intend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>The restriction on alienation is a further proof that the * testator intended to give an estate which would be <em>alienaMe, </em>without that restriction. Otherwise, the restriction was wholly nugatory.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-7\">An executory devise cannot be attached to an estate-tail. <footnotemark>(h<em>)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The case of <em>Porter </em>vs. <em>Bradly,</em><footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>does not militate against this doctrine, as that was in fact a fee-simple converted into a fee-tail by <em>implication, </em>and the court merely decide that the implication should not be raised, because if would defeat the remainder j and considering the limitation over as a contingent remainder, it cannot take effect under the authority of <em>Carter </em>vs. <em>Tyler.</em><footnotemark><em>(j)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Warner </em>vs. <em>Mason,</em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there was an <em>express life-estate, </em>and other circumstances going to shew the intention of the testator to restrain the limitation over within the proper limits. On the other hand, the case of <em>Sydnor </em>vs. <em>Sydnors,</em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is a strong authority in our favour. <em>Custis Kendall, </em>therefore, took an estate-tail, which was converted by the statute into a fee-simple.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b309-8\"><em>Leigh, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-9\">1. As to the objection to the <em>remedy </em>by ejectment. I admit that a right of entry is essential to an ejectment, and that the action cannot he maintained, if that right is taken away by any means whatever. It is said that this effect was produced, by the conveyance of <em>Custis Kendall </em>to <em>William, Eyre, </em>in the year 1797. But the act of assemb1ly <footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is decisive on this subject; which declares that no conveyance shall operate to pass more than the estate of the grantor. <em>Eyre, </em>therefore, only took an estate for the life of the grantor <em>C. Kendall.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b309-10\">Such being the nature and quantity of estate held by Eyre, did he die so seised, and was such descent cast as <em>tolled </em>the entry of the remainder-man ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>We have the authority of <em>Coke Littleton,</em><footnotemark><em>(n)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for saying, no descent tolls an entry, unless the ancestor dies seised of a <em>fee-simple, </em>or <em>fee-tail </em>and <em>freehold.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2F\">But in truth, there was no descern\u00ed in this case. The appellee was in by <em>devise, </em>which was the act of the party. The reason why a descent tolls an <em>entry </em>is, that the heir is in by act of law.<footnotemark>(<em>o)</em></footnotemark><em> Eyre, </em>therefore, was neither the <em>disseizor </em>of the tenant for life, or of the remainder-man. Not of the tenant for <em>life; </em>for he was in by his conveyance. Not of the remainder-man; because, by force of the act of assembly, he took no estate which interfered with his rights. Nor was <em>Littleton Eyre a disseizor. </em>He only took what his testator had to give, viz : the estate <em>pur autre vie. </em>But that neither made him a <em>disseizor, intruder </em>or <em>deforceor; but </em>only a <em>tenant at sufferance, </em><footnotemark><em>(p)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At the time of the supposed descent cast, the right of entry had not accrued ; for <em>William Eyre </em>died in 1808, and <em>Custis Kendall, </em>in 1809. The right of entry, therefore, could not be <em>tolled. </em>An executory devise is not affected even by fine and recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-5\">2. As to the merits. The limitation <em>under which the </em>appellants claim, is either in its nature an <em>executory devise, </em>limited on a previous fee, given to <em>Custis Kendall; </em>or a <em>contingent remainder </em>to the appellants, limited on a life-estate devised to <em>C. Kendall.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b310-6\">The frequent reference in the will to the explanatory clause, imperiously directs us to look there for the testator\u2019s true intent and meaning. The words~\u201c <em>as now more particularly </em>expressed,\u201d do not refer exclusively to the restriction on alienation, but to the previous limitations. The expression \u201c shall be held and possessed by \u201c each of my children <em>respectively, or their lawful issue \u201c living, </em>&amp;c.\u201d is applicable to all the preceding limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>lions, and is a provision for the event of any of the devisees dying in the testator\u2019s life, leaving issue, to prevent the estate from <em>lapsing. </em>The effect of this construction will be, not to make the issue take by succession from their parents, nor as purchasers of the remainder after them $ but by substitution in <em>place of </em>them. The limitation to the children <em>or their issue living, </em>gives a fee-simple to the children, if they survive the <em>testator; </em>and if they die before him, <em>leaving issue, </em>it gives the same estate to the issue living.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-4\">If <em>C. Kendall </em>took a fee-simple, the limitation over is clearly good as an executory devise. This construction obviates the argument drawn from the prohibition of alienation, and is perfectly reconcilable with the argument that the prohibition is confined only to the <em>children. </em>If the issue took, they were to have a <em>fee; </em>if the remainder-men took, it was inteuded to restrain their alienation also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-5\">If this construction is wrong, that of Mr. <em>Hay </em>is right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b311-6\">Upon these constructions, the testator will die <em>testate </em>as to all his estate. Every event will be as well provided for, as if <em>C. Kendall </em>took an estate tail. It will be good as a contingent remainder limited on <em>C. Kendall\u2019s </em>life estate <em>; </em>or it will be equally good as an executory devise, if the remainder is so limited, that in the nature of things it could not vest, at the termination of the particular estate.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\"><em> </em>2Ld.
