No <em>colloquium </em>is laid. Plea not guilty. At the trial the defendant offered a demurrer to the evidence, stating the testimony given at the trial on the part of the plaintiff, which was objected to by the plaintiff, because the defendant had given evidence on his part, though he admitted, that that testimony was only offered in mitigation of damages : what that evidence was does not appear. The Court refused to receive the demurrer after the defendant had introduced testimony on his side, to which opinion the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b209-3\">Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-4\"><em>Campbell </em>and <em>Wickham </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-5\">As to the point relied upon in the exceptions, it must be given up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">The question will then be, whether the words laid in the declaration be actionable or not? Some words are actionable in themselves, if spoken of <em>any person </em>\u2014as to charge him with the commission of such a crime as might endanger his life, &amp;.C.: others are actionable only when spoken of a person whose <em>office </em>or <em>profession </em>distinguishes him from others; with respect to such persons, some words are actionable without any averment, or explanation whatever: as to call a merchant a bankrupt:\u2014others are not of themselves actionable, unless spoken of the person in his <em>official </em>or <em>professional </em>character, any more than they would have ueen if spoken of a person not bearing that character. In cases of this sort, therefore, the words ought to be made to apply to the person in <em>that particular </em>character, by laying a <em>colloquium. </em>2 <em>Esp. 235. </em>The words, as laid in this declaration, do not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>impute any crime or improper conduct to the defen , dant: besides, they are too general, 2 <em>Esp. </em>25:2.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b210-8\">The President.</author>\n<p id=\"Amh\">Although the appellant\u2019s coun sel, in their argument of this cause, abandoned the exception taken to the opinion of the Court, refusing to receive the demurrer to evidence, yet we have considered it, thinking it important to the practice, and necessary to be settled. We have been able to derive but little aid upon this subject from the <em>English </em>books, and have therefore taken it up on principle. To permit a party to go fully into the trial, and after demurring to the evidence, take his chance with the jury, and failing there, to try the Court, would be highly improper, and repugnant to the spirit of the law, which prevents a plaintiff from suffering a nonsuit after the jury have retired. On the other hand, it would be equally improper to preclude him from the demurrer, because he had examined witnesses. We think the proper rule is, to allow a demurrer to evidence at any time before the jury retire, although the party demurring may have examined witnesses on his part, (the whole evid\u00e9nce on both sides being stated, which in all cases ought to be done,) unless the Court think the case clear against the party; and then the books agree, that the Court may refuse to receive the demurrer. In this case the opinion of the Court as to this point was right, first, because the whole evidence was not stated; and secondly, because we think the case was clearly against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">To consider the main question relied upon in this Court, upon principle. The law has liberally provided remedies for every person injured in his person, property, or reputation. The plaintiff in this case complains of a wrong done to his character. The jury think his complaint well founded, and that he has sustained damage thereby to a certain amount. Yet the Court is applied to, to set aside the verdict, by declaring that the words charged in the declaration are not actionable. If a man be injured in his property to the value of five shillings, he may recover reparation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>therefor; and yet, if the injury, though an hundred times more grievous, be offered to his reputation, is said he is without redress by the principles of lav/, though the fact be established by a jury. If the books be consulted, it will be found, that in ancient times, the Judges to discourage actions of slander, were very rigid indeed in their decisions, from whence arose the doctrine (long since exploded) that words should be taken in <em>mitiori sensu. </em>Discovering afterwards, that slanders were by this means encouraged, a more rational and just principle was introduced, viz. \u201c That words should be understood in the sense they were understood by the bvestanders.\u201d In the case of <em>How </em>v. <em>Prinne, </em>2 <em>Ld. Ray. </em>812, it ivas decided, that to charge a man with evil principles was actionable. In the present case, the words laid in the declaration clearly import a charge against the defendant in his mercantile character. The declaration states him to be a merchant, and the whole of it taken together shews that the words were spoken of him <em>as such. </em>It was contended that the words do not in themselves import a charge against his reputation. We admit that they might have been innocent. One man may properly say to another in private, by way of asking for information, or in the necessary discussion of a disputed point, that that other had not accounted for property placed in his hands. The case is quite different here\u2014the charge is made publicly\u2014-it is laid to have been <em>maliciously </em>spoken, with intent to injure the plaintiff, and so the jury have found it. After this it would be highly improper in the Court to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"AKk\">The judgment must be affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b211-7\"> <em>Hyers </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>2 Call. 574. 588. <em>Cave </em>v. <em>Sheler, </em>2 Munf. 193, <em>191.
