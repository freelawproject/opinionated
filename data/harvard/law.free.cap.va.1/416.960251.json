Among the real estate owned by him in the City of <em>Richmond, </em>were a house and lot on the south side of E street, with a lumberhouse on the opposite side of the alley. This house and lot, with the lumber-house, formed one of the principal subjects of controversy in this suit. <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>claimed that it was given to her by her father on her marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-12\">It appears that <em>Arnold W.

George Winston, </em>in December 1817, executed two other deeds upon other portions of his property, one of them to secure to the <em>Bank of Virginia </em>a debt of 25,000 dollars, and the other to secure to the <em>United Stales Bank </em>at <em>Richmond </em>a debt of 35.000 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">In June 1818, the <em>Commonwealth </em>recovered a judgment against <em>Winston, </em>as the security of <em>Campbell, </em>for 17.000 dollars\u2014and in March 1819, he procured an act of assembly giving him time to pay this debt in three equal instalments, at the expiration of five, six, and seven years, upon condition of his giving security; and he accordingly gave his sons <em>Pleasant </em>and <em>James Winston </em>as his sureties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-9\">On the 21st of August 1820, <em>George Winston </em>conveyed the whole of his property, real and personal, to <em>Charles J.

The trustees are directed to apply the proceeds of the trust property to seven distinct classes of subjects, in succession, the first six of which are specific. The seventh class embraces all <em>Winston\u2019s </em>unenumerated creditors, and there is a proviso added to the deed, by which the trustees are authorized to sell to any of the unenumerated creditors, any portion of the property mentioned in the numbers from 11 inclusive to the end of the list, except 13, 14, and 17, in satisfaction of their claims; who are to hold it released from the operation of the trusts of this deed.

The trustees filed their answers in May of that year, and at the May term 1824, that court made a decree declaring that the deed was void as to the plaintiffs and the other judgment creditors of <em>George Winston, </em>and appointing the marshal of the court a receiver to manage the property and to collect the rents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-6\">In June 1821, <em>Mary W.

The bill alleged that <em>Arnold W. Ricks </em>by his will gave his estate to his wife for life, with remainder in fee to his daughter <em>Deborah; </em>and they prayed that the trustees might be compelled to convey the property to the plaintiffs. The notice to the tenant and the agreement with <em>Appleton Jones, </em>above mentioned, were filed with the bill as exhibits, and were the only evidence in the cause.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A5S\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\n<em>George Winston</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqM4\">answered, admitting ,the parol gift. <em>James Winston </em>in his answer, stated that whilst <em>Ricks </em>lived in <em>Southampton </em>he, <em>Winston, </em>collected some of the rents and remitted them to him. <em>Macmurdo </em>answere&lt;^ that he knew nothing about it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASC\">On these pleadings and exhibits the cause was forthwith brought to a hearing, by consent, and the court, saying that it did not intend to express any opinion on the deed of trust, decreed that the defendants should convey the house and lot to the plaintiff <em>Mary W. </em>for life, with remainder to the plaintiff <em>Deborah Ann </em>in fee: and a deed was accordingly executed by the defendants on the 19th of June 1821, conveying to the plaintiffs the house and lot as directed in the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">Sometime after the 1st of April 1821, <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>made out an account against her father as her collector, in which she charged him with the rents of the tenement on E street, on the quarter days on which they fell due, from the year 1817 to the 21st of August 1820, with interest upon each item from its date <em>to the 1st </em>of April 1821, amounting to the sum of 4579 dollars 82 cents; also with the annual rent of a lot on <em>Church Hill, </em>from the 1st December 1817, to the 1st December 1820, with like interest from the date of each item to the 1st of April 1821, amounting to 1100 dollars\u2014also with three years annual hire of two boys <em>Randal </em>and <em>Simon </em>for the years 1818, 19, and 20, and two years and a half hire of a boy <em>Primus, </em>with interest from the dates when the hires are alleged to have fallen due, till the 1st of April 1821, amounting to 586 dollars 30 cents, and making a grand total of 6266 dollars 12 cents. This account was endorsed as correct by <em>George Winston, </em>signing himself agent for <em>Charles J.

The personal estate of her husband was applied to the payment of his debts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZK\">Previous to the 8th December 1823, <em>George Winston, </em>who was an experienced builder of houses, and who had on hand when he made his deed of August 1820, a supply of bricks, and an obligation for the supply of 200,000 more, and who had several slaves, mechanics bound to him for a term of years, had built six tenements on <em>Cary </em>street for <em>David Bullock, </em>for the price of 12,255 dollars, of which <em>Bullock </em>had paid 2178 dollars 70 cents, leaving a balance of 10,076 dollars 30 cents due on the 1st of October 1823. On the 8th of December 1823, <em>Mrs. Micks, </em>by her agent <em>George Winston, </em>and <em>David Bullock </em>entered into an agreement under seal, and put upon record, in which it is recited that this work had been done by <em>Winston </em>as the agent of <em>Mrs. Ricks, </em>and that the balance due, with interest, was to be paid to <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>by a lease of the six tenements at the rent of 1225 dollars 50 cents per year for ten years, and by such additional annual payments as would extinguish the debt in ten years; with a proviso for an earlier discharge of the debt, if <em>Bullock </em>chose; and the further proviso that payments to <em>George Winston </em>were to be as good and the same as paid to <em>Mrs. Ricks.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-8\">In 1825, <em>George Winston </em>as the agent of <em>Mrs. Ricks, </em>entered into a contract with <em>David Bullock </em>and <em>James Ship hard, </em>for rebuilding a house for them in <em>Richmond, </em>for which they were to pay him out of the rents after it was finished; the price to be ascertained after the work was done; and by a memorandum of agreement between the same parties, dated April 7th, 1826, it was agreed that the price of building the house was 5879 dollars 95 cents; and it was recited that <em>Bullock </em>had paid his half of that sum, and he was exonerated from any farther claim for the building; and it was agreed that after <em>Bullock </em>had been satisfied for some advances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>he </em>had made for the building out of <em>Ship hard's </em>moiety of the rents, they should be applied to the satisfaction of <em>Mrs. Ricks's </em>claim for <em>Shiphard\u2019s </em>moiety of the price of the building.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7\">On the 25th of July 1820, <em>George Winston </em>and his son <em>Pleasant Winston </em>conveyed another tenement on E street to <em>Nathaniel Crenshaw </em>and <em>Benjamin Sheppard, </em>to secure the payment of 3600 dollars to <em>Edmund B. Crenshaw. </em>In 1825, this lot was sold under the deed of trust, and was struck out to <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>at 4065 dollars. On the 30th of April, the trustees conveyed the tenement to her in fee <em>simple; </em>and she on the same day reconveyed it to the same trustees to secure the balance of the purchase money; and by an agreement of the same date, between herself and <em>Edmund B. Crenshaw, </em>she assigned to him the rents of three of the tenements to which she was entitled under the contract with <em>Bullock, </em>until the balance of the purchase money should be paid; with a stipulation that if the securities given for the payment of the balance of the purchase money should not be sufficient to satisfy it, she was in no way to be personally responsible for it. It appears that the balance of the purchase money was paid out of the rents of the house sold, and the three tenements, without a sale under the trust deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">In 1821, <em>James Winston </em>as trustee in a deed for <em>Nathaniel Winston, </em>conveyed to <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>a lot on <em>Church Hill. </em>In her answer in this cause, she says, that the lot was purchased for her by her father, and paid for by him at the price of 300 dollars; and that subsequent to the purchase, her father, as a very small reimbursement towards the debt he owed her, built a small dwelling house upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">On the 16th of October 1826, <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>executed three deeds, by one of which, in consideration of natural love and affection, she conveyed to her four sisters, <em>Elizabeth Clark, Lucy Ann Kyle, Amelia H. Winston, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and <em>Virginia J. Winston, </em>her interest in four of the tenements she held under the contract with <em>Bullock; </em>by another of which she, for the same consideration, conveyed one other of these tenements to her brother <em>Thomas B. Winston; </em>and by the other she, for the same consideration, conveyed to her aforesaid sisters one moiety of the tenement purchased from <em>Crenshaw, </em>reciting in said deed that the other moiety had been conveyed in trust for the separate use of <em>Elizabeth C. Winston, </em>the wife of <em>Pleasant Winston. </em>On the 19th of October, <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>executed another deed, by which she, for the same consideration, conveyed to her four sisters the house and lot on <em>Church Hill.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-4\">Upon the bonds executed by <em>George Winston </em>in satisfaction of the judgment against him as security of <em>Campbell, </em>the <em>commonwealth </em>proceeded to obtain judgments in the <em>general court </em>against him and his sureties <em>James </em>and <em>Pleasant Winston, </em>as the instalments fell due in 1824, \u201925 and \u201926; the last judgment being at the June term 1827, against the sureties only, <em>George Winston </em>being then dead. But partial satisfaction was obtained on these judgments, <em>George Winston\u2019s </em>property being covered with incumbrances, and his sureties proving insolvent. Whereupon in May 1828, the <em>commonwealth, </em>by the <em>attorney general, </em>instituted this suit against <em>George Winston\u2019s </em>representative, his sureties <em>James </em>and <em>Pleasant Winston, Mrs. Ricks </em>and her daughter, and those claiming under <em>Mrs. Ricks, </em>and others; and in the original information filed he charged that the contracts with <em>Bullock, </em>and <em>Bullock </em>and <em>Ship-hard, </em>were entered into in the name of <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>with the fraudulent intent on the part of herself and her father of protecting his property and the profits of his business from his creditors. He charged that the conveyances by <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>to her sisters and brother were without consideration, and asked that they might be set aside, unless she would establish by proof that the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>was acquired by her in <em>good </em>faith; that she might be required to account for all the moneys received by her under the contracts with Bullock, and <em>Bullock </em>and <em>Sliiphard-, </em>that these contracts might be held to enure to benefit of the <em>commonwealth; </em>that all necessary accounts might be ordered; that in the mean time a receiver might be appointed to collect the rents on all the property, and all sums of money to become due for the same; that <em>Bullock </em>and <em>Ship hard </em>be restrained from paying over any moneys due or to become due on said contracts to <em>Mrs. Ricks; </em>that she disclose what consideration she paid for the property conveyed by her to her sisters and brother, and what amount she advanced out of her own funds under the contracts aforesaid; and for general relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-4\"><em>Mrs. Ricks </em>answered, stating the gift of the house on E street to her husband and herself by her father on her marriage, stating the indebtedness of her father to her on account of the rents of the houses she claimed, and the hire as hereinbefore stated; the purchase by her, as one of the unenumerated creditors of her father in part discharge of the debt he owed her, of the services of three negro men who were bound to service until the age of twenty-five years, of a parcel of bricks then on hand and a debt from <em>Benjamin Haley </em>and <em>Benjamin </em>and <em>John Sheppard </em>for two hundred thousand bricks. .That having purchased this property, and being possessed of two servants hound to serve until they should attain the age of twenty-one, she on the 22d of May 1822, entered into a written agreement with her father, by which she placed in his hands the property above mentioned; which with 1000 dollars a part of the debt he owed her, was to constitute a fund to be employed by him in his business of house builder, &amp;c. for her use and benefit. That his remuneration was to be such sum as they should agree upon; or if they disagreed as to the amount to be allowed, it was to be fixed by arbitra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tors mutually chosen by them. That it was under this agreement that the contracts with <em>Bullock, </em>and <em>Bullock </em>and <em>Shiphard </em>were made and executed. That she purchased the house of <em>Sheppard </em>and <em>Crenshaw </em>for the joint benefit of herself and sister-in-law <em>Elizabeth C. </em>. <em>W^znston, </em>whose moiety thereof had been conveyed to trustees for her separate use. That said <em>Elizabeth </em>paid 1254 dollars, of the purchase money, she had paid about 820 dollars, and the balance had been paid out of the rents of that house and of three of those of which she had possession under her contract with <em>Bullock. </em>That the house and lot on <em>Church Hill </em>were acquired by her as hereinbefore stated, and that her conveyances to her sisters and brother were without consideration other than natural love and affection. That she has received no part of the rents of the six tenements, except what was applied to satisfy <em>Crenshaw. </em>That she kept no accounts of these moneys, and is unable to give a correct statement of accounts between her and her father.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">The claimants of the property under <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>answered, admitting the conveyances to them were voluntary. The other parties also answered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">In 1830, the <em>attorney general </em>filed an amended information, in which he enumerated all the conveyances hereinbefore <em>mentioned; </em>stated that when the most, if not all these conveyances were made, <em>George Winston </em>was greatly in debt; stated <em>Douthat\u2019s </em>judgment and the proceedings on it. That in November 1820, the <em>United States Bank </em>had recovered a judgment against <em>Winston </em>for 19,999 dollars, exclusive of interest and damages ; charged that the house and lot on E street claimed by <em>Mrs. Ricks, </em>were conveyed by the deed to <em>Macmirdo </em>and <em>James Winston; </em>stated the decree rendered in the suit of <em>Mrs. Ricks </em>and her daughter against <em>George Winston </em>and his trustees, <em>James Winston </em>and <em>Macmurdo ; </em>charged that the whole proceeding was fraudulent as to the creditors of <em>George Winston, </em>and asked that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>might be set aside; and the amended bill concluded by praying that such of the deeds recited as might appear to have been made to defraud and defeat creditors might be set aside, that such as were made <em>bona fide </em>to secure creditors might be enforced, that all proper accounts might be taken, and for general relief.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-4\"><em>Mi's. Ricks </em>again answered, stating the manner in which the house and lot on E street was given to her by her father, and denying all fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">In the progress of the cause, the court appointed <em>Philip B. Jones </em>a receiver of the court, with authority to take possession of all the real estate mentioned in the bill, and to rent it out, and collect the rents. In 1843, the receiver reported that all the property was in the possession of the marshal of the <em>United States </em>court, as receiver in the case of the <em>United States Bank </em>v. <em>Winston Sp others, </em>with the exception of one warehouse which was in the possession of <em>Rives Sp Harris </em>as tenants ; and that he had received from them 1844 dollars 22 cents, being one half of the rents of the warehouse for part of the year 1834, and for the years 1835, \u201936, \u201937, \u201938, \u201939, \u201940, \u201941 and \u201942, inclusive, but that they refused to pay interest thereon, because, as they alleged, they had always been ready to pay the rents to any person legally authorized to receive them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-6\"><em>Mrs. Ricks </em>intermarried with <em>Thomas H. Terrell; </em>and the cause came on in March 1843 to be finally heard, when the court expressed the opinion that there was no proof of fraud between <em>Mrs. Terrell </em>and <em>George Winston; </em>that there was no sufficient ground to impeach the title of <em>Mrs. Terrell </em>to the house and lot on E <em>street; </em>or to the property erected by her for <em>Bullock </em>and Shiphard, or her title to any other property mentioned in the information. The court, therefore, confirmed her in her title to said property; and directed the possession of the property to be delivered to <em>Thomas H. Terrell </em>and his wife by the proper officer of the court. The court farther decreed that <em>Rives Sp Harris </em>should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>pay interest upon the rents in arrear, and directed the <em>sr j sr i </em>receiver <em>Jones </em>to pay over the money in his hands to <em>Terrell </em>and wife. From this decree, the <em>attorney gone- </em>, , , , \u2019 <em>y </em>63 <em>ral </em>obtained an appeal to this court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATSp\"><em>Baxter </em>attorney general, <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Bouldin, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AgVj\">Lyons, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-13\"> He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b451-11\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A7H\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">As regards the tenement on the south side of E or main street in the City of Richmond, together with the lumber house on the opposite side of the adjoining alley, in the proceedings mentioned, the court, without deciding under what circumstances, if any, a parol gift of real estate from a father to a child, accompanied by delivery of possession, ought to be enforced or recognized by a court of equity, against the creditors of the donor, or subsequent purchasers from him, or against the donor himself, is of opinion that, in the present case, no equitable right to such relief or protection, in respect to said property, has been shewn by the appellee <em>Mary W. </em>Terrell, formerly <em>Mary W. Ricks, </em>and her daughter, the appellee <em>Debora,h Ann Ricks, </em>or either of them, under the gift in the proceedings mentioned, asserted by the said <em>Mary W. </em>as having been made by her father <em>George Winston to </em>her and her former husband <em>Arnold W. Ricks. </em>And the court is further of opinion, that the rights of the creditors of the said <em>George Winston, </em>in regard to said property, cannot be affected by the decree of the late superior court of chancery for the <em>Richmond </em>district, in the proceedings mentioned, rendered on the 13th of June 1821, in a cause then depending therein, between the said <em>Mary W. Ricks </em>and <em>Deborah Ann Ricks </em>plaintiffs, and the said <em>George Winston </em>and <em>James Winston </em>and <em>Charles James Macmurdo </em>defendants, by which decree the said defendants were directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>to convey to the said <em>Mary W. </em>for her life, with remainder in fee simple to the said <em>Deborah Ann, </em>the property <em>aforesaid; </em>the said creditors not having been parties in that suit. And in regard to the arrangements, contracts and other transactions between the said <em>Mary W. Ricks </em>and <em>George Winston </em>in the proceedings mentioned, by which it was, amongst other things, pretended, that the said <em>Mary W. </em>became the creditor of her said father to a large amount; that she acquired certain of the personal property and funds which had been embraced in the general deed of trust of the 21st of August 1820, executed by the said <em>George </em>Winston'for the benefit of his creditors; that said <em>Winston </em>became engaged and employed in her service and as her agent, with her resources and upon her credit, in the business of house building, and that she was entitled to the proceeds thereof, and the' property and funds thereby acquired: the court is of opinion, that the said arrangements, contracts and other transactions between the said <em>Mary W. Ricks </em>and <em>George Winston, </em>were fraudulent devices and contrivances for the purpose of defeating the creditors of said <em>Winston, </em>and securing to him and his family the products of his skill, labour, resources and contracts, against their <em>demands; </em>that the said <em>George Winston </em>was in no wise indebted to the said <em>Mary W. Ricks; </em>that she acquired no right to any of the property or funds embraced in the trust deed aforesaid, as against the creditors of said <em>George Winston, </em>nor as against them to the benefit of the contracts in the proceedings mentioned, made in her name with <em>David Bullock, </em>and with <em>Bullock </em>and <em>Ship hard, </em>nor to the purchase in her name in the proceedings mentioned, of the property sold by the trustees <em>Nathaniel C. Orenshato </em>and <em>Benjamin Sheppard, </em>under the deed of trust of the 5th of July 1820, executed to them by said <em>George Winston </em>and <em>Pleasant Winston, </em>to secure a debt to <em>Edmund B. Crenshaw, </em>and by said trustees conveyed to said <em>Mary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>W. Ricks </em>by their deed of the 30th of April 1825; the said contracts and purchase last mentioned having in truth been made by means of the labour, skill and resources of the said <em>George Winston, </em>and for the benefit of him and his family, except so far as an interest in said purchase may have been acquired by <em>Elizabeth C. Winston, </em>wife of <em>Pleasant Winston, </em>in regard to which the court expresses no opinion. And as regards the lot in the answer of said <em>Mary W. Ricks </em>mentioned, as having been purchased for her by said <em>George Winston, </em>from <em>James Winston, </em>trustee of <em>Nathaniel Winston, </em>and conveyed to her by said <em>James Winston </em>on the 27th of May 1821, and improved for her by said <em>George Winston; </em>the court is of opinion, that the same must be treated, in respect to the creditors of said <em>George Winston </em>as his property, the transaction being a fraudulent contrivance, upon a feigned consideration, as between the said <em>George </em>and the said <em>Mary W., </em>for the purpose of defeating said creditors, and securing the benefit of said property to him and his family. And the court is further of opinion, that the conveyance in the proceedings mentioned, from the said <em>Mary W. Ricks </em>to her brother <em>Thomas B. Winston, </em>and the conveyances in the proceedings mentioned, from her to her four sisters, <em>Elizabeth Clark, Lucy Ann Kyle, Amelia </em>iJ. <em>Winston, </em>and <em>Virginia J. Winston, </em>were as between the grantors and grantees merely voluntary, and as between the said <em>Mary W. Ricks </em>and <em>George Winston, </em>parts of their fraudulent arrangements and transactions aforesaid, contrived for the purpose of defeating the creditors of the said <em>George Winston: </em>and that the property, interest and funds thereby conveyed, are subject to the demands of said creditors. Wherefore the court is of opinion, that the said decree rendered in this cause, by the said superior court of chancery for the <em>Richmond </em>circuit, is erroneous, except so far as it relates to the question, whether interest was chargeable to <em>Rives </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Harris </em>upon the rents of the lumber house therein mentioned, until collected from them by the receiver of the court. And the court is further of opinion, that though the general deed of trust above mentioned, executed by sa^ <em>George Winston </em>on the 21st of August 1820, is not impeached as fraudulent by the informations of the <em>attorney general </em>filed in this cause, yet that the fairness and validity of that deed are involved in the question of priorities amongst the creditors of the said <em>George Winston, </em>seeking satisfaction out of the property thereby conveyed, and his other property, under the several incumbrances and liens of said creditors, in the proceedings mentioned; as are also the fairness and validity of the conveyance in the amended information mentioned, made by the said <em>George Winston </em>to his son <em>James Winston, </em>and of the several conveyances in said amended information mentioned, made by the said <em>George Winston </em>to his son <em>Pleasant Winston. </em>And the court is further of opinion, that the <em>attorney general </em>ought to be required to amend his informations, so as to state distinctly the liens, incumbrances and priorities claimed by the <em>commomoealth, </em>and the grounds upon which she impeaches any of the liens, incumbrances, conveyances and priorities claimed by others, and so as to state distinctly the property, funds and effects which she seeks to subject to the satisfaction of her demands against the said <em>George Winston\u2019s </em>representatives and his sureties the said <em>James Winston </em>and <em>Pleasant Winston : </em>and making all proper additional parties not now before the court. And that accounts ought to be directed before a commissioner, of the property, funds and effects of the said <em>George Winston </em>in the hands of the said <em>Mary W. Terrell, </em>formerly <em>Mary W. Ricks, </em>and others claiming under her; and of the property, funds and effects of the said <em>George Winston, </em>embraced in the aforesaid general deed of trust executed by him on the 21st of August 1820; and of any other property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>funds and effects of his, in whose hands soever they may be, liable to the demands of his creditors; and of the rents, profits and proceeds of all such property, funds , . , . ... .. i or effects; and of the several priorities claimed by and. amongst his said creditors: and also such other accounts as in the further progress of the cause may he found necessary to the rendition of a final decree. Wherefore it is decreed and ordered, that so much of the said decree rendered in this cause, as is above declared to be erroneous, he reversed and annulled, with costs to appellant against <em>Terrell </em>and wife, <em>Deborah A. Ricks, Thomas B. Winston, Elizabeth H. Clark, Amelia II. Winston, Virginia J. Winston, Hazlet Kyle </em>and <em>Mary Ann Kyle his wife, </em>and <em>George Winston\u2019s </em>administrators, and the cause remanded for further proceedings according to the principles herein declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
