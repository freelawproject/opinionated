Cox and Elizabeth Thompson, stating the following case: that on the 18th day of November, 1803, an agreement was made between the complainant, and the said <em>Elizabeth Thompson, </em>by which the latter agreed to sell and convey to the complainant, a tract of land in the county of W estmoreland, called <em>Laurel Grove, </em>in consideration that the complainant would pay certain debts due from the said <em>Elizabeth Thompson, </em>set forth in the agreement, together with a sum of money to herself, making in the whole, 87QI.: that one of the debts to be paid by the complainant, was due to Peter P. Cox, and secured by a deed from the said <em>Elizabeth </em>to the said <em>Peter, </em>dated the 8th of August, 1801, conveying the same tract of land, and <em>stating the </em>consideration to be <em>$ </em>1,500 j with a condition that the said <em>Peter </em>should hold the said land in trust, to secure the payment of the said sum, with interest: that at the time of entering into the agreement aforesaid, the complainant understood that there was a mortgage on the said land to the said Cox, and nothing more: that the complainant made several payments under his agreement, was put into possession of the land, and was preparing, by great exertion, to pay the purchase money, and exonerate the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>from this incumbrance, when in 1806, after he had paid the 1 said Cox, the sum of 800/. 8s. in part of his debt, he was informed that the title to the said land, was doubtful: that in consequence of this information, the complainant filed a bill of injunction against <em>Cox </em>and Thompson, and one who, as the complainant was informed, claimed title to some part of the said tract of land : that the injunction was granted, and afterwards dissolved : that immediately after the dissolution of the injunction, the said Peter P. Cox undertook to sell the said land, without giving any warning to the complainant, or requiring payment of the balance due, and the said land was put up to public sale, and bought by a certain j whether on his own account or that of the said <em>Cox, </em>the complainant did not know : that the deed to <em>Cox, </em>can only be considered as a mortgage, because there is no particular person named as trustee, who might act impartially between the debtor and creditor : that the trust is uncertain and equivocal, as there is no covenant on the part of <em>Cox, </em>to receive payment from the grantor, and to release her, or re-convey the land: that if the deed is a mortgage, the proceedings of the said <em>Cox, </em>are illegal and improper: that he knew of the agreement between the complainant and <em>Elizabeth Thompson, </em>and had received from him two payments under that agreement: that <em>Cox </em>has caused the <em>\u25a0whole </em>tract to be sold to pay the balance due; and threatens to bring an ejectment against the complainant. He, therefore, prays that the said <em>Cox, </em>and <em>Elizabeth Thompson, </em>may be made defendants: that he may be permitted to redeem upon paying the principal and interest due to the said <em>Cox; </em>and that the latter may be compelled to release all his claim to the said land, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">The defendant <em>Cox </em>answered, that the g 1,500 lent to the said <em>Elizabeth Thompson, </em>were not his own, but the money of his wards, the children of his brother; to secure the payment of which, the deed of trust mentioned in the bill was executed: that he advertised the said land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>for sale, in pursuance of the deed of trust; but the sale * was injoined at the suit of the complainant, under pretence that the said <em>Elizabeth Thompson\u2019s </em>title to the said land was defective: that the injunction was afterwards dissolved, and the land again advertised for sale on the premises : that the complainant and many others attended <em>; </em>when the complainant, before the sale commenced, asked the respondent if he would receive from him eleven or twelve hundred dollars, and give a longer time for payment of the balance : that the respondent, induced by the distress of the complainant\u2019s family, agreed, that if the said sum was paid in one hour, he would give a longer time for the balance : that the.respondent waited at least three hours, and did not commence the sale, until he was informed by the complainant, that he had been disappointed in obtaining the money: that the sale was then commenced, and several persons made bids for the land, but no one on account of the respondent: that the land was purchased by Mr. <em>William Taylor </em>for 6261. for himself, and not for the respondent; who offered to let the complainant have it, if he would pay the sum he had bid for it in eight or ten days: that the said deed was always treated by the complainant and <em>Elizabeth </em>Thompson, as a <em>deed of </em>trust, and not a <em>mortgage: </em>that the respondent admits, that he has received from the complainant, the sum of 300Z. 8s. in part of the sum due, which, with interest, leaves a balance due to this respondent\u2019s wards, of272Z. 13s. 8rf.: that as to the title of the said <em>Elizabeth </em>to the said land, he believes it to be unimpeachable, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-8\">The answ\u2019er of <em>Elizabeth Thompson, </em>confirms the answer of <em>Cox </em>as to <em>the </em>consideration of the deed of trust : that she considered it as a <em>deed of trust, </em>and not a <em>mortgage: </em>that the complainant, in his treaty with her for the purchase of the said land, urged a reduction in the price, because the said <em>Cox </em>might, at very short notice, sell the land : that her title is undeniable: that since the sale, the said <em>Cox </em>as trustee, has paid the respondent <em>3 </em>400, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>for which sum the complainant shall have credit in his contract for the sale of the land to him, and the balance, if any, she will pay to him, on his producing evidence that he has paid or secured the payment, to <em>Forbes and Whitlock, </em>according to his agreement with her ; but if the dee : aforesaid shall be considered a <em>mortgage </em>and not a <em>deed of trust, </em>she hopes that she may be paid the amount due to her by the agreement, and that the debt to <em>Forbes and Whitlock. </em>may be also paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-4\">The chancellor referred the accounts between the parties to a commissioner, to ascertain the balance remaining unpaid in the hands of the defendant <em>Cox, </em>of the sales of the land in the bill mentioned, and the amount due from the plaintiff to the defendant <em>Thompson, </em>&amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-5\">The commissioner reported a balance unpaid in the hands of Cox, of <em>2531. </em>16s. 3d.; and that <em>William Chowning </em>was indebted to <em>Elizabeth Thompson, </em>in the sum of <em>1661. 3s. 9d.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-6\">The chancellor decreed, that the complainant\u2019s bill should <em>be </em>dismissed as to so much thereof, as seeks to be relieved against the said sale : that he and his heirs, should be forever barred of all title in the said land ; and that the defendant <em>Cox, </em>after reserving out of the sale of the said land, the amount reported by the commissioner to be due to him, do pay to the defendant <em>Thompson, </em>the sum of 12ol. with interest thereon from the first day of January, 1804, until paid ; and that he do pay to the plaintiff the sum of <em>2531. </em>I6s. <em>3d. </em>with interest from the 29th day of May, 1812, until paid, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-8\">From this decree, <em>William Chowning </em>appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-9\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-10\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-11\">For the appellant, it was contended : 1. That the deed was in fact a mortgage, and that a creditor could not be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>trustee for his own benefit. 2. That <em>Cox </em>was not authorisen by the terms of the deed, nor by the principles of equity, to sell more land than was necessary to pay the debt due from Elizabeth Thompson to him. The cases of <em>Davidson </em>vs. <em>Wait,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Turner </em>vs. <em>Turner,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were referred to, as analogous to the present case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-5\">The counsel for the appellee replied, that Cox proceeded to sell the land with the perfect knowledge of Chowning, and without objection on his part: that as to <em>Cox </em>being <em>creditor </em>and trustee, Mrs. <em>Thompson </em>frequently recognized his character as <em>trustee; </em>and it is proved by the deed itself, that he was not the <em>real </em>creditor, but that the money borrowed, was that of his <em>wards. </em>But admitting that he was the creditor, there is no principle or authority which forbids the union of the two characters in the same person. No unfairness in the sale is proved or even alleged, in the present case. The case of <em>Moore\u2019s ex\u2019r. </em>vs. <em>Aylett\u2019s ex\u2019r. &amp;c.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The deed authorised and directed <em>Cox </em>to sell the <em>whole </em>land.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\"><em> </em>2 Munf. 527.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AtV\">5) 3 Munf. 66-68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b322-10\"> 1 H. &amp; M. 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\"><em>February </em>13.</p>\n<author id=\"A1E\">Judge Cabell,</author>\n<p id=\"AUf\">delivered the opinion of the court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">This case presents the general question, whether a deed executed by a debtor conveying land to his creditor, and purporting to constitute him the trustee for selling the land, and applying the proceeds of sale to the payment of the debt due to himself, can be regarded otherwise than as a mere mortgage, to which the right of redemption is incident: or, in other words, whether a creditor thus constituted a trustee, can, by the mere authority derived from the deed, and without resort to a court of equity, sell the lands so as to bar the rights of the debtor, and those claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Where a third person, disinterested and indifferent between the parties, is constituted the trustee, it cannot now be questioned that lie possesses the powers claimed for the creditor in this case. We do not mean to insinuate that the court has gone too far in confirming these powers, and in sanctioning the summary proceedings to which they give rise: but we are of opinion, that it has gone far enough ; that it has gone as far <em>as </em>the purposes of convenience and justice require <em>; </em>and that it cannot go farther, without opening a door to fraud and oppression. Although there is no decision which bears, expressly, on the point before us, yet the principles frequently declared in relation to the powers and duties of trustees in general, are utterly incompatible with the due exercise of those powers and duties by the creditor. Some of these principles will be found declared in the case of <em>Lane </em>vs. <em>Tidbal.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is there said, among other things, that a trustee, in a deed of trust, is to be considered as the agent of both parties; and that he ought to act impartially between them, Ac. It is surely not necessary, for the purpose now before us, to proceed farther in the enumeration. It must frequently happen, that the time, the place, and the manner of selling, will present questions of serious difficulty, and of great importance to the parties. The sum really due, at the time of sale, may also admit of much controversy. On all these points, as well as many others that might be mentioned, the interests of the parties may be, and frequently are, at direct variance <em>i </em>and to refer them, for adjustment, to the will of one party only, would be contrary to the clearest principles of na tural justice. That any man should execute a deed conferring such powers, with a <em>belief that </em>the deed will be obligatory on him, affords another proof of the maxim, that the borrower is a slave to the lender. This is one of those cases in which it becomes necessary to protect men from the effects of their own folly or imprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"AQS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>We </em>are all, therefore, of opinion, that the deed in the record mentioned, did not give the power to sell the lands, so as <em>to </em>bar the right <em>of </em>redemption.</p>\n<p id=\"AyX\">In pronouncing this opinion, we wish to be understood as confining ourselves to the case before the court, which is a case of real property. How far the same principle may, or may not, be applicable to a case of personal property, we wish to be understood as giving no intimation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">On these principles, if there were no other persons than the debtor and creditor, interested in this controversy, the court would not only reverse the decree, but provide for a sale under the directions of the court of chancery. But the person who purchased under the former sale, and who has the legal title, has not been made a party. Had he been before the court, he might have given a different aspect to the cause. He might have shewn, that although the sale cannot be justified on the sole ground of the powers derived from the deed, yet it ought to be confirmed in his favor, in consequence of the subsequent acts of the appellant. He ought, therefore, to have been a party <em>; </em>and the chancellor erred in pronouncing a final decree, without affording an opportunity to bring him before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">It is proper to observe, that if the decree were free from the objection aforesaid, we should still have to reverse it for error against the appellee, Cox. The decree is erroneous, even on the principles on which it professes to proceed. The land sold for <em>626l. </em>There was due to Cox the sum of <em>372l. Ss. 9d. </em>which he is directed to <em>retain; </em>of course, he ought not to have been subjected to pay more than the balance, viz. <em>2,531. </em>16s. <em>3d. </em>Yet he is decreed to pay that balance to the appellant j and the farther sum of <em>1201. to </em>the appellee Thompson, <em>with </em>interest from January, 1804.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The decree is therefore reversed, and the cause remanded for farther proceedings, pursuant to the principles now declared.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\"> Judge Brooke absent from indisposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><em> </em>Gilmer\u2019s Rep. 130.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
