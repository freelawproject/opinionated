And a dispute arose between the parties, which should bear the loss ? whether <em>Peter </em>had fairly performed the contract of bailment on his part ? and whether or no he was bound, under the peculiar circumstances of the case, to account to <em>Butler </em>for the value of the flour, which he had deposited with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>him on storage ? Hereupon, Butler, finding persons in <em>Virginia </em>indebted to <em>Peter, </em>proceeded by way of foreign attachment in chancery (1 Rev. Code, ch. 123. p. 474.) exhibiting his bill, in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Winchester, </em>against <em>Peter, </em>as ah absent debtor, and against <em>his </em>debtors in <em>Virginia </em>as garnishees, praying a decree for the value of the flour, against <em>Peter, </em>and the attachment and application of the moneys due him in <em>Virginia, </em>to satisfy the claim. <em>Peter, </em>besides making strenuous defence upon the merits, objected to the jurisdiction of the court of chancery. The chancellor sustained the jurisdiction; and, upon the merits, decreed <em>Butler </em>the amount of his claim. And <em>Peter </em>appealed to this court;</summary>\n<attorneys id=\"b298-9\">The cause was argued here by Leigh, for the appellant, and by <em>Wickham </em>and <em>Stanard </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">The facts of the case were much controverted, and several interesting questions of law were discussed, both in the court of chancery, and here : but, in the view of this court, the cause turned wholly on the questions of fact. These the court decided against the appellant, and affirmed the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">The only point of law involved in the decision, was the question of jurisdiction. This court concurred with the chancellor, that a claim, arising on a contract of bailment made out of <em>Virginia, </em>against a non-resident of <em>Virginia, </em>is such a claim for debt, for which the foreign attachment in chancery is a proper remedy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b297-17\"> <em>Carr, </em>J. did not sit, because he had decided the cause in the court of chancery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b297-14\">1829.
