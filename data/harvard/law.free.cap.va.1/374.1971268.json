The case was as follows.\u2014Mercer, being in possession of a tract of land, to a part of which <em>Hansborough </em>was entitled as heir to his mother, (and which had been sold to the father of <em>Mercer, </em>by the father of Hansborough, without the privy examination of the mother) proposed selling it to Smallwood, who hearing of the title of <em>Hans-borough, </em>objected thereto. <em>Mercer, </em>to remove this obstacle, applied to <em>Hansborough, </em>and a bond dated <em>March </em>26th, 1783, was entered into, with a condition, the material parts of which are as follow, <em>viz: \u201c </em>whereas certain matters of controversy now depend, and subsist between the above named <em>Mercer, </em>and the above bound Hansborough, that is to say, a claim which the said <em>Hansborough </em>pretends to have to 1331 acres of land, now in the possession of the said <em>Mercer, </em>and which the said <em>Hansborough </em>claims as heir at law to his mother <em>Lettice, </em>whom the said <em>Mercer </em>admits to be one of the daughters and co-heiress of <em>Joseph Summer </em>deceased ; and also admits the said land to be the same, which the late <em>John Mercer, </em>father of the said <em>Mercer, </em>purchased of the father of the said Hansborough, as, and for, the reversion of one-third of 400 acres, called the dower of the widow of the said <em>Joseph Sumner ; </em>also a claim the said <em>Mercer </em>has, or may have against the said Hansborough, as executor of his father, for the value of the said land, in case the same shall be adjudged to the said Hansborough,\u2014he, the said Hansborough, hereby acknowledging assets in his hands sufficient to make satisfaction for the said 133s acres, and also acknowledging the said <em>Mercer </em>to have all the right of his father, under the deed from the said Hansborough, which several disputes the said <em>Mercer </em>and the said <em>Hansborough </em>have agreed to submit to the arbitration, &amp;c., of <em>Joseph Jones, Alexander </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Rose, </em>and <em>Andrew Buchanan, </em>or any two of them, to be adjudged, &amp;c., and in manner following, <em>viz: </em>\u201c if they shall adjudge the said <em>Hansborough </em>to be entitled to said land, they shall award the said <em>Mercer </em>to pay the said <em>Hansborough </em>the value thereof in money, upon receiving a conveyance of the said land from said <em>Hansborough; </em>and as to the dispute between the said <em>Mercer </em>and the said <em>Hansborough, </em>as executor of his father, it is agreed, the same shall be adjusted as follows, <em>viz: </em>if the said arbitrators shall adjudge the estate of the said <em>Hansborough </em>liable to make good the value of the said land, they shall adjudge what value shall be paid, and may allow the said <em>Hansborough </em>to retain such value in his hands, in full, towards the consideration they shall adjudge to be paid for the said lands. The condition is, if the said <em>Hansborough </em>shall in all things do and perform the award, &amp;c., which the said arbitrators shall make touching the premises (provided the same be made in writing, ready to be delivered <em>on or befor\u00e9 the </em>30 <em>th of June next,) </em>then See. See. To which was annexed the following memorandum, <em>viz: </em>\u201c It is agreed, if the legatees of the said <em>J. Hans-borough, </em>(the father,) shall dissent from the claim of the said <em>Mercer </em>against the said <em>Hansborough, </em>on the covenants in the deed of the said <em>J. Hansborough </em>being arbitrated, then the arbitrators shall be discharged from that part of the business before submitted to them. And it is agreed, the said <em>Hansborough </em>shall enter an appearance at the suit of the said <em>Mercer, </em>in an action of covenant in the General Court, and allow the same to go on with all legal despatch to a judgment, until when, said <em>Hansborough </em>agrees to waif with said Mercer, for whatever the said arbitrators shall adjudge the said <em>Mercer </em>to pay for the said 133s acres, and then to discount therefrom what may be recovered in the action of covenant; and further, the said <em>Hans borough </em>agrees that he will make the said <em>Mercer </em>deeds for the said lands, immediately upon payment of the value to be awarded, or upon receipt of a bond for the same, with such security as the said <em>Hansborough </em>shall agree.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>This bond being shown by <em>Mercer </em>to <em>Smalhvood, </em>the latter, after consulting counsel, was induced to snake the purchase, and paid the consideration money agreed upon\u00bb The award was never made, on account of the refusal of one of the arbitrators to act, because he had previously given his opinion to <em>Hansborough </em>with respect to his title. <em>Mercer </em>offered to concede the title to be in <em>Hansborough, </em>and to give Mm bond and security to pay as much per acre for the 133-i acres, as he was to receive from <em>Smallwood </em>for the whole tract, which offer was refused. <em>Hans-borough </em>brought an ejectment against Smallwood, upon which <em>Smalhvood </em>exhibited this bill, praying for an injunction and conveyance. Upon the institution of this slut, <em>Mercer </em>brought an action of covenant against Hansborough, as executor to his father.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-3\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-4\">This bond contains a positive agreement on the part of <em>Hansborough </em>to sell the land in question, and the agreement as to the sale could not be dependent upon the award, the object of which was, merely to decide upon <em>the title of Hansborough, </em>to fix the price of land, and the damages to be paid by <em>Hansborough </em>out of the assets of his father, for the breach of his contract ,in not warranting the title of the land. The circumstances which attended the giving of that bond, prove incontestibly that this was the intention and design of the parties. <em>Hansborough </em>knew of <em>Smallwood1 s </em>intention to purchase, ancr his objection on account of <em>Hansboroughs </em>claim to the land. To remove this objection, he gave the bond, which was shown to Smallwood, and it had the expected effect. A third person paying his money in consequence of this agreement, ought not to be affected by the fault, either of <em>Hansborough, </em>or of <em>Mercer, </em>in failing to adjust those other matters of dispute, which only concerned themselves. The proviso, that the award should be made, and delivered within a stated time, does not alter the case, because it could only relate to the matters submitted, which were the <em>price and damages, </em>not the <em>sale, </em>which is positively stipulated for, whatever might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>be the event of those subjects of dispute. But fur<em>tber\u2014Hansborough, by </em>appointing a referee, whom he could not act, committed a fraud, and he will, therefore, be bound to submit to some other equitable mode of adjusting the price,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A_y\">Campbell, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">If this Court be called upon to decree a specific execution of an agreement, it must be done in the way agreed upon by the parties, and in no other. For otherwise, it would be to <em>make, </em>not to <em>execute an agreement; </em>and if, from any circumstance, it cannot be executed in that way, this Court must leave the parties to their legal remedy. It is to be observed, that <em>Smallwood, </em>knowing of <em>Hansboroughs </em>title, can stand in no better situation than <em>Mercer </em>would, if he were plaintiff. This obligation is to be binding in the whole, or not at ail. Now what does <em>Hansborough </em>bind himself to perform ? The award of the arbitrators. That is, if they say he hath a title, they are to decide upon the price which <em>Hansborough </em>shall take for the land. But upon what condition is <em>Hansborough </em>bound to sell for that price ? That the decision be made <em>within a limited time. </em>If this condition be not performed, heis not bound at Law, and upon what principle can he be bound in Equity ? He might, for the purpose of putting an end to litigation, and with a view to receiving the value of the land within a short period, be disposed to sell his right, which otherwise he would not have been induced to do if kept in suspense beyond that time. But after that time is passed, \u2014litigation still hanging over him,\u2014the purchase money at this day unpaid, and he forced at length to assert his right in a Court of Law ;\u25a0\u2014after so great a lapsed of time, and after he has been compelled to incur all the trouble and expense, which he so anxiously wished to avoidcan it be just or equitable, that he should be still bound to sell, though he agreed to do so upon a condition only, which has not been performed ? It is impossible. But what can this Court do ? They cannot appoint referees; for they may not be agreeable to the parties. And if the Court could ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>point them, still the award cannot now be made within the time fixed upon by the parties, and, consequently, the prayer of the bill, which is for a specific execution of that agreement, cannot be decreed. The result of the whole is, that this Court must remain neuter between the parties, and leave them to the Law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-3\"><em>Marshall, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Add\">I yet insist, that the agreement to sell is absolute. The business of the arbitrators is stated in the preamble to the condition, namely, to decide the right of <em>Hansborough </em>to the land, the price to be paid by Mercer, and <em>Mercer\u2019s </em>claim to damages. But the arbitrators are not to decide whether <em>Hans-borough </em>is to sell or not. If they were, then I admit the full operation of the proviso. But that is not submitted ; the bond itself is complete evidence of a prior agreement to sell; for, in all bargains, it is usual for the vendor'to agree to sell before the price is spoken of. This previous point being settled, the consideration and terms follow next, and is either fixed by the stipulation of the parties, or left to depend upon other inodes of ascertainment. I admit, that the Court cannot appoint referees ; but if it be clear that a sale was agreed upon, and that the award which was to fix the price has been prevented by accident or fraud, this Court may compel a specific performance as to the sale, and direct a jury to settle the price. In the case of <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>in this Court, a similar decree was made, transferring this power from arbitrators to a jury. With greater reason ought it to be done in this case, where the party himself prevented the award, by appointing an arbitrator, who he knew could not, or ought not to act, and knowing, too, that <em>Mercer\u2019s </em>view in obtaining the bond, was to enable him to sell to another.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b399-4\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AXJO\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The question is, whether a Court of Equity, upon the agreement and the facts stated, will compel <em>Hans-borough </em>to convey his land, upon receiving the value thereof, to be ascertained, either by the price which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>Smallwood </em>gave <em>Mercer ; </em>by appointing new valuers, by \u00e1 jury ? It is to be premised that <em>Smallwood </em>is in no better or worse situation than Mercer, since he purchased with notice of the written agreement, without any further information or promise from <em>Hansborough, </em>who is not bound by any mistaken opinion formed of that agreement, either by Smallwood, or by his counsel. He seems to have considered as fixed sundry events then contingent, namely, that the arbitrators would decide the title, and, if in favour of <em>Hans-</em>borough, that they would ascertain the price to be paid for the land, and that <em>Mercer </em>would, in case that price was not discounted by his claim, pay the value, or give bond, with satisfactory security for the same. If all these things had been done, <em>Hansborough </em>would indeed have been compellable in Equity to convey. But <em>Smallwood </em>never could conceive that <em>Hansborough </em>was to convey his land at all events, without even knowing the price he was to receive for it, or without having any satisfactory assurance that he should ever get any thing. Such a conveyance, I believe, no Court of Equity ever compelled a defendant to make.</p>\n<p id=\"Aul\">It was contended by Mr. Marshall, that the <em>sale </em>was not referred to arbitration, but was made by the parties themselves, and that the arbitrators were only to settle the value. It would seem a strange sale, in which such necessary ingredients as price, and the vendor\u2019s right to sell, were in suspense. It would be more properly described by calling it an <em>inchoate </em>contract for a sale, provided the arbitrators determined in in favour of the vendor\u2019s title, fixed the price, and that the other requisites were complied with, none of which were done, and consequently the contract never was completed. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">In -cases of bonds to perform awards, there are two remedies-\u20141st. At Law, upon the bond, in which a plea that the arbitrators made no award, would, if true, defeat the plaintiff\u2019s action. 2d. If any act be awarded to be done, for which a complete remedy cannot be had at Law, such as to \u00a1make a conveyance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>a bill in Equity .'or a specific performance of the award is common and proper. But how the Court can decree the specific performance of the condition of a bond to perform an award, when, in fact, no awax*d has been, or can be made, is not discernible. But the bond is relied upon as containing an agreement, to sell, which agreement is sought to be specifically executed. That agreement, it has been shewn, was only a treaty, never brought to perfection for want of the award. And that this was the effect of the arbitrators refusing to act, seems to have been well understood both by <em>Mercer </em>and <em>Hansborough. </em>The former makes new propositions, which the other declines, and brings his ejectment 5 and <em>Mercer </em>brings his action of covenant, each pursuing his original remedy, as if no agreement had ever subsisted. It is true, if the agreement had been perfect, (since <em>Smcillzoood </em>purchased under it, and both the defendants knew it,) and they had consented to dissolve it, it would have been a fraud upon the plaintiff, against which a Court of Equity would have relieved. But no such ingredient appears, and every thing depends upon the original agreement. That agreement never having been perfected, there is no foundation for the interposition of the Court of Equity, and, therefore, we</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\">Affirm the decree.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b401-4\"> <em>Baker Glass, </em>6 Munf. 212.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
