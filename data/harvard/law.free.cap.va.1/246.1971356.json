That his receipts of money in depreciated paper are reduced by the scale or depreciation, on the day they were received, without any proof that he received it unnecessarily, or delayed paying it away to those who were entitled to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-13\">2d.

An executor is not only compelled to receive the debts of his testator, but is bound to solicit and to enforce the payment of them. For if they should be lost by his neglect in not using the proper means of obtaining payment, he must sustain that loss. In this situation, therefore, it would be unjust to burthen him with the loss by depreciation of money thus forced into his hands, and at a time when perhaps no opportunity offered of applying it. Some reasonable time, then, should be allowed him to dispose of the money before the scale can with justice be applied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-3\">Second exception.\u2014Where the risk mus\u00ed be run by the executor, he is not bound to pay interest. This is laid down in the case of <em>Ratcliff </em>v. Graves, 1 <em>Vern. </em>179; and though, in that case, interest was decreed!; yet it was upon a principle which does not apply in this country; it was, that the money might be insured. So, an executor who changes the nature of a debt due to the testator, becomes liable to himself to pay it, out of his own pocket, 1 <em>Vern. </em>473. An executor is not liable to pay interest, even in <em>England, </em>unless he make a profit by the principal. <em>Newton </em>v. <em>jBennet, </em>1 <em>Bro. C. </em>C. 359. The <em>Chancellor </em>was, therefore, mistaken, (as I humbly conceive,) when he presumed the appellant had made a profit, because the contrary was not shewn. The executor could not, in this case, distribute the money amongst the legatees, who were under age, and who, of course, eould not give him a discharge ; he was, therefore, compelled to retain it, and unless it appeared that he made use of it, nothing can be more unrighteous than to force him to pay interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-5\">It is true, that the appellant stands in the double character of guardian and executor; but as the debts due from his testator were not all discharged, he will be considered as holding the money in his capacity of executor. The interest I consider-as a reasonable compensation for his trouble, upon the same princi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>pie, that he is entitled to the undisposed surplus, unbarred by an express compensation allowed by the testa tor. There is no case to be found, which subjects a guardian to the payment of interest from whence I conclude that he is not liable to pay it: and a guardian and executor appear to stand much in the same situation; for if the former take a bond for rent due to his ward, he is liable to pay it out of his own pocket, and the bond is his own. 2 <em>Cha. Rep. 97.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-6\">The law of this State requires that a guardian should annually return an account of the profits, and of the income, of the ward\u2019s <em>estate, </em>to Court; but this can only mean the real estate, to which the words <em>profits and income </em>are more properly applicable; unless indeed the guardian should lend out the money, in which case, the interest would be income, and to be accounted for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-7\">Third exception'\u2014The legacy given to the executor, is to be considered as a gratuity, independent of his trouble in executing the trust, and not in lieu of his commissions. If he. had refused, he would still have been entitled to the legacy, and having undertaken the trouble, he ought to receive a compensation for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARh\">Fourth exception\u2014The appellant, being an executor, was not thereby rendered incapable of discharging a debt he owed to the estate of his testator, at the time it became due, more especially, as it appears in this case, that the payment was applied to the discharge of a debt due from the testator. If so, he is entitled equally w ith others, to the benefit of the law, respecting payments in paper money.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-9\"><em>Campbell, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-10\">First point\u2014-Nothing can be more just, or reasonable, than that an executor, claiming to be charged on a clay posterior to that on which he received money, or in other words, with less than he received, should. shew some good reason for such a pretension. It is a subject susceptible of proof and of explanation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-11\">If the rule laid down by the <em>Chancellor </em>be rejected, to what other can we resort. The liability of an ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ecuior, if he do not recover his testator\u2019s debts in proper time, can only exist, where there was probable ground to apprehend insolvency, or the like; and in such cases only, can he be charged with such negligence, as to render him personally liable. But at a time, when a depreciated paper money was in circulation, I should not hesitate to consider an executor guilty of malfeasance in his office, who should press for the payment of his testator\u2019s debts, unless under an evident necessity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-4\">Second point\u2014The <em>Chancellor, </em>in the case of <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Bennet, </em>which has been cited, says, that where it does not appear, that the executor applied the money to the purposes of the will, or unless he brings it into Court, he shall be presumed to use it in the way of his trade, and be liable to pay interest for it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">This case is strongly in my favor. If there be debts due from the estate, and carrying interest, and the executor permits that interest to accumulate, when it might be avoided, it is right that he should answer for it out of his own pocket.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-6\">Third point\u2014By the laws of this State, a guardian receiving the estate of a ward, must annually render an account; and he is confined to the <em>profits or other income </em>for the support of the ward, without being permitted to go farther. The word <em>estate, </em>includes <em>money </em>as well as <em>land.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b339-7\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"A0r\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The first objection made to the report is, that the paper money is reduced by the scale of depreciation, on the day it was received by the executor. Upon general principles, such a rule would certainly be improper and unjust; and especially too, when the money was received in a state of rapid depreciation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The executor may not be able to find a creditor, or legatee, to whom he could pay the money, on the day it was received, or the payment might be suspended, in some cases, by disputes amongst creditors for the preference.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>But, in this case, the appellant has neither objected to m\u00b0de originally, nor pointed out any other, the propriety of which might be. considered by the Court on the contrary, his accounts were stated by himself jn the same manner, the debits and credits being reduced by the scale on the day they were received and paid. He ought, therefore, to be bound by this mode, and the <em>Chancellor </em>did right in over-ruling this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"AMo\">The second objection is to the charge of interest, as if the executor were a debtor, or had received or retained the money improperly. It is contended, that such a charge, at the time it was made, is peculiarly unjust, as there were then no borrowers of good credit to be met with ; and that the executor neither did, nor could, derive a profit from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">There are no facts disclosed in the record which can throw light upon this subject. The bill is silent as to interest, and so is the answer, except that part of it, where (speaking of the paper money which he scaled,) he states the injury arising from considerable sums having been on hand, from time to time, lessening every day in their value, without benefit to him, and without an opportunity of paying it away. Thus the question stands upon the face of the accounts. It is true, that there is no general rule which obliges an executor to pay interest. We find from the cases upon this subject, that it has been determined both ways; and, upon principle, it will appear that no general rule can be formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Each case must depend upon its own particular circumstances; in some cases, the executor ought, and, in others, he ought not, to answer interest. In this, we think he ought to be accountable for interest, on the money resting in his hands from time to time. But, for the reasons before stated, in considering the first point, itwould be too rigid and injurious to charge him with interest from the day of each receipt of money. The accounts ought to be closed at the end of <em>each </em>year, and interest allowed upon theJdifferent balances, up to the year 1782, when the whole transae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>lion closed. But such interest ought not to be carried to the account of the succeeding years, in order deduct the same from the payments made in such succeeding years. This, though done in the common eases of debtors, is too strict as to trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">As to the risk stated at the bar, or the difficulty of procuring borrowers, it is an objection which does not come from the executor, nor is it stated by him in his answer, but is mentioned in argument as a possible case. But if it were true, he might have applied to the <em>Chancellor </em>for his direction as to lending it to individuals, or to the public, which would have made him safe; or he might have carried the money into that Court. In this case, there were children whose fortunes were almost entirely pecuniary. It would, therefore, be unjust that the money should lie in the executor\u2019s hands unproductive, so as to deprive the legatees of maintenance, or oblige them to resort to the principal of their legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">If the executor does not settle his accounts every year, he ought at least to strike the balance at the end of every year, that he may see the state of his accounts, and of the funds in his hands. It is upon this principle that we establish the rule before mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In stating this interest, the appellant ought to have credit for the 500/. in 1773, which, by the will, was directed to be lent him without interest, and to be recharged with it in 1778, when the loan was to cease.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">The third objection is made on the score of commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">An executor is certainly entitled to some compensation for his trouble, and that, by custom, is generally fixed at <em>fivq per cent, </em>upon actual receipts. But it is objected that the legacy left to him is a bar of all further compensation. The rule, that a legacy given to an executor defeats his claim to the undisposed <em>residuum, </em>is assimilated to the point under consideration. But that principle seems to be much mistaken in the application made of it. It is .unnecessary for us to give an opinion upon that point, as, in this case, there is no surplus; yet it may be observed, that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>there were such a <em>residuum, </em>the legacy would be no bar, as there were several executors, to all of whom unequal legacies are given, and so this Court decided in the case of <em>Shelton v. Shelton. </em>The present question therefore, like all others of this nature, depends (as to the amount to be allowed,) upon the custom, and the intention of the testator. He clearly meant to allow an adequate compensation. To one executor, he gives 250/.', and lest that should be an insufficient recompense for his trouble, he authorises, the other executors to increase it, if necessary. In the codicil, he gives the appellant (who is not named an executor in the will itself,) a legacy, <em>as being his </em>nephew, and to this, he would have been entitled, though he had refused the office. It would seem, as if the testator did not at first mean to make him an executof, by his directing <em>his </em>executors, to lend him 500/ without interest. So that it is evident, he never intended the legacy as a compensation for his services, but merely as a bounty. The appellant therefore, ought to have credit, for.five <em>per cent, </em>commission on his receipts of each year, before the accounts are closed, in order to adjust the interest as before mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">As to the fourth point, the Court entertain some doubt, whether the 500/. ought to be charged to the appellant at all, or not?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">In the exceptions, it is stated as a debt due from the appellant, to the testator, and paid in. 1778,\u2014in his account, he gives credit in <em>October </em>1111, for this sum, as due in 1778, and reduces it by the scale of <em>October </em>1777. He is charged with it by the Commissioners, in 1778, as cash, had five years, without int\u00e9rest, and then due; in which case, he ought not to be charged with it, unless he received it in other money, than what came to his hands by collection, with the whole of which, he seems to be charged in the account. This fact therefore, must be ascertained in the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">If it appear, that he is so charged, the credit in his account (as executor,) in <em>October </em>1777, ought to be considered as a payment on that day, in paper, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>reduced by the scale accordingly; for a debtor, by undertaking the office of an executor, cannot be ed from exercising, in common with others, the right of paying in paper money a debt due to the testator. And as no better proof can be expected, the entry in his account, will be evidence of the <em>time </em>of payment, and from that time, he bound his securities to be answerable for the application of the</p>\n<p id=\"Aez\">The decree therefore must be costs, and the cause remanded to the High Court of Chancery for the enquiry to be made, and for an account to be taken, according tothe principles of this decree.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b343-5\"> <em>Taliaferro </em>v. <em>Minor, </em>2 Call. 190. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Beverleys, </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 415. <em>White's Ex. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>2 Munf, 285. <em>Sheppard's Ex. </em>v. <em>Starke et. ux. 3 </em>Munf. 29. 40. <em>Cavendish </em>v. <em>Fleming.
