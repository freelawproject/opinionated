Upon the return of a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum, </em>\u201cnot found,\u201d a <em>scire facias </em>issued against Cooke, on the 18th of <em>May </em>following, who pleaded in bar, that on the <em>2d </em>of <em>November, </em>1784, he rendered the body of the said <em>Willis </em>to the jail of the County of Frederick, (where the writ was served) according to the Act of Assembly, in that case made and provided, and took a receipt for the body of the said <em>Willis, </em>from the Sheriff, in the following words : viz. received, &amp;c. <em>and this </em>Is'c.\u2014To this plea the plaintiff demurred specially, stating for cause, first, that the defendant doth not set forth in his plea, that he returned the receipt <em>forthwith </em>to the Clerk of the Court, where the suit was depending: secondly, because the defendant, in his plea, neither tenders an issue to the country, nor offers to verify his plea by the record. The County Court gave judgment for the plaintiff upon the demurrer. The defendant then moved to amend his plea, on payment of costs, by inserting these words : \u201c That he <em>forthwith lodged the receip t </em>with the Clerk of the Court, agreeably to the Act of Assembly, in that case made and provided, and this he is ready to verify,\u201d which motion was over-ruled by the Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>He then moved to have leave to put in a new plea, which was likewise over-ruled. In the record is a certificate of the Clerk of <em>Frederick </em>Court, that the receipt mentioned in the plea was filed in his office on the 6th <em>o\u00ed May, </em>1785.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-11\">Upon an appeal to the District Court, the judgment of the County Court was affirmed, from which the defendant appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-12\">' <em>Marshall, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-13\">The judgment against Willis, was entered up in <em>April </em>1785, and the <em>scire facias </em>issued in <em>May </em>of the same year. The surrender of the principal was in <em>November </em>1784, and the receipt appears-, from the record to have been lodged with the Clerk on the 6th of <em>May, </em>1785. The first question is, whether the appellant was discharged, though the receipt was not lodged immediately with the Clerk ? And this will depend upon the construction of the Act of Assembly, 5th <em>Geo. III. </em>c. 6. Upon the literal construction of the Act, it is evident, that if the Sheriff refuse to give the receipt, or if the receipt be not returned to the Clerk, still the bail is discharged. The latter part of the 4th section, which says, \u201c that the receipt shall be by the bail forthwith delivered to the Clerk of the .Court where the suit is depending/7 is merely <em>directory </em>to the bail, who is discharged by the Act of surrendering the principal, though he should fail to return the receipt. But \" if there be a doubt upon this clause, it is completely explained, and removed, by the 5th section, which speaks of the right of a special bail to dischar ge himself by <em>surrendering the principal, </em>without qualifying that right by any condition whatever. The words are, \u201c that where the special bail, in any action or suit, where judgment hath been, or shall be given, are or shall be entitled to discharge themselves by surrendering the principal, it shall and may be lawful for such bail to make such surrender, either before the Court where judgment was obtained, or to the Sheriff of the County, where the original writ in such suit was returned, <em>and thereupon the bail </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>shall be </em>discharged.\u201d So that the bail Is discharged <em>upon the surrender.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-3\">If I am right in giving to the Act its literal exposition, I feel great confidence in saying, that it is founded upon good reason. For it would be strange, if the Sheriff, by refusing to give the receipt, should prevent the bail from relieving himself. If then the returning of the receipt <em>forthwith </em>is not a prerequisite to the bail\u2019s discharge, it was unnecessary to aver it in the declaration. But if I am wrong in my construction of the law, I then contend, that the Court should have permitted the defendant to amend his plea. He cited 1 <em>Burr. </em>317. 322. I admit that the Court possesses a discretionary power in allowing amendments, but this is a legal discretion, and if it be improperly exercised, a superior Court will correct their judgment in this respect. It is to advance the justice of the case, that the defendant should be permitted to try the cause upon its merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-4\">As to the second cause of demurrer, I answer, that the <em>et </em>cestera, is tantamount to the tendering of an issue, for it will be construed to supply what the defendant ought to have added\u2014the case of <em>Sayer </em>v. <em>Pocock, </em>Co<em>wp. Rep. </em>407, is a strong authority as to this point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-5\">Wickham, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">There is an essential difference in reason between a surrender before, and <em>after </em>judgment. In the first case, the Sheriff is not authorised to keep the body a moment after the judgment is rendered, unless the plaintiff pray him in custody. But, in the latter case, the Sheriff is to keep the body in the same manner, as he must have done, if he had been prayed in custody in the former case. This distinction will enable us, the more clearly, to give the law in question its true exposition. It is to be observed, that the fourth section relates to a surrender <em>before </em>judgment, the fifth and sixth sections to a surrender <em>after. </em>If it be before judgmentj and made <em>in Court, </em>nothing farther is necessary for the bail to do ; for this reason, because the plaintiff, who is supposed to be always in Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>having notice of the surrender, may, if he choose, pray . the principal in custody, and, therefore, he cannot suffer but from his own neglect. But if the surrender be <em>before </em>judgment, and to the Sheriff <em>out of Court ; </em>as the plaintiff is not presumed to have notice of what is done <em>in </em>pais, it is reasonable, and, by this law, it is made an essential part of the duty of the bail, as a <em>condition </em>of his discharge, that he <em>forthwith return the receipt to the Clerks </em>that the plaintiff may have notice of it, so as to pray the principal in custody. So much for the fourth section. But if the surrender be made <em>after </em>judgment, then the 5th section does not require a receipt to be returned, for this reason\u2014because, by the sixth clause, the Sheriff is directed in such case to keep the principal in his custody, in the same manner, and subject to the like rules, as are provided for debtors committed in execution, during the space of twenty days, &amp;c. This, which I conceive to be the fair and liberal construction of the law, seems to be strongly supported by the reason and justice of the case. For were it otherwise, the Sheriff and the debtor might, by collusion, defeat the plaintiff of his security by a surrender made out of Court, and by keeping out of sight that sort of notice, which is required by the law to be given him, and which, if given, would enable him to claim the body of the principal. Nay, this might happen without collusion. For the Sheriff not being bound to give the creditor notice of the surrender, the creditor would most frequently be ignorant of the fact till judgment was given, and the body discharged. It has been argued as a hardship on the other side, that the Sheriff might refuse to give a receipt. To this I answer, 1st. That the Sheriff, in such case, would be liable to the bail; and, 2dly. The bail might avail himself of such refusal by pleading it, and would be excused ; for it is a rule, thaf if an officer be bound,' and is required, to do a particular act, his refusal shall not place the party, for whose benefit it was to be done, in a worse situation, than if he had done it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-9\">As to the second objection, the case relied upon from <em>Cowper </em>is not apposite to the present in any re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>spect The omission there was of words merely for\u00bb mal, and the question ivas made after a <em>trial </em>and verdiet. The defect in this case is in a substantial part of the plea, and is specially demurred to. So that the Statute of Jeofails, which might cure a great deal after verdict, cannot help even formal defects, if stated as cause of demurrer. But it is contended that the <em>et ecetera </em>must necessarily mean \u201c and this he is ready to verify.\u201d But may it not as well mean a conclusion to the country ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-3\">As to the amendment\u2014The motion was made after demurrer, argument, and judgment thereon. I admit, that the discretion of the Court, in allowing amendments, is a legal one, and subject to the correction of a Superior Court, if improperly exercised. Yet I ask, will this Court permit an amendment against the justice of the case. If the defendant in this case could claim it upon Mr. <em>Marshall\u2019s </em>principle, namely, that the cause might be tried upon its merits, then it might be always claimed as of right; and if so, a defendant who wished for delay, would always put in a frivolous plea, so as to force the plaintiff to demur, and, after taking that chance, claim the privilege of amending. If it be quite indifferent whether the justice of the case favoured the amendment asked for, (the reverse of which I think appears in the record,) this Court will presume that the Inferior Court did right, unless the party seeking to impeach their judgment had stated enough upon the record to destroy this presumption. Besides, will this Court do a vain thing? For, if I am right upon the first point, what good purpose could it answer to allow the amendment, since, by correcting the plea, according to the facts appearing in the record, the defendant could not succeed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-6\">Marshall, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxUW\">The 4th section of the law relates to surrenders both before and after judgment. Mr. <em>Wickham </em>contends for his exposition of the law, because otherwise the creditor might be entirely defeated of his security, by not having it in his power to pray the principal in custody.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-8\">But if I can shew, that even <em>his </em>construction would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>not in every instance remedy the supposed inconve-* , nience, then there can be no necessity for giving the law that construction. Now it is to be recollected, that when that law was made, there was a General Court in <em>Virginia, </em>embracing the whole State within its jurisdiction. Of course, the surrender might be made in some remote county, far distant' from the Court, a day or two before the judgment was rendered. So that it would be impossible to return the receipt in time for the plaintiff to pray the principal in custody. In this case, therefore, the supposed inconvenience, which it is contended was meant to be prevented, \u25a0 would happen, even upon Mr. <em>Wickham\u2019s </em>construction; and, since it <em>is </em>not presumable that the Legislature would attempt a vain thing, so it is not to be supposed they meant it. The sixth section supposes that the creditor will in twenty days obtain notice of what is doing in <em>pais, </em>and therefore compels him to do so, under pain of losing his security. And why may he not also get notice by the same means, where the surrender is made before judgment ? As to collusion, this may as well happen between the Sheriff and the creditor, to prevent the surrender, as between the Sheriff and the principal, or bail, in order to deprive the creditor of his security. So that we must at last resort to the literal meaning of the words, which seems plainly with the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-9\">This plea, if wrong, was most probably entered by the Clerk, and is his mistake 5 for there appears in the record a letter from the defendant\u2019s attorney to the Clerk, desiring him to plead a surrender generally, and the formal defect arises from his want of skill, and therefore ought to be amended.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b430-10\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AiD\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The question upon the first point, depends upon the law, which has been so fully commented upon at the bar; and is this\u2014whether the special bail be discharged by the surrender to the Sheriff, without his also <em>returning, forthivith to the Clerk, </em>the receipt ob\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Sained from the Sheriff. The 4th section of the law upon which this question rests, points out two of surrender; the first in Court, upon which the bail is discharged, whether the directory part of the clause (which says that the defendant shall be committed to the custody of the Sheriff) be complied with or not. The other alternative is, \u201c that such special bail may discharge themselves, by surrendering the principal to the Sheriff of the county where the original writ was served.\u201d The discharge of the bail therefore is complete by the surrender, and the following parts of the clause are <em>directory </em>only, and do not impose a condition, the non-compliance with which can prevent the discharge. This appears the stronger, since it begins with a direction <em>to the Sheriff </em>what he is to do with the prisoner, and then goes on to direct what the bail shall do with the receipt. And this construction is farther enforced by a view of the fifth and sixth sections, respecting surrenders after judgment. The fifth, makes no distinction between a surrender in Court, and a surrender to the Sheriff out of Court, as to the discharge of the bail. The sixth, without taking notice of the discharge of the bail, proceeds to direct what shall be done in the case of a surrender in the country. The Sheriff is to keep the prisoner in custody for twenty days; and the bail is to give immediate notice to the creditor. So that in both cases of a surrender in the country, either before or after judgment, the discharge of the bail is complete, and the plaintiff has a new remedy, if the directory part be not complied with, either against the Sheriff, if he fail in his duty, or against the bail, if he neglect to do what the law requires of him. The difference in these remedies is important; since in an action founded upon the directory part, the Sheriff or bail would be let in to shew a reasonable excuse for not complying with the law, or to shew that no damage thereby arose to the creditor. But they might be precluded from these advantages upon the <em>scire </em>facias, if the bail were considered as not being discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The Court have given their opinion upon this point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>for the satisfaction of the parties, and as it may prevent further litigation. As to the second cause of demurrer, we think that the plea is insufficient for want of a proper conclusion. An <em>et cestera </em>may be allowed to supply what must necessarily be inferred from what is expressed. But in this plea the words inserted will equally admit of a conclusion to the Court or jury, and therefore the Court cannot supply the words omitted, by any necessary implication; besides this defect is specially demurred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-12\">But the Court are clearly of opinion that the defen\u00bb dant ought to have been permitted to amend his plea, upon payment of costs: and upon this point, the judgment is to be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to admit such amendment. The parties will consider whether it be worth their while to prosecute the suit farther, after the decision of the Court upon the first point, in which the Judges are unanimous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
