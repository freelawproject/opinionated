The consideration of the promise made by <em>B. </em>is both legal and sufficient to support an action against him upon his promise of indemnity.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-5\">This was an appeal from a judgment of the District Court of Charlottesville, injan action upon the case brought by the appellee. The declaration stated, that <em>John </em>Carr, deceased, by his will, directed his executors, (of whom the defendant was one,) to sell a tract of land, the property of the testator ; that the plaintiff was employed by the executors to cry this tract of land at public auction, when the same, was purchased by a certain <em>John </em>Moore, who was the highest bidder. That <em>Nathaniel </em>Anderson, one of the executors, complained of the sale as being unfairly made, and con-, trary to the directions of the executors, and insisted that the land should be again set up for sale. That the defendant objected to this, and promised that if the plaintiff would not cry it again, but would confirm the sale so made, he would indemnify and save him harmless from all actions or demands which might be brought against him on account of the sale made to Moore; that the plaintiff in consideration of this promise did forbear to cry the land again, and did confirm the sale. The breach is, that the defendant, not regarding his said promise, did cause and permit an action to be brought against him, in his name and that of the other executors, for and on account of the sale so made to the said Moore, and did cause and permit a judgment to be obtained against him for 140/.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b355-6\">Upon the plea of non-assumpsit, the plaintiff got a verdict. The defendant moved in arrest of judgment, but was over-ruled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ApJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Washington, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ana\">There is either no consideration at all laid in the declaration, or, if there be, it is an illegal one. 1st. There is none laid. After the appellee had struck off the land to <em>Moore, </em>his power over the subject ceased. He had no longer an authority to vacate the purchase, and again expose the land to sale, or to confirm what had been done. If the transaction was fair and legal, nothing remained to consummate it, but for the executors to convey. If it was unfair, or illegal, they alone could confirm or sell again. A promise, then, made in consideration of the auctioneer\u2019s <em>not </em>doing ryhat he could not legally have done, was entirely vain, and had no necessary cause to induce it. As little so, as a promise to pay money to <em>B. </em>in consideration that he will not sell the land of C., which would undoubtedly be a <em>nudum pactum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-5\">But if there be a consideration, then 2dly, it was illegal, and consequently insufficient to maintain an assumpsit. The defendant undertakes, that if the plaintiff will confirm an unfair and <em>illegal </em>sale, he will save him harmless for so doing. When the foundation of an agreement is fraud, immorality, or any thing against law, a Court of Justice will not be made the instrument of enforcing the performance of it. The plaintiff himself states the consideration of the defendant\u2019s assumpsit to be bottomed upon a fraud.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-6\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b356-7\">Wherever a consideration, which is the foundation of a promise, produces benefit to the one party, or injury to the other, it is sufficient to support an assumpsit. The defendant requests the plaintiff not to do a certain act, and promises to save him harmless from the consequences of his compliance. The plaintiff is induced by this promise to gratify the wishes of the defendant, which afterwards subjects him to the payment of damages. Can it be seriously urged that, in such a case, there is no consideration for the promise? If the case require further aid, let it be observed, that the person bound to indemnify, is the very person who assists in producing the injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Tlie second point appears to be s\u00ed\u00fc\u00ed more destitute of foundation. The principle laid down, that a sideration illegal or immoral will not sustain an assumpsit, is unquestionably true. Bui I cannot discera the application of it to this case. It does not appear that the plaintiff had done an unfair or Illegal act. One of tlie executors supposes so, and insists upon a re-sale. The other executor thinks otherwise, and wishes to confirm it. It is a mere contest between them, each wishing to prevail, ansi the one promises to indemnify a tlrnd person employed by them to do a certain act, if he will obey his directions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b357-5\">Lyons J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHa6\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The principle laid doivn at the bar by the appellant\u2019s counsel, as to the validity of a consideration, is certainly correct A promise to pay money in consideration of another* doing an immoral or illegal act, would clearly be insufficient to suppoit an action. But the present case is not chargeable with any such objection. The appellee was employed by all the executors to perform the duties of a cryer, in the selling of a tract of land. la that capacity, he struck it oft to the highest bidder, as lie was bound to do. The sale, for any thing that <em>w </em>e can know from this record, was fair and legal. But one of the executors thinking otherwise, desired a re-sale, which- was successfully opposed by the appellant, in consequence of his promise to indemnify the cryer against all actions or demands on that account Yet this very executor causes, or permits, .an action to be commenced against the person he was bound to protect, and recover:- damages. If there be fraud any where, it is properly chargeable to the appellant, Suppose a man Is arrested at the suit of two executors, one of whom directs the officer to discharge the defendant, which is opposed by the otherthe orders of the former are obeyed, in consequence of a promise to indemnify and save the Sheriff harmless;\u2014-yet this very executor unites with the other in an action against the Sheriff, and damages are recovered against him: can there be a doubt but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>the Sheriff might well maintain an action upon this promise? It is difficult to conceive-upon what principle the executors could recover damages from the cryer in the present case. As to the purchaser, he being the highest bidder, was most clearly entitled to the land, if he were not privy to a fraud, or apprised of a deviation in the cryer from the orders of those who employed him. In such a case, the cryer might certainly be subjected to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">But whether the judgment against the appellee was a righteous one or not, cannot be a question in the present action: he has sustained an injury in consequence of an act performed at the request of the appellant, against which the appellant promised to indemnify him.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We think there is no difficulty in the caste, and affirm the judgment<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\"> <em>Scott\u2019s Ex. </em>v. <em>Osborne\u2019s Ex. </em>2 Munf. 413.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
