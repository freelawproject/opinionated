The evidence of this promise was the deposition of the widow of Mr. <em>Bannister, </em>who proved that her husband, in different conversations with her previous to the marriage, had declared his intention once to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>have been to give his daughter 1000/. But upon a occasion, and previous also to the marriage, he told her, his embarrassments would oblige him to substitute 500 acres of land on <em>Hatcher*s-run, </em>in lieu of money. Also a letter from <em>Bannister, </em>addressed to his daughter, after marriage, in substance as follows, viz. \u201c I mean to give my daughter in lieu of 1000/. her intended portion, and I do hereby give to my said daughter and her heirs, 500 acres of my <em>Hatchers-run </em>tract, and five slaves, as her dowry in marriage, subject to her husband\u2019s legal claim, whose unconditional right thereto is plain. And if I should be prevented from executing a conveyance to this effect, this shall stand as one\u2014as witness my hand and seal.\u201d To this paper a seal was annexed. This letter was sent to <em>Shore, </em>and in his bill, he acknowledges that he received, and retained it, without any act proving his dissent; but says, that he did not mean to assent to it, supposing that there would be time enough after-wards to shew his disapprobation. One of the defendants in his answer states, that previous to the marriage, he informed the appellee, at the request of <em>Bannister, </em>that he intended to give his daughter land instead of money, with which the appellee seemed well satisfied\u2014another witness proved, that he had seen <em>Bannister </em>and the appellee, upon the land mentioned in the above letter, searching out a fit place, whereon to erect buildings. <em>Shore </em>had a child by his wife, after which, the wife, and then the child died. After this, <em>Bannister </em>conveyed the land before mentioned, to his son <em>John, </em>but upon what consideration, does not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">The Chancellor decreed the 1000/. to the plaintiff, from which the executors appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-7\"><em>Wickham, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-8\">If <em>Shore </em>be entitled to the 1000/. his remedy is entirely a legal one, and he might have recovered in an action upon the case. If so, a solid objection will lie to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-9\">Upon the substantial merits of the case, there seems to be but little difficulty.\u2014Because a father, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>particular situation of his estate, may at one time intend to give a certain portion to a child, will it be contended that he is afterwards bound to pursue that intention, whatever changes may take place in his fortune, and however inconvenient it may prove to him? Surely it cannot\u2014besides, this <em>intention, </em>if it can be called a <em>promise </em>in the present case, is merely an intended testamentary disposition, which is at any time revocable. The answer states, that Mr. <em>Shore </em>was informed of this alteration of Mr. <em>Bannister\u2019s </em>intention, before his marriage, and was satisfied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-4\">This fact is completely established by the retention of the letter or deed, without dissenting from the terms contained in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">He ought not, after circumstances are altered, to be permitted to say, that he did not <em>assent </em>to those terms, or to complain of being deceived by them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">If then, <em>Shore </em>has no title to the money, the next question is, whether he can have any to the land?</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-7\">The letter from Bannister, though it may not have all the forms, most certainly contains the substantial parts of a deed. It is signed, sealed, and delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-8\">\u25a0\u2014Of course, the daughter was entitled to an immediate seisin in fee, in the land, and the husband to the enjoyment of it during her life, and of his own also, as tenant by the curtesy, in consequence of the after birth of a child. But <em>Shore, </em>not having obtained a seisin in <em>fact, </em>during the life of his wife, is not entitled to his curtesy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-9\">But if he be entitled to his curtesy, still the objec- \u2018 tion first made occurs, which is, that he has an ade-</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-10\">quate remedy at law to recover the possession and damages. Upon every principle, therefore, it would seem that the decree for 1000/. is erroneous\u2014since, if <em>Shore </em>has any title whatever, it can only be to the land, or its value, for his life; to ascertain which, an issue ought to have been directed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b241-11\"><em>Ronolu </em>and <em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-12\">The objection made to the jurisdiction of the Court is now too late, after answer filed, and no plea in abatement, or demurrer put in. See the Act of 1787, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>c. 9. Besides, this Court has concurrent jurisdic** tion with the Law Courts in cases of marriage agreements. 1 <em>Vern. </em>110.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHE\">As to the merits: After the father hath declared an intention to give his child a certain marriage portion, in consequence of which a third person is induced to make his addresses, and thus to engage his affections, it would be monstrous if the father could change, or diminish that portion, by any subsequent secret declaration. 2 <em>Vern. </em>499. 764. The declaration, therefore, of Mr. <em>Bannister </em>to his daughter, is an underhand agreement, and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4o\">The proof of Mr. <em>Bannister3s </em>promise to give 1000/-could not have been more complete, unless Mr,</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEf\"><em>Shore </em>had demanded it in writing; an indelicacy, which the law did not require him to commit. As to a supposed waver of the money portion, in consequence of his assent first given, and his subsequent acquiescence, the first is not proved, and the second is the result of a false deduction from the fact. The answer of one of the defendants, which states the assent of Shore, is not evidence of the fact, because not responsive in any allegation in the bill. And if it were, yet Mr. <em>Shore </em>may have conceived that he was to enjoy the same interest in the land which he would have had to the money ; else, it is not probable that he would have given up 1000/. for a <em>life </em>estate in land, which was worth no more <em>in fee. </em>His conduct in retaining the deed, can furnish no presumption of acquiescence, since there was no necessity for expressing his dissent from the terms of it, until the promised conveyance was <em>tendered </em>to him. Besides, the contract contained in that letter, was made with the daughter, at that time a married'woman, and was, therefore, void; it could not operate to deprive the husband of an antecedent vested right-\u2014a right which cannot be considered as surrendered, but for a real, valuable consideration. But admit that <em>Bannister </em>had an election to substitute land in the place of money; yet having deprived himself of the power to do the one, he shall be compelled to perform the other.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>Wickham, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">It is true, that in EnglandCourts of Equity exercise a jurisdiction in cases of marriage promises, because they can, and always do, compel the husband to make a suitable settlement thereout upon his wife. But this is never done in this country. The Act of 1787, which has been relied upon, can only apply to cases not strictly within the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery, as to the <em>person </em>or <em>property. </em>But, surely, this Court may dismiss a bill for the want of that equity, which can alone entitle it to jurisdiction, although no plea in abatement is put in. If the construction contended for be right, then it will follow, that the Courts of Law may, by the combination of the parties, be entirely ousted of their jurisdiction, and every subject of controversy may be transferred to, and decided in Chancery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">I do not contend that the express promise of a father to give a certain portion to the person who shall marry his daughter, is not obligatory upon him ; but 1 insist, that it would be mischievous in the extreme, if general declarations of his intentions, and more especially those made (as in the present case,) in the bosom of his family, should bind him, whatever inconveniences might result from it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b243-7\">The President,</author>\n<p id=\"A8n\">after stating the case, and observing that the Clerk had certified that the infant child of <em>John </em>Bannister, the son, had been made a defendant, though no process was prayed against him, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">There is no evidence in the cause that the appellee ivas ever entitled to any thing, except the paper referred to in the bill, addressed by Mr. <em>Bannister </em>to his daughter. This was received by the appellee, and retained by him, without any evidence of his dissent from the terms of it. Independent of this tacit acquiescence, it is in proof that Mr. <em>Bannister </em>and the appellee went to view the land spoken of in that letter, and that the former, in the presence of the latter, informed the witness that they had been to examine it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>for the purpose of fixing upon a proper situation for a house.</p>\n<p id=\"AIp\">The executor, in his answer, states, that he was sent <em>Bannister </em>to inform the appellee of his intention to give his daughter land, with which the appellee appeared well satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahqk\">But, independent of this, there is no proof at all whereon the claim of the appellee can be founded. Mr. <em>Bannister\u2019s </em>public declarations are relied upon. These are denied by the executors. But whether this denial be evidence or not, is of little consequence, because that which is relied upon to sustain the claim, falls very short of its object. What is it ? A private, confidential, domestic conversation between a husband and his wife, wherein the former speaks of an <em>intention once </em>formed, and then, for influential reasons, altered. And because it was once formed, it is supposed to be irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The claim, if at all founded, is merely \u00e1 legal one ; and if a suit at law should be brought for the land, it may then be discussed with propriety, whether any act of the appellee amounted to such a seisin, as to secure his right to be tenant by the curtesy.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">It was objected, that the conveyance of the land to <em>John Bannister </em>the son, put it out of the power of the father to perform his engagement respecting it. But the fact is, that'by the death of Mrs. Shore, and of her child, in 1784, the land descended to <em>John </em>Bannister, the brother, as her heir at law, to whom it was after-wards conveyed by the father.\u2014But this deed does not appear in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">The decree therefore must be reversed, and the bill dismissed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">* (1) <em>\u00bfMorris\u2019 JEx. </em>v. <em>The </em>Auditor, <em>JBeaseley </em>v. <em>Owen, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 235. 45S, <em>Wilson et, </em>al. v. <em>Sutler, </em>3 Munf. 559.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
