There was a verdict for the defendant, given under instructions by the court, and exceptions filed, which shewed the following case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-12\">In March 1808, Milly the mother of the plaintiff, together with Naise her husband, applied for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>in Gallia county, Ohio, to bo delivered from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>custody of John Rodgers, who claimed them as slaves. The writ was granted ; and upon a hearing of parties and witnesses at a subsequent day, the judgment of the court was, that Milly and Naise \u00abgo hence, be discharged, and set at liberty.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">Edward Tupper a witness proves, that the day after this discharge, Rodgers came to him, and requested him to prevail on Milly to live with him as an indented servant for two years; that, if she would agree to do so, he would execute to her a complete deed of manumission, which should put the question of her liberty at rest; for now, he might possibly reverse the. judgment on the <em>habeas corpus. </em>Agreeably to this request, the witness obtained the consent of Milly and Naise to indent themselves for two years, on R\u2019s first making the deed of manumission, which is spread on the record. The witness examined the deed, before Naise and Milly executed the indenture for two years service.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-6\">Bithia Tupper, a witness, heard R. say, he would execute the deed of absolute manumission, if Milly and N. would agree to serve him two years <em>; </em>that, he always intended to emancipate Milly at his death, and had so provided by his will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-7\">The deed of absolute manumission was executed in Gallia county, Ohio, on the 2d April, 1808, John Rodgers styling himself in it, a citizen of Virginia. It is attested by two witnesses. F. Le Clercq, one of them, deposes, that he heard R. acknowledge the execution of the deed, and that it was his voluntary act, and deed, at the time of signing, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-8\">Rodgers moreover acknowledged the execution of the deed before Brewster Higley one of the associate judges of Gallia county, which the judge certifies. The recorder of the county certifies the same acknowledgment. The clerk of the county certifies, that this recorder is the actual recorder, and that full faith is due to his certificate : and the President of the Court of Common Pleas of the county certifies, that this clerk is the actual clerk, &amp;c\u201e</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>On the trial, the admissibility of this deed as evidence was objected to :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AgO\">1.

If offered as valid under the laws of Ohio, it cannot be received $ for, there is no law of Ohio preset ibing the mode of emancipation. The constitution of Ohio, declaring there shall be neither slavery, nor involuntary servitude, is spread upon the record. The court rejected the deed thus offered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">One of the witnesses also proved, that Milly was seen working at a sugar camp in Ohio on a Sunday, while her residence was in Virginia.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-9\">On this case, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel moved the court to instruct the jury :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-10\">1. That, if they believed Rodgers employed Milly to work for him in Ohio, in any business not merely transitory, before the plaintilf\u2019s birth, they should find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-11\">2.

That it was conclusive of the said right, if the jury should be of opinion it was rendered on the ground of Milly\u2019s having been made to work for R. in Ohio <em>\u2022, </em>or of having been sent there in violation of the laws of that state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-13\">4.

There was consequently judgment for the defendant on the verdict, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-8\"><em>Gilmer, </em>who at the request of the court argued the case for the appellant, took the following points :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-9\">Not contending that the discharge of Milly under the <em>habeas corpus, </em>was conclusive of her right to freedom, he said, that the fact of her having been so discharged in a state where all involuntary servitude was forbidden, together with the circumstance of Rodgers having treated with her as a free person, was at least presumptive evidence of her right to freedom at the time: That the deed of emancipation executed by Rodgers in Ohio, where there is no slavery, to a person discharged from his custody as free, purporting to confirm such right to freedom, ought to have, been received in evidence. It ought to have been received, because its execution is proved by a deposition regularly taken in the cause; the deposition too of a subscribing witness, the proper testimony in all such contracts. He did not contend, that it was admissible as a certified deed, because the certificates were not in conformity with the Act of Congress : Nor did he insist that it would have been admissible, if executed in Virginia, without strictly complying with the provisions of the statute of the state regulating the mode of emancipation. <em>Givens </em>vs. <em>Mann,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was a <em>complete authority </em>on this point, he conceded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b30-10\">His view of the case, he alledged, freed it at once from all these objections, and would not at all violate the spirit of the rigorous statutes on the subject of emancipation. Since Lewis, even if entitled to freedom, was subject to be removed from the state by the act. 1 Rev. Code, p. 437, \u00a7 64. And the policy of the act being to prevent the increase of negroes, free or bond within the state, to declare Lewis free, and have him transported, would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>'more in obedience to the policy of the statute, than to condemn him as a slave, and suffer him to remain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ4\">The court, however, will not perhaps be at liberty to go into considerations of state policy, farther than they are forced upon it, by the obvious intent of the act. And he said, that the legislature of Virginia had never declared its will on the subject of emancipation of slavesrwhether by citizens or others, in cases in which such emancipation was complete and perfect by what is done between the parties abroad. Such cases can no more be subjected to the control of the local legislation of Virginia by the general principles of law, than any other case of contract. Here is a contract executed in Ohio, and a right is asserted under it in Virginia; the question then arises, whether the contract is to be expounded by the laws of Ohio where it was made, or those of Virginia, whose courts are asked to enforce it. The cases in the English authorities are numerous to shew, that contracts entered into between British subjects in foreign countries, intended to be executed abroad, will be interpreted neither by the law of the country of the domicile of the parties, nor of that whose tribunals are asked to coerce the <em>fulfilment; </em>but that the <em>lex loci contractus </em>will govern. On this principle, Indian interest is allowed on contracts entered into and intended to be executed in India. This principle is familiar, and need not to be insisted <em>on.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The common law has, in this, adopted the principle of the civil law, <em>contraxisse unusquisque in eo loco intelligitur, in quo ut </em>solve<em>ret se obligavit.</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And where no place is specially assigned for the execution of the contract, the place of its date must be intended to be that in which it is to be executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-6\">In the case before us, the contract was made in Ohio, and if the law of Ohio govern its interpretation, the con-: tract, is valid; for by the laws of that state, all involun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>serv*tl,^e prohibited, and consequently, no statute was required to give the right, or prescribe the mode of emancipation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_7\">Though it be true, that the <em>lex loci contractus </em>will govern the interpretation of contracts, it is equally so, that a contract made in one place, but by express stipulation to be executed in another specified place, must be controlled by the laws of the latter, as is shewn by the passage quoted from the civil law. But it will be observed, that the deed of emancipation was complete and perfect on its execution : it had nothing farther in prospect; and consequently the indenture for two year\u2019s service, which was the consideration in part on which the. deed of emancipation was executed, cannot control this last mentioned deed, so as to make <em>it </em>also have relation to Virginia, as the place of its execution : it can no more control it, than an agreement to pay a sum of money in Virginia in consideration of the manumission would make such deed have reference to the laws of Virginia as the place of its execution. In this case, the consideration is already passed. To give such an interpretation, wpuld in this case convert the deed of emancipation into a naked instrument of fraud by Rodgers ; a mere device for decoying into Virginia a person, who in Ohio had been declared to be free, and with whom he treated as a free person. The deed of emancipation, too, was a valid deed between the parties without any consideration at all: Rodgers and all claiming under him are estopped from denying its validity ; much more, then, ought he be prevented from setting up his own fraud to vitiate his own act, done freely and voluntarily.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">To say, that a deed made abroad under such circumtances is void, is to assert, that no native Virginian can, in any country on earth, emancipate a slave in such country, so as to entitle him to freedom in Virginia ; except by a literal compliance with the statute of Virginia: which would be contrary to every general principle of law ; and there is nothing in the statute on this subject to disfin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>armsli it from other cases. The deed then ought to have \u00b0 \u00b0 been admitted as a contract, or voluntary gift, on the proof of its execution, as any other contract would have been ; and being admitted, it is conclusive against Itodgers and all claiming under him : the judgment ought then for this reason to be reversed. Be declined to press the other points, thinking this the principal question on the merits.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b27-13\">The reporter is indebted for the report of this case, to the gentleman who argued it, Jt was argued before the appointment of the present reporter\u00bb</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b30-11\"> 6 Munf. 191.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b31-7\"><em> </em>1 Bos. and P. 138. 2 Bos, and P. 263. 1 Ba. alr. 331.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\"> 44 Dig. ti, <em>7. </em>1. 81.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b33-5\">Judge Roane,</author>\n<p id=\"AuD\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The court is of opinion, that there is no error in the opinions of the Superior Court, impeached by the 2d and 3d exceptions. The reasons in support of those opinions, are so clear and self-evident, that they need not he adverted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Nor is there any error in <em>the </em>other opinions of that court, objected to by the appellant, and which go to the merits of his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">The appellant claims his right to freedom, on three grounds: 1st, on the right to freedom alleged to have been acquired by bis mother, prior to his birth, by having sojourned within the state of Ohio, and as is further alleged, been there employed by her master: 2dly, on the ground that her right to freedom was, prior to his birth, established by the judgment on the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>stated in the record;\u2014and Sdly, he claims it under the deed of emancipation contained in the proceedings; and which was also executed prior to the birth of the appellant. It is readily conceded, that if his mother\u2019s right to freedom was valid and complete, prior to Isis birth, on any of ibe.se grounds, his right to freedom follows as a necessary consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">Under the first enquiry, we must throw entirely out of view the <em>subsequent </em>residence of the mother within the state of Ohio, with the alleged consent of Rodgers her former master. Whatever may be the effect of a residence therein, for a great length of time, and with the assent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>aforesaid: whatever may be the effect of this circumstance * in relation to a person who may thereby have become one of the permanent members of that state, the residence now in question is of a far different character.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay_\">There is no evidence in this case of the mother\u2019s residence within the state of Ohio, prior to the appellant\u2019s birth, but that she.was once seen, on a Sunday, working at a sugar camp therein, in the absence of her master, and without any evidence that it was with his permission. In reference to this evidence, the court below- was asked to instruct the jury, that if they should find,that she was employed by her master within that state, in making sugar, or any other local service, not merely transitory, and for however short a time, they must find a verdict for the plaintiff. The judgment of the superior court refusing to give that instruction was, in our opinion, <em>entirely correct. </em>Such an occupation for a short time, and even for the benefit of the master, and probably in his presence, could never operate an emancipation of his slave. It could not so operate, when the animus: <em>revertendi </em>strongly existed in him, both in relation to himself, and to his slave. There is indeed <em>but </em>a shade of difference between such a residence as this, (if indeed it can be called a residence,) and the mere right of passage through the state : and such a construction, as that now contended for, would whittle down to nothing the right of the citizens of each state, within every other state guaranteed to them by the constitution. Such an occupation connot be said <em>to </em>carry with it evidence of the assent of the master, that she should cease to remain his property, and become a member of the state of Ohio, without which the regulations of that state on the subject of emancipation cannot attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">As for the 2d ground, of claim, under the judgment upon the <em>habeas corpus, </em>it has been truly answered, that that judgment has not <em>affirmed </em>the mother\u2019s right to freedom. Even if it had, and this mode of proceeding was legalized by the laws of that state, (as it <em>seems </em>not to be by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>'\u00bflie laws of this,) in favour of a slave against his master, ' \u00b0 those laws are not found in the case before us : and even if they were, it might well be questioned whether the judgment aforesaid could have concluded the right of the master in the present instance. The right of our citizens under the constitution to reclaim their fugitive slaves from other states, woidd be nearly a nullity, if that claim was permitted to be intercepted by a proceeding like the one in question ; a proceeding of so extremely summary a character, that it affords no fair opportunity to a master deliberately to support bis right of property in his slave. Such a proceeding ought not, therefore, to be conclusive on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">As to the deed of emancipation contained in the record, that deed, taken in connexion with the evidence offered to support it, shews, that it had a reference to the state of Virginia. It is stated to have been made by John Rodgers a resident of the state of .Virginia ; and the testimony shews, that it formed a part of a contract whereby the slave Milly was to be brought back, (as she was brought back,) into the state of Virginia. Her object, therefore, was to secure her freedom by the deed, within the state of Virginia, after the lime should have expired, for which she indented herself, and when she should be found abiding within the state of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">If then this contract had an eye to the state of Virginia for its operation and effect, the <em>lex loci </em>ceases to operate\u00bb In that case it must, to have its effect, conform to the laws of Virginia, It is insufficient under those laws, to effectuate an emancipation, for want of a due recording in the county court, as was decided in the case of <em>Givens </em>vs. <em>Mann </em>in this court. It is also ineffectual, within the commonwealth of Virginia, for another reason. The <em>lex loci </em>is also to be taken subject to the exception, that it is not to be enforced in another country, when it violates some moral duty, or the policy of that country, or is inconsistent with a positive right secured to a third person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>or Party by the ^aws \u00b0f ^ia* country, in which it is sought to be enforced. In such a case we are told \u201c <em>magis jus </em>nostrum, <em>quam jus alienum servemus.3'</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That third party,in this case, is the commonwealth of Virginia : and her policy and interests are also to be attended to. These turn the scale against the <em>lex loci </em>in the present instance. For want of being emancipated agreeably to the provisions of our act on that subject, the duty of supporting the old and infirm slaves would devolve <em>upon </em>the commonwealth. That burthen is only to be borne by the master, in relation to slaves \u201c <em>so </em>emancipated that is, emancipated agreeably to the provisions of the act. 1 Rev. Code, p. 434. Even yet, and notwithstanding a late alteration of the law upon this subject, that bur-then must be borne by the commonwealth, at least for a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">For these reasons, we are unanimously of opinion to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b36-5\"><em> </em>Hub. 2 tom. lib. 1, tit. 3. 2 Fonb. 444.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
