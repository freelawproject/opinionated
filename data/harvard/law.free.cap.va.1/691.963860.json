Moody. </em>The indictment contained twenty counts. In several of them, charging the larceny of different checks,-the instrument was merely described as a check for the payment of a certain sum, and of the value of that sum. Other counts, in addition to the amount and value of the check, set forth the date and number of it, by whom drawn and in whose favour, the particular bank <em>(Exchange </em>or <em>Farmers </em>bank at <em>Norfolk) </em>on which drawn, and, where made payable to order, the endorsement by the payee. One count charged the larceny of three checks, another of two, and another of two paper bills of credit issued under the authority of the <em>United States, </em>commonly called treasury notes ; the count in each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>these cases stating the aggregate amount and value of all the checks or treasury notes therein mentioned, but not the separate amount or value of each, or of any one. The 17th count charged the larceny of a <em>promissory note </em>for the payment, and of the value, of 50 dollars, commonly called a treasury note : to which description the 18th count added, that the note was \u201c made by the <em>United States.\u201d </em>The 19th count differed from the 17th, and the 20th from the 18th, only in terming the instrument charged to be stolen a <em>note, </em>instead of <em>a promissory note.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b721-4\">Before pleading, the prisoner produced the record of the examining court, including the warrant for convening the same, and moved the circuit court to quash the indictment for the following reasons: 1. It does not sufficiently appear from the proceedings of the examining court, that the prisoner was examined according to law for the offence specified in the said indictment or any count thereof. 2. The court of the justices was held for the examination of the prisoner for feloniously stealing \u201c divers goods and chattels,\u201d the property of <em>John S. Moody ; </em>and no such offence is charged in the indictment. 3. There were not five days between the date of the warrant, and the day on which the court of examination was thereby appointed to be held, and was actually held. In connexion with this ground of the motion to quash the indictment, it was proved to the circuit court that the 17th of March 1842, the date of the warrant, was thursday, and consequently that a Sunday intervened between that day and the day of holding the court of examination. 4. For other reasons apparent on the face of the indictment and the proceedings of the examining court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b721-5\">The circuit court overruled the motion to quash the indictment, and the prisoner excepted, setting forth in his bill of exceptions the warrant for convening the court of examination, the proceedings of that court, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>the grounds of his motion as above detailed. He then moved to quash the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th counts of the indictment; which motion was also overruled. Whereupon he pleaded not guilty, and a jury being impanneled for the trial, found him' \u201c guilty of the charges preferred against him in the indictment,\u201d and ascertained the term of his imprisonment in the penitentiary to be two years. The circuit court rendered judgment accordingly. And now he applied by petition to this court for a writ of error to the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b722-4\"><em>R. H. Armistead, </em>for the petitioner,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYnT\">relied upon the second and third grounds above assigned for quashing the indictment. He adverted to the terms of the act 1 Rev. Code, ch. 169. \u00a7 1. p. 598. providing that the day to be appointed in the warrant, for holding the court of examination, shall be \u201c not less than five nor more than ten days after the date thereof;\u201d and suggested that the court, in <em>Thompson </em>v. Commonwealth, 2 Va. Cas. 135. must have overlooked the language of the enactment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b722-5\">On the question whether an intervening sundaj' is to be reckoned in the computation of the five days, he referred to the cases cited in Tate\u2019s Dig. 2d edi. p. 250. note 4.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b722-6\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AOFA\">Writ of error denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
