In 1798, one <em>Peebles, </em>himself a member of the company, and agent for the rest., entered into possession of the 100,000 acre tract, and began to clear and build, upon it; others shortly after followed; and the <em>New England company, </em>and others claiming under them, have continued to hold the possession ever since, making settlements and improvements, paying all public dues, and defending the lands against conflicting claims ; and so incurring great expense. The <em>New England company </em>soon discovered, that their survey of 100,000 acres, interfered with the survey of 100,000 acres, then called <em>Tidball's, </em>it not being known, that this tract had been <em>granted </em>to <em>Morgan. </em>The tract included in <em>TidbaWs </em>survey and <em>Morgan's </em>patent, was assessed for the direct tax of the <em>O.

Of <em>Sims\u2019s </em>claim, they had, at the time, no knowledge. They relied on the lapse of time, as a bar to inquiry into the regularity of the collector\u2019s sale for taxes; they called in question the fairness of <em>Sims\u2019s </em>deed of trust, under which the plaintiff claimed: they called for proof, that the plaintiff was a creditor of <em>Sims: </em>they denied his right, if a creditor, under <em>Sims\u2019s </em>deed of trust, to elect to take this land at a valuation, after the lapse of twenty-one years: they denied the right of <em>Sims, </em>or of the plaintiff claiming under him, to a specific execution of <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>alleged contract for the sale of the land to <em>Sims, </em>no written contract between <em>Morgan </em>and <em>Sims </em>being produced, and n\u00f3 evidence of the payment of the purchase money by <em>Sims </em>to <em>Morgan: </em>they relied on the act of limitations as a bar to the assertion of such an equity as that set up in the bill: and they denied the efficacy of <em>Mrs. Neville\u2019s </em>conveyance of the legal title to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-4\">As against <em>Mrs. Neville, </em>the bill was regularly taken <em>pro confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-5\">The plaintiff exhibited the <em>patent </em>to general <em>Morgan </em>of March 9. 1796; a receipt of general <em>Morgan </em>to <em>John B.

States\u2019 </em>taxes, the lands included in <em>Tidhall\u2019s </em>survey, intending to take possession of all not claimed under prior grants, and have ever since claimed the title and the possession under that purchase, as well as under their own patent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-6\">On the hearing of the cause, chancellor <em>Tucker </em>declared, in substance:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201c That it was important to decide, whether either party had the legal advantage ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-3\">\u201c That the institution of this suit by Smith, excluded the idea that he had the legal title, since if he had, he should have exhibited his claim in another forum: and, in fact, <em>Mrs. Neville's </em>deed to him, being confessedly subsequent, and actually referring to a prior deed to the defendants, the legal title could not have passed to him by her deed; and there was no'other way, in which it could be pretended that he had the legal title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-5\">\u201c That, as to the defendants, they claimed, first, under the <em>New England company's </em>patent; but that being overreached by <em>Morgan's, </em>they rested their pretensions to the legal title upon <em>Mr. </em>and <em>Mrs. Neville's </em>deed, and upon their purchase under <em>the </em>sale for the <em>U. States' </em>direct tax. To their title under that sale, it was objected, that the sale was made in the name of <em>Tidball, </em>though <em>Morgan's </em>patent on <em>Tidball's </em>survey, had issued several years before such sale: and such objection would prevail, without more saying, if the act of congress had not authorised the sale of the land, in the name of a person not the owner. Bioren\u2019s Laws U. S. vol. iii. ch. 272. \u00a7 5. p. 459. Still, the title claimed under that sale, could not prevail, unless the requisitions of the law (Id. ch. 92. \u00a7 11. p. 103.) were proved to have been complied with, or unless such compliance was to be presumed (as was contended) in favour of possession after such a length of time. No such proof was offered. And such a presumption ought not to be raised, to defeat a <em>legal title {Morgan\u2019s) </em>upon a mere possession of <em>twenty-two years, </em>counting from the date of the sale to the date of the suit: it should be more cautiously admitted, in a case, where a party\u2019s rights have been sold in the name of another, and where, from the nature of the requisitions of the law, the presumption of compliance with them might so easily be fortified, by the evidence of one at least of the many numbers of the four gazettes, in which the notification required by law, must have appeared. The requisitions of all such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>statutes must be strictly pursued; and no purchaser is blameless, who buys without seeing that they have been so, or who has failed to preserve so essential a muniment of h<em>i</em>s title. The defendants themselves tacitly admitted the insufficiency of their title under the collector\u2019s sale, when they fortified it by a release or conveyance from <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>devisee; and thus afforded decisive evidence against the presumption on which they would rely, as late as 1818, about sixteen years after the sale. Therefore, the collector\u2019s sale and the marshal\u2019s deed did not convey the legal title to diem. Nor did the deed of <em>Neville and wife </em>place them in a better situation. If that deed was executed by <em>Mrs. Neville, </em>in whom the title was, (which was left in doubt, as tlie deed was not filed) yet it was not such a deed, as would give to the defendants, the advantage of purchasers .of the legal title without notice of a precedent equity; because it was expressly stipulated, that <em>when </em>the legal use should be made of the deed, the value of the transfer should be ascertained and paid to <em>Neville and wife, </em>and if no use should be made of it, the <em>company </em>should re-convey to <em>Neville and wife; </em>whence it is not only obvious, that there was no payment of any purchase money, (which is necessary to make a complete purchaser without notice, who will be protected), but that there was no transfer, which the <em>New England company </em>may not at any time re-transfer. Such a transfer could not be forced within the influence of those principles, which govern the case of a purchaser without notice. Under the <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>contract with <em>Mrs. Neville, he </em>would have title to all her interest in the contract with the <em>company: </em>for, if the <em>company </em>should pay <em>Neville </em>any thing, the plaintiff would have a right to receive it, both as claiming through <em>Sims </em>under <em>Morgan, </em>and under <em>Mrs. Neville\u2019s </em>own deed to him. The <em>company, </em>by their contract with <em>Neville, </em>were to pay <em>Neville </em>in proportion to the advantage to be gained .by the transfer; and should they succeed upon the strength of <em>this </em>title of <em>Neville\u2019s, </em>the advantage gained must be measured by the value of the land: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number><em>if </em>they should succeed against the plaintiff upon <em>Neville's </em>title, they must pay <em>Neville, </em>or the plaintiff, her assignee, for the land. And thus it was obvious, that <em>Neville's </em>deed to the <em>company </em>could not serve as any protection to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-8\">\u201c That, as the plaintiff claimed an equitable title under <em>Morgan, </em>and as tile defendants could only claim under <em>him </em>with any prospect of success, this was, in effect, a contest between equities under <em>Morgan </em>or his heirs; and as the plaintiff\u2019s equity was prior to the defendants\u2019, it must prevail, unless it was inferior.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-9\">\u201c That the defendants\u2019 equity was, J st, that arising from payment of taxes and from improvements; but this created an equitable <em>charge, </em>not an equitable title: 2dly, an equity arising from their contract with <em>Neville; </em>but that was an executory contract, for which no consideration had been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-10\">\u201c That the plaintiff, however, must succeed by the strength, of his own equity, not merely by the weakness of his adversary\u2019s. The equity of <em>Sims </em>against <em>Morgan, </em>was sufficiently proved by the depositions, and <em>Morgan's </em>receipt, filed in the cause; and though it was not shewn, what he was to pay, or what he had paid, the conveyance of <em>Mrs. Neville, </em>the heir and owner of the estate, was the best evidence, that nothing was due, and concluded all inquiry on the subject. The validity of <em>Sims's </em>deed of trust could not be a matter <em>of </em>inquiry here, where no creditors of <em>Sims </em>were parties: as between him and the trustees claiming under him, it was valid. Though the proceedings of the plaintiff had been dilatory, in claiming under <em>Sims's </em>deed of trust, yet the evidence, that he was a creditor of <em>Sims, </em>sufficiently appeared to entertain him here, as standing in <em>Sims's </em>shoes, claiming the legal title derived from <em>Morgan, </em>who had sold to <em>Sims.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-12\">\u201c That the equity of <em>Sims </em>against <em>Morgan's </em>heirs, was better than that of the defendants, and must prevail over them, because it was proved, that he had paid part of the purchase money, and was admitted by the heir, against her own interest in every respect, to have paid the whole; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>whereas the defendants have as yet paid nothing, and by losing their contract with <em>Neville </em>would only be replaced in <em>statu </em>quo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9HS\">\u201c But that although the plaintiff might <em>be </em>permitted to assert this equity to preserve it, yet his case was too defective 'to entitle him to a final decree, at that time. A conveyance from the heirs of the trustees, on whom indeed the <em>title </em>but not the <em>confidence </em>descended, ought not to be held sufficient. <em>Sims\u2019s </em>heirs should be made parties in the cause, in order to a final decree.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ApG\"><em>\u201c </em>That the <em>New England company </em>having paid the taxes on the land in dispute, to the collectors of the <em>U. States, </em>were entitled to a lien on the lands for the amount, with interest thereon from the date of such payment, and were in like manner entitled to a lien on the said lands for all taxes paid since; and, moreover, having settled on the lands many years ago, and made valuable improvements thereon, under the faith, first of their patent, and afterwards of the sale for taxes, and on the supposition, that <em>Tidball\u2019s </em>was the best right, and that they had acquired it; and Morgan, and those claiming under, him, having quietly looked on; the defendants were entitled to a full and liberal allowance for permanent improvements, so far as they exceeded the rents and profits.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-7\">Therefore, the chancellor gave the plaintiff leave to amend his bill, by making the heirs of <em>Sims </em>party defendants: and <em>he </em>appointed a commissioner to ascertain and state the amount of taxes paid by the defendants to the <em>U. States, </em>and the taxes paid by them to the state of <em>Virginia, </em>on account of the land in the bill mentioned, and also to state and report the value of the permanent improvements made by the defendants on the land, and an account of the rents and profits thereof, during the time that they or those claiming under them have had the same in possession; and remanded the cause to the rules for further proceedings to be had therein as to the heirs of <em>Sims, </em>and continued it as to the other defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>From this order, the defendants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A8B\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Johnson </em>for the appellants, and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-8\">I. <em>Johnson </em>took several objections to the appellee\u2019s claim to relief, upon his own case, as stated in the bill, and the proofs adduced in support of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b253-9\">1. He insisted, that <em>Smith </em>had shewn no right in himself to assert <em>Sims\u2019s </em>equitable title under <em>.Morgan </em>to the land in question. The only evidence adduced to shew that he was a creditor of <em>Sims, </em>was the deposition of <em>Lee; </em>and that deposition shewed, that the evidence of the debt consisted in the record of a proceeding and judgment in a court of law: it was indispensible to produce the record: no parol evidence of its contents ought to have been heard. If he was a creditor of <em>Sims </em>at all, he was not a creditor entitled to claim the benefit of <em>Sims\u2019s </em>deed of trust of August 1800; for the deed provided only for <em>Sims\u2019s </em>own proper debts; but his debt to the plaintiff, arose out of the assignment of the bond of another person to him; and the assignor of a bond is, in reality, only a surely for the obligor, bound to pay the debt to the assignee, if he cannot recover it of the obligor. And if he was a creditor, whose claim was provided for by the deed of trust, he was bound, if he claimed <em>the </em>benefit of that deed, to have elected to take the trust subject, at the valuation, within some reasonable time: he ought not to be allowed to wait, as he did, twenty-one years, and then elect to take, al a valuation made in 1800, a parcel of land, the value of which might now, in all probability, be quadrupled. Had this deed of trust been a mortgage of this land, for the security of this very debt to <em>Smith, </em>after the lapse of twenty years, payment of the debt would have been presumed, and his bill to foreclose would have been dismissed. He went into equity to disturb an adverse claim in the highest degree meritorious; a claim asserted under a patent,'to lauds, which the grantees had taken early possession of, defended against conflicting claims, settled, im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>proved, and preserved from forfeiture by the payment of public dues: and there was no such merit in <em>Smith\u2019s </em>claim, as should have induced the chancellor to shew it any favour or indulgence. He presented his cause for a hearing; and, not having shewn and proved a case entitling him to a decree, his bill should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABp\"><em>Leigh denied, </em>that these objections had any good foundation : but supposing they had, the questions they presented, were questions between <em>Smith </em>and the heirs of <em>Sims ; </em>questions, in which the <em>JYeu&gt; England company </em>had no interest. The chancellor had not <em>decided </em>them: in requiring that <em>Sims\u2019s </em>heirs should be made parties, he left them open to be litigated by <em>them, </em>and to be considered by the court, after <em>they </em>should be heard. Enough appeared to shew, that <em>Smith\u2019s </em>claim, as against them, had very strong colour of justice, to say the least; and it would have been unprecedented and unjust,1 to dismiss his bill absolutely, merely because it had not made all the proper parties. There could be nothing meritorious in the case of either party, distinct from the law and equity on which his claim was founded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-7\">2. <em>Johnson </em>objected, that <em>Smith </em>had shewn no case, entitling -himself, claiming under <em>Sims, </em>to ask a specific execution of <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>contract to- sell the land to <em>Sims. </em>He had not proved, that the title bond, given by <em>Morgan </em>to <em>Sims, </em>was lost or mislaid; and without proof of that, the court ought not to listen to parol evidence of its contents.. The parol evidence only proved; that there was a contract; it did not prove what were the terms of it, or that <em>Sims </em>so complied with its terms, as to have entitled him to demand a specific execution of <em>Morgan. </em>And <em>Sims </em>had never had possession under the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-8\">It was answered, that <em>this </em>was a question between <em>Smith </em>claiming under <em>Sims, </em>and <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>heir or devisee. <em>Mrs. JYeville </em>was the residuary devisee and legatee of <em>Morgan; </em>entitled to tire land, if <em>Morgan </em>was not bound to convey it; entitled to any balance of the purchase money, which <em>Sims </em>might have left unpaid. <em>She </em>admitted her father\u2019s sale to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>Sims, </em>and that he had entitled himself, and those claiming finder him, to a conveyance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACX\">3. It was urged, as an objection against giving any relief in the case, in whatever shape it might be presented, and however it might be sustained by proofs, that, at the time <em>Morgan </em>contracted to sell to <em>Sims, </em>or at least when <em>Sims </em>conveyed the laud in question to trustees for the benefit of his creditors, the <em>New England company, </em>and those claiming under them, were in actual possession, claiming adverse title under their patent; and, at the time the heirs of the surviving trustee conveyed the land to <em>Smith, </em>and when <em>Mrs. Neville </em>conveyed her legal estate to him, the company were in possession, claiming under their patent, under the marshal\u2019s deed, and under the deed of <em>Neville and wife. </em>And thus, <em>Smith\u2019s </em>claim stood condemned by tho statute against conveying or taking pretensed titles; 1 Rev. Code, ch. 103.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">Tho answer was, that <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>sale to <em>Sims </em>was made before the <em>New England company </em>had taken possession; and, for the rest, the statute inhibits the purchase of pretended <em>legal </em>estates, not of <em>equitable interests </em>in lands.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-7\">II. <em>Johnson </em>made two objections to the details of the chancellor\u2019s order: 1. That in requiring new parties, ho had not required all the proper parties; for, not only <em>Sims\u2019s </em>heirs but his personal representatives, and <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>personal representative too, as well as <em>Mrs. Neville </em>his devisee, were proper and necessary parties : 2. That the decree was premature in directing an account of rents and profits, at the suit of <em>Smith, </em>while it was yet uncertain, whether he had any just right to the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">In answer to tho first objection, <em>Leigh </em>denied, that <em>Sims\u2019s </em>personal representative could be a necessary party in any possible state of the case: And, as to <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>personal representative, if it were proper to make him a party, it could he so only and merefy for form sake; for it was apparent, that <em>Mrs. Neville, </em>the residuary legatee as well as devisee of <em>Morgan, </em>was entitled not only to the legal estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in the land, but to any balance of the purchase money, which might possibly have been left unpaid by <em>Sims </em>to her father; <em>she </em>was a party; and far from setting up any such claim, she had disclaimed it. As to the account directed, it was hard to say, to which of' the parties the decree, in that particular, was most beneficial: it was an account of permanent improvements made, taxes paid, and expenses incurred, by the appellants, as well as of rents and profits; and it was probably more convenient to them, than to the appellee, thus to expedite the accounts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5c\">III. <em>Johnson </em>strenuously contended, that the <em>New England company </em>had acquired a good title under their purchase at the collector\u2019s sal\u00e9 for <em>U. States\u2019 </em>taxes, and the marshal\u2019s deed of December 1805. That which would strike one as the principal objection to the regularity of the sale, and to the efficacy of the marshal\u2019s deed to pass the title, namely, that the land was assessed for the taxes, and sold, as the property of <em>Tidball, </em>was cured by the express provision of the act of congress. He admitted, that it had been settled by the decisions both of this court and of the supreme court of the <em>U. States, </em>that in sales of land <em>by </em>a collector for taxes, he acts under a naked power, and must strictly comply with all the requisitions of the law, as to all the steps preceding the sale; that a purchaser claiming under such a sale, is bound to preserve and adduce evidence of the exact regularity of it; and that the marshal\u2019s conveyance to him, is not even <em>prim\u00e1 facie </em>evidence, that the provisions of the law have been complied with. <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Minor, </em>4 Munf. 431. <em>Nalle </em>v. <em>Fenwick, 4 </em>Rand. 585. <em>Stead </em>v. <em>Course, 4 </em>Cranch, 403. <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Rule, </em>9 Cranch, 64. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Peyton, 4 </em>Wheat. 77. But, he said, though the purchaser be bound to prove the collector\u2019s exact compliance with the provisions of the law, in the steps preparatory to the sale, he could not justly be held to strict proof at any distance of time: and this was admitted in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Peyton: </em>for C. J. <em>Marshall, </em>after referring to the provisions of the act of congress prescribing the duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>of the collector, said, \u201c If these duties be examined, th<em>ey </em>will be found to be susceptible of complete proof on the part of the officer, and consequently on the part of the who ought to preserve the evidence of them, <em>at least for a reasonable time,\u201d </em>The purchaser at such a sale, ought not to be held to preserve fugitive evidence of acts <em>in pais, </em>longer than twenty years : after such a lapse of time, the regularity of the collector\u2019s proceedings ought to be <em>presumed. </em>Such presumption was allowed to supply the place of direct proof, in a stronger case. <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>6 Munf. 159. There, a slave claimed his freedom, on the ground that he had been imported into <em>Virginia </em>contrary to law : whether he was illegally imported or no, depended on the question of fact, whether the master had, within ten days after his removal to the state, taken a particular oath, prescribed by law to justify the holding him as a slave here : and it was held, that the taking of the oath would be presumed from the lapse of <em>twenty ye.ars\u2019 possession </em>without claim of freedom on the part of the slave.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b257-7\"><em>Leigh </em>remarked, that the appellants had supplied evidence enough to rebut the presumption now insisted on. For, in the first place, they had alleged and proved, that they commenced the settling and improving the lands as early as 1799; and it was hardly possible, that there was not personal property enough on the lands, out of which 54 dollars (the amount of tax) could have been made by distress ; and if there was, the collector\u2019s sale of the lands for the taxes was contrary to law. 3 Bioren\u2019s Laws U. S. ch. 92. \u00a7 10. 11. p. 102, 3. And, in the next place, the appellants had deemed it necessary to procure a conveyance of the legal title from <em>Neville and wife, </em>as late as 1818, to fortify the title they claimed under the marshal\u2019s deed. But there was no ground on which the court should allow any such presumption. The collector\u2019s sale was made December 27. 1802; the term for redemption allowed by law, two years (Id. \u00a7 13), expired December 27. 1804; the marshal\u2019s deed was made in December 1805. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>sUit was brought in November 1824. Twenty years had not elapsed from the time when the title under the sale for taxes accrued. And if they had, the court would hardly indulge a presumption, on the mere strength of which a purchase of 95,000 acres of land for 54 dollars, was to be upheld. The expression of the chief justice, in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>that the purchaser is bound to preserve the evidence of the regularity of the collector\u2019s proceedings preparatory to his sale, \u201c <em>at least for a reasonable time,\u201d </em>must be taken with due regard to the nature of the facts of which the evidence is required to be preserved: and the chief justice, ip the sequel of his opinion, said, that the purchaser ought to preserve the gazettes (in which the collector\u2019s advertisements were published); and that <em>\u201c </em>it was imposing no greater hardship on him to require it, than it would be to require him to prove, that a <em>power of attorney, </em>in a case in which his deed had been executed by an attorney, <em>was really given by the principal.\u201d </em>Surely, the execution of a <em>power of attorney, </em>in such a case, could not be presumed fiora \u00bf^possession of twenty years, or any time short of the periods prescribed by the act of limitations in regard to land titles.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b258-4\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">Many objections to the decree, were urged in -the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"A6kr\">The first was, that <em>Smith </em>did not shew himself possessed of the equitable claim of <em>Sims, </em>upon <em>Morgan: </em>because, 1. he had not proved himself a creditor of <em>Sims, </em>since the evidence of <em>Lee </em>was secondary, speaking of a suit on a bond assigned by <em>Sims </em>to <em>Smith, </em>of which suit there must be a record, which being the highest evidence, was alone admissible : but, 2. if <em>Smith </em>had been a creditor in 1800, this debt must be presumed to have been paid before 1821, when he elected to take the land : or if not, 3. after such a lapse of time, and especially the death of the trustees, he had no right to take the land, nor'had the heirs of the surviving trustee any power to make a deed to him, the confi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>dence as to that being personal: and 4. their deed was utterly ineffectual, both because there was adverse possession, and it was a contract for a pretensed title. It was denied on the other side, that there was weight in these objections : hut the answer to them mainly relied on, was, that they were points, not one of which had been decided by the chancellor; that, when he directed the heirs of <em>Sims </em>to be made parties, he meant to give them an opportunity to contest the claim against their ancestor, on every ground which might avail them, and of course, could not intend to forestall them, by deciding any point of their case in their absence ; that when they should appear and answer, if they admitted the claim of the plaintiff, there would need no further <em>proof; </em>if they contested it, the whole case, as to those parties, would <em>be open; </em>new evidence might <em>be </em>taken on either side <em>; </em>and whether it was or not, the chancellor would decide upon the claim of <em>Smith </em>against <em>Sims, </em>as a part of the. case untouched before. I think there is great force in these remarks, and that they dispose, for the pn these objections, unless it be true, that the chancello: of directing new parties, ought at once, to have di; the bill, either for defect of proof of the claim again\u00ae or, because that claim was attempted to be satis taking a pretensed title, which the court was calle! assist.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">As to the first, the language of the chancellor is, although the plaintiff may be permitted to assert this equity, <em>to preserve it, </em>yet his case <em>was too defective, </em>to entitle him to a final decree at that time.\u201d I think the distinction here taken a very sound one. There may not <em>be </em>proof sufficient to establish a claim, nor exactly of that kind which is the best evidence the case will admit of; yet it may be such as to create a strong belief, and also to shew, that better and full evidence can be produced. In the case before us, the plaintiff had the deed of the heirs of the trustee, stating that he was a creditor of <em>Sims; </em>and he had the evidence of <em>Lee, </em>stating that he was a creditor: but, <em>Lee </em>adds, that he \u201c that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>no connection. had prosecuted a suit to judgment, on a bond assigned by <em>Sims </em>to <em>Smith. The </em>chancellor could not properly decide against the heirs of <em>Sims, </em>when they were not before him. But was not here enough to prevent him from dismissing the bill at once ? Did not this proof go pretty strongly to shew a debt from <em>Sims </em>to <em>Smith, </em>at the same time, that it pointed to a source (the record) from whence indubitable evidence could be obtained ? And was it not likely to be most conducive to equity, to call those before the court, who could properly discuss this matter, and at the same time, give opportunity to the plaintiff to produce this record-evidence, if the heirs of <em>Sims </em>should dispute his claim ? I think so. It was an equity, with which the defendants had</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Neither can I see, that the taking this deed from the heirs,of- <em>Sims\u2019s </em>trustee, was a transaction within the letter odie spirit of the statute against buying and selling pretensed titles.. That law, as I have always understood it, means buying and selling legal, not <em>equitable </em>titles. In <em>Wood v. Griffith, </em>1 Swanst. 43. lord <em>Eldon </em>says, \u201c It is extremely clear, that an equitable interest, under a contract of purchase, may be the subject of saleand after some further remarks, he adds, <em>\u201c </em>If I were to suffer this doctrine to be shaken, by any reference to the law of champerty or maintenance, I should violate the established habits of this court.\u201d In our case, <em>Sims\u2019s </em>original purchase from <em>Morgan, </em>was in 1797, before there was any adverse possession : but he did not get the legal title : he conveyed this equity in trust to pay his debts; and the plaintiff, a creditor, takes the deed from the heirs of the trustee, in order to carry into effect, the deed of his debtor, and obtain payment of his debt. Whether this effort be successful or not, there was surely nothing criminal in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">The counsel for the appellants also objected, that, though there was no doubt of a contract for the land between <em>Sims </em>and <em>Morgan, </em>yet there is not such evidence of it, as equity will deem sufficient on a bill for specific execution: for <em>Sims </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>never had possession of the land; neither is there any such written evidence of the contract, as discloses the terms; the contents of the title bond are not proved; and the receipt, though it acknowledges 18,000 dollars paid in <em>Morris </em>and <em>Nicholson\u2019s </em>notes, in part payment for 100,000 acres of land in <em>Randolph, </em>does not give u,s the particulars of the contract: that thus we do not know what was the price to be given: that the depositions of <em>Armistead </em>and <em>Summerton </em>merely state their belief, that all the purchase money was paid, which is not full proof, and if it were, payment is not such part performance, as will authorise a decree for specific execution. There is no doubt with me, that <em>Armistead </em>sold this land for <em>Morgan </em>to <em>Sims; </em>and I think we may fairly conclude from the evidence, that full <em>payuuyft </em>been made. <em>Armistead </em>swears, \u201c that <em>Morgan </em>pumriS^ijs possession, a title bond for a conveyance of the land | and the patent, both to be delivered by him to <em>Sims, </em>jIV virtue of that contract.\u201d What lie did with them, ho does \\|ot\u2019say.j It is probable, that be delivered them to <em>Sims; </em>and tlfo^sub sequent insolvency of <em>Sims, </em>together with bis death, and that of both bis trustees, and the lapse of so many years, may well support the assertion in the bill, that the bond is lost. I do not say, that these circumstances are such, as clearly to authorise equity to decree a specific execution, if the heirs of <em>Morgan </em>were resisting it: but 1 do say, confidently, that, when the residuary devisee of <em>Morgan, (Mrs. Neville) </em>having the sole right under him, releases all that right to the plaintiff as representing <em>Sims, </em>and thereby acknowledges the contract, and satisfaction for it, equity will feel itself fully authorised, so far as <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>right is concerned, to decree in favour of the plaintiff. It was said, that this deed <em>o\u00ed Mrs. Neville </em>could have no operation whatever, both because she had before passed the legal right to the defendants, and because of their adversary possession. Whether <em>Mrs. Neville, </em>who was then a <em>feme covert, </em>was privily examined in the execution of .the deed to the defendants, we do not know, as the defendants, though they refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>to this deed in their answer, have' not filed it. But, however this may be, and however inoperative the deed of <em>Mrs. Neville </em>may be in the way of conveying title to <em>the </em>plaintiff, it would certainly be conclusive against her, to shew that she admitted the contract between <em>Morgan </em>and <em>Sims, </em>and was willing to do all she could in execution of it.</p>\n<p id=\"A9n\">It was also objected, that the chancellor erred in deciding that the marshal\u2019s deed was not effectual to pass the title. The counsel admitted the general rule, that he who claims under one of these sales, founded on a forfeiture, must shew that the law had been strictly pursued; and that such titles, where (as in this case) 100,000 acres of land are bought for 54 dollars (the mere tax due on it) ought not to be encouraged : but yet he insisted, that the same presumptions from length of time, which govern other cases, would apply here also; and that, the defendants having been in possession under'the sale for twenty years, it ought to be presumed, that every pre-requisite of the law had been complied with. It has been decided-, in several cases, both in the federal court and in this, that an officer, who acts under a naked power, especially if by the exercise of that power the rights and property of others may be lost, must pursue his authority to the very letter, and that those claiming under his acts- must shew this, as nothing will be presumed. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>the deed of the marshal made under this very act of congress, was decided not even to furnish <em>primd facie </em>evidence, that the advertisements Sic. required by the law, had been set up in the country, and published in the papers; and from the manner in which the question is treated there, it seems clear to me, that the court would have permitted no other presumption, than such as would be received as to any other link in the chain of title to real property, The chief justice, who delivered the opinion, says, \u201c It is a general principle, that the party who sets up a title must furnish the evidence necessary to support it. ' If the validity of a deed depends on an act <em>in pais, </em>the party claiming under that deed is as much bound to prove the perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ance of the act, as he would be bound to prove any matter of record on which its validity might depend. It forms a part of his title; it is a link in the chain which is to its continuity, and which it is incumbent on him to preserve. These facts should be examined by him before he becomes a purchaser, and the evidence of them should be preserved as a necessary muniment of title.\u201d He then goes on to shew, that these general principles apply, with peculiar force, to the marshal\u2019s proceeding to sell lands under the law of congress for non-payment of taxes; where the officer\u2019s duties are clearly pointed out, and his compliance with them easy of proof, and where, for the opposite party to prove that they had <em>not </em>been complied with, would be always difficult, often impossible. Now, if the validity <em>of the </em>marshal\u2019s deed depends on these <em>acts in pais </em>(the publishing advertisements of the sale in the gazette, and setting them up in public places); if the party claiming under such deed, is as much bound to prove their performance, as he would be to prove any matter of record, on which the validity of the deed might depend: how can it be supposed, that he would be permitted to supply evidence of these acts, by presumption from time, sooner than he might supply the want of the deed <em>itself, by </em>such evidence? The very nature of such titles, it seems to me, ought to warn the purchasers, to see that all the pre-requisites of the law are complied with <em>ad unguem. </em>They buy often large and valuable tracts of land for a mere trifle; and they ought always to expect, that the owner will attempt to recover them. This is notice, intrinsic in the transaction, that they must be ready for defence; and they ought, at once, to collect the proper evidences of compliance with the law; and these documents, being written, can be just as easily preserved as their deed. My opinion, then, is, that the time which has elapsed, did not release the appellants from the necessity of strict proof; and that, failing altogether in producing it, the chancellor was right in saying, that the marshal\u2019s deed did not help their case at alb</p>\n<p id=\"AaF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>He was equally correct, I think, in saying that the deed from <em>Mr. </em>and <em>Mrs. Neville </em>(even if she was privily examined), did not give the appellants the position of purchasers without notice, against the plaintiff; because nothing was paid by them, and it was in their option, at any time, to re-convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">With respect to the order of account made by <em>the </em>chancellor, I think it neither incorrect nor premature. Its object was to ascertain, for the benefit of the defendants, principally, the amount of taxes they have paid, and the value of their improvements, as well as the rents and profits. It cannot, therefore, be said to disturb them ; for it is not probable, that a step will be taken in it, unless at their instance; and if the plaintiff should unnecessarily be the means of incurring costs in the case, the chancellor will have it in his power to make him pay all such costs, however he may decide the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Upon every ground, therefore, I am for affirming tire decree.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b264-6\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ASG\">I concur in the opinion of judge <em>Carr, </em>as to tire correctness of the decree, in all respects, excepting the requiring an account of rents and profits. In my opinion, it was premature, in the actual state of the cause, to order such an account to be rendered; since it may hereafter appear, upon the amended bill, that the plaintiff has not acquired any just right to <em>Sims's </em>equitable title to the land; and it is wrong to put the defendants to the trouble of rendering an account of rents and profits, till it be ascertained, that the plaintiff has a right to demand it. I am, therefore, for correcting the decree in this respect, and reversing it for this cause, and affirming it as to all things else.</p>\n<author id=\"b264-7\">Brooke, President.</author>\n<p id=\"AkmF\">As respects some of the objections taken to the decree, in the argument, the appeal to this court was certainly premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The chancellor having rightly decided, that the legal title. to the land in controversy, was in neither of the parties, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>next question was, which of them had the better equitable right. <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>patent being older than the patent under which the defendants claimed, the legal title was in his devisee, <em>Mrs. JYeville. Sims </em>under whom the plaintiff claimed, there can bo no doubt, purchased the land of <em>Morgan, </em>and paid for it. The evidence of <em>.fLrmistead, </em>corroborated by that, of <em>Summerton, </em>might not bo conclusive of that fact; but the release of <em>Mrs. JYeville, </em>the devisee of <em>Morgan, to </em>the plaintiff, though it conveyed nothing, was conclusive evidence that she claimed no title to it. And the plaintiff having shewn by <em>Lee\u2019s </em>evidence, enough to give colour to his claim under <em>Sims, </em>the chancellor was correct in not dismissing his bill, until an opportunity was afforded him to make <em>Sims\u2019s </em>representatives parties, and then to prove, if <em>he </em>could, by the record of <em>the </em>suit spoken of by <em>Lee, </em>that he was a creditor of <em>Sims, </em>and by other evidence, that he had a right to elect to take the land in question, in discharge of his claim. It might have been more regular to have made <em>Sims\u2019s </em>representatives parties before; but a court of equity will not dismiss a hill for the want of parties only, especially in this case, in which the plaintiff could not be sure that his title under <em>Sims </em>would be controverted by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">The objections, that the claim upon <em>Sims, </em>accruing in 1800, ought to have been presumed paid in 1822, and to the title of the plaintiff under the deed of trust for the benefit of <em>Sims\u2019s </em>creditors, the confidence in the trustees being personal, and not devolving on the heirs of the surviving trustee, from whom the plaintiff obtained his deed; are objections of the same character, and ought not to have been discussed until <em>Sims\u2019s </em>heirs were made parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The other objections are of a different character and deserve more consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The objection, that the purchase of the land, either by <em>Sims </em>from <em>Morgan, </em>or by the plaintiff from the trustees of <em>Sims, </em>was the purchase of a pretensed title, is not sustainable upon the facts in the case. At the time of the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>chase by <em>Sims </em>of <em>Morgan, </em>there was no adverse possession of the land in question; and the purchase by the plaintiff of <em>Sims\u2019s </em>equitable title, under its circumstances, was no violation of the letter or spirit of the act against the purchase of pretensed titles. That act imposes a penalty, but does not avoid the conveyance <em>(Tabb </em>v. <em>Baird, 3 </em>Call, 441.) <em>even </em>where the <em>legal </em>estate is conveyed; and cannot affect the conveyance of <em>equitable rights. </em>And, though equity will <em>not </em>enforce an <em>equitable title, </em>purchased by a party under circumstances, which if it were a <em>legal </em>title, would subject him to the penalty of the act against the purchase of pretensed titles, that is not the case before us. The plaintiff elected to take the land under the deed of trust, in discharge of a prior debt. He violated neither the letter nor the spirit of the act. The opinion of lord <em>Eldon </em>in <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>is directly in point. There can be nothing clearer, I think, than that this objection to the decree of the chancellor has nothing in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Another objection was, that though there was a contract between <em>Morgan </em>and <em>Sims, </em>for the land, yet there is not such evidence of it, as equity will deem sufficient on a bill for specific execution, <em>Sims </em>never having been put into possession, and there being no written evidence of the terms of the contract, as to price &amp;cc. If <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>representatives were resisting this contract, I think this objection would be entitled to great weight. The title bond spoken of by <em>Armistead </em>from <em>Morgan </em>to <em>Sims, </em>ought to be produced, or its loss accounted for, and its contents proved. But the proof, I think, is full enough of the payment of the whole of the purchase money by <em>Sims. Armistead </em>swears, that <em>Morgan </em>put into his hands the patent and title bond to be delivered to <em>Sims, </em>in virtue of that contract. The insolvency of <em>Sims, </em>his death, and that of his trustees, and the lapse of so many years, might, with other circumstances, account for the non-production of the bond, even if <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>representative was contesting the claim, and <em>Sims\u2019s </em>representatives were also parties: but in the present state of the cause, the release of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the representative of <em>Morgan </em>to the plaintiff, must be considered a full acknowledgment of the contract alleged in the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The last objection to the decree was, that the deed from the marshal to the defendants, in virtue of the sale for taxes, was pronounced to be invalid. It was admitted, that, by the decisions both of the supreme court of the <em>U. States, </em>and of this court, a purchaser claiming under these deeds, must shew that all the requirements of the act of congress have been complied with; but it was insisted, that after the lapse of twenty years, compliance with the requirements of the act may be presumed, though the party be unable to prove it. If such a presumption were applicable to a case like this, the defendants could not avail themselves of it. When they purchased the land under the sale for the nonpayment of the taxes, they had full notice of the rights of <em>Morgan; </em>indeed, the purchase was made, to evade the title of <em>Morgan, </em>and to fortify their own. They were put on their guard, and ought to have preserved all the documents and proofs of their title under the deed. When an officer acts under a naked power, and the property of others is to be affected by his acts, it must be shewn, that he has acted in pursuance of his authority to the very letter. In <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>the deed of the marshal under this-same act <em>of </em>congress, was held not to be even <em>primd facie </em>evidence, that the requirements of the act, previous to the sale, had been complied with: and from the manner, in which the question is treated in that case, it is pretty clear, that the court would have permitted no other presumption, than such as would be received as to any other link in the chain of title to real property. [This the judge shewed, by several parts of the opinion, which he quoted.] Neither is it fairly inferrible, from any part of the opinion of the court in that case, that if presumption in such a case were admissible, it would be allowed on a shorter lapse of time, than is required to found such presumption, where any other link in. the chain of title to real property, may be presumed, in the absence of proof otherwise indispensible. And that h* a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>case at law, where forfeitures may be strictly insisted on. But courts of equity rather favour presumptions to relieve forfeitures, than to sustain them. In the case of. <em>Abraham </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>the presumption after the lapse of twenty years, th\u00e1t a party bringing a slave into this state, had taken the oath before a magistrate, prescribed by statute, was allowed to <em>save the forfeiture </em>under the statute. Whether, in any case, a court of equity will allow presumption to <em>sustain </em>a forfeiture, where the party claims immediately under it, it is not necessary to decide. The case of <em>Christy </em>v. <em>Minor, </em>and other cases, in this court, concur in tire principle of <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Peyton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Upon tire whole, as the object of the decree was to preserve the equity of tire plaintiff under <em>Sims, </em>until it could be properly controverted by his representatives, the order that they be made parties was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">But I concur with judge <em>Cabell, </em>that the decree is wrong in the particular mentioned by him, and must for that cause be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The day after these opinions were delivered, the <em>president </em>mentioned, that the objection taken by the appellants, in their answer, that their twenty years possession was a bar to the assertion of the equitable right to the land claimed, by the bill, if it had been presented in the argument, had not been considered by the court; and that the point might now be argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">It was spoken to accordingly. The case of <em>Elmendorf v. Taylor, </em>10 Wheat. 152. was referred to; in which it was held, that twenty years adverse possession is a bar in chancery to the assertion of an equitable title, whenever it would bar an ejectment, if the plaintiff claimed the legal title. The principle was not contested: the only debate was, whether it was applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">The <em>president </em>afterwards announced, that the court saw no reason to alter its decree. The reporter was afterwards, informed, that the court did not think it necessary, in the present state of the case, to decide the point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
