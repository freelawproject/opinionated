T. </em>Tee, who died in 1795. That in the same year, administration of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>estate was granted to <em>Moore, </em>by the county court of <em>Prince George. </em>That he returned an inventory and appraisement of his intestate\u2019s chattels, but never settled his accounts of administration; and that he was indebted to the estate. That he permitted the sheriff to sell a female slave, named <em>Eve, </em>under execution for a debt due from the estate, at a time when he was himself indebted to the estate, on his account of administration, to a greater amount than would have satisfied the execution; and purchased the slave himself at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and continued, ever afterwards, to hold her and her increase now thirteen in number. The hill prayed, an account of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>estate, and a decree for the balance which should appear due; that the sale of <em>Eve </em>should be set aside; that that slave aud her increase should be decreed to <em>Todd and wife, </em>and that an account should he taken of their profits, and the amount thereof alsa decreed to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number><em>Avery </em>answered, that his intestate <em>Moore </em>had early set-tied his accounts of administration of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>estate, before commissioners of the county court of <em>Prince George, </em>and the account had been reported to the county court; hut owing (as he believed) to the negligence of the clerk, it has never been recorded, and was now lost or mislaid. That his account was fair and just; and <em>Moore </em>had paid the balance to <em>Mrs. Todd, </em>or her guardian. That at the time of the sale of <em>Eve, </em>under execution, the administrator <em>Moore </em>had no other assets of his testator\u2019s estate applicable to the debt; that the sale of <em>Eve </em>was therefore unavoidable; and that the purchase by <em>Moore </em>was perfectly fair, and the proceeds <em>all </em>accounted for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXy\">Chancellor <em>Taylor </em>ordered <em>Avery </em>to render an account before a commissioner of the court, of his intestate <em>Moore\u2019s </em>administration of <em>Lee\u2019s </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-5\"><em>Avery </em>appearing before the commissioner to render an account, produced an office copy of the account, which had been taken before the commissioners of the county court, and which was supposed to have been lost or mislaid in the clerk\u2019s office of <em>Prince George, </em>but had been recently found on record there. This account had been audited and returned as early as the .year 1801, and it fully sustained <em>Avery\u2019s </em>answer. But the commissioner, by restating the account, and charging interest from the proper dates, (as he supposed) which were anteriour to those from which the county commissioners had computed it, shewed, that, at the date of the sale of the slave <em>Eve, </em>there was a balance due from <em>Moore </em>the administrator, very nearly though not quite equal to the debts for which that slave was taken in execution and sold. The commissioner reported, that <em>Moore </em>had paid the guardian of <em>Mrs. Todd, </em>the full balance reported by the county commissioners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">The sheriff\u2019s sale of the slave <em>Eve, </em>and <em>Moore\u2019s </em>purchase of her, took place in 1797. There was nothing unfair in the sale itself. But, according to the depositions of two witnesses, <em>Moore </em>acknowledged at the time that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>indebted to his intestate\u2019s estate, and said, that he permitted the sale, and made the purchase, to save the property for the infant distributee, <em>Mrs. </em>Todd, who was his niece; that when she should attain to full age or marry, it would be delivered to her. She married <em>Todd </em>in 1810, while she was yet an infant; and <em>Todd, </em>was very soon afterwards informed of every fact concerning <em>Moore\u2019s </em>purchase of <em>Eve </em>and advised to bring a suit; but, though <em>Moore </em>lived till 1822, <em>Todd and wife </em>never asserted any claim against him in his lifetime: the bill in this case, was exhibited against his administrator, soon after his death, viz. in 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b471-5\">The chancellor, upon the final hearing, dismissed the bill, with costs: and <em>Todd and wife </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b471-6\"><em>Spooner, </em>for the appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApT\">endeavoured to shew, from the state of <em>the </em>accounts, that <em>Moore </em>was indebted to his intestate <em>Lee\u2019s </em>estate, in a balance sufficient to pay the debts for which the slave <em>Eve </em>was sold under execution in 1797, and ought to have paid those debts, and prevented the sale: and for that reason, if for no other, he ought to be regarded as a trustee of this property for the distributee. He was an administrator too, purchasing at a sheriff\u2019s sale, property belonging to his intestate\u2019s testate; and could not, any more than any other trustee, or in any other mode of sale, purchase the trust subject for his own benefit: in this view also, he ought to be regarded as a trustee for the distributee. Finally, <em>Moore </em>himself understood the transaction in the same light, and declared that he purchased for the benefit of the distributee. His subsequent assertion of a right to hold the property for himself, was a breach of trust, and a fraud. No lapse of time could give sanction to such a right, or bar the just claims of the <em>cestui que trust; </em>especially, as she had been, all the time, under the disability first of infancy, and then of coverture. He cited <em>Redwood </em>v. <em>Riddick, </em>4 Munf. 222. <em>Hunter\u2019s ex\u2019ors. </em>v. <em>Spotswood, </em>1 Wash. 145.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ADt\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number><em>Shands, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aep\">insisted, that the administration account, regularly audited and settled by the commissioners of the county court in 1801, ought not, at this late day, and under the circumstances of the case, to be opened; and that, if it were proper to open it, it was correctly stated: And this account shewed the perfect fairness of <em>Moore's </em>conduct. He examined the evidence; and controverted the proof of <em>Moore's </em>declaration that he purchased the slave <em>Eve </em>for the benefit of the distributee; but, it was in proof, that <em>Todd </em>was informed of the evidence now adduced of this declaration of <em>Moore, </em>and of every other fact of the transaction, soon after his marriage in 1810, and yet he never asserted this claim during the twelve years that <em>Moore </em>lived; a plain proof, that he himself had no confidence in its justice. To shew the impropriety of opening the accounts, he cited <em>Hudson &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Hudson's ex'or. </em>3 Rand. 117. As to the purchase by the administrator himself, of the property of his intestate, fairly made, at a sheriff\u2019s sale, at a time when there was no money in his hands to pay the debts for which such property was taken in execution; he cited <em>Anderson &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 245. to shew that such purchase could not be impeached. And, surely, after the long acquiescence of the appellants in these transactions, and that with full knowledge of every fact on which they now rely; coming at this late day, into a court of equity, to assert a claim against <em>Moore's </em>administrator, which they never ventured to assert against him in his lifetime; they could have no right to the relief they ask. See Sugd. law of Vend. ch. 14. \u00a7 2. in. pp. 483, 4.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b472-4\"> Ingraham\u2019s Edi. <em>Philadelphia, </em>1820.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b472-3\">Carr, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AoqX\">recapitulated the facts, and said, he was of opinion, that the decree dismissing the bill was right. It is due to the quiet of families, and to justice, that these old settlements should be suffered to sleep in their graves, and not be dug up, to frighten and disturb the descendants of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>those who were parties. <em>Lee </em>died in 1795. In the same year, <em>Moore </em>qualified as his administrator: and he lived till 1822. <em>Mrs. Todd </em>married in 1810; and in that year, her husband was told all the facts concerning the sale of <em>Eve, </em>and that he ought then to sue; yet this suit was not brought till late in 1823, thirteen years after, and after <em>Moore </em>the administrator had died. He could probably have explained many things which now have a bad appearance. The slave <em>Eve </em>was bought in 1797. Ever since that time, she and her increase have been at the risk of the purchaser: if all of them had died, his would have been the loss. He had them twenty-six years, before this suit was brought, and thirteen years after the present plaintiffs knew the facts, and ought to have sued : all this time, he has been the insurer of their lives. And now it is asked, of equity, that he shall restore the slave and her thirteen children and pay hires for them. 1 am against the whole bill; and think (as lord <em>Hardwicke </em>said, in a case not stronger) that it would be setting the worst example, that could be set, for the disturbance of families, to encourage such attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The other judges concurred, and the decree was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
