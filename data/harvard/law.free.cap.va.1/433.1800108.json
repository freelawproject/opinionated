Cooke: held, variance material, and notice insufficient.</p><p id=\"b445-7\">A <em>fieri facias, </em>sued out of the circuit court of <em>Stafford, </em>by the appellees against <em>George M. Cooke, </em>having been levied on his property, he together with <em>John Cooke, </em>his surety, gave bond for the forthcoming of the property at the day of sale, in the usual form; which was forfeited. A notice was given to the true obligors, of a motion to be made for award of execution on the bond: but it was addressed to <em>John .M. Cooke </em>(instead of <em>George J\\I. </em>Cooke) and <em>John Cooke; </em>and it described the bond as the bond of <em>John M. Cooke </em>(instead of <em>George </em>AT.) and <em>John Cooke. </em>It was objected at the hearing of the motion, that the notice did not truly describe the bond on which the motion was made, but on the contrary described a bond which did not exist; but, notwithstanding this variance, the circuit court awarded execution on the bond. The defendants applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</p><p id=\"b445-9\">The only point was the <em>misnomer </em>in the notice, of the principal <em>obligor\u2014John M. </em>instead of <em>George M. Cooke; </em>the effect of which was, that the notice described a different forthcoming bond from that on which the motion was in fact made.</p><p id=\"b445-10\">This court held the variance material and fatal, and reversed the judgment of the circuit court.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
