Cooke, </em>having been levied on his property, he together with <em>John Cooke, </em>his surety, gave bond for the forthcoming of the property at the day of sale, in the usual form; which was forfeited. A notice was given to the true obligors, of a motion to be made for award of execution on the bond: but it was addressed to <em>John .M. Cooke </em>(instead of <em>George J\\I. </em>Cooke) and <em>John Cooke; </em>and it described the bond as the bond of <em>John M. Cooke </em>(instead of <em>George </em>AT.) and <em>John Cooke. </em>It was objected at the hearing of the motion, that the notice did not truly describe the bond on which the motion was made, but on the contrary described a bond which did not exist; but, notwithstanding this variance, the circuit court awarded execution on the bond. The defendants applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-8\"><em>Green </em>for the plaintiffs in error, and <em>Briggs </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-9\">The only point was the <em>misnomer </em>in the notice, of the principal <em>obligor\u2014John M. </em>instead of <em>George M. Cooke; </em>the effect of which was, that the notice described a different forthcoming bond from that on which the motion was in fact made.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\"><p id=\"b445-6\">In a notice of a motion to be made on a forthcoming bond the bond is described by mistake as executed by <em>John </em>when it was in fact executed by <em>George </em>M. Cooke: held, variance material, and notice insufficient.</p><p id=\"b445-10\">This court held the variance material and fatal, and reversed the judgment of the circuit court.</p><p id=\"b445-11\"> He was absent during the whole of' this term, being a member of the convention, (which sat from the first Monday in October 1829, till the 15th January 1830) and constantly attending his duty there.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
