January.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-6\">A confession of judgment on a motion on a forthcoming bond, will operate as . a release of errors in the original judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b56-7\">Therefore, where an office judgment is erroneously entered up against the principal and <em>special </em>bail; the latter afterwards gives a forthcoming \"bond, and confesses judgment on the said bond, he cannot avail himself of the error in the original judgment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-8\">James Green brought two actions of debt against James Edmonds and John Edmonds, on single bills, in the superior court of Fauquier county. William Edmonds, the appellant, became their appearance bail. At a succeeding court, the appellant entered himself special bail. The defendants failing to appear, an office judgment was confirmed against them and \u201c William Edmonds security for their appearance.\u201d A <em>fieri facias </em>issued against the defendants and \u2018\u2018 William Edmonds jun. their <em>appearance bail.\u201d </em>Upon service of the execution, the defendants together with the appellant gave a forthcoming bond. The bond being forfeited, a motion was made against all the obligors, who gave a judgment <em>by consent. </em>William Edmonds the appellant (who had become special bail, but \u25a0against whom a judgment had been erroneously entered as <em>appearance bail) </em>then applied for, and obtained, a supersedeas, from a judge of this court, on the <em>original </em>judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-9\">\n<em>Briggs,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av9\">for the appellant, contended, that the original judgment was clearly erroneous, in being entered against the <em>special </em>bail; and the only question was, whether the confession of judgment on the forthcoming bond, operated as a release of errors in the original judgment. He contended, that it would not; because although the forthcoming bond is to some intents <em>dependent </em>on the <em>original </em>suit, yet it is not a <em>part </em>of that suit. The act of assembly<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>fore is fully satisfied in confining the release of errors, to the judgment on the forthcoming bond. The appellant had no opportunity on the motion on the forthcoming bond, to avail himself of the errors in the <em>original </em>judgment. If lie had attempted it. his attempt would have been fruitless. W hy then should his confession of judgment be construed indo a release of errors, to which he could not have excepted, in any mode of proceeding ? When the execution was served on him, he was compelled either to give bond, or to suffer his property to be sold. Having chosen the former alternative, he could not, by any means in his power, have averted the judgment. He acted throughout, under a species of duress. To confess a judgment, which could not be prevented in any legal mode, cannot surely come within the meaning of the act of assembly. That act can only reasonably apply to such errors as might be taken advantage of, if the confession had not been made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-6\">\n<em>Tucker,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AD\">for the appellee, contended : 1. Thai the. mere filing special bail does not discharge the appearance bail. The act of <em>assembly</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>declares, that, the appearance bail may be prodreeded against, if the principal does not both appear <em>and </em>give special bail. The word <em>and </em>cannot bo construed <em>or ; </em>because then <em>either </em>would suffice. But <em>appearing </em>without bail, will certainly not be sufficient,<footnotemark>(<em>c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>So that the word \u201c <em>and\u201d </em>cannot be construed \u201c <em>or\u201d </em>and it is just as insufficient to give bail without appearing, a a to appear without giving hail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-9\">If then it be insufficient to give bail without <em>appearings </em>the appellant cannot complain, for bis principal did <em>not </em>appear. The appearance bail did indeed enter into a recognizance as special bail, but there was no <em>appearance </em>entered for the principal; of course, under the act, the proceeding went on against both.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b57-10\">But, admitting that the judgment ought not to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>been entered against both, the appellant ought to have moved to have quashed the execution, and to correct the oiSce judgment before lie came here.<footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-7\">2. The confession of judgment has released all error. The judgment, on the delivery bond here, is entered <em>by consent </em>of the defendants, of whom the appellant was one. This is a confession of judgment in the strongest form j for, it not only acknowledges the right to a judgment on the merits, but assents to its entry, whatever errors there might have been. It is, perhaps, stronger than the case of <em>Cooke </em>and <em>Pope,</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>where the defendant agreed the plaintiff\u2019s <em>damages; </em>and stronger than <em>Leftwich </em>vs. <em>Stovall, </em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>That was a case of arbitration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-8\">Here there being a confession of judgment on the delivery bond, the act of assembly says it shall be equal to a release of errors. But it seems to be supposed, this confession operates to release the errors in the proceeding on the delivery bond alone. But this is too limited a construction. The object of the act was to prevent frivolous and vexatious objections, where a party had solemnly acknowledged on record, that the debt, for which he was sued, was just, and that he was willing he should have judgment for it. The act has been <em>construed</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to dispense with the necessity of a declaration. Of what importance can it be, whether the proceedings in the original cause were regular or irregular, if the judgment against the defendant is by himself acknowledged to be just?</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b58-9\">The proceedings on the forthcoming bond are in law considered as appendages to the original judgment, and proceedings, <footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The reversal of the original judgment reverses or annuls the judgment on the delivery bond, and the supersedeas to the former also supersedes the latter.<footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Briggs, replied.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b56-10\"> 1 Rev.
