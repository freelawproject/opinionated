The court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions to the report, and sent it back to the commissioner with instructions, by which he directed among other things, that commissions should be allowed.

As to <em>Jarrell Turner, </em>they con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tended that although he died before the passage of the act, yet <em>Benjamin Turner </em>having qualified as his administrator, it was the duty of <em>Benjamin </em>to have set-tied the account of <em>Jarrell\u2019s </em>administration as well as his own upon <em>Edmund Turner\u2019s </em>estate. For failing to perform this duty, <em>Benjamin Turner </em>may be responsible to <em>Jarrell Turner\u2019s </em>estate; but the terms of the law are plain. It was the business of <em>Benjamin Turner </em>to have performed this duty as well as any other -which his office of administrator imposed upon him; and he not having done so, <em>J. Turner\u2019s </em>estate must be subjected to the consequences of his neglect.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-3\"><em>C.

If such had been the intention it would have been so expressed. It would have given some time to the representative, in which to perform the duty. It would not have operated where there was no representative of the administrator. If indeed any duty had devolved on <em>Jarrell Turner </em>in his lifetime, then it might have been the duty of the administrator to perform it; but when he died, the act of 1825 was not in existence, and it was not his duty to settle his account.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b35-9\"> That act says: That henceforth it shall be the duty of every executor, administrator, curator or committee, who shall hereafter qualify or receive their appointment in any court within this commonwealth, within <em>two years from </em>the time of such qualification or appointment, and so in like manner in every two years thereafter, and of every executor, administrator, curator or committee, who shall heretofore have received his appointment, or qualified as aforesaid, within two years from the commencement of this act, and so in like manner in every two years thereafter, to apply to the court from which their powers emanate, to appoint a commissioner or commissioners to state, settle and adjust their accounts on the estate committed to their charge, as far as they may have progressed in administering the same; and it shall moreover be the duty of such executor, administrator, curator or committee, within six months after the said order shall have been procured, to cause his accounts to be settled before such commissioners, and such accounts, so settled and adjusted, to return to the proper court.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">Any executor, administrator, curator or committee, who shall fail to comply with the provisions of this act, shall forfeit all right to any commission or compensation whatever, for services rendered in administering so much of the estate of the testator or intestate, as shall not have been settled agreeably to the provisions of this act; and in no case where such failure may occur, shall any compensation for such service be allowed by the court to which such accounts may be rendered: <em>Provided however, </em>That the forfeiture of commissions hereby declared, shall not be incurred in any case in which within the periods above described for a settlement, the accounts of such executor, administrator, curator or committee, shall have boon actually settled with the parties entitled to the assets, or shall have been referred to a commissioner in chancery for settlement in a pending suit, and shall thereafter he actually settled in such suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b37-6\">The president</author>\n<p id=\"Adz\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">The court is of opinion that there is no error in the decree as against the representative of <em>Jarrell Turner </em>deceased; it is therefore considered that the same be affirmed; and that the appellants pay to the appellee, administrator of said <em>Jarrell Turner </em>his costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The court is further of opinion, that the claim of the appellee as administrator of the said <em>Benjamin </em>Turner, to commission or compensation for his services in admi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>nistering the estate of his intestate, was forfeited by his failure to comply with the provisions of the act of the 16th February 1825; it satisfactorily appearing that the said <em>Benjamin </em>lived more than two years after the passage 0f sa)\u00bf act. an(j faiied during his lifetime to settle any account of his administration.
