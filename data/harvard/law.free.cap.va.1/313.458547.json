Tazewell, executor of Benjamin Taliaferro, deceased, William McCandlish, and Mary Nelson, his wife, and others, defendants. The case disclosed by the bill, answers and exhibits, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Akb\"><em>Richard Taliaferro, </em>by bis will, devised two tracts of land in Brunswick and Dinwiddie, to his wife, Rebecca, during her widowhood 5 and at her death or marriage, to <em>Benjamin </em>and <em>Robert </em>Taliaferro, his sons, equally to be divided between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-13\">Benjamin Taliaferro intermarried with the complainant, <em>Sophia Ann, </em>and died leaving two infant children, Richard Henry and Henry T. Taliaferro, leaving a will, by which he appointed the complainant, <em>Sophia, </em>and <em>Littleton W. Tazewell, </em>his executors <em>$ </em>the latter of whom alone qualified, and took upon himself the office of executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-14\">The will of Benjamin Taliaferro, after providing for his widow, the complainant Sophia, directs, that all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>rest and residue of his estate, \u201c of what nature or kind soever, whether in possession, remainder, or reversion, may be sold by his executors, or such of them as shall qualify, \u201c <em>at any time, and in any manner he or they shall </em>\u201c <em>think proper. </em>And it is my will and desire, that the <em>t( </em>money arising from the sale of my property above spo<em>\u20186 </em>ken of (after payment of my just debts,) may be laid \u00ab out by my executors, or such of them as shall act, in \u00ab any manner they may think most advisable, so as to \u201c produce a certain annual <em>income; </em>and it is my will and <em>\u201c </em>desire, that this annual income may be <em>equally divided be- \u201c </em>tween my two sons, <em>Richard Henry </em>and <em>Henry Taliaferro, \u201c </em>each and every year, until either of my said sons attains <em>\u201c </em>the age of twenty-one years, or marries; at which time, I \u201c desire that one moiety of the principal may be assigned \u201c and transferred to him, in like manner as the other <em>** </em>moiety is given to his <em>brother; </em>but should either of my \u00ab said sons die before he attains the age of twenty-one, or \u201c marries, then it is my will and desire, that the other \u201c should succeed to his proportion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-7\"><em>Richard Henry </em>and <em>Henry Taliaferro, </em>both died under the age of twenty-one, and unmarried, and during the life of the aforesaid <em>Rebecca Taliaferro, </em>the widow of <em>Richard Taliaferro, </em>and possessed of the estate in question,, under the will of her husband.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-8\"><em>Rebecca Taliaferro </em>died shortly before the institution of this suit, without having married a second time, and consequently, without having forfeited the estate, under the will of her husband, <em>Richard Taliaferro.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-9\">No partition was ever made of the two tracts of land aforesaid, between the said <em>Benjamin </em>and his brother <em>Robert, </em>or their heirs; nor did Littleton W. Tazewell, the executor of <em>Benjamin Taliaferro, </em>ever execute the power vested in him by the will of the said <em>Benjamin, </em>of selling his estate in the lands aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-10\"><em>Sophia Ann Taliaferro </em>intermarried with <em>Larkin Smith </em>; and contends that she is entitled to all the interest which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>the said <em>Henry </em>and <em>Richard Taliaferro </em>had in the estate <em>J </em>4/ of the said <em>Benjamin Taliaferro; </em>as the mother of the said <em>Henry </em>and <em>Richard, </em>and the licit* at law of the survivor of them : that the complainants being the only persons entitled to the proceeds of the said sale, are at liberty to discharge the executor from the necessity of selling, and may elect to take the land itself. This suit was, therefore, brought against the executor and heirs of Benjamin Taliaferro, to compel the said executor to deliver up the said estate to the complainants, and to release all his right, title and interest in the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-4\"><em>Littleton W. Tazewell, </em>admits the allegation of the hill, and says that the reason why he has not exercised his power of selling is, that during the life of <em>Rebecca Taliaferro, </em>(who had but recently died,) he supposed that no sale of the reversion of an undivided property, could be made without an immense sacrifice; and that since the termination of the life estate, the right to the property being contested, he was unwilling to do any act which might affect the interest of either party. He professes his willingness either to make sale of the land, or to surrender his interest in it, in any manner or to any person that the court might direct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\">The heirs of the said <em>Benjamin Taliaferro </em>also answered, and contended, that <em>Richard </em>and <em>Henry Taliaferro </em>received the estate by purchase from their father, and therefore the real estate must descend to their <em>paternal </em>kindred; that the land devised, must be considered as <em>real </em>and not <em>personal </em>estate in a court of equity, under the circumstances of this case ; and that it was purchased, not from the <em>executor, </em>but <em>directly </em>from <em>Benjamin Taliaferro </em>himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">In the progress of tise cause, the suit abated as to the complainant <em>Sophia Ann Smith, </em>by her death, and was revived in the name of <em>Larkin Smith, </em>her administrator; and <em>Larkin Smith </em>having also died, it was revived in the name of <em>William Brooke, </em>administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of <em>Ann Sophia Smith </em>deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>The chancellor decided, that upon the principle of equithings agreed to be done, are to be considered as done; the real estate directed to be sold by the will, ought to be considered <em>personal </em>estate : that the widow of Ben<em>jamin Taliaferro </em>having survived her two sons, though she died in the life-time of her last husband, her personal representative, the plaintiff is entitled to the remaining proceeds of the sales thereof, when the same shall be made, and to the profits which have accrued or may accrue under the sales, first for the benefit of her creditors, and then to the use of those claiming under <em>Larkin Smith, </em>the last husband. And that, for these purposes, partitions and sales of the land ought to be made, and an account taken of their profits, as also of the administration of the estate of the said <em>Benjamin Taliaferro. </em>He therefore decreed, that certain commissioners should make partition of the said lands: that an account should be rendered of the rents and profits of the said lands, as well as of the administration of <em>Littleton W. Tazewell, </em>upon the estate of his testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\">From this interlocutory decree, the defendants obtained an appeal, by petition to the chancellor.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-5\"><em>Leigh </em>and <em>D. Robertson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b328-6\"><em>Stanard </em>and <em>Wickham, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">For the appellants, it was admitted, as a general <em>rule, </em>that land, directed to be sold, will, in equity, be considered as money ; but, in questions between the heir and legatee, the character of <em>personalty </em>must be <em>definitmely </em>fixed by the <em>testator.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The circumstances which will be relied on to prove that the character of personal estate is definitively fixed on the land devised by this will to be sold, are: 1st. That the money arising from the sale, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>to be laid out, so as to produce a <em>certain annual income. </em>But, such an income may arise, as well from <em>real </em>as <em>personal </em>estate. 2d. The word <em>principal, </em>may be supposed to indicate <em>personal </em>estate only. This construction, however, would be much too narrow, because it would exclude an investiture in many species of stock, which are declared by law to he real estate. 3. As little weight is to be attached to the expressions, <em>assign </em>and <em>transfer ; </em>for, these are equally applicable to <em>real </em>and <em>personal </em>estate; and, even if they were more appropriate to the latter, it should be remembered, that the words of a testator ought not to be examined with technical severity. 4. It may be said, that the mixture of real and personal estate in the will, gives the character of <em>personalty </em>to the whole mass. But, in the cases of <em>Durour </em>vs. <em>Motteux,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Jlckroyd </em>vs. <em>Smithson,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this circumstance was not allowed to have any weight.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2W\">But, the chief argument is, that the will does not direct the land to be sold <em>positively, </em>but only says it <em>may </em>be done. The executor has a discretion to sell the laud or not, as he may think proper ; and, therefore, it is not a conversion of the real estate into personal <em>out and out, </em>which all the authorities consider requisite.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKne\">If all these positions are incorrect, still the only purpose of the sale having failed, by the death of the children before the condition of the estate was changed, the real estate must descend to the heir. This doctrine is supported by the cases of <em>Cruse </em>vs. <em>Barley,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> Ckilty </em>vs. <em>Parker, </em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Berry </em>vs. <em>Usher.</em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The legacy had not vested at the time of the death of the children <em>;</em><footnotemark><em>(g)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor can it be considered as a conversion <em>out and out.</em><footnotemark><em>(h)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A20\">For the appellee, it was said, that the principle of equity being admitted, that lands directed to be sold will be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>sidered as money, the appellants must prove, either that this will does not afford a case for the application of the principle $ or, that by some subsequent event, the rule has ceased to operate. Both grounds are taken, and will be examined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\">1. As to the discretion given to the executor to sell or not, as he thinks proper, the will gives no discretion, except as to the <em>time </em>and <em>manner </em>of selling the property, but does not leave it to his pleasure to refrain from selling <em>altogether. </em>Circumstances might exist, which would render it inexpedient for the testator to fix any definite <em>time </em>or <em>manner </em>of selling, while, at the same time, it was his determination that the property should be sold. The testator evidently intended that the property should be sold before his sons arrived at twenty-one; because, he requires that the proceeds shall be laid out in such manner, as to produce a certain annual income, to be equally divided between his two sons, <em>until either of them shall attain the age of twenty-one </em>years, or <em>marries. </em>The word <em>may, </em>in this case, does not imply <em>discretion, </em>but is used imperatively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\">The devise is of a <em>mixed </em>subject of real and personal property, - both of which are to be applied to the <em>payment of debts, </em>which shall be so invested as to produce a <em>certain annual income. </em>One moiety of the <em>principal </em>is to be <em>assigned </em>and <em>transferred </em>to each of the children. All these terms are peculiarly applicable to <em>personal </em>estate. The case of <em>Doughty </em>vs. <em>Bull,</em><footnotemark><em>(i)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>shews that discretionary words in a will, may be considered as imperative. It is a rule of equity, that the character given to property by the testator is to be retained, unless the legatee make his election to take it in a different <em>character.</em><footnotemark><em>(j)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-9\">2. It is said, that the purposes of the will having failed by the death of the children, the land will remain in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>original condition of <em>real property. </em>But, the purposes of the will have not failed. The children survived the testator, and their legacy was a <em>vested </em>one. The <em>failure </em>contemplated by the law, is <em>a failure to vest, </em>or where there is a <em>lapse </em>of the legacy. In every case of a <em>vested </em>legacy, the character impressed by the testator on the property, attaches <em>immediately, </em>and can only be altered by the <em>election </em>of a person competent to make an <em>election.</em><footnotemark><em>(k)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The authorities cited by the counsel for the appellants, to prove that this <em>legacy </em>had not vested, have no application. There is no case where a personal subject is given at a particular time, and interest in the mean time, the legacy is not considered as <em>vested, </em><footnotemark><em>(l)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\"> 2 Ves. jun.

It is clearly a vested interest, unless a different result be produced by the testator having left the time of selling, to the discretion of the executor. In every instance of a sale by an executor, some time must, of necessity, elapse between the death of the testator, and the <em>sale; </em>and something is almost invariably left to the discretion of the executor, as to the time of selling. Yet that makes no difference where, as in this case, the direction to sell is imperative. It has never been doubted, that the devisee or legatee,.for whose benefit a sale is thus directed, takes by the will, ars <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>immediate vested interest; nor has it ever been held, that the death of the devisee or legatee before the sale, defeated that interest, unless there was some provision in the will, <em>to that </em>effect. Under <em>stick </em>circumstances, tlie interest in ^ie Procee(is the sale, is as much a vested interest, as if the land itself had been immediately and directly devised to the devisee. The circumstance in this case, that the testator had only a remainder in the land, expectant on the death of his mother, will not vary the construction, in this particular, which ought to be given to the will. He was well informed of his interest in this land, and yet he expressly subjects to sale, all his estate whether in possession, remainder or reversion. He may have been aware, that circumstances might, by possibility, render it essential to his children, that the sale should be made, before the life-estate might fall in; and he very prudently left the time of the sale, to the discretion of the executors.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The interests, therefore, intended for the children of the said Benjamin Taliaferro, vested at his death ; and there ' being nothing in the will to defeat them, they were continuing interests at the deaths of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">It becomes important to enquire, in the next place, what was the nature and character of those interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">It is an established principle, \u201c that money directed to <em>\u201c </em>be employed in the purchase of land, and laud directed <em>\u201c to be </em>sold, and turned into money, are to be considered \u201c as that species of property into which they are directed \u201c to be converted.\u201d The English reporters abound with cases upon this subject; and there is no part of the law more firmly established, or better understood. The important question in such cases is, whether the character of land or money is definitively and imperatively affixed, by the will, to the property ; for, the character thus impressed upon it, will remain so impressed, until some person having a right to elect, elects to take it in its original character. <em>Ashby </em>vs. <em>Palmer.</em><footnotemark><em>(m)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Land, therefore, thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>impressed with the character of money, will, until election he made to take it as land, pass as money, although it has not been actually converted into money. Thecounsel for the appellants relied upon the principle laid down, in <em>Walker </em>vs. <em>Denne,</em><footnotemark><em>(n)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the property will pass according to the state in which it happens to be at the death of the person from whom it is claimed. But, that principle has been repeatedly overruled. <em>Wheldale </em>vs. <em>Partridge; </em><footnotemark><em>(o)</em></footnotemark><em> Biddulph </em>vs. <em>Biddulph ;</em><footnotemark><em>(p)</em></footnotemark><em> Kirkman </em>vs. <em>Miles :</em><footnotemark><em>(q)</em></footnotemark><em> Ashby </em>vs. <em>Palmer, </em><footnotemark><em>(r)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The other cases, relied on by the counsel for the appellants, have no application. In all of these, there was, from some cause or other, a resulting trust, in whole or in part, for the. heir at law of the testator. But, in the case before us, the conversion into money is imperative, \u201c <em>to every </em>intent, <em>out and </em>outand the whole proceeds of sale, after payment of debts, are given, as personal property, to the two sons of the testator ; and it is to <em>them, or the survivor of them, </em>that the succession must now be made. There is then no foundation whatever for any claim on the part of the heirs at law of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">If there were no persons other than the present parties, who might claim an interest in this controversy, the court, pursuing the principles above declared, would affirm the decree of the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">But, it appears that after the death of the two sons of the testator, Benjamin Taliaferro, their mother, to whom the property in controversy had passed at the death of the survivor of them, as his next of kin, intermarried with Larkin <em>Smith; </em>and that the said Smith and his wife instituted this suit, as the only persons interested in the sale of the land, claiming, by their bill, to discharge the executor from the necessity of selling, and electing to take the land itself. If this election had any operation in fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Vor 0f the wife, in restoring the land to its original cha,a. , racter, as land, it may become important to her heirs at law, as she died before the termination of the suit, and befare the land was reduced to possession by the husband, to enquire whether her rights therein descended to them. On this point, the court expresses no impression even, farther than to say, that it is a subject on which the heirs at law ought to have an opportunity to be heard before a final decree. The decree is therefore reversed, with costs to the appellees, as having substantially prevailed <em>; </em>and the cause is remanded to the court of chancery, with directions to make the heirs at law of Mrs. Smith, parties.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Azh\"> Judge Brooke did not sit in this cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(m)\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\"> 1 Merivale, 296. 2 Maddock, 108,9, 10; and the cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(n)\">\n<p id=\"A40\"> 2 Vesey, 170.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(o)\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\">8 Ves. 227.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(p)\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\"><em> </em>12 Ves. 161.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(q)\">\n<p id=\"ABj\"> 13 Ves. 338.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(r)\">\n<p id=\"AT7\"><em> </em>1 Merivale, 296.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
