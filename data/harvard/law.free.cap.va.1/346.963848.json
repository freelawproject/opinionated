Code of 1819, ch. 104. \u00a7 <em>13. </em>it is sufficient in such bill to aver in general terms that the writing of which probat has been received is not the will of the decedent.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b374-13\">An answer to a bill contesting the validity of a will states, that some of the plaintiffs had accepted legacies and deyises under the will; and the fact appears to be so by exhibits filed with the answer. After verdict and decree against the will, the objection is taken in an appellate court, that those parties had precluded themselves from disputing the validity of the will, and that as they are improperly joined with the other plaintiffs, the suit cannot be sustained. Held, the objection will not avail.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b374-14\">On the trial of an issue whether a writing, admitted to probat as a will, be the will of the decedent or not, the evidence against the will consists of statements by witnesses, of what a legatee told them had passed on one occasion when he and the decedent were together. That legatee is one of many defendants, and it does not appear that he refused to testify. The admissibility of such evidence questioned before the appellate court by counsel, but not decided.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b374-15\">On the trial of an issue whether a writing, admitted to probat as a will, was the will of the decedent or not, it appeared that the ' decedent had made a codicil to his will, and that the codicil was afterwards destroyed by his direction. The evidence tended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>shew that the will was written on one sheet of paper, and the codicil on another; that the will was left with one person, and the codicil with another; and that the will and codicil were with . ..... those persons respectively, at the time the codicil was destroyed, The circuit court instructed the jury, that if they believed from the evidence, that the decedent intended, at the time of destroying the codicil, thereby to destroy or revoke the will, in that case the destruction of the codicil was a revocation of both the will and codicil. Held, this instruction was erroneous.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b375-8\">Although a testator has directed his will to be destroyed, and believes that it has been destroyed as requested, yet if it be not in fact destroyed, such direction and belief will not operate as a revocation of the will, even in relation to the personal estate.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-9\"><em>David M.

On the sixth of March 1837, the will was proved in the court of <em>Greenesville </em>county by <em>M. H. Hobbs </em>and <em>William F.

The decedent having left no descendants, no father, mother, brother or sister, no descendant of his mother or of any brother or sister, and no <em>grandfather or grandmother, </em>the suit was brought by uncles and aunts and their descendants, to wit, by <em>William H. Hobbs </em>and <em>Martha </em>his wife, and others. Among the plaintiffs were <em>Franky Wilkins </em>and the children of the decedent\u2019s aunts <em>Elizabeth Wyche </em>and <em>Sally Davis. </em>The only allegations in the bill impeaching the validity of the will, were in these terms: \u201cYour complainants deem it unnecessary to refer your honour to the various bequests contained in said paper, or to allude to the remarkable fact that a sensible man should die with such a will, his wife living, and not the least' preparation of any kind made for her comfort and support. Your complainants think it only necessary to state their thorough conviction, and they therefore charge, that said paper was not the will of <em>David M. </em>Malone.\u201d The prayer of the bill was for an issue <em>devisavit vel non, </em>and that the court would set aside the will. <em>Edmunds Mason </em>as administrator with the will annexed and in his own right, <em>Frances Mason </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>his wife, <em>John Y.

He then proceeded to set forth such circumstances as he knew in relation to the testamentary dispositions of the testator. <em>John </em>Y. <em>Mason </em>also, in his answer, detailed such circumstances as were in his knowledge. But these answers not being evidence in favour of the defendants,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it is not deemed necessary or proper to narrate the circumstances set forth by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-5\">None of the other defendants answered except <em>Baxter Wilson </em>the brother and administrator of the widow, who stated that <em>Edmunds Mason, </em>the principal legatee in the will of <em>Malone, </em>did, soon after the death of <em>Malone, </em>by deed of gift (which respondent filed with his answer) generously convey to the brothers and sisters of mrs. <em>Malone </em>all the slaves which <em>Malone </em>acquired by his marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-6\">The cause (after a previous trial elsewhere, on which the jury disagreed) was removed to the circuit court of <em>Petersburg, </em>and an issue was directed to be tried on the common law side of that court, to ascertain whether the writing purporting to be the will of <em>Malone </em>was in fact his valid will. The trial took place on the seventeenth and eighteenth of November 1841.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b377-7\">At the trial, the bill, answers and exhibits were read to the jury, and on motion of the plaintiffs the court in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>structed the jury that the answers were not evidence for the defendants, except so far as they were responsive to the bill. The defendants, in support of the issue on their part, adduced the following evidence : 1. The will an(^ Pr\u00b0bat thereof. 2. They proved by the subscribing witnesses to the will, that at or about the date thereof, and when the testator was unmarried, he came to their store, one morning before breakfast, <em>from </em>the direction in which he lived, produced the writing, and requested them to witness it; which, upon due acknowledgment thereof by him, they did, by subscribing their names thereto in his presence. One of the said witnesses further staled that <em>D. M.

Witness then asked him if the law would dispose of his properly as he wished <em>l He </em>replied, it would not. Witness then urged him to make his will without losing any time. He said he would do so the next morning. But he died before it was done. The next morning, witness went over to the testator\u2019s, and found <em>E. Mason </em>there. Witness said to him, <em>\u201c </em>I suppo.se judge\u201d (meaning the testator,) \u201c has died without making any provision for his wife, as he has .left no will.\u201d <em>E.

Mason) </em>threw the codicil into the fire. Witness is certain that the expression which <em>E. Mason </em>told him he used to the testator was, \u201c I suppose we may as well burn <em>those papers,\u201d </em>and that the reply he said the testator made was, \u201c Destroy them ; they are of no force now.\u201d The witness mentioned that dr. <em>Parham </em>and himself were called on by <em>John Y.

He also mentioned an expression of the testator, disapproving the conduct of a man who had not made, as he thought, proper provision for his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-5\">2. <em>Thomas Jones ; </em>who deposed to similar expressions by the testator about that same person, and a declaration by him that he would rather his wife should have what he had, than any other person.

Mr. <em>Mason </em>spoke of it as a will. I heard, I think, from him or some other person, that he (mr. <em>Mason) </em>had sent for it to <em>John Y.

Dr. <em>Thomas Parham, </em>the attending physician of the testator in his last illness, who had been living in testator\u2019s family for several years before his death. He heard testator say, about four or six weeks before his last illness, that he intended to leave all his property to his wife. The night before his death, after some conversation about his situation, he remarked that he would not die without a will, or making a will, (witness does not recollect which,) for some large sum of money which he named. Witness then offered to bring pen, ink and paper, that one might be written. He said he would put it off till the next morning, when he would do it the first thing. But he died just before light the next morning. After mentioning the terms on which he and the testator were, and the happy manner in which the testator and his wife lived together, the witness deposed, that in a conversation which took place between himself and <em>E. Mason </em>at <em>David M. Malone's </em>residence, the day after his death, <em>Mason </em>asked the witness if <em>David M. Malone </em>had done any act which would revoke a will ? stating that there was a will in the possession of <em>J.

M. Malone\u2019s </em>death, as above mentioned. In that conversation mr. <em>Mason </em>told witness, that <em>David M. Malone </em>had made a codicil to his will, which disposed of negroes acquired after making his will, and that the first time he came to his (E. <em>Mason's) </em>house a few weeks after his marriage, he <em>(Ma</em>son) said to testator, in substance, (witness cannot depose to the words), \u201c I suppose the paper or papers are of no use now,\u201d and that testator replied, \u201c Yes, destroy or burn them,\u201d (witness does not recollect which,) \u201c I have got somebody else to leave my property to now.\u201d Witness never heard <em>Malone </em>speak of having a will.

The deposition of <em>Nathaniel Young, </em>who, since giving it, has died. This witness deposed, that in the last week of November 1835, he was at the house of <em>\u25a0John </em>T. <em>Mason </em>in the county of <em>Southampton, </em>and <em>David Malone </em>came to said <em>Mason\u2019s, </em>where he spent the day and staid all night. He slept in the same bed with deponent. While in bed, <em>Malone </em>asked deponent wbat could be the reason that his wife would not have a child ? to which deponent said, \u201c The reason is that you are deficient and cannot perform your part.\u201d <em>Malone </em>replied it was not his fault, but there was a defect or disease about his wife that would certainly prevent her from breeding, and he had made up his mind never to alter bis will unless his wife had a child. Deponent then asked him if he kept a will by him, to which <em>Malone </em>answered, \u201c Cousin <em>John Y. </em>wrote my will <em>before </em>I was married, and had it to take care of for me, and I am determined never to take it out of his possession or alter it, unless my wife shall have a child; for there is a blamed set of folks gaping round me for what they think I will give them, but they shall be disappointed.\u201d Deponent then, in a joking manner, asked <em>Malone </em>if he had remembered him (deponent) in making his will ? He replied no, he had given his property to those who had been his best friends; and stated that he had given his cousin <em>John Y. </em>some negroes, to doctor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>George Mason </em>a boy and his old horse <em>Baptist, </em>to <em>Eliza Mallory </em>wife of colonel./. <em>B.

The plaintiffs examined several witnesses to prove that mrs. <em>Malone </em>was in good health until a few months before her death. And the defendants admitted that <em>Young </em>was about 60 or 70 years old, and the brother of mrs. <em>Edmunds Mason.)</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\"><em>2.

On ascending the stairs, I heard mr. <em>Malone </em>and mr. <em>Young </em>in conversation. I did not understand on what subject they were conversing. I well recollect waking several times during the night, and at each time they were in conversation. I recollect distinctly asking mr. <em>Young </em>what he and mr. <em>Malone </em>could find to talk about on the occasion alluded <em>to; </em>and added, that they could not have slept any that night. Mr. <em>Young </em>replied that they did not sleep much ; for <em>David </em>was telling him, nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the whole night, of his will, and of an affection of his <em>. </em>wife. I do not recollect the precise time that these questions were propounded to mr. <em>Young, </em>but believe it was the next day.\u201d <em>BoyJcin </em>stated that he was a son in law both of mr. <em>Young </em>and of <em>Edmunds Mason. \u00b0</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_u\">_ 4. <em>Nathaniel P.

Shortly afterwards, doctor <em>Geo?ge Mason </em>and the witness retired to a room adjoining the one in which his father and <em>Malone </em>were. The statement of the witness is then as follows: \u201c They were in conversation when we retired, and continued it so long as I was awake. When my father and myself arrived at home, I enquired what could have engaged him and <em>David </em>so much in conversation when they slept together at judge <em>Mason's. </em>His answer was, that <em>David (or </em>the judge, as he called him) was talking of his will. This was in my father\u2019s chamber.

He and mr. <em>Mason's </em>overseer <em>{Davis) </em>witnessed it. It was on a small piece of paper, and witness saw nothing but the name \u201c <em>Cynthia.'' </em>He did not know what it was. In March before testator\u2019s death, witness went to his house to have a settlement with him, and witness and testator went hunting. Testator advised witness to get married, saying he had been much happier since he was a married man, and would be more so but for his wife\u2019s situation. In the course of the evening, testator said he had a will, and did not intend to be without one, (he did not say where his will was;) that there were a set of fools gasping after his property, who should never have it. He did not say who they were. He said, he never expected his wife to have a child. After testator told witness he had a will, witness asked him what the paper was he had witnessed ?

This paper was executed before the marriage of the said <em>David M. Malone, </em>and bequeathed those negroes to the defendant <em>E.

Mason, </em>and that he now states he does not know what was in it (the paper), he said in answer, that he had no explanation;, his deposition and evidence would speak for themselves.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-6\">In the same deposition, being asked whether he ever had any conversation with <em>Malone </em>about his will after his marriage, he said, \u201c I did. About 10 or 12 months before his death, he was advising this deponent to get married, said he had been happier since his marriage, that there were some people gasping after his property who should never have it, that he had made his will and never intended to be without one. He did not designate who they were, or call any names. The said <em>Malone\u2019s </em>wife was in bad health, and he told this deponent that he never expected any child. Mrs. <em>Malone </em>was very ill when <em>David M. Malone </em>died, and survived him but a few weeks. <em>David M. Malone </em>was much attached to <em>E. Mason </em>and <em>L. G. Heath, </em>which attachment was never interrupted.\u201d And now upon cross examination, being asked by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, whether mrs. <em>Malone </em>was in bad health when he and the testator went hunting? and having answered that he did not know whether she was or not, the witness was then asked to account for the fact that he had stated in his deposition that she was in bad health at that time. He answered, that he did not know any thing about it, except that <em>David M. Malone told </em>him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b386-7\">In the same deposition, being asked whether he ever heard from <em>Malone </em>where' his will was, or any thing about his will, he said, \u201cI never did. I heard him say he had one.\u201d And being further asked how often did he ever hear <em>David M. Malone </em>speak of his will, he said, \u201c Never but once, and that as stated above.\u201d And now upon his cross examination, being asked by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, if he did not say, on the first trial of this cause, that he had had several conversations with <em>Malone </em>on the subject of his will, he replied that he <em>might </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>have said so. If he did, he meant that they were all the same evening. He does not recollect whether he said they were all on the same evening or not, at the first trial, because he does not recollect that the question was asked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AUaN\">_ _ _ In the same deposition, being asked whether <em>D. M. Malone </em>ever told him what became of the codicil, he answered, \u201c He never did. He told me after his marriage that that paper was then of no account.\u201d And being further asked whether be gave any reason why the codicil to his will was then of no account, he answered, \u201cHe did not.\u201d And now upon his cross examination, being reminded of his stating that <em>Malone </em>told him that the codicil was burnt or destroyed, and being asked how he accounted for having sworn in his deposition positively that he did not tell what had become of it, he answered, that after giving his deposition, in reflecting, he recollects that <em>Malone </em>did tell him the codicil was burnt or destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-5\">The defendants moved the court to give the two following instructions to the jury: 1. If the jury believe that the will was written on a sheet of paper, and the codicil on another sheet or piece, then the mere destruction of the codicil did not revoke the will. <em>2. </em>If the jury believe that the testator intended, at the time of destroying the codicil, to destroy or revoke the will, but reserved the destruction or revocation thereof as matter to be afterwards carried into effect, and did no further act to revoke or destroy it, in that case the destruction of the codicil, though done with the intention thereafter to revoke or destroy the will, did not amount to a revocation or destruction of the will. And the plaintiffs opposed the same. But the court gave both instructions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b387-6\">The court, however, on the motion of the plaintiffs, added the following:\u2014But if the jury believe from the evidence, that <em>Malone </em>directed the will to be destroyed, and thought that it was destroyed as requested, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>court then instructs the jury that the said will, so far as it related to the personal estate, was revoked in law, although it might not in fact have been destroyed. Moreover, if they shall believe from the evidence, that <em>Malone </em>intended, at the time of destroying the codicil, thereby to destroy or revoke the will, in that case the destruction of the codicil was a revocation of both the will and codicil. To the instruction so added by the court, the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-4\">On the 19th of November 1841, a verdict was found against the validity of the will. When the jury rendered their verdict, they requested permission to state in open court, and did state, that they did not design or intend by their said verdict to cast the least censure on the conduct or character of <em>Edmunds Mason </em>or <em>John Y. Mason, </em>but that their verdict resulted from the opinion, unanimously held by them, that <em>David M. Malone, </em>in the act of destroying the codicil to his will, intended thereby to revoke or destroy the will also. And the court, uniting with the jury in exempting <em>Edmunds Mason </em>and <em>John Y. Mason </em>from all censure, did, with the consent of parties, make a memorandum to this effect part of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">The defendants, after the rendition of the verdict, moved the court to certify that the verdict was against evidence ; but the court overruled the motion, and the defendants excepted to the opinion.

By what act has the will of the decedent in this cas\u00e9 been revoked ? Not by making a codicil to it; for even if that had made a disposition of any part of the estate different from the will, it would only be a revocation <em>pro tanto. </em>Not by the marriage; for that without the birth of a child is no revocation. And not by any verbal declarations of the testator; for even if the will were of personalty merely, it would be protected by the provision in the statute declaring that \u201c no will in writing or any devise therein of chattels shall be revoked by a subsequent will, codicil or declaration, unless the same be <em>in wri</em>ting.\u201d 1 R. C. 1819, p. 377. \u00a7 9. In the language of judge <em>Roane, </em>in <em>Cogbill </em>v. <em>Cogbill &amp;c. </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. <em>512. </em>the will submitted is to prevail unless a posterior will was not only <em>contemplated </em>but actually executed. \u201c In the case,\u201d says he, \u201c of a will of personalty, such a will remains in force under our statute, until legally revoked by another will <em>in writing, </em>conforming in other respects to the law as established on the subject. The question is therefore not whether the will submitted for probat is the last will the testator intended to execute, but whether, being once sanctioned as a will, it has been nullified by any subsequent act or testament.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-8\">In <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Kniffen, 2 </em>Johns. Rep. 31. the will was one of lands, but the principle adjudged is equally applicable to a will of personalty; for, as <em>Spencer, </em>J. said, (p. 36.) \u201c a will, whether of real or personal estate, cannot be revoked since the statute of 29 Charles II. by words alone.\u201d The declarations by the testator, of which evidence was offered in that case, were of the most solemn character, but the evidence was rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>as inadmissible, because such declarations could have no effect against the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-8\">Where, after a will is made, the'circumstances occur of marriage and the birth of a child, the revocation of the will takes place in consequence of a rule or principle of law, independently altogether of any question of intention of the party himself, and consequently no evidence is admissible to shew an intention that it should not be revoked. Such is the <em>unanimous </em>opinion of the judges of <em>England, </em>pronounced after the profoundest argument and the malurest deliberation, in the late case of <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>8 Adolph. &amp; Ell. 14. 35 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 303. Where the only circumstance occurring after the will is that of marriage, and no revocation takes place in consequence of any rule or principle of law, parol evidence must be equally inadmissible to shew an intention to revoke. In the language of sir <em>William Folletl </em>in the case just referred to, (p. 315.) \u201csince the statute of frauds, the most direct expression of an intent to revoke avails nothing unless intimated by the means there pointed out.\u201d \u201cSuppose,\u201d says <em>Alderson, </em>B. (p. 313.) \u201c the testator, after marriage, has clearly declared his intention that the will shall be revoked, and he afterwards changes his mind and declares his intention that it shall take effect, is the will ambulatory in the mean time? and where are such changes to stop?\u201d \u201cIf,\u201d says <em>Tindal, </em>C. J. (p. 325.) \u201c against the intention to revoke, which is presumed by law, parol evidence of a contrary intention could be admitted, such as evidence of conduct of the testator leading to the inference that he meant the will to stand, or of declarations to that effect, then it would be but reasonable to allow such evidence to be met and encountered by evidence of conduct of the testator leading to a different inference, and of declarations contradictory to the former. And again, the admission of such evidence leads to this further difficulty, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>that if the testator changes his first intention and adopts . . . . a contrary one, which of the two intentions is to prevail? Is it to be the first, which is clearly proved, or is the latest formed intention, like the last will, to be allowed to predominate? It was precisely to preserve us from the perplexity and uncertainty of such conflicting evidence, both in the making and revoking of wills, that some of the provisions of the statute of frauds were expressly framed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-13\">It is true that in the case of <em>Marston </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>the question related to the revocation or non-revocation of a will devising real property; and it may be said that in a case of personalty, where the question is as to what shall or shall not be a testamentary paper, or what shall or shall not amount to a revocation of a will, the evidence bearing on those points is frequently composed, in part, of the declarations of the parly. The reason is, that under the law of <em>England, </em>and under the law of <em>Virginia </em>as it formerly stood, a will of chattels might be made or revoked by a writing not signed by the party or subscribed by any witness. <em>Glasscock </em>v. <em>Smither &amp;c. </em>1 Call 479. And declarations and other evidence were necessarily let in to shew that at the time of the writing there was the <em>animus testandi </em>or the <em>animus revocandi. </em>The writing offered as a will could not be valid where there was not the <em>animus testandi, </em>and the writing offered as a revocation could not be valid as a revocation where there was not the <em>animus revocandi. </em>So too where the will is alleged to be revoked by the testator\u2019s destroying, cancelling or obliterating the same, or causing it to be done in his presence, whether the will be of realty or personalty, two things must concur: there must first be shewn an act of destroying, cancelling or obliterating, and then it is secondly to be ascertained whether this act was done <em>animo revocandi. </em>And in all such cases the declarations of the testator, accompanying the act, are evidence to shew the <em>quo animo. </em>This view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>of the ground on which such declarations are admitted js adverted to by <em>Woodworth, </em>J. in <em>Dan &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Brown &amp;c. </em>4 Cow. 490. \u201c The <em>execution of the </em>will,\u201d he observes, \u201cbeing established, the next question is, whether there was any evidence that it was cancelled. On this point, I lay no stress upon the declarations of the testator. They were made long after the execution of the will, and shortly before his death. They are not evidence unless they relate to the <em>res gesta, </em>or to an act done, as where by mistake the will <em>is </em>lorn or thrown into the fire. The declarations of the testator are in such cases evidence, where they shew the <em>quo animo. </em>The act of cancelling is in itself equivocal, and will be governed by the intent.\u201d Moreover, if there was formerly any difference between the admissibility of parol evidence to shew a revocation of a will of realty, and the admissibility of such evidence to shew a revocation of a will of personalty, that difference must now be considered at an end, since the act of the 4th of March 1835. Sess. Acts 1834-5, p. 43. ch. 60. Sess. Acts 1839-40, p. 50. ch. 57. \u00a7 2. Opinion of <em>Stanard, </em>J. in. <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>Barksdale, </em>decided in March 1842.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-6\">There being in this case no <em>writing </em>of any kind offered as a revocation of the will, one of the grounds above alluded to for admitting parol evidence, <em>viz. </em>to shew the intent at the time of the writing, is of course inapplicable to this case. And before the evidence can be received to shew the <em>animus </em>with which an act of destroying, cancelling or obliterating was done, such an act must be first established. The intent to destroy, cancel or obliterate will not suffice, unless the intent be carried into execution. <em>Perkes </em>v. <em>Perkes &amp;c. 3 </em>Barn. &amp; Ald. 489. 5 Eng. Com.

In a note at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the end of the case of Reed v. <em>Harris, </em>it is stated that in a subsequent case between the same parlies, upon nearly the same evidence, it was decided that the will was revoked as to <em>copyhold </em>lands. That subsequent case is in 8 Adolph. &amp; Ell. 1. 35 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 299; and the reason of it is that the statute of 29 Car. 2. ch. 3. has been held not to apply to <em>copyhold </em>lands. See <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Barnes &amp; wife, 2 </em>Vern. 597. <em>Tuffnell </em>v. <em>Page, 2 </em>Atk. 37. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>7 East 299. But the reason for this decision as to <em>copyhold </em>lands does not apply in <em>Virginia </em>to any kind of estate known here, our statute declaring, as before mentioned, that no will in writing, even of chattels, shall be revoked by any subsequent declaration unless <em>in writing. </em>Accordingly, in <em>Boyd &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>3 Leigh 32. where the testator was a blind man, and the parties contesting the probat offered to prove an admission by a daughter of the testator, who had written his will, that she had been directed by her father to destroy the will, and that he believed it was done, the court of appeals <em>held </em>this not to be proof of revocation, and admitted the will to full probat as well in respect of personal as of real estate. <em>Carr, </em>J. said, \u201c Mere parol directions given to a person to destroy the will can never satisfy the requisitions of the statute; and to suffer them, would be to incur the very danger the statute meant to avoid.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-12\">This decision of the courl of appeals, and the other authorities before cited, have been disregarded by the circuit court. For the circuit court instructed the jury that if they believed from the evidence, that <em>Malone </em>directed the will to be destroyed, and thought that it was destroyed as requested, then the will, so far as it related to the personal estate, was revoked in law, although it might not in fact have been destroyed. And in this instruction the appellants insist there is manifest error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-13\">The other instruction is a very curious one, in reference to the evidence, which tended to shew that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>will was written on one sheet of paper, and the codicil on another, that the will was left with <em>John T. Mason </em>and the codicil with <em>Edmunds Mason, </em>and that the will and codicil were in these places respectively at the time the codicil was destroyed. The instruction is, that # \u2019 if the jury believe from the evidence, that <em>Malone </em>intended, at the time of destroying the codicil, thereby to destroy or revoke the will, in that case the destruction of the codicil was a revocation of both the will and codicil. Now, if the two papers, instead of being a will and codicil, had been duplicates of the same will, and the court had instructed the jury that if they believed that the dec\u00e9dent, at the time of destroying one copy, intended thereby to revoke the will, the destruction of one copy was in such case a revocation of the will, such an instruction would be intelligible enough. But when the two papers, in different places, are of wholly different tenor, when one is a will and the other a codicil, and the paper destroyed is not <em>the will but the </em>codicil, it is difficult to comprehend how the destruction of the codicil can be a revocation of the will. If the will were destroyed, then the codicil being <em>prima facie </em>dependent on the will, the cancellation of the will is an implied revocation of the codicil. 1 Williams on Executors 76. But there is no foundation for the converse of this proposition. A will is not dependent on the codicil, and the cancellation of the <em>codicil, so far from </em>being a revocation of the will, is evidence rather that the will was intended to remain as it was before that codicil was made. If the intention to destroy a will be not sufficient to revoke it without an act destroying it, and if the destruction of a codicil in one place does not of itself destroy the will in a different place, it follows that the destroying tire codicil, no matter with what intention, is not a revocation of the will. Yet the circuit court instructed the jury otherwise. And it was this instruction which caused the verdict that was found. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number><em>For </em>the jury have declared that their verdict resulted from the opinion that the decedent, in the act of destroying the codicil to his will, intended thereby to re- , j , ... , voke or destroy the will also.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdWb\">With the verdict that was found, the court of chaneery ought not to have been satisfied. It was without evidence to support it. The declarations of the testator, deposed to by the witnesses of the plaintiffs, tended merely to shew that after his marriage he considered his will as not in force, and intended to make a will providing for his wife. They do not shew that there was any new will made, or any valid act of revocation. And the only other evidence adduced against the will consists of statements by <em>Weaver </em>and dr. <em>Parham, </em>of what <em>Edmunds Mason </em>told them had passed on one occasion when he and the decedent were together. The admissibility of such evidence as this is very questionable, <em>Osgood </em>v. <em>The Manhattan Company, </em>3 Cow. 623. <em>The Hartford Bank </em>v. <em>Hart, 3 </em>Day 493. especially as it does not appear that <em>Edmunds Mason </em>was called on and refused to testify. See opinion of <em>Bayley, J. </em>in <em>The King </em>v. <em>The Inhabitants of Hardwick, </em>11 East 590. But whether admissible or not, the statements are too vague and uncertain to have much weight against <em>Edmunds Mason, </em>and they are entitled to still less against the other legatees. <em>They </em>certainly ought not to be <em>concluded </em>by a verdict found upon the statements of one out of many legatees under the will, detailed second-hand, when even according to those statements there was no act destroying, cancelling or obliterating the will. But the case is not merely one in which there is an absence of evidence on the part of the plaintiffs to establish a revocation of the will. The testimony of several corroborating witnesses, adduced by the defendants, and relating to different times and conversations, shews the sense of the testator, long after the act of destroying the codicil, that the will was a subsisting will. <em>Bates </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>v. <em>Holman, </em>3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 502. Now we do not admit that the will is invalidated by an intent to burn it, even if such intent were <em>established, (the will itself </em>remaining in existence). But suppose the testator did intend should be burnt, yet if he afterwards knew that it was in existence, and intended that it should stand for his will, evidence of this removes the effect of the other evidence shewing a previous intent to destroy the will. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>4 Serg. &amp; Rawle 297.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-4\">In every aspect of the case, the decree should be reversed and the verdict set aside. And then the question will be whether a new trial shall be directed, or the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALF\">The bill ought to state such facts as, admitting them to be true, are sufficient in law to make the will invalid ; and this bill stating no such facts, we insist that it is for that reason defective, and ought therefore to be dismissed. Moreover, the plaintiff <em>Frankly Wilkins, </em>and the children of mrs. <em>Wyche </em>and mrs. <em>Davis, </em>having by such cogent acts recognized the validity of the will, and the bill stating nothing to avoid the effect of those acts of recognition, those plaintiffs cannot be entertained in a court of equity. And then the objection arises, that the other plaintiffs having joined with themselves, as coplaintiffs, parties who are not entitled to sue, the suit cannot be sustained. <em>Cuff </em>v. <em>Platell, </em>4 Russ. 242. 3 Cond.

This principle applies as well to wills of realty as of personalty. Under the third section of our statute of wills, 1 Rev. Code, p. 376. which follows as to this matter the sixth section of the english statute of frauds, we admit that no mere declaration of intention to revoke is sufficient; that the strongest declaration by words in <em>grcesenti </em>will not answer ; and that the intention to revoke, though prevented from being carried into execution by fraud, will be wholly unavailing. We admit, in short, that there must be either a written revocation, or an act destroying, cancelling or obliterating the will. But an act may be an effectual revocation, though the will be neither totally destroyed nor wholly obliterated; there may be a slight act, only cancelling a part or obliterating a clause, which will yet operate to revoke the will, because done with that intent: while, on the other hand, the most positive act destroying or obliterating the whole instrument will be insufficient, if the intent to revoke be wanting. Instances of total cancellation are furflished in the cases of <em>Scruby </em>v. <em>Fordham and </em>others, 1 Add. 74. 2 Eng. Eccl. Rep. 34. and <em>Moore &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Moore &amp;c. </em>1 Phill. 375. 1 Eng. Eccl. Rep. 109.; of partial cancellation, in the cases of <em>Sutton </em>v. Sutton, Cowp. 812. Swinb. Pt. 7. \u00a7 16. <em>Larkins and others </em>v. <em>Larkins and others, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pul. 16. <em>Short </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 East 419. In all the cases, cancelling is regarded as an ambiguous act. <em>Burtenshaw </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>Cowp. 52. <em>Smith &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>1 Add. 448. 455. 2 Eng. Eccl. Rep. 175.

And the slightest act will revoke, where it appears to be done <em>animo revocandi. Bibb </em>v. <em>Thomas, 2 W. </em>Bl. 1043. <em>Boyd &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Leigh 32. The conclusion from all the cases is, that there must be some act of cancellation ; that whether such act be a revocation or not, depends on the intent; and that it shall either be a total or a partial revoca33 testator intended. Now a codicil is part and parcel of the will, a substantive part of it, united to it, whether it be on the same or on a separate piece of paper. Swinb. <em>15. Bates </em>v. <em>Holman, 3 Hen. &amp; Munf. 525. Acherley </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>Comyn 381. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>1 Ves. jun. 407. <em>Westcott and others </em>v. <em>Cady and others, 5 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 334. The codicil republishes the will, and gives by implication new life and vitality to it. The effect of the codicil is to make the will speak as of the date of the codicil. <em>Beckford </em>v. <em>Parnecott, </em>Cro. Eliz. 493. 1 Wms. Saund. 277. <em>e. Crosbie </em>v. <em>MacDougal, </em>4 Ves. 616. And the will and codicil are so united that the cancellation or revocation of the will revokes <em>prima facie </em>the codicil. 1 Williams on Ex\u2019ors 76. But this presumption may be repelled, as in <em>Medlycott </em>v. <em>Assheton, </em>2 Add. 229. 2 Eng. Eccl. Rep. 280. The destruction, then, of the codicil must be placed on the same ground as the destruction of a substantive and independent clause of a will. And as the destruction of part of the will, though a revocation <em>prima facie </em>of only that part, may, by shewing the intent, operate as a revocation of the whole, so, though the destruction of the codicil is <em>prima facie </em>a revocation of the <em>codicil only, yet </em>upon shewing the intent, it may operate as a revocation of the will, as well as of the codicil. This intent sometimes appears from the nature of the provisions. If, for example, there be a particular provision in the will, and the codicil contain the same provision, a destruction of the codicil will be a destruction of that provision in the will. <em>Utterson </em>v. <em>Utterson, </em>3 Ves. &amp; Beam. 122. Here the codicil in respect to the slaves has the same effect as the residuary clause, and the testator at least intended a revocation <em>pro tanto. </em>The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tent may also be to revoke the whole, and may be shewn by circumstances. If in any case the \u00ed-lestrnrtinn nf a must have that effect here ; for the jury have found such ing such intent, have the effect ot revoking the will, it intent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">II. The circuit court has declared that the solemn direction by a testator that his will should be destroyed, and his belief that it was destroyed accordingly, are in law a revocation of a will of personalty. Before the statute of frauds, words were sufficient to revoke a will either of really or personalty. 1 Wms. Saund. 278. h. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Kirton, </em>Cro. Jac. 115. The provisions of the english statute are in 1 Williams on Ex\u2019ors 59. 60. The virginian statute is more brief, but to the same effect; 1 R. C. p. 377. \u00a7 9. Under these statutes, something more is necessary than mere words; but less will do than would be required to revoke a will of realty. Words accompanied by conduct shewing an intent to revoke, are still sufficient to revoke a will of personalty. The whole effect of the statute is to prevent a revocation of such a will by words importing a present intent to revoke; but the direction to destroy the will, and the belief that it is destroyed accordingly, will still revoke it. Here the direction was to burn the papers (will as well as codicil), and the codicil was actually burnt. Such a direction applicable to both papers, and believed to have been complied with, would operate as a revocation of a will of personalty in <em>England, </em>and must have the same effect here. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>8 Adolph. &amp; Ell. 1. 35 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 302. This, it is true, was a case of copyhold lands, which do not strictly come within the statute of frauds relating to realty ; but what will revoke a will of copyholds will revoke a will of personalty. The decisions in the ecclesiastical courts shew clearly, that though words will not revoke, yet intention manifested by conduct will. <em>Walcott </em>v. <em>Och</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>terlony, </em>1 Curteis 580. 6 Eng.Eccl. Rep. 398. And on this subject the ecclesiastical law is our law. <em>Redford's adm'r </em>v. <em>Peggy and others, 6 Rand. 316. Worsham's adm'r </em>v. <em>Worsham's ex'or, </em>5 Leigh 589. In the case of <em>Boyd &amp;c. v. Cook, </em>3 Leigh 32. relied upon on the other side, the attention of judge <em>Carr </em>was confined to the clause of the statute relating to wills of realty, and the case does not overrule the doctrine of the ecclesiastical courts, that conduct, with present intention to revoke, will amount to revocation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-5\">It is not proper to consider the act of 1835, (Sess. Acts 1834-5, p. 43. ch. 60.) as changing the mode of revocation. At common law, every instrument not under seal was capable of being orally dispensed with. After a will was required to be in writing, it might have been revoked by words until the statute of frauds. 1 Roberts on Wills, ch. 2. p. 193. And it must still be capable of being revoked in any manner which the statute allows. The requisition of greater formalities in the execution cannot of itself impose greater formalities in the revocation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-6\">III. Parol evidence is clearly admissible to shew the intent with which an act was. done; and for this purpose declarations accompanying the act, or made subsequently, may be received. Then as to the declarations of <em>Edmunds Mason, </em>though it is true that a party to a suit cannot be compelled to give evidence, yet declarations of any party contrary to his interest may be received. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of Hardwick, </em>11 East 578. <em>Burton &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Scott &amp;c. </em>3 Rand. 399. Such evidence is received on the principle that the statements are against the interest of the party, and that he cannot be compelled to testify.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-7\">IV. This being a case of conflicting evidence, was peculiarly proper for a jury. The verdict should not be set aside merely because the judges would, if on the jury, have found differently.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>V. There was no necessity to set forth in the bill the grounds of the proceeding. All that is necessary is to set forth what entitles the plaintiffs to the relief required. Besides, there was no demurrer on this ground, but an answer. Had there been both demurrer and answer, the answer would have overruled the demurrer. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Earl of Strafford, </em>3 P. Wms. 81. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Phelps and others, </em>6 Johns. Ch. Rep. 214.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-4\">VI. It is no objection to a suit that the title of one of the plaintiffs is destroyed, provided there remains on the record a plaintiff whose title to relief is consistent with the claim of the other, and is not affected by its failure. The authorities cited on the other side are not applicable, because there the plaintiffs claimed a joint demand arising out of contract, and either the claim had no existence, or it was joint. Such cases are analogous to those at common law, where plaintiffs suing on a contract alleged to be made with them jointly, must sustain the demand as alleged. But here there are separate and distinct interests, and the utmost that would be proper would be to dismiss the bill as to the party having no interest. But in fact there is an interest existing in all the plaintiffs, either as devisees and legatees, or as heirs and distributees. The ground is merely that there is an equitable bar, not that any of the plaintiffs ought not to be parties. And the objection moreover is not made by plea, but only by the answer. It is like the case of an answer setting up that one of the plaintiffs is paid. Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. \u00a7 203. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Parry, </em>4 Russ. 272. 3 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 662.

He remarked, that from the opinion in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Harris, 35 </em>Eng. C. L. R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>302. it appeared, that the statute of frauds was held , . . . not to apply, and the conduct in that case was considered as equivalent to words, and as revoking because words would have been sufficient to revoke. The other case&gt; <em>(Walcott </em>v. <em>Ochterlony, </em>6 Eng. Eccl. Rep. 398.) he said must have been decided upon the ground that there was such a writing as satisfied the requisitions of the statute; the ecclesiastical courts going farther in holding particular writings sufficient, than the courts of <em>Virginia </em>would go. But here there is no writing, and it is conceded that mere words wall not do.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-15\"><em>Gholson </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJEj\">Though the 3d section of our statute points out the only modes in which a will of realty may be revoked, it is not true that every way in which a will of personalty may be revoked is prescribed by the 9th section. This section only declares that a subsequent will, codicil or declaration, in order to revoke, must be in writing; which is, in substance, that a will of personalty shall not be revoked by words only. The destruction of a will of realty must be in the presence of the testator. Will it be contended that the burning a will of personalty by direction of the testator, though not in his presence, is not a valid revocation? Surely not. The mere declaration \u201cI revoke my will,\u201d the mere attempt to make a nuncupative will, will'not revoke a will of personalty. These are mere words. But a positive direction to destroy is the act of the testator, and if carried into effect, is, so far as relates to personal estate, a valid revocation. And a testator having the right to revoke in this way, if a fraud be practised upon him, the will nevertheless will stand revoked as to chattels. It is certain that <em>Malone </em>burnt, or caused to be burnt in his presence, the codicil to his will. This was no declaration; it was a solemn act. Was this act done in obedience to his orders to destroy his will ? If so, upon what principle can it be conten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ded that this would be a revocation by words only ? or in what respect would this revocation violate either the letter or spirit of the 9th section ? It was no will, no codicil, no declaration, but an act of the most unequivocal character. The remark quoted from the opinion of judge <em>Curr </em>in <em>Boyd &amp;c. v. </em>Cook, 3 Leigh 32. is made upon the 3d section, and the attention of the court in that case was not directed to the 9th section. The question, moreover, judge <em>Carr </em>said would be considered still open. <em>Walcott </em>v. Ochterlony, 6 Eng. Eccl. Rep. 398. should therefore have the weight to which it is entitled, unimpaired by the opinion in <em>Boyd &amp;c. </em>v. Cook. And the point of that case is, that there was a present intention absolutely to revoke, manifested by something more than mere words.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-7\">Then as to the other instruction. No witness (except <em>Young, </em>whose testimony was disregarded by the jury) proves that the will had ever been in <em>John Y. Mason's </em>possession at all, and he does not prove that it was there at the destruction of the codicil. But wherever the will might in fact be, it is certain that <em>Malone </em>thought the will, as well as the codicil, was in the possession of <em>Edmunds Mason, </em>when he ordered him to destroy \u201c those papers.\u201d <em>Malone </em>thought so on the very night of his death, when he called upon his brother in law to take charge of his affairs. He thought so on the occasions when he told his friends and companions he had no will. Is the instruction wrong? A codicil being part of the will, and the destroying a part of the will <em>animo revocandi </em>being a sufficient revocation of the whole, it follows that the destroying the codicil, with intent to revoke the will as well as codicil, is a revocation of both. Where there are duplicates of a will, and one is in the possession of the testator and the other in possession of a friend, the fact that the one is missing from the testator\u2019s possession works a revocation of the other. 4 Kent\u2019s Comm. 531. <em>Colvin </em>v. <em>Fraser &amp;c. </em>2 Haggard 266. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>4 Eng. Eccl. Rep. 113. <em>Boughey </em>v. <em>Moreton, 2 </em>Lee 532. 6 Eng. Eccl. Rep. 231. <em>Onions </em>v. <em>Tyrer, 2 </em>Vern. 742. <em>S. C. </em>1 P. Wms. 346. Much stronger is the case where a codicil is destroyed with the belief and for the purPose revoking and destroying the will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABNJ\">Upon the other points, <em>Gholson </em>enforced the views presented by <em>Seddon. </em>If the instructions of the court were right, the verdict of the jury, he insisted, was <em>not </em>without evidence to sustain it. The bill was clearly sufficient; for upon it the court was obliged to direct the issue, and the decision of the question could not be withdrawn from the jury, by demurrer to evidence or in any other way. And there was no such improper joinder of plaintiffs as had been objected. Suppose, he said, all the legatees of an estate sue an executor, and he files with his answer receipts in full from several of the plaintiffs, this surely would not cause the bill to be dismissed as to the others. The principle contended for only applies where a plaintiff joins with him others who, according to their own shewing, are not entitled to sue.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AnW\"><em>Macfarland, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aju\">argued, that this case strikingly vindicated the wisdom of the law which protected last wills and testaments from the frail memories and the machinations of witnesses. There was in truth nothing to authorize a grave suspicion that the testator intended to destroy his will, or directed it to be destroyed. The only foundation for such an opinion was the report by one of the witnesses, of a conversation held by him with <em>a legatee; </em>and even that was to-be sought for, not in the general accuracy of the report, but in its minute and exact precision as to the terms employed by the legatee. It would be better to annul the law, than admit of exceptions broad enough to sanction such an experiment. The admissions of the legatee were not evidence. But admitting them, and granting the instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>tions, the evidence was not only too loose and imper-feet to justify a verdict against the will, but should have induced an opposite finding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aquf\">2. Parol evidence, he said, was admissible to ascertain the intent of an equivocal cancellation or partial destruction, so as to determine whether the act was done for the purpose of revoking the will altogether or only in part, or was accidental, and so was not designed to have either operation. But an apparent partial destruction was necessary, to lay a foundation for the admission of such evidence; which had never been received to dispense with the <em>factum </em>of destruction, or to make it out when the instrument exhibited no traces of it. To allow evidence to impeach a will as destroyed, whilst the appearance of the instrument refuted the pretension, would leave it wholly at the mercy of witnesses. The necessity of an apparent act, tending to destruction, was shewn by all the cases. It was sufficient to refer to <em>Read </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>33 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 57. where they are collected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">The general rule was admitted ; but it was still contended that the destruction of the codicil, to which the testator assented, furnished the act or <em>factum </em>required to let in the evidence; upon the ground that the codicil was part of the will, and that the rule, properly understood, required nothing more than some significant act with which to connect the evidence. The answer was, that the <em>factum </em>which alone authorized a recourse to evidence, was something which had impressed itself on the will, and naturally suggested an enquiry as to the intent wherewith it was done; not something which the evidence brought to light, and which, without it, would be unknown. Any other hypothesis involved the absurdity of admitting evidence to prove the <em>factum, </em>at the same time that the ascertained existence of the <em>factum </em>was a prerequisite to the admission of evidence. The argument ran in a circle. It was plain that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>was no practical, sensible .restriction on the introduce tion qf evidence, unless it be confined to marks or indications of destruction apparent on the will. So the rule had hitherto been expounded ; and every consideration \u00b0f policy was opposed to any relaxation of it. The argument founded on <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Harris </em>and <em>Walcott </em>v. <em>Ochterlony </em>had been already <em>answered; </em>and he enforced the views taken by <em>Robinson </em>of those cases. The idea of a factum, of which there was no trace on the instrument, serving to let in parol proofs, implied the efficacy of typical cancellation and destruction. It had no foundation in authority or principle.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-4\">It was not denied that a codicil was part of a will. Still the will was independent of the codicil, and would remain effectual notwithstanding its cancellation. Such was the general rule. In the present instance the will and codicil were on different papers, committed to separate custodies, and when the codicil was burned, it was not in the power of the testator to destroy the will if he had so wished. The will bore no marks of the testator\u2019s dissatisfaction with any of its provisions, and was to all appearance exactly such as might have been expected if the testator remained contented with it. Upon its face it was a complete and perfect instrument. The simple act of destroying the codicil raised no presumption against the efficacy of the will. And then the question was, whether it was admissible to prove the intent or impression of the testator as to the will, so as to extend the act of destruction to that? in other words, whether the evidence of witnesses, unaided by any inherent indications, was competent to prove that the will had been renounced ? The question could admit of none but a negative answer. The case of <em>TJtterson </em>v. <em>Utterson, </em>relied upon by the opposite counsel, was in perfect harmony with the rule. It proceeded on the ground that the cancellation of the codicil evinced a change, in the testator\u2019s purposes towards his disinhe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>rited son; and that the intent to provide for him, implied thereby, ought to prevail over the correlative clause of the will. The cancellation of the codicil connected itself by internal evidence with the will; and the case, therefore, was not an authority for the appellees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aql\">3. He insisted that the bill was imperfect in respect to all the requisites of a bill in equity, and ought to have been dismissed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b377-12\"> See opinion of <em>Cabell, </em>J. in <em>Kincheloe </em>v. <em>Kincheloe, </em>11 Leigh 398. and of <em>Stanard, </em>J. in S. <em>C. </em>402.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b407-7\">Baldwin, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AAd\">The spirit of our statute law in regard to the making and revocation of wills, is, to restrain parol testimony on the subject within the narrowest practicable limits. Hence the solemnities of writing, signature, attestation. Revocations by cancel-ling or destroying the instrument arise naturally from the custody, control and dominion of the testator. Prescribed formalities in regard to them would be of little value, and would involve the necessity, in the event of nonobservance, of resorting to parol testimony for the purpose of setting up and establishing the ruined instrument; one of the very evils intended to be guarded against. Still, however, the statutes are not without their efficacy in relation to these as well as the other modes of revocation, by excluding the evidence of witnesses as to the conduct and declarations of the testator, except so far as they bear upon the permitted acts of revocation. This is obvious from the consideration, that, as nothing can supply the want of the acts of revocation, so nothing can extend them beyond the legal import and effect of the acts themselves. The act, however, of cancellation or destruction necessarily presents enquiries calling for or permitting the examination of parol proofs to a very considerable extent. The mere act most usually establishes itself; for if a will which had been executed by the testator, and retained in his custody, be found cancelled at his death, or after diligent enquiry cannot be found at all, the legal presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>is that it was cancelled or destroyed by himself. But then this presumption is liable to be repelled by proof that the act of cancellation or destruction was done by some one else, without his knowledge and consent. So too, as the mind of the testator must accompany his physical act, every such case is open to proof of a mistake in point of fact: as if he were to throw ink upon his paper instead of sand, or, having two wills by him of different dates, <em>should </em>direct one of them to be can-celled or burnt, and the person so directed should through misapprehension or inadvertence cancel or burn the other. Still further, if the act in question be not a substantive, independent act, but dependent upon another, the whole forming together one transaction, we must look to the entire design and purpose, in order to ascertain whether a revocation has been accomplished. Thus, where a testator knowingly cancels or destroys his will, but with the belief that he has substituted or is about to substitute another in its place, which consequential or preliminary object is defeated by some accident or mistake, preventing the execution, or the complete and perfect execution, or the valid effect of the new will; in such cases, the work of revocation is incomplete and ineffectual. The purpose must concur with the act. And in this sense it is that there must be the <em>animus revocandi; </em>the purpose to revoke by the adopted mode of revocation. <em>But the purpose alone is </em>unavailing, without performance of the act itself. A general intent of the testator <em>to </em>alter his will, or change the disposition of his estate; a particular design to cancel or destroy <em>it; an abortive </em>attempt to do the very act in question, even though prevented by accident, fraud or violence, do not affect the legal validity of the instrument. The will must be cancelled or destroyed. How far the work of destruction must proceed, is not yet settled. It would seem that where the testator has done all that he designed <em>to </em>do for. the purpose of ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>tual destruction, and believes that he has accomplished it, a literal compliance with the statute is not indispensable, <em>Moore &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Moore &amp;c. </em>1 Phill. 375. A slight tearing and burning were held sufficient in <em>Bibb </em>v. Thomas, 2 W. Black. 1043. A mere scorching of the envelope, not extending to the will it embraced, was held insufficient in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>33 Eng. Com. L. R. 57. However this may be, I think it clear that a cancellation or destruction, to effect a revocation of the whole instrument, must be directed against the whole, or an essential part of it; otherwise it can amount only to that partial cancellation or obliteration so well established as being a revocation pro <em>tanto </em>only. Swinb. Pt. 7. \u00a7 16. 1 Williams on Ex\u2019ors 73. <em>Scruby </em>v. <em>Fordham &amp;c. </em>1 Add. 78. If a will, whether written on one sheet of paper or several sheets, be torn up by the testator, or thrown into the fire, then it is manifest that the act of destruction is directed against the whole instrument, though only a part be destroyed, and that part a codicil only; but if the testator cancels or obliterates a particular clause, or destroys one of the sheets, retaining and preserving the rest, then his purpose to destroy a part only is equally clear, and the sole question is as to the validity and effect of what remains uneradicated ; a question which may occur as to the whole residue of the instrument, or (as in <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>Cowp. 812. <em>Larkins &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Larkins &amp;c. </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 16. <em>Short </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 East 419.) as to the residue of a particular clause.</p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">In the case before us, it was physically impossible that the act of destruction in question, the burning of the codicil, could have been directed against the will, inasmuch as the will was not present but in a different custody. And yet the court instructed the jury, that if the testator intended, at the time of destroying the codicil, thereby to revoke the will, in that case the destruction of the codicil was a revocation of both the will and the codicil. If this be correct, it must be either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>because a codicil is so essential a part of a will that its revocation necessarily involves the revocation of the will, (a ground too palpably wrong to require discussion, and not assumed by the appellees\u2019 counsel, nor by the circuit court); or because the destruction of a codicil, without any the slightest destruction of the will, or any attempt to destroy it, or even an intent to destroy it, must have the effect of revoking the will, if so intended by the testator. This last proposition, it seems to me, requires but little consideration after what has been already said. To place it in the strongest light for the- appellees, let us suppose that the testator, at the time of burning the codicil, expressly declared that he did it with intent thereby to revoke the will. Could it have that effect ? The will itself was in no wise can-celled or destroyed, but remained perfect and entire,! indestructible and intangible by the act in question. Then is it not obvious, that if revoked, it must have been by the sole efficacy of the testator\u2019s parol declaration, directly in the teeth of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The argument of the appellees\u2019 counsel is, that the question of revocation is in some degree a question of intention,- and the act of cancellation or destruction an equivocal act, which must be done with an intention to revoke; and therefore, that though a partial cancellation or destruction is <em>prima facie </em>a partial revocation,, yet by the intent of the party it may be extended to a total revocation. The premises are true, but do not warrant the conclusion. The intent to revoke must concur with.the act of revocation, but Cannot go beyond it, being limited by law to the act itself. We must not confound the intent to do the physical act of cancellation, or destruction, with the. intent, to produce thereby the legal effect of revocation. When the intent to do the physical act concurs with the act itself, it then becomes an act of revocation ; and when the intent to revoke concurs with the act of revocation, it then becomes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>a legal revocation. When the concurring physical act . ... \u00b0 1 <em>J </em>and intent to do it are partial only, we have merely a partial act of revocation, and, as regards that act, the testator designs to do no more; and thus the question is presented, whether a partial act of revocation can accomplish a total revocation ? a question which is answered by merely stating it.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">In this view of the subject, it avails the learned counsel nothing to prove, from reason or authority, that a codicil is to be taken as a part of the will j for still it is a case of partial revocation. The argument is, however, stronger against total revocation, where the act of cancellation or destruction is applied to the codicil, than where it is applied to a part only of the will; for the part of the will cancelled or obliterated may be essential to the validity of the rest, which can never be as regards the codicil relatively to the will. The codicil is a part of the will for construction and testamentary disposition, but not for execution, nor for revocation, when that is applied to the codicil. It is a branch not essential to the existence of the tree, but which can have itself no distinct vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">In my opinion, therefore, the instruction in question violates both the letter and the spirit of the statute, and is fraught with all the evils of parol revocations. There can be no stronger illustration of the mischievous effects of such a doctrine than is furnished by this very case, which was made to turn upon the hearsay testimonj' of two witnesses to prove admissions, by one of the devisees, of expressions used by the testator, which derive their whole force from the very looseness of the terms employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">The attempt to sustain this doctrine by authority has completely failed. No case has been produced in which it has been held that a revocation of a codicil, with whatever intent or in whatever mode, has operated as a revocation of the will. The case cited of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>Utterson </em>v. Utterson, 3 Ves. &amp; Beam. 122. it seems to . . . me is not in point. There a father, after having made his will, being displeased with his son, by an interlineation of his will excluded him from all share in his proPefty but one shilling, and also by a codicil, made for that purpose, declared his determination to the same effect; but afterwards being reconciled to his son, the testator cancelled the codicil by drawing his pen across it, but the interlineation was left standing in the will: and it was held that the cancellation of the codicil had the effect of cancelling the <em>interlineation. </em>The obvious principle of this decision, I think, is, that the interlineation and the codicil were parts of the same transaction, and to be regarded as an entire act for the same identical purpose ; and that the revocation of the codicil was as much a revocation of the interlineation, as the revocation of a will is of its counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Another instruction given by the court on the trial of the issue was, that if the jury believed from the evidence, that the testator directed the will to be destroyed, and thought that it was destroyed as requested, then the will, so far as it related to the personal estate, was revoked in law, although it might not in point of fact have been destroyed. As this instruction, if erroneous, ought not to be repeated on another trial of the issue, I think it proper to express my opinion upon it. The proposition which in its broad terms it announces, is, that <em>if </em>the testator directed the will to be destroyed, whether <em>inprcesenti </em>or <em>in </em>futuro, and whether the will was present or absent at the time, and believed, whether then or at a subsequent period, that it was destroyed, then the will, as relates to the personal estate, was revoked, though not in point of fact destroyed. I need not consider the proposition thus stated, as I do not believe the court intended to be so understood, and as the counsel for the appellees have chosen to construe the instruction in reference to the instructions which had already been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>given on the motion of the defendants, and to the evidence on the trial. Passing by any objection founded on an apparent clashing of the instructions, or an ambiguous hypothesis of the facts, let us suppose that the court had in its contemplation the undisputed facts disclosed by the evidence; to wit, that the will was not present at the time of the destruction of the codicil, but in a different custody ; that the destruction directed by the testator was <em>inyrrmsenti; </em>and that if the direction extended to the will, it was under a misapprehension on his part, not occasioned by any fraud or mistake of the person directed, that the will was actually present. Let us further suppose that there was evidence tending to prove that the direction, under such misapprehension, extended to the will as well as the codicil. Then the case presented is that of a destruction of a codicil in the testator\u2019s presence and by his direction, and a further direction at the same time to destroy the will together with the codicil, under a mistaken belief of the testator that the will was then actually present. The instruction concedes that the will was not revoked as to the realty, and the question is whether it was revoked as to the personalty. I waive the enquiry whether the act of 1835, placing wills of personal property on the same footing as wills of real estate in regard to authentication, is to be consequently construed as placing them on the same footing in regard to revocation. Let the negative be conceded. Still we have a statute of long standing, taken from the english statute of frauds, prohibiting parol revocations of wills of personalty. Of what avail then was the parol direction to destroy the will, when in fact it was not destroyed, and moreover could not at that time have been destroyed ? There is nothing more certain than that a direction to cancel or destroy a will, if it be not complied with, is not a cancellation or destruction. Revocation by cancellation or destruction, equally applicable to wills of personalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>and realty, is recognized by the english statute of frauds, . ..... . ... and our statute ot wills, in regard to revocations o\u00ed devises of real estate. And in the language of Coleridge, J. in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>33 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 61. \u201c the kid o*\" construction which has been insisted upon would lead to a repeal of the statute on this subject, step by step. The statute, for wise purposes, does not leave the fact of cancellation to depend on mere intent, but requires definite acts. In the making of a will, if the proper signatures were not affixed, no explanation of the want of signatures could be received; and so where a will has been made, to revoke it there must be some act coupled with the intention, to bring the case within the sixth section.\u201d The learned judge of course refers to the acts of cancellation or destruction mentioned in the 6th section of the english statute. The counsel for the appellees, however, contend that the statute prohibiting verbal revocations, that is to say, requiring revocations by words to be in writing, does not apply to acts evidencing an intention to revoke, though falling short of cancellation or destruction. There is no argument for this, founded in reason or policy ; and no. authority that I am apprized of. The cases cited do . not warrant the proposition. That of <em>Walcott </em>v. <em>Ochterlony, </em>6 Eng. Ecc. Rep. 398. was one of written directions to destroy a will, which were treated as an actual revocation in writing. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>35 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 301. was a case of copyhold, which was held not to be within the statute of frauds, and therefore the will liable to revocation, as at common law, by words of present revocation, or acts equivalent thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">And here again this case strongly illustrates the danger of parol revocations of wills. This part of the case was made to turn upon the testator\u2019s unfounded belief, supposed- to be proved by the hearsay evidence of loose expressions above alluded to, that the will was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>actually present at the time, so as to connect that belief, and the inferred direction in relation to the will, with the burning of the codicil. If we were to lose sight of the legal barriers, that is to say, the solemn forms and decisive acts prescribed by law, what security could we have against the corruptions, and blunders, and inaccuracies of witnesses in relation to the testamentary dispositions of estates ?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Without considering the objection made by the appellants\u2019 counsel to the evidence, given without opposition on the trial, of the admissions made by mr. <em>Mason, </em>one of the devisees, in regard to statements of the testator in conversation with him, I am of opinion that the judge of the circuit court, sitting as chancellor, ought not to have been satisfied with the verdict of the jury, because of the misdirections above stated; and therefore that the decree ought to be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">It remains to enquire what further proceedings ought to be had in the cause. The appellants\u2019 counsel contend that the bill should be dismissed, on two distinct grounds. One is that the bill does not state such facts as, admitting them to be true, are sufficient in law 1o make the will invalid; it merely, by a sweeping allegation, charging that the paper propounded is not the last will and testament of the alleged testator. My present impression is that this objection could only be properly taken by a demurrer to the bill; but I will briefly consider it upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The question of <em>devisavit vel non </em>is a common law question, and in <em>Virginia </em>most usually a mere question of probat. After a will has been admitted to record, it cannot, with us, be controverted incidentally; as it frequently is in the english common law courts, and sometimes (through the intervention of a jury) in their court of chancery, in consequence of the want of a court of probat in relation to wills of real estate. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>sentence of our courts of probat cannot be drawn in . . . question, unless in an appellate forum, except in the mode prescribed by our statute of wills, 1 R. C. p. 378. \u00a7 13. which provides, \u201c th\u00e1t when any will shall be exhibited t0 be proved, the court having jurisdiction may proceed immediately to receive the probat thereof, and grant a certificate of such probat. If, however, any person interested shall within seven years afterwards appear, and by his or her bill in chancery <em>contest </em>the validity of the will, an issue shall be made up whether the writing produced be the will of the testator or testatrix or not, which shall be tried by a jury, whose verdict shall be final between the parties; saving to the court a power of granting a new trial for good cause, as in other trials : but no such <em>party </em>appearing within that time, the probat shall be forever binding;\u201d with a saving in favour of persons labouring under disabilities. The 14th section also provides, that \u201cin all such trials by jury, the certificate of the oath of the witnesses at the time of the first probat shall be admitted as evidence, to have such weight as the jury shall think it deserves.\u201d Thus the statute provides a supplemental tribunal to revise the decision of the court of probat, if in favour of the will; and that tribunal is a jury, to be impannelled for trial of the issue of <em>devisavit vel non, </em>to be directed by a court of chancery. The jurisdiction, such as it is, so conferred on the chancery courts is no part of the original jurisdiction of the courts of equity, which will not, (in the language of the books) in an adversary way, take jurisdiction to determine the validity of a will. It is a probat jurisdiction, to be exercised not by the chancellor, but by the jury; and his only province is to convene the proper parties, and cause the prescribed issue to be made up and tried, with the incidental power to grant a new trial, and to remove impediments and furnish facilities to a full and fair trial of the merits before the jury. The issue is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>directed by the mandate of the law, in order to the final , . , probat of the will propounded; and not to inform the conscience of the chancellor, whose conscience is not ... . . at all concerned in the matter, except to prevent mjustice from being done by the verdict of the jury. The issue is not that made up by the bill, answer and other pleadings in the chancery proceeding, but is a new and separate issue, which, when drawn into technical form, is the result of feigned pleadings in a supposed action at law. The issue covers the whole ground (at least so far as required by the parties) whether the paper propounded is the last will and testament of the testator or not. When the jury are impannelled upon the issue, the parties are then in a legal forum, which looks only to the question that the jury have been sworn to try, without regard to the chancery pleadings. Those pleadings cannot enlarge or contract the issue before the jury, nor the evidence adduced at the trial. Of what avail then would it be, to require the chancery pleadings to be ramified into details of the facts that are to be the subject of evidence on the trial before the jury ? No such unprofitable controversy is required at the first probat, and why should it be at the last ? It could not have been contemplated by the statute, the object of which was to allow an opportunity \u201cto contest\u201d the validity of the will, to all who had not enjoyed it in the court of probat, where the propounding was usually <em>ex parte; </em>and to allow it, not in a more formal, but a more substantial manner, the probat court not having the power to convene the necessary parties, and trying the case itself without the aid of a jury, supposed by our law to be a more competent tribunal for the decision of such matters. The legislative mind has since been more fully developed by the act of 1838, which, by a happy expedient, authorizes the whole controversy, at the election of the propounder of the will, to be finally adjudicated in an original court of probat; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>which is clothed with the same powers of convening the parties, directing the issue, granting new trials &amp;c. as are vested in the chancery court by the original statute of wills j and without any formality of plead it be the fictitious or supposed common law pleading, employed, or conjectured, to raise the broad issue of <em>devisavit vel non. </em>No inconvenience is felt in this mode of proceeding, from the want of schedules of controverted facts, in the form of bills and answers, which serve rather to perplex than elucidate the cause, by multiplying subordinate and irrelevant issues. Upon the whole, I cannot perceive the propriety of requiring the plaintiff to do more in his bill, (besides shewing his interest in the subject and making the necessary parties) than to \u201ccontest the validity of the will,\u201d by averring in general terms that it is not the last will and testament of the alleged testator, or, at his election, by a brief statement of bis grounds of objection thereto, the briefer the better upon a mixed question of law and fact, which it is not the province of the court to separate, and which must be submitted in general terms to the decision of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">It only remains for me to notice the other objection to the bill, that some of the plaintiffs, by accepting their legacies and devises under the will, have precluded themselves from disputing its validity, and that the other plaintiffs, having joined with them those so precluded, are not entitled to sue. This objection comes loo late <em>(Dickenson </em>v. <em>Davis &amp;c. 2 </em>Leigh 407.) not having been made by plea, nor even relied upou as a bar by way of answer. But it could have availed nothing in any form ; the correct rule, as I conceive, being that of the ecclesiastical courts, that the acquiescence of the next of kin in the grant of a probat in common form (which corresponds with our <em>ex parte </em>probat), even though they receive legacies as due them under the will, does not preclude them from calling for proof in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>solemn form (which is analogous to our final probat under the issue of <em>devisavit vel non), </em>unless under peculiar circumstances, and <em>laches </em>by long acquiescence. 1 Williams on Ex\u2019ors 193. With us, no <em>laches </em>can be imputed to those who come within the period prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\">My opinion therefore is, that if the cause be remanded, it should be with directions to set aside the verdict of the jury, and award a new trial of the issue, on which new trial the instructions given at the former trial on the motion of the plaintiffs are not to be repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The other judges concurring, the opinion of the court of appeals was declared to be, that the instructions given by the circuit court to the jury, upon the motion of the appellees, on the trial of the issue of <em>devisavit vel non, </em>were erroneous; and therefore that the judge of that court, sitting as chancellor, ought not to have been satisfied with the verdict of the jury. The decree was reversed with costs, and the cause remanded to the circuit court, with directions to award a new trial of the issue, on which new trial the instructions aforesaid were not to be repeated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
