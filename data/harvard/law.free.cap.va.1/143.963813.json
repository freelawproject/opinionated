The defendant then read in evidence a single bill to <em>Waldo P. Goff </em>for 85 dollars, dated the 9th of October 1833, payable three months after date, which was executed by <em>Thomas </em>as principal and the plaintiff <em>Jackson </em>as his surety therein, and offered evidence tending to prove that the bill of sale executed by <em>Thomas </em>to the plaintiffs was intended to indemnify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number><em>Jackson </em>as surety to said <em>Goff. </em>And thereupon the said , _ , , . . . . , .~ defendant moved the court to instruct the jury, that it, from the whole evidence before them, they were satisfled that the said bill of sale was made and intended to indemnify the surety for said <em>Thomas </em>in the bond to <em>Goff, </em>and that the debt due to <em>Goff </em>was the individual debt of said <em>Thomas, </em>then the plaintiffs could not recover, <em>Thomas </em>not being authorized by the power of attorney to pledge the horses to secure the payment of his individual debt. The court declined giving this instruction, and instructed the jury that the power of attorney invested <em>Thomas </em>with full power and authority to make sale or dispose of the property of <em>Hewes, </em>so long as the said power of attorney was unrevoked and in force <em>; </em>that under that authority it was competent to the attorney to execute the said bill of sale, and to vest thereby a legal estate in the said horse and mare in the plaintiffs; and that the legal rights of the plaintiffs to the said property are not affected by reason of the transfer by the attorney in fact being in consideration of one of the plaintiffs becoming surety for a private debt of the said attorney in fact.

Where one deals with an attorney having his authority in writing, he is informed of the objects and limitations of the power, and good faith forbids his co-operation in any act which on its face applies the power to purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>in no wise connected with the interests of the principal and perverts it to objects hostile to those interests; and the law justly denies validity to such acts. In particular agencies, this operates the annulment of the act, though the agent may have had the possession and ostensible ownership of the subject of the contract, and the party dealing with him may not have known that he was not the actual owner. Thus a factor has the possession of the property of his principal, with full power to sell for cash or on credit, and on a credit sale, to transfer or collect the debts. All such acts may be for the benefit of his principal; and the subsequent misuse of the funds that may thus come to his hands in no wise invalidates the sale, transfer or collection. But he cannot pledge the goods, or the note taken on the sale of them, for his own debt, so as to give the pledgee a title paramount to that of his principal. Comyn on Contr. 538, 9. And this, though the <em>pledgee </em>did not know that the party with whom he dealt was not in reality what he ostensibly was, the owner of the goods. <em>Martini </em>v. <em>Coles, </em>1 Mau. &amp; Selw. 140. The power of the factor is assimilated to that of an attorney, for the purpose of imposing this limitation on his general and large authority, <em>Kinder </em>v. <em>Shaw, 2 </em>Mass. Rep. 398, and the party dealing with him is subject to the' consequence of this limitation, though he knows not that in the particular transaction his title is that of a factor. When the act is done avowedly under a written authority, the party is with more reason bound to shew that it is done in conformity with the objects, and withiu the expressed or fairly inferred limits, of such authority. Broad as are the terms of the letter of attorney in question, the power given has relation to the business and concerns of the principal, and an act which is not only alien but ostensibly hostile to those interests is not within its scope. Such is the act in question; and if the facts be as the plaintiff in error offered evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>dence to prove them, there is a misstatement of the consideration in the bill of sale, which evinces a consciousness in the parties of a want of authority for the real transaction, and an improper attempt to disguise it, by giving it the semblance of an act concerning the business of the principal. I think, therefore, that the court below erred in its opinion, and that the judgment ought to be reversed with costs, the verdict set aside, and a new trial of the issue had, on which the court, if desired, should give the instruction that the plaintiff in error asked for on the former trial, and withhold that which was given on that trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The other judges concurring, judgment entered accord inalv.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
