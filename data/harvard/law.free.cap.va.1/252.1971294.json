The declaration was in common form, with a <em>profert, </em>&amp;c. Upon oyer, the bond is set forth at large, and the defendant pleads payment. The jury found the following verdict, <em>viz: </em>\u201c We find for the plaintiff the debt in the declaration mentioned, if the Court shall be of opinion, that the copy of the original bond, with the indorsement thereon, filed in this cause, and proven to be stolen and burnt, all of which is well attested, is legal evidence to go to the jury and support the plaintiff\u2019s declaration, otherwise we find for the defendant.\u201d . i</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Upon the copy of the bond is indorsed a memorandum, signed by three persons, certifying that they compared the copy with the original, and found them perfectly to agree. Judgment for the plaintiff, and appeal prayed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-8\"><em>Washington, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-9\">The copy of a deed, of which <em>oyer </em>cannot be demanded, may be given in evidence, if the original be lost, or be in the possession of the adverse party. But if <em>oyer </em>be demanded, and must be given, the obligee has no remedy left, but to resort to a Court of Equity, to establish the bond. Even, if this Court should consider itself bound by the case of <em>Read </em>v. <em>Brookman, 3 Term. Rep. </em>151, still that decision will have no influence upon this case, since the loss of the bond is not stated in thq declaration, nor put in issue by the pleadings.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-10\"><em>Marshall, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-11\">The case of <em>Puered </em>v. <em>Duncombe, </em>2 <em>Ld. </em>Ray. 852, is an express authority to prove that it is not necessary to produce the original bond. Why the party should be forced into a Court of Equity, if he can at law prove the existence, and subsequent loss or destruction of the bond, I am at a loss to imagine. The same evidence is required in both Courts\u2014The danger of setting up a forged bond, for the copy of the real one, is not greater in the one Court than in the other. If a suit should be brought in the Court of Chancery, and doubts be entertained concerning the execution, or loss of the bond, that Court would at last direct an issue to be tried at law. In the note to the case of <em>Read v. Brookman, </em>it was decided, that the copy of a bond, or of it release, might be given upon <em>oyer. </em>But admit it to be true, that the bond must be produced, if <em>oyer </em>of it be demanded, yet if the defendant wave the necessity of seeing the original, and without denying the validity of the bond, avoid it by the plea of payment, it is surely too late after this to object.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-13\"><em>Washington, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANX\">The case of <em>Puered </em>v. <em>Duncombe, </em>was decided before the Statute of the 4th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Ann, </em>c. 16, making the sum mentioned in the condiinstead of the penalty, the real debt, and is therefore not to be relied upon,</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZDl\">The case of <em>Matison </em>v. <em>Atkinson, 1 Term.Rep. 353, </em>in the note, is against the appellee, because it proves, jjjgt where <em>oyer </em>of the original is dispensed with, the plaintiff must file a special declaration, stating the loss of the bond, or obtain a rule upon the defendant, to shew cause, why <em>profert </em>of a copy should not be accepted. This mode of proceeding, though new, seems liable to no solid objections, because the loss being put in issue, the defendant is apprised of the point he is to contest.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b346-6\">Lyons J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuG\">We will not now determine how the case would have been if the defendant had insisted upon <em>oyer </em>of the original bond : because it is clear, that she has waved the necessity of its being produced, by accepting <em>oyer </em>of a copy, and pleading to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">The case is completely within the reason of the modern practice, stated in the case of <em>Read </em>v. <em>Brookman, </em>and the notes subjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(1<em>)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\"> <em>Waller's Ex. </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>2 Munf. 88.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
