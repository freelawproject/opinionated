Breckenridge </em>and <em>Eliza </em>his wife, of the county of <em>Prince George </em>in the state of <em>Maryland, </em>made a deed to <em>Colin Auld </em>of the county of <em>Alexandria </em>in the district of <em>Columbia, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>which stated on the face thereof, that <em>Breclcenridge </em>and wife, for the consideration of 20,000 dollars, conveyed to <em>Auld </em>three pieces of land in the county of <em>Mason </em>in the state of <em>Virginia, </em>forming part of a tract called <em>Graham\u2019s station.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-4\">On the same day, a memorandum was signed by <em>Breckenridgc </em>and <em>Auld, </em>stating, that although that conveyance was made, it was understood that <em>Auld </em>was to account to <em>Breclcenridge </em>for whatever the land might ultimately produce, after deducting any claims which <em>Auld </em>might have against <em>Breclcenridge, </em>or against the estate of <em>Bailey E. Clarke </em>deceased, of which <em>Breckenridge </em>and his wife were executors, or whatever loss or damage might arise to <em>Auld </em>in consequence of his undertaking for <em>Breclcenridge </em>and obligation to <em>Abraham Clarice.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">The conveyance was admitted to record in the county court of <em>Mason </em>(without the memorandum) on the 18th of September 1826, upon the certificates of two justices of the peace, of the acknowledgment of <em>Breclcenridge, </em>and the acknowledgment and privy examination of his wife.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">About three years after the conveyance, <em>Auld </em>advertised the land for sale. His advertisement appeared in some of the papers of the district of <em>Columbia. </em>And <em>Breckenridgc </em>was at the time in the district, and knew of the advertisement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">On the 1st of September 1831, <em>Auld </em>made a deed to <em>Henry Strider, </em>of the county of <em>Jefferson </em>in <em>Virginia, </em>whereby he conveyed to <em>Strider </em>two parcels of the <em>Graham\u2019s station </em>tract (being all that remained unsold by <em>Auld) </em>for the consideration of 10,000 dollars. On the same day, <em>Strider </em>made a deed of trust to <em>Richard H. Claggett, </em>reciting his purchase from <em>Auld; </em>stating that he had executed to <em>Auld </em>the following bonds, to wit, five bonds for 1000 dollars each, payable on the first day of April 1832, 1833, 1834, 1835 and 1836 respec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>tively, two bonds for 2000 dollars each, payable on the first day of April 1837 and 1838 respectively, and one bond for 1000 dollars, payable on the first day of April 1839; and conveying to <em>Claggett </em>in trust, to secure the payment 0f the sajd bonds, the same property which had been conveyed by <em>Auld </em>to <em>Strider. </em>Both of these deeds were admitted to record ; the deed to <em>Strider </em>on the 20th of September 1831, and his deed of trust on the 15th of November 1831.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-4\">Previously to the conveyance from <em>Auld </em>to <em>Strider, Auld </em>had been discharged from the liabilities against which the deed from <em>Breclcenridge </em>and wife was intended to indemnify him, and <em>Breclcenridge </em>had demanded a reconveyance of the land, on the allegation that there was no indebtedness from him to <em>Auld. </em>But <em>Strider had </em>not, at the date of his purchase, any knowledge of the secret equity of <em>Breclcenridge, </em>or of any adversary claim whatever. <em>Auld </em>had held the land for years, and was in the actual possession thereof, claiming to be the owner, and exercising acts of ownership. And <em>Strider </em>contracted with <em>Auld </em>in the belief that he was the true and sole owner. <em>Strider </em>broke up his establishment in <em>Jefferson </em>county, removed to his new purchase, took possession of the land, and held it for nearly three years, before he heard of the claims of <em>Breclcenridge. </em>During this time, he put upon the land valuable and permanent improvements. But he had paid no part of his purchase money, when he first received notice of <em>Breclcenridge\u2019s </em>claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-5\">Before this notice was received by <em>Strider, </em>the matters in controversy between <em>Auld </em>and <em>Breckenridge </em>had, in March 1833, been submitted to arbitration. The adjustment was found to be one of great difficulty, requiring long and laborious investigation. The arbitrators had various meetings, and did not make up their award until the 29th of January 1834; when they adjudged that <em>Auld </em>should convey the land to <em>Breckenridge, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>that the </em>latter should, on receiving the conveyance, pay to the former the sum of 3347 dollars 31 cents, which they found due to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-4\">About the time of this award, an assignment was made by <em>Auld </em>to <em>John Ramsay, </em>of the bonds executed by <em>Strider </em>to <em>Auld. Strider </em>was informed of the assignment by a letter from <em>Auld </em>bearing date the 30th of January 1834, and by a letter from <em>Ramsay </em>bearing date the 3d of February 1834.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">In July 1834, <em>Strider </em>filed a bill in the circuit court of <em>Mason, </em>setting forth the nature of <em>Breckenridge's </em>title; stating, that he (Strider) considered his contract with <em>Auld </em>a beneficial one, but that he regarded the title of <em>Breckenridge </em>as superior to that which he had acquired ; and concluding with a prayer for a rescission of the contract between himself and <em>Auld. </em>To this bill, <em>Breckenridge, Auld </em>and <em>Ramsay </em>were made defendants: and they all answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\">The rescission of the contract between <em>Strider </em>and <em>Auld </em>promoted the object of <em>Breckenridge, </em>who by a cross bill, as well as by his answer to the original bill, sought a decree compelling the other parties to convey the land to him. Such rescission was, however, objected to by <em>Ramsay, </em>who claimed to be the assignee for valuable consideration, of the bonds executed by <em>Strider </em>to <em>Auld.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-7\">It was expressly charged in the bill, that the assignment w'as made without consideration ; and though the charge was denied both by <em>Auld </em>and <em>Ramsay, </em>neither of them exhibited any satisfactory proof of the consideration. All that was shewn was, that <em>Auld </em>had given bond in the office of the register of wills for <em>Alexandria </em>county, as guardian of <em>John Ramsay </em>and four other orphan children of <em>John Ramsay </em>deceased, in the penally of 80,000 dollars. Whether any settlement of <em>Auld's </em>accounts as guardian had ever taken place, or what was the amount of his indebtedness, or whether he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>indebted at all, nowhere appeared. Yet <em>Ramsay </em>stated, that the motive which induced him to take the assignment, was his desire to get from <em>Auld\u2019s </em>hands the debt due from <em>Auld </em>on account of his father\u2019s estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-10\">Both <em>Auld </em>and <em>Ramsay </em>alleged that the assignment was made on the first of January 1834. But there was no proof to support this allegation. Neither of them alleged that any step was taken to inform <em>Strider </em>of the assignment until after the award. It appeared by the depositions of the arbitrators, that although <em>Strider </em>was no party to the submission, yet the sale to him was a subject investigated by them. They were satisfied that the land was worth much more than it was sold for to <em>Strider; </em>that it was worth 13,000 dollars. And this induced <em>them to </em>provide in the award,\"that in <em>cose Auld </em>should not restore the land to <em>Breckenridge </em>at the time prescribed by them, then he should pay to <em>Breckenridge, </em>in lieu thereof, the sum of 13,000 dollars, subject to a deduction of the- before mentioned sum of 3347 dollars 31 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-11\">Pending the cause, a judgment was obtained by <em>Ramsay </em>on one of <em>Snider's </em>bonds, and an injunction was awarded to restrain <em>Ramsay </em>from proceeding on that judgment, and on the other bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-12\">The circuit court of <em>Mason, </em>by two decrees of the 23d of January and 19th of April 1839, decreed, 1st. That <em>Strider </em>be quieted in his title and possession of the land, subject to the deed of trust executed by him to secure the payment of the purchase money. 2. That the injunction be dissolved as to the judgment, and as to so much of the bonds first becoming due, as, with the judgment, would amount to 3347 dollars 31 cents with interest thereon from the 1st of January 1834, deducting therefrom the costs incurred by <em>Breckenridge </em>in the prosecution of his cross bill, which <em>Auld </em>was decreed to pay. 3. That <em>Ramsay </em>should file with the clerk the residue of the bonds, and that <em>Strider </em>pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>same to <em>Breclcenridge, </em>without any damages by reason of the injunction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\">On the petition of <em>Breclcenridge, </em>an appeal was allowed him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-10\">The cause was argued in August 1841, by the <em>attorney general </em>for the appellant, by <em>Peyton </em>for <em>Ramsay, </em>and by <em>Cooke for Strider.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQT\">The argument not being concluded before the term ended, written notes of argument were delivered to the judges in vacation, by <em>Baldwin </em>for the appellee <em>Auld, </em>and <em>Johnson </em>for the appellant. It is unnecessary to report the argument in detail.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b181-11\">The question of law mainly discussed was, whether, notwithstanding the sale made by <em>Auld </em>of the land conveyed <em>to </em>him by the deed of the 17th x\\ugust 1826, <em>Breckenridge </em>retained, as between <em>Auld </em>and himself, a right of redemption ? The counsel for the appellees endeavoured to distinguish the case from that of <em>Chowning </em>v. <em>Cox &amp;c. 1 </em>Rand. 306. But supposing the cases not to be distinguishable in principle, they said that <em>Chowning </em>v. <em>Cox &amp;c. </em>had been decided without reference to the late decisions in <em>England, </em>or to those in <em>New York, </em>and was clearly inconsistent with them. Those decisions, they contended, have established the proposition that a power of sale given to a mortgagee, in default of payment, by way of substitute for the decree of foreclosure, may be exercised by the mortgagee so as to bar the equity of redemption. They referred to 2 Rob. Pract. 61. 2 Story\u2019s Eq. 295. \u00a7 1027. and note. 4 Kent\u2019s Comm. 146. 1 Sugden on Vendors 357, 8.\u2014where the doctrine and cases are slated.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-12\"> The former had been consulted by the appellee <em>Strider. </em>The latter was counsel for the appellee <em>Auld.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b181-12\">Cabell, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ao1\">The deed from <em>Breclcenridge </em>to <em>Auld </em>for <em>Graham's station, </em>executed on the 17th of August 1826, although absolute on its face, was in fact nothing more than a mortgage; for the written agreement entered into by the parties on the same day, gives the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>true character of the deed, by shewing that its sole object was to secure to <em>Auld </em>any moneys which <em>Breclcenridge </em>then owed him, or might thereafter owe him, and to indemnify him against certain liabilities to which he wag eXp0sej on his account.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The deed' being only a mortgage, the right of redemption by <em>Breckenridge </em>was incident to it; and <em>Auld </em>could not, by the mere authority derived from the <em>deed, </em>and without resort to a <em>court of </em>equity, sell the land <em>so </em>as <em>to </em>bar the rights of <em>Breckenridge. Chowning </em>v. <em>Cox &amp;c. </em>1 Rand. 306. The sale of the land by <em>Auld </em>to <em>Strider, </em>by the deed of the first of September 1831, was therefore, as between <em>Auld </em>and <em>Breckenridge, </em>a mere nullity; especially when we consider that <em>Breckenridge </em>had previously discharged him <em>from the </em>liabilities against which the deed was mainly intended as an indemnity, and had demanded a reconveyance of the land, on the allegation that there was no indebtedness from him to <em>Auld. </em>A sale of the land under such circumstances, and without disclosing to Strider, the vendee, the pretensions of <em>Breckenridge, </em>was doubly fraudulent. If, therefore, there were no other parties to this controversy but <em>Auld </em>and <em>Breckenridge, </em>it is manifest that <em>Breckenridge </em>would be entitled to his land, on his paying to <em>Auld </em>the money which he owed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">But there is a third party to the controversy. <em>Strider </em>has obtained the legal title to the land; and although that title was fraudulently conveyed to him by <em>Auld, </em>yet <em>Strider </em>did not participate in the fraud. He saw <em>Auld </em>in the actual possession of the land, which he had held for many years, claiming to be the owner thereof, and exercising all the acts of ownership, under an absolute deed in fee simple from <em>Breckenridge, </em>spread upon the records of the Court of the county where the land lay. <em>Auld </em>had even advertised the land for sale in the public newspapers published at no great distance from the residence of the parties, without remon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>strance or opposition on the part of <em>Breckenridge. </em>It is not pretended that <em>Strider, </em>at the date of his purchase, had any knowledge of the secret equity of <em>Brechenridge, </em>or of any adversary claim whatever. On the contrary, he had good reason to regard <em>Auld </em>as the true and sole owner; and he contracted with him in the belief that he was so; he received his conveyance, gave his bonds for the purchase money, broke up his old establishment, removed to his new purchase, took possession of the land, and held it for nearly three years, before he heard of the claims of <em>Brechenridge; </em>during which time, he put upon the land valuable and permanent improvements. It is true that he had paid no part of his purchase money, before the time when he received notice of <em>Brechenridge\u2019s </em>claims; and it was strongly contended in the argument, that this circumstance is sufficient to deprive him of the right to, insist on the benefit of his purchase. I do not think it necessary to decide this point in this case; for if, in consequence of this notice, <em>Strider </em>had no right to insist on his purchase, then there would be nothing to prevent the court from deciding the cause as to <em>Brechenridge </em>and <em>Auld, </em>upon the principles of equity applicable to them. And if, on the contrary, he had a right, notwithstanding this notice, to insist on his purchase, it is very clear that he had the right to waive or abandon the purchase, provided his doing so would not impair or injure the rights of others. He might pursue this course, even if his right to insist on his purchase were clear and undoubted; much more might he do so, if it were attended with doubt and uncertainty. He has filed his bill, stating what he considers the superior title of <em>Brechenridge, </em>and praying the rescission of the contract, although he thinks that contract was a beneficial one. Who is to object to this course ? Not <em>Brechenridge; for </em>it is that which he desires, and to which he claims to be entitled. Not <em>Auld; </em>for his interest is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>not affected by it; and if it were, the fraud of which he has been guilty must close his mouth against any such objection. If, therefore, <em>Breckenridge, Auld </em>and <em>Strider </em>were the only parties to this controversy, the cjaims of <em>Breckenridge </em>must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">But there is yet a fourth party, <em>Ramsay, </em>whose pretensions remain to be examined. He claims to be the assignee, for valuable consideration, of the <em>bonds </em>executed by <em>Strider </em>to <em>Auld </em>for the purchase money of the land in controversy. To make this claim available, he must not only allege, but he must prove, that he was an assignee for value; for, as the bonds were invalid and worthless in the hands of <em>Auld, </em>they will be equally so in the hands of bis assignee without value. And it may also be added, that even if full value were paid for them, they will be unavailable in the hands of Ramsay, if he had notice of the claims of <em>Breckenridge.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">It is certain that these bonds were assigned to <em>Ramsay </em>under circumstances calculated to throw strong suspicion on the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"AzH\">The matters in controversy between <em>Auld and Breckenridge </em>had been submitted to arbitration, as far back as March 1833. The adjustment was found to be one of great difficulty, requiring long and laborious investigation. The arbitrators had various meetings from time to time, and did not make up their award until the 29th of January 1834, when they adjudged that <em>Auld </em>should convey the land to <em>Breckenridge, </em>and that the latter should, on receiving the conveyance, pay to the former the sum of 3347 dollars 31 cents, which they found due to him. Both <em>Auld </em>and <em>Ramsay </em>say that the assignment of the bonds was made on the first of January 1834. But there is no proof to support the allegation. They do not pretend that any step was taken to inform <em>Strider </em>of the transfer of his bonds, until after the award; <em>Auld\u2019s </em>letter, which gives the information, bearing date on the 30th of January, and <em>Ram</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number><em>say\u2019s </em>on the 3d of February. If the assignment was in fact made on the 1st of January, this delay in making so important a communication would manifest a degree of negligence and imprudence which we are unprepared, by any thing in the record, to attribute to mr. <em>Auld; </em>whilst the almost simultaneous communication by both <em>Auld </em>and <em>llamsay, </em>so immediately after the award, excites a strong suspicion that the assignment itself followed the award, and was induced by a knowledge of its contents ; and consequently, that <em>Ramsay </em>had notice of the claims of <em>Rreckenridge. </em>This suspicion becomes still stronger, by the notoriety which the record shews was given to the subjects investigated by the <em>arbitrators; </em>one of which was the sale of the land to <em>Strider, </em>although he was no party to the submission. Besides, it seems almost inconceivable that any man should take an assignment of bonds for such an amount, and payable at such remote periods, without an enquiry into the consideration for which they were originally given; especially w'here the parties to the transaction occupied towards each other the intimate relations existing between <em>Auld </em>and <em>Ramsay. </em>But be this as it may, the conduct of <em>Add </em>in assigning these bonds, at any time, while his right to them was involved in the questions then pending before the arbitrators, was grossly <em>fraudulent; </em>and as it is expressly charged in the bill that the assignment was made without consideration, it was incumbent on <em>Ramsay </em>to adduce satisfactory proof of the consideration, if any. No such proof is exhibited. We have nothing but his own assertion and that of <em>Auld, </em>added to the fact that <em>Auld </em>had qualified as the guardian of <em>Ramsay </em>and his four sisters, and had given a bond as guardian of them all, in the penalty of 80,000 dollars. But whether any settlement of his accounts had ever taken place, or what was the amount of his indebtedness, or whether he was indebted at all, nowhere appears.</p>\n<p id=\"Al7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Nothing is more improbable than the story told by <em>. </em>. <em>Ramsay, </em>as to the motive which induced him to take the assignment of these bonds. He says it was his desire to get from <em>AuWs </em>hands the debt due from him on account of Other\u2019s estate. Then why not get it directly from <em>Auld </em>himself, who lived in his immediate neighbourhood, and who is not alleged to be insolvent, or even in embarrassed circumstances ? Why take bonds on a stranger, living hundreds of miles from him ? And above all, why take, in discharge of a present debt which he wished to collect, bonds, some of which had to run four years before they came to maturity ? Upon the whole, I am of opinion that he has shewn no title to the bonds as against <em>Strider </em>or <em>Breckenridge, </em>and that his pretensions to enforce the collection thereof are without any just foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The other judges concurred with the president in the following decree:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">The court is of opinion that the sale <em>by Auld, </em>to <em>Strider </em>of the land in controversy be rescinded, and that <em>Strider </em>do surrender to <em>Breckenridge </em>the full possession of the said land, with all its appurtenances, on or before the first day of January next; and that in the mean time he do permit him, his servants &amp;c. to have free ingress and egress into and from the said land, for the purpose of seeding the usual fall crops. That an account be taken of the rents and profits of the said land while in the possession of the said <em>Strider, </em>and also of the permanent improvements put thereon by him, until the present time; distinguishing those permanent improvements made before, and those made since, the institution of the suit by <em>Strider. </em>That <em>Strider </em>do pay to <em>Breckenridge </em>the amount of the said rents and profits, subject, however, to a credit for so much of the value of all the said improvements, as may not exceed the amount of all the rents and profits; but that <em>Brecken</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>ridge </em>shall not be liable for any excess of the value of the improvements above the amount of all the rents and profits, unless the value of the improvements put upon the land before the institution of the suit, shall exceed the amount of all the rents and profits during the whole time that <em>Strider </em>has held the said land ; in which case he shall be chargeable with such excess, as a lien on the said land. That the injunction restraining <em>Ramsay </em>from enforcing his judgment at law, and from enforcing the collection of the bonds executed by <em>Strider </em>to <em>Auld, </em>and by him assigned to <em>Ramsay, be </em>perpetuated; and that <em>Ramsay </em>surrender the said bonds to <em>Strider, </em>to be cancelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">But although <em>Ramsay </em>has shewn no cause, as between him and <em>Breckenridge </em>and <em>Strider, </em>to enforce the collection of the bonds assigned to him by <em>Auld, </em>yet as <em>Auld </em>admits that the said bonds were assigned by him for valuable and full consideration, the court is of opinion that that admission gives to <em>Ramsay </em>a just claim against <em>Auld, </em>and entitles <em>Ramsay </em>to receive from <em>Breckenridge </em>the sum of 3347 dollars 31 cents, found due from <em>Breckenridge </em>to <em>Auld </em>by the award of the arbitrators in the proceedings mentioned, with interest thereon from the first day of January in the year 1835; and that the said sum, with interest as aforesaid, is chargeable as a lien on the said lands herein before directed to be surrendered to <em>the </em>said <em>Breckenridge: </em>that <em>Breckenridge </em>be directed to pay to <em>Ramsay </em>the said sum of 3347 dollars 31 cents with interest as aforesaid, on or before the expiration of sixty days from and after the time when he shall receive possession of the land as aforesaid; and that in default of said payment, the said land shall be sold, in whole or in part, as may be deemed most expedient, to pay such portion or part of the said sum of money and interest as aforesaid, as may remain unpaid, and the costs of the sale,\u2014on a credit of nine months for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>one third part thereof, of twelve months <em>for another </em>third part, and of eighteen months for the residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">It is therefore adjudged, ordered and decreed, <em>that </em>the decrees be reversed, with costs to the appellant <em>Breclcenridge, </em>to be paid by the executor of <em>Avid </em>out of the assets of his testator in his hands to be administered, if so much thereof he hath; the other appellees not being subjected to costs in this court, because the appellee <em>Strider gets by the decree of this court a </em>rescission of the contract of purchase, which he sought in the court below, and which was denied by the decree of that court; and because the appellee <em>Ramsay </em>prevails in this court, to the extent that he prevailed in the court below. And the cause is remanded to the circuit court, to be further proceeded in <em>according to the </em>principles before declared.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
