Administration of <em>CralTe\u2019s </em>estate was granted to <em>Griffin H.

The character, he said, of property belonging to the estate of a decedent, and the respective rights of parties interested in it, are ascertained at the time of the decedent\u2019s death. If the will directs land to be sold and the money to be paid to a legatee, the failure to make the sale is immaterial: though the legatee die before the land has been actually converted into money, it nevertheless passes as money, to his personal representatives, not to his heirs. <em>Tazewell &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Smith's adm'r, </em>1 Rand. 313. 320. <em>Ashby </em>v.

None of them provides for the restitution <em>in specie </em>of slaves in the situation in which these were at <em>Cralle's </em>death, but only (at most) for indemnification to the owners. Indeed no british minister would have dared to make such a stipulation, knowing the theory of the law of <em>England </em>in respect to slavery on the english soil. The claims of american owners of deported slaves are recognized and treated, from first to last, as money claims, not as claims to specific property. The property in the slaves had been divested by the act of deportation <em>jure belli. </em>And even if the british government had expressly agreed to restore the slaves deported, such agreement would not have had the effect to revest the property; it would have been merely an executory contract of the british government to restore, and nowise equivalent to the actual restitution. The fund then was money <em>de facto\\ </em>when it came to the hands of the administrator, and there was nothing in the transactions between the two governments which impressed on it the character of slave property. Indeed <em>Cralle </em>never had, under the treaties, a right to claim even pecuniary compensation for the loss of these <em>slaves; </em>though his administrator did obtain such com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>pensation by an equitable construction made by the american commissioners for distributing the fund which the british government had paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGy\"><em>CraTle, </em>therefore, having no property in these slaves at the time of his death, the cases cited on the other side are wholly inapplicable.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-5\"><em>Leigh, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkIZ\">The dispute between the american and british governments as to the construction of the first article of the treaty of <em>Ghent, </em>related to slaves and other property on board the british vessels lying in our waters at the exchange of the ratifications of the treaty. Our government contended that <em>Great Britain </em>by that article had stipulated not to carry away, but to make restitution of, all slaves and other property of american citizens which might be in that situation. Suppose the slaves then on board the british vessels had been, in conformity with that construction, actually landed on our coast, and relinquished by the british forces: there can be no doubt that the property would have remained <em>in specie </em>to the original owners. The construction maintained by the american government was the true construction of the article, and the slaves ought to have been so landed and relinquished. The award made by the emperor of <em>Russia </em>proceeds upon that construction : it declares that the <em>United States </em>are entitled to claim a just indemnification for all private property carried away by the british forces; not because the treaty bound <em>Great Britain </em>to pay a pecuniary equivalent for such slaves and other property of american citizens as she should think proper to carry away, but because she had thereby stipulated not to carry away any such property at all, but on the contrary to leave it with the american authorities, for the purpose of restoration to the owners. The appellee\u2019s counsel interprets the word <em>indemnification </em>as importing a pecuniary equivalent only. This interpretation is too narrow. In the case of a lawless or unjust deportation of specific property, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>best and most perfect indemnification is always the res- .. , titution ot the property Uselr. <em>Besides, </em>by the 6th artide of the convention for carrying the award into execution, the sum awarded to each owner of slaves was t0 bg paj\u00bf t0 bim itjn peu Jjjg siaveS)\u201d and &lt;*on condition of such releases or assignments to be given\u201d as the commissioners should direct; that is, releases or assignments of the right to the slaves <em>in specie. </em>The owner retained the right to demand, and the british government the right to make, the restitution of the specific property <em>if to be had: </em>the alternative value was to be paid in money, if the property could not be restored <em>in specie. </em>Suppose <em>Cralle </em>had died having an unsatisfied judgment in detinue, for a slave or the alternative value : could it be contended that in the event the slave could not be had, the widow would be entitled to regard the right of the intestate as a right to a sum of money merely, and to claim an absolute property in her distributive share ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-7\">If the appellee\u2019s <em>counsel </em>is correct in his idea that <em>Cralle </em>had no right even to pecuniary compensation for the loss of his slaves, then the administrator has received money to which the estate was not entitled, and the widow has no just claim to any part of it.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-10\"> He had been counsel for the appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b517-8\"> \u201c All territory, places and possessions whatsoever, taken by either party from the other during the war, or which may be taken after the signing of this treaty, excepting only the islands hereinafter mentioned, shall be restored without delay, and without causing any destruction, or carrying away any of the artillery or other public property originally captured in the said forts or places, and which shall remain therein upon the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty, or any slaves or other private property.\u201d Treaty of <em>Ghent, </em>art. 1.

The two governments, not being able to agree, made and concluded a convention on the 20th day of October 1818, by which they referred the difference to the decision of the emperor of <em>Russia. </em>In this convention it was recited that the <em>United States </em>claimed for their citizens, and as their private property, <em>the restitution of, or full compensation for, </em>all slaves which were embraced by their construction of the treaty as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">On the 22d of April 1822, the emperor of <em>Russia </em>made his award, sustaining the construction given to the treaty by the american government: the words of the award being, that <em>\u201c </em>the <em>United States </em>of <em>America </em>are entitled to claim from <em>Great Britain </em>a just <em>indemnification </em>for all private property which the british forces may have carried away, and as the question relates to slaves more especially, for all the slaves that the british forces may have carried away, from places and territories of which the treaty stipulates the restitution, in quitting these same places and territoriesand that \u201c the <em>United States </em>are entitled to consider as having been so carried away, all such slaves as may have been transferred from the above mentioned territories to british vessels wdthin the waters of the said territories, <em>and who for this reason may not have heen restored.\u201d </em>On the 12th of July 1822, a convention was executed to carry into effect this award. By the first article, commissioners were to be appointed to ascertain and determine the amount of <em>indemnif cation </em>which might be due to citizens of the <em>United States </em>under the award. The average value to be allowed for each slave for whom indemnification might be due, was to be fixed. The evidence in support of the claims for indemnification was to be examined and decided on. And after the commissioners should have decided, the british government engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>to cause the sum awarded to each and every owner in ^eu h*s slaves, to be paid at the times and places awarded, and on condition of such releases or assignments to be given, as the commissioners should direct. Difficuhies having arisen in the execution of this convention, on the 13th of November 1826 another convention was made, by which <em>Great Britain </em>agreed to pay and the <em>United States </em>to receive, for the use of the persons entitled to <em>indemnification </em>and <em>compensation </em>by virtue of the decision of the emperor of <em>Russia </em>and the subsequent convention, a specific sum in lieu of and in full and complete satisfaction for all sums claimed or claimable from <em>Great Britain </em>by any person under the said decision and convention. And the adjustment of the claims and distribution of the sum paid was to be made in such manner as the <em>United States </em>alone should determine. This ended the controversy between the two governments; and on the 2d of March 1827 an act of congress passed, creating a commission to determine on the claims, and directing the distribution of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Certain slaves, the property of the appellant\u2019s intestate, had been carried away. He died in 1825, leaving a widow; and after his death, his administrator preferred a claim and received a sum of money on account of these slaves. As the intestate died without issue, his widow claims, under our act of distributions, one half of the sum received as indemnity for the deported slaves, as her absolute property; and the administrator contends that she is entitled only to such interest in the money as she would have been entitled to in the slaves for which it was received, that is, an estate for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">As <em>Great Britain </em>stipulated to restore the slaves and private properly which remained in the places designated, it is unnecessary to enquire what would have been the effect of the capture upon the title of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>owner. By the <em>jus postliminii, </em>if the property so captured had been restored, and had come again into the power and possession of the original owner, his title would not have been considered as divested by the capture. But the property in question was not restored; the possession of the original owner was never resumed; and it would not be contended that under the provisions of this treaty, he could have followed the property, and asserted his claim to it as against individuals into whose hands it had fallen. His claim was, through his government, upon the government of <em>Great Britain, </em>and not to the specific chattel wherever it might be found. To constitute a complete title to the thing, possession must have been acquired; and that not being resumed, the claim of the original owner was, through his government, upon the foreign government for indemnity. It therefore would seem to follow, that as soon as it was ascertained that the property was not or could not be reclaimed, that fact destroyed all title to the identical property. Whatever was afterwards received on account of it, was so received by way of indemnity and compensation for the loss. If the case stood therefore upon the treaty of <em>Ghent </em>alone, it seems to me that in the event which has happened, the money paid could not, as between these parties, be regarded as slaves. To liken it to the case of private individuals, here was an executory contract to restore property, the title to which, under the laws of war, was divested by the capture, and by the continued possession of the enemy. Under the treaty and by right of postliminy, if the possession had been restored, the original title would have been revested and have overreached the capture. ' But it was not so restored; the title never did revest, and the claim of the party was for compensation for the breach in not restoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">But the subsequent conventions between the governments would seem to remove all difficulty, as the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>could claim only through the acts of his government. It had full authority to surrender his rights, or commute them, or accept such compensation for them as it thought proper. By the convention of 1818, the <em>United States </em>c]a;me(j for their citizens the restitution of, or full compensation for, all slaves carried away against the treaty as they construed it. This claim, thus stated in the alternative, was submitted to the arbitrator. He decided that they were entitled to indemnification from <em>Great Britain </em>for the slaves so carried away; and to render it perfectly certain for what this indemnity was to be paid, he further stated that they were entitled to consider as having been so carried away, all such slaves as might have been transferred &amp;c. and who for this reason had not been restored; thereby shewing that after such carrying away, restitution could not be made, and therefore indemnification was given. The claim for restoration was submitted; the decision put an end to it <em>by awarding indemnity, and is conclusive as to </em>the title to the specific property.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">After this award, restoration of the property is no more heard of. The convention of 1822, for carrying the award into effect, speaks of the indemnity alone, and fixes the mode by which the amount is to be ascertained and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Some reliance was placed upon the clause in the treaty, by which the british government engaged to pay the sum awarded to the owner in lieu of his slaves, on condition of such releases and assignments to be given, as the commissioners should direct. I do not understand this as recognizing a right then subsisting to have the specific thing, (for that would be contradicting the words of the award and treaty,) but simply as shewing that the money was paid as an indemnity for the specific property for which compensation was awarded. And as to the releases or assignments, it is to be observed that, by the treaty, <em>Great Britain </em>was to pay to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>each owner. The decision of the commissioners would furnish evidence of the claim ; and it was necessary for her security that some authentic evidence of the payment should be furnished. This, it seems to me, was the object of this clause. <em>Cralle </em>died after the ratification of this treaty. His right then, as secured by his government, was a right to a pecuniary indemnity for his loss, and the subsequent treaty and law merely provided for the payment, but did not vary the character of the subject. His administrator received it as a pecuniary compensation to which his intestate was entitled, and is bound to distribute it as other money of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">I think the widow is entitled to claim the moiety as her absolute property, and that the decree should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Brooke and Baldwin, \u00ab7. concurring, decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
