And the articles contained a covenant in these words: \u201c As the sufficiency of the titles, by which the lands aforesaid are respectively held by the parties, is not known to them, for the further assurance of the sufficiency, the said <em>Mercer </em>covenants and agrees, that he will procure <em>Charles F.

Mercer, </em>and appointed him executor : who, in July 1819, exhibited his <em>bill </em>against <em>Richards, </em>in the superiour court of chancery of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>setting forth the facts above stated; complaining, that in the survey which had been made at <em>Richards\u2019s </em>instance, in May 1810, there were in truth 441 instead of 373 acres of <em>bottom, </em>and only 305 instead of 373 acres of <em>hill land; </em>insisting that, consequently, according to the terms of the <em>proviso </em>contained in the deed of November 8th 1809, <em>Richards </em>was bound to take 136 acres more of <em>hill </em>land at the price of <em>seven </em>dollars per acre; and praying, that the land might be laid off to <em>Richards </em>conformably with the true intent of the covenants and of the deed, and that he might be decreed to settle and to pay the balance of the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-8\"><em>Richards, </em>in his <em>answer, </em>insisted on the survey of Ma1810, as fair in itself, and one in which the <em>Mercers </em>had acquiesced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>In the progress of the canse, ihe chancellor ordered a survey, which was made and returned by the surveyor of <em>Mason. </em>It appeared by this survey, that the quantity of <em>bottom </em>land was 411 acres; and the line, called the <em>short </em>parallel, was thrown out, so as to include the equal quantity of <em>hill </em>land; making in all 822 acres; that is to say, 76 acres more than <em>Richards\u2019s </em>survey had made it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-4\">The chancellor also ordered an account, to ascertain the balance of the purchase money due from <em>Richards. </em>The commissioner reported that both parties acquiesced in the last survey, and stated the balance to be 1,774 dollars, with interest &amp;c. With this report both parties were content.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-5\">But <em>Richards, </em>in the moan time, by leave of the court, filed a <em>supplemental answer; </em>wherein he stated, that since filing bis former answer, be bad discovered, that the whole tract of 14,000 acres, whereof the land be bad bought of <em>John </em>F. <em>Mercer </em>was parcel, had been mortgaged by <em>Charles F. Mercer </em>to <em>William Philip Perrin </em>of <em>London, </em>to secure <em>\u00a3 </em>3,375. sterling, payable in four equal annual instalments, with interest from October 1803; and that this mortgage (for aught he knew) was still a subsisting security and incumbrance on the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b141-6\">Upon this, all the deeds affecting the title, were exhibited. The land was originally granted to <em>George Mercer, </em>by the colonial government, by patent dated in December 1772, wherein the quantity is stated to be 13,532 acres. <em>George Mercer, </em>by deed of lease and release, dated in November .1773, conveyed the whole tract to <em>William Philip Perrin </em>(described as being of the parish of <em>St. George, Bloomsbury, </em>in the county of <em>Middlesex). </em>By deed of lease and release, dated October 1803, <em>W. P. Perrin </em>(described in this deed, as being of <em>Dorset </em>street, in the parish of <em>St. Mary Le Bone </em>in the county of <em>Middlesex) </em>conveyed the whole tract to <em>Charles F. Mercer, </em>for the consideration of <em>\u00a3 </em>3,375. sterling, payable in four instalments: And <em>C. F. Mercer </em>immediately <em>mortgaged </em>it to <em>Perrin </em>(described here also as of <em>Dorset </em>street &amp;c.) as a security for the purchase mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ney. He also gave his bonds for the debt, in which <em>Mr, Monroe, </em>then <em>American </em>Minister at <em>London, </em>and a <em>Mr. Remolds </em>of <em>London, </em>were his sureties. And, in July 1809, <em>Perrin </em>conveyed the land and assigned the mortgage and the debt to <em>Rennolds. </em>The conveyance from <em>Perrin </em>to <em>C. F. Mercer, </em>was recorded in the general court; but neither <em>Mercer's mortgage </em>to <em>Perrin, </em>nor <em>Perrin's </em>assignment thereof to <em>Rennolds, </em>was ever recorded in <em>Virginia.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-4\"><em>Mercer </em>averred, that the whole of the debt due to <em>Perrin, </em>had long since been paid ; and he adduced evidence, which rendered it highly probable, though .not certain, that it was paid. But no release of the mortgage, either by the heirs of <em>Perrin </em>or of <em>Rennolds </em>(they were both dead) was produced ; and it seems, that for the want of knowledge who or where they were, such release could not be procured. It appeared, indeed, that <em>Mercer </em>had forgotten the execution of the mortgage, till he was reminded of it by the supplemental answer of <em>Richards.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\">The chancellor was of opinion, that the mortgage to <em>Perrin </em>was no obstacle to the relief prayed by <em>Mercer; </em>and he decreed, that <em>Richards </em>should pay <em>Mercer </em>the balance of 1,774 dollars, with interest <em>&amp;c. </em>and'the costs of suit: but the decree did not require, that <em>Mercer </em>should convey to <em>Richards, </em>the surplus 76 acres of <em>hill </em>land, included in the lines of the survey made under the order of court, which the decree compelled <em>Richards </em>to take, and the price of which constituted part of the balance of purchase money decreed. <em>Richards </em>appealed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9PW\"><em>Stanard, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6g\">made two objections to the decree. 1st. The deed of November 1809 conveys the land lying within certain defined metes and bounds, and no more; and the survey made under the order of the chancellor' having departed from those metes and bounds, and thrown, out the <em>short parallel, </em>so as to include 76 acres of <em>hill </em>land lying <em>without </em>the metes and bounds specified in the deed, that deed did not pass this additional 76 acres. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>proviso </em>in the deed is an executory contract for the conveyanee of such additional quantity$ but it is not itself a conveyance, nor can it enlarge the actual conveyance that pro-cedes it. It is apparent, that the deed was not intended to Convey, by its own force, more than the quantity contained within the bounds therein specified. The chancellor, therefore, ought not to have decreed the unconditional payment of the whole purchase money, including the price of the, additional 76 acres, without providing that <em>Mercer </em>should make a conveyance.thereof to <em>Richards.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b143-4\">2d. The proof of the payment of the debt due to <em>Perrin </em>and secured by the mortgage, is insufficient to establish the fact; and if the debt be paid, yet the mortgage has not been released, and therefore the <em>legal estate </em>is still outstanding in the heir at law of <em>Perrin </em>or of <em>Rennolds ; </em>neither has the heir at law of <em>Perrin </em>or of <em>Rennolds </em>been made a party, so that the court could decree a release of the mortgage. <em>John F. Mercer, </em>at the time of his sale to <em>Richards, </em>and <em>Charles F. Mercer, </em>at the time of the decree, held only an equitable estate. And the court ought not to have made the decree until the legal title was got in; or at least it ought to have made the payment of the balance of the purchase money by <em>Richards, </em>dependent on the consummation of his title.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b143-5\"><em>Harrison </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atb\">As to the 1st point: To understand the description of the land contained in the deed, and especially the effect of the <em>proviso, </em>it must be remarked, that, at the time the deed was made, the river boundary in front, the western line <em>(Mercer </em>and <em>Garnett's </em>line), the back line of the military survey, the eastern line running out from the river quite through the bottom to the very foot of the river hills but no farther <em>(Maret's </em>lower line), and the back line of <em>Maret's </em>land, were all fixed and known to the parties; and the river hills gave the line which divided the <em>bottom </em>from the <em>hill </em>land; so that the <em>boundaries of the bottom land </em>were fixed; but the <em>quantity </em>of the <em>bottom </em>land had not been ascertained; consequently, it was not known <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>where the <em>short parallel, </em>or the line which was to be run parallel to <em>Mercer </em>and <em>Garnett's </em>line, and which was to be run from the back line to <em>Maret\u2019s </em>land, ought to be located, so as to include as much of <em>hill </em>as there was of <em>bottom </em>land; and consequently, too, the number of acres intended to be sold was not ascertained. Therefore, it was not intended to fix the location of the <em>short parallel </em>by the deed, but to prescribe a certain method of locating it: the quantity of <em>bottom </em>land within the known boundaries of it, was first to be ascertained; and then the <em>short parallel </em>was to be drawn in, or thrown out, so as to give an equal quantity of <em>hill </em>land. The function of the <em>proviso </em>is to explain the previous description of the land conveyed: it is part of the description. The deed leaves the <em>short parallel </em>ambulatory; but it prescribes a plain and simple mathematical process for the location of it; and wherever it should by that process be located, it was the <em>effect </em>as well as the <em>intent </em>of the deed, to convey all the land within it, and no more. Greater precision and certainty cannot be required. Accordingly, <em>Richards </em>made no complaint in the court of chancery, as to the sufficiency of the deed to convey <em>all </em>the land included in the last survey, which fixed the location of the <em>short parallel; </em>and the amount of the purchase money, by his express assent before the commissioner, was computed with reference to the quantity shewn by that survey.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b144-5\">As to the 2d objection, there are many considerations any one of which would furnish a sufficient answer, much more all combined. 1. The mortgage to <em>Perrin </em>was never recorded in <em>Virginia ; </em>and it was a conveyance of real estate to an alien, for <em>Perrin </em>is therein described as of <em>Dorset </em>street, in the parish of <em>St. Mary Le Bone </em>in the county of <em>Middlesex; </em>and though the instrument might have been available as a security in equity, yet as there can be little doubt that the mortgage debt has been satisfied, it could never avail him to recover the naked legal title. 2. There was certainly no fraudulent concealment of this incumbrance practised by <em>John F. Mercer </em>upon <em>Richards: </em>On <em>the con</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>trary, llie probable defect of the title is noticed in the original articles of August 31st 1809. <em>Richards, </em>in all prohability, had actual notice of this mortgage, when he purchased: and if he had not, he might with the exercise of the slightest diligence have had notice of it: if he looked at all into the title of his vendor (as all purchasers ought, and almost all do) he would have seen a recital of this mortgage in the deed under which his vendor immediately claimed, then of record in <em>Mason </em>county court open to his inspection; namely, <em>Charles V. Mercer\u2019s </em>deed to his brother and <em>Mr. Garnett, </em>of January 13th 1804. He took, and he has hitherto held, possession, undisturbed. No suit has been prosecuted; none is threatened. He cannot now object this technical and patent, if not known, defect in the title. Sugd. law of Vend. <em>2, </em>8. Id. ch. 9. \u00a7 vi. 345, 6, 7. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Ralston </em>v. <em>Miller, 3 </em>Rand. 44. <em>Vail </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>4 Rand. 478. And 3. <em>Richards </em>knew there were doubts concerning the title, and stipulated for a particular security; a covenant of general warranty, wherein <em>Charles F. Mercer </em>should join with the vendor. This security he has got. He can ask no more. Sugd. ch. 9. \u00a7 iv. 331. Harg. Co. Litt. 384. a. note 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-7\"><em>Stanard, </em>in reply. The reasoning, by which the appellee\u2019s counsel endeavour to obviate the first objection to the decree, conflicts with the principle on which the <em>bill </em>is framed, its prayer and its object. The argument concludes, that the deed of November 1809, was an <em>executed </em>contract in all its parts, and that this is a suit only to recover the purchase money : whereas the <em>bill </em>treats the <em>proviso </em>contained in the deed as an <em>executory </em>covenant, and prays a specific execution of it. And the bill takes the right ground. There is not a single word <em>of grant or conveyance </em>in the deed, that applies to a foot of land lying without the lines therein specified : the <em>proviso, </em>surely contains no words of <em>grant; </em>it is, in its terms, an executory contract; there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>nothing in the context, to give it a meaning variant from that which its words import; and no principle of equity or even of convenience requires, that the construction should be strained in the least. The <em>short parallel </em>is defined by the deed as precisely as any other line: the deed gives its course, its <em>terminus a quo </em>and <em>terminus ad </em>quern; calls for a straight line, parallel to <em>Mercer </em>and <em>Garnett\u2019s </em>line, from <em>Marefs </em>corner to the back line of the military survey j and conveys all the <em>hill </em>land included <em>within that line, </em>and neither more nor less. The <em>proviso </em>is a covenant providing for <em>a future change </em>of this line. Its language is prospective throughout; providing what should be done afterwards, and not even professing to declare what was done, or intended to be done, in this particular, by the deed. If the <em>short parallel </em>as located by the deed, should be found to include <em>more </em>of <em>hill </em>than of <em>bottom </em>land, the <em>proviso </em>bound <em>Mercer </em>to take a re-conveyance of the excess, and to make a proportional abatement from the price; if found to include <em>less </em>of <em>hill </em>than of <em>bottom, Richards </em>was hound to accept a conveyance of, and to pay for, an additional quantity of <em>hill </em>land. This is the effect of the <em>proviso. </em>According to the construction of the appellee\u2019s counsel, the deed does not, <em>proprio vigore, </em>pass the additional <em>hill </em>land; it operates to convey it, <em>only by force of the future survey: </em>in effect, the <em>survey, </em>not the <em>deed, </em>is the operative conveyance of the additional 76 acres of <em>hill </em>land : and whether a <em>survey </em>can be a <em>conveyance </em>of land, let the court judge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-6\">Then, as to the incumbrance of <em>Perrin's </em>mortgage. That this mortgage was not recorded, can no wise help <em>Richards, </em>seeing that he has notice of it, before payment of the purchase money. Supposing <em>Perrin </em>an <em>alien, </em>and admitting that therefore he cannot claim to take and hold under the mortgage, as a conveyance, at law, it is nevertheless effectual as a security for the debt in equity y and I submit, that the evidence does not suffice to establish the payment of the debt. But, there is no proof that <em>Perrin </em>was an <em>alien, </em>unless it be impossible that an <em>American </em>citizen can be domi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>ciled in <em>London. </em>And if the description of <em>Perrin\u2019s </em>domicil in the mortgage, prove him an <em>alien, </em>it proves too, that he was a <em>british subject; </em>so that he was competent to take and hold under <em>George Mercer\u2019s </em>conveyance of November 1773 ; and, under that conveyance, as the land was never confiscated, he continued to hold it, till the 6th article of the treaty of 1783 prevented any future confiscation, and till the 9th article of the treaty of 1794 secured his title, and provided, that with respect to this subject, and the legal remedies incident thereto, he should not be regarded as an <em>alien, </em>but might grant, sell or devise it, <em>in like manner </em>as if he was an <em>American </em>citizen. (1 Bior. Laws U. S. 205. 212.) That <em>Perrin </em>was competent to sell and convey the subject in 1803, the appellee himself must <em>maintain; </em>else <em>Richards </em>has no title at all. Can it be doubted, that the treaty of 1794 enabled him to take an immediate mortgage of the same subject, to secure the purchase money ? The argument deduced from the supposition, that <em>Richards </em>had actual notice of <em>Perrin\u2019s </em>mortgage, or at least that that incumbrance was a patent defect in the title, of which he might without gross negligence have acquired knowledge, is refuted by the fact, clearly appearing on the record, that this mortgage was so little known, or had made so little impression on the <em>Mercers </em>themselves, that <em>Charles F. Mercer, </em>who executed the instrument, had forgotten that it ever existed. With what reason can it be contended that <em>Richards </em>\"ivas conusant of that of which the <em>Mercers </em>were ignorant ? There is as little reason to impute knowledge of the defect to him, as concealment of it to them. The proposition, that the parties have stipulated, and <em>Richards </em>has obtained a particular security against defects of title, namely, a general warranty of the land, in which both the <em>Mercers </em>joined, is quite destitute of foundation, unless the appellee be at liberty to toar a covenant out of the contract of August 1809, for the sale of 1300 acres of land on <em>Sixteen Mile creek, </em>though that contract was completely abandoned, and to insert it in the new contract, evidenced by the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>of November 1809, for the sale of another parcel of land on <em>Crab </em>creek. Let it be remembered, that this is not a case of a purchaser coming into equity, asking relief on account of defect of title, after having accepted a conveyance, and paid the purchase money, but of a vendor, claiming specific execution and payment of the purchase money, and a defect of title discovered, before the purchase money is all paid, and before specific execution decreed. In such a case, the very authorities cited for the appellee, prove that the vendor is bound to clear the title. Sugd. ch. 9. \u00a7 vi. p. 345. The objection to the title is not merely technical: the legal estate is outstanding: and this is so serious an objection, that it has become a settled and invariable rule, that a purchaser shall not be compelled to accept a doubtful title, nor be forced to take an equitable one. Sugd. ch. 7. \u00a7 III. 242.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b145-9\"><em> </em>The edition of <em>Sugden\u2019s </em>treatise, to which these references are made, is <em>Ingraham\u2019s Philadelphia </em>edition of 1820.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AqC\">Coalter, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ARr\">compared the price at which <em>John F. Mercer </em>sold <em>Richards </em>the tract of 822 acres, with that at which <em>Charles F. Mercer </em>bought of <em>Perrin </em>the whole military tract of 13,582 acres; and shewed, that the purchase money of the small parcel bought by <em>Richards, </em>containing not a <em>sixteenth </em>of the whole tract, amounted to about a <em>third </em>of the purchase money for which the whole tract had been bought of <em>Perrin: </em>whence, he said, it might be fairly inferred, that if the whole debt secured by the mortgage to <em>Perrin, </em>were yet unsatisfied, there would be land enough, and much more than enough, to satisfy the whole debt, without touching the painel held by <em>Richards. </em>But he remarked there were many circumstances (which he stated and commented on) to raise a belief that the debt to <em>Perrin </em>had been fully paid.</p>\n<p id=\"A_s\">And (he proceeded) though these circumstances do not amount to absolute proof of the payment of the debt secured by the mortgage to <em>Perrin, </em>yet they go so strongly to establish a belief that this must be the fact, as to authorise us (as it seems to me), especially connected with the other circumstances of the case, to leave the party to his remedy on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the covenants in his deed. Those other circumstances are, that first stated, namely, the improbability that the parcel of land bought by <em>Richards, </em>could in any event be touched by <em>Perrin\u2019s </em>mortgage, and the further fact, that the parties, being ignorant as to the goodness of the title to the lands given in exchange under the contract, or being apprised that difficulties of some kind or other did exist, agreed mutually to procure others to join them in the deeds and covenants of warranty, so as to secure them against such defects. This, therefore, is stronger than the ordinary case of covenants by a <em>vendor alone; </em>a particular security was required, and that very security given: and if, in an ordinary case, a court (under such circumstances as this case presents) might turn the party over to his covenants, <em>a fortiori </em>may it be done where security was required and given.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">It is said, the legal title is still outstanding, and the party has a right to have it in. If, however, the debt has been paid, as there is every reason to believe, can actual notice of an unrecorded mortgage, after payment, affect the party at law ? Is it not void for want of registry, unless notice is given before the debt is discharged ? I incline to think there can be no danger to the party on this ground. The deed to <em>Richards </em>does not lead him, by reference, to the deed of <em>Charles F. Mercer, </em>to his brother and <em>Mr. Garnett, </em>in which alone the mortgage is mentioned; and he swears he had no actual notice of the mortgage until May 1822. At most, then, he had before that time, such implied notice as might affect him in equity in relation to the creditor, had the mortgage been undischarged. It seems to me, it could not have been the intention of the legislature, that notice of an <em>unrecorded satisfied </em>mortgage should affect the party at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">I should be sorry to be obliged to say, that a mortgage executed in a foreign country, held up for so long a time, and when it must be so difficult to get releases &amp;c. shall be a sufficient ground, on which to hold up the purchase money, especially under the circumstances attending this case. How long is it to be held up ?</p>\n<p id=\"AgBE\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The <em>mere possibility </em>that the legal title conveyed by the mortgage may prove a disturbance to <em>Richards\u2019s </em>title, resting on the <em>intire improbability </em>that the debt has not been paid, or that it cannot be paid out of the remaining lands, is surely too slight a ground, on which either to vacate the contract, if that was asked, or to tie up the purchase money to an indefinite period of time. The covenants and security given in the deed ought to be enough to cover this surmise of a want of clear title. How could <em>Perrin </em>disturb the title, either at law or in equity, if the money has been paid, or can be satisfied out of the remaining lands, or can be made out of <em>Mercer 9</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">But it is further said, that the deed does not convey that small portion of the <em>hill </em>land, which is now embraced by the moveable line, as now established by the decree in tins case.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">This seems to be an objection thought of, for the first time, in this court. It is not taken in the answer; and it is not to be supposed, that, if any doubt had been suggested in the court below, there could have been any hesitation in that court to decree a conveyance thereof, either by the party, or by a commissioner. If there were any doubt on this subject, however, and if the decree were to be reversed on such ground, the costs ought to be paid by the appellant, the appellee having substantially prevailed. But can there be any doubt as to this matter ?</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The <em>bottom </em>land was bounded by the river on one side, and by established lines on two of the other sides, running out from the river to the hills; and was bounded on the other side by the <em>hill </em>land. The whole <em>bottom </em>land is conveyed, but the quantity was not precisely known. Had the parties established the lines along the foot of the hill, and slated them in the deed, leaving the quantity unascertained, and then made the same provisions as are now contained in the deed; it is believed, all would agree that the deed would convey one equal quantity of <em>hill </em>land. The parties intended a <em>conveyance, </em>and not an <em>executory contract, </em>as to the <em>hill </em>land; and the question is, whether, as the margin of the <em>hill </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>land was not ascertained <em>in the deed, </em>but as that must now be a matter resting on <em>opinion only, </em>the deed can operate a conveyance ? This objection, if well founded, might (it seems to me) go further than in the argument it was thought fit to push it: it might go to shew that the contract itself, considering it executory, could not be executed for uncertainty. Who is to form this <em>opinion, </em>if the parties, themselves, have left it vague ? But if others can ascertain the line of division between the <em>hill </em>and <em>bottom </em>land, then so soon as that is done, it is as certain, as if the parties themselves had done it in the first instance, and the residue follows by mathematical certainty. That is certain which can be rendered so. Suppose the parties themselves, or a surveyor for them, had run this <em>border line, </em>so as to ascertain the quantity of <em>bottom </em>land, and they had thus been satisfied as to that, and the surveyor had proceeded, with like consent, to close and mark the open line, and <em>Mercer </em>had afterwards brought his ejectment for the land, thus embraced in the survey, is it possible, that any court of law, these facts appearing, could hesitate in deciding that the deed covered this land ?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">But hero is a decree settling the boundary, in a suit brought by .Mercer, claiming to settle it <em>precisely </em>as it has been; and it is, in fact, by the assent of both parties to the survey, settled to their <em>mutual satisfaction. </em>Who can disturb this P not <em>Mercer </em>surely; and if he cannot, no one under him can; no one can, except one having title paramount to both. No.mere intruder could prevail against this title, thus confirmed by a decree <em>founded on assent as to the boundaries. </em>Hence, no one in the court below dreamed of the-necessity of a farther conveyance. The strong reasons urged in the argument in favour of this position, also furnish additional ground to shew, that no doubt ought to exist on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">On the whole, therefore, 1 think the decree ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">The other judges concurred, and the decree was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
