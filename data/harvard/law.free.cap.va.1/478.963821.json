The whole tract is sold under the trust deed, and conveyed by the trustee to the purchaser; who, in 1820, brings suit in chancery against the original owner, his vendee of the 100 acres, and a third person, by whom a lien on the land is claimed under a trust deed prior in date to that under which-the plaintiff purchased; the object of the suit being to have the plaintiff\u2019s title quieted, and possession of the land delivered to him. The vendee of the <em>100 </em>acres, having failed <em>to </em>answer the bill though duly seryed with process, is brought into court in June 1832 to answer interrogatories, and the plaintiff thereupon offering him the election, to taire a conveyance from the plaintiff of his title to the 100 acres, and pay him the residue of the purchase money stipulated with the vendor, or else to surrender his own title under the vendor\u2019s deed, he answers, declining to have his contract with the vendor carried into execution, and reclaiming the purchase money he has paid him. The .land has then become greatly depreciated in value. In 1833 it is decided that the first deed of trust has been satisfied, and that the defendant claiming under it has no lien. In 1834 the court not only decrees that the plaintiff be quieted in his title and possession against all the defendants, but, holding that the vendee of the 100 acres has been unreasonably delayed in his title, and that the tender by the plaintiff was too late, proceeds to decree that the contract and deed for the 100 acres be annulled, and that the vendor repay to the vendee the purchase money he has received. The vendor appeals from the decree, and in the court of appeals objects, 1. That equity ^has no jurisdiction of the plaintiff\u2019s case. 2. That the vendee ought to have been required to take the title offered by the plaintiff. 3. That the case is not one in which a decree can properly be rendered between codefendants. But the court of appeals <em>affirms the </em>decree.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>By deed dated the 12th of June 1817, <em>Jesse Jones </em>sold and conveyed to <em>Robert Morriss </em>a tract of land in <em>Campbell </em>county containing 600 acres. <em>Morriss, </em>on the same day, executed a deed conveying the land to <em>Micajah Moorman </em>and <em>Howard Bennett, </em>in trust, for securing to <em>Jones </em>the payment of the purchase money, amounting to 4905 dollars 75 cents, for which <em>Morriss </em>had given his three bonds payable respectively on the first of January 1819, 1820 and 1821. Both deeds were duly recorded in <em>Campbell </em>county court. In October 1818, it was agreed between <em>Morriss </em>and <em>Jones, </em>that <em>Jones </em>should take from <em>Morriss </em>a conveyance of another tract of land in <em>Campbell </em>county, containing about 780 acres, in satisfaction of the purchase money due for the 600 acre tract. <em>Jones </em>was put in immediate possession of the 780 acre tract; and on the 18th of November 1818, he surrendered <em>Morriss's </em>three bonds, endorsing thereon a receipt in full, and taking <em>Morriss's </em>written promise to make him a deed for the land ; which was accordingly executed on the 8th of January 1819, and recorded in the county court of <em>Campbell </em>on the 8th day of February 1819. But no release of the trust deed to <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Bennett </em>was executed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\">After the contract between <em>Morriss </em>and <em>Jones </em>respecting the tract of 780 acres was entered into, but before the land was conveyed to <em>Jones, </em>namely, on the 12th of November 1818, <em>Morriss </em>conveyed the same land, with other property, to <em>Christopher Winfree </em>in trust for the purpose of securing a large debt to <em>D. W. &amp; C. Warwick. </em>This deed was duly recorded in the corporation court of <em>Hynchburg </em>on the 4th of March 1819; and being produced to the county court of <em>Campbell </em>on the 12th of April 1819, with the certificate of the registry in the corporation court endorsed upon it, was thereupon ordered to be recorded in the county court. When <em>Jones </em>received his conveyance from <em>Morriss, </em>he had, it seems, no notice of the trust deed to <em>Winfree </em>for the benefit of the <em>Warwicks.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AnxN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>On the 12th of March 1819, <em>Morriss </em>conveyed the tract of 600 acres to <em>Samuel Garland </em>and <em>John H. Smith, </em>trustees, for the purpose of indemnifying <em>Robert L. Coleman </em>and <em>Nicholas Harrison, </em>who had endorsed his notes <em>to </em>a large amount. When <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison </em>took this conveyance from <em>Morriss, </em>they knew that the trust deed conveying the same tract to <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Bennett, </em>for securing the payment of the purchase money to <em>Jones, </em>had never been released ; but they were also apprized of the contract between <em>Morriss </em>and <em>Jones, </em>by which the latter had surrendered <em>Morriss\u2019s </em>bonds, and accepted the conveyance of the 780 acre tract in payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">Shortly after the execution of the trust deed to <em>Garland </em>and <em>Smith, John Dinwiddie, </em>with full notice of that deed, contracted with <em>Morriss for </em>the purchase of 100 acres parcel of the 600 acre tract, at the price of 2000 dollars, 500 dollars to be paid in cash, and the residue (for which he executed his three bonds to <em>Morriss) </em>to be paid when <em>Morriss </em>should make him a good title to the land. No particular time was limited for perfecting the title; and both parties believed that several years would elapse before it would be perfected. Meanwhile <em>Dinwiddie </em>was to have possession of the land, and his bonds were to remain in the custody of X <em>N. Cardozo. Dinwiddie </em>accordingly paid <em>Morriss </em>500 dollars in part <em>of </em>the purchase money <em>; his </em>bonds <em>for the residue </em>were delivered to <em>Cardozo; </em>and he received from <em>Morriss </em>the possession of the land, and a conveyance of the same, bearing <em>date </em>tne 1st of May 1819.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-7\"><em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison, </em>having been compelled to take up notes endorsed by them for <em>Morriss </em>to the amount of 6500 dollars, required the trustees <em>Garland </em>and <em>Smith </em>to make sale of the 600 acre tract, in pursuance of the deed of the 12th March 1819. The said trustees accordingly sold the land at public auction, on the 23d of July 1819. <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison </em>became the purcha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>sers, for a sum less than the amount which <em>Morriss </em>owed them ; and the land was conveyed to them by the trustees, by deed dated the 24th of July 1819. Before the properly was set up to be sold, <em>Jones </em>forbade the sale, and made known to <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison </em>and the trustees, that he claimed a lien on the land for the purchase money which would be due him from <em>Morriss, </em>in case his title to the tract of 780 acres, conveyed to him by <em>Morriss </em>as aforesaid, should fail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-4\"><em>Morriss </em>having also made default in the payment of the debt to the <em>Warwicks, </em>secured by the trust deed to <em>Winfree, </em>the tract of 780 acres was sold by <em>Winfree </em>in conformity with the provisions of that deed, and purchased <em>by Daniel Warwick, </em>(one of the firm of <em>D. W. </em>and <em>C. Warwick,) </em>to whom <em>Winfree </em>accordingly conveyed the same, by deed dated the 4th of September 1820. At the timo of this sale, <em>Jones </em>was in actual possession of the land, claiming it under his purchase from <em>Morriss. </em>Before the property was sold, he made his claim known both to <em>D. Warwick </em>and the trustee, and publicly forbade the sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-6\">In May 1820, <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison </em>filed their bill in the superior court of chancery for the <em>Lynchburg </em>district, against <em>Morriss, Jones </em>and <em>Dinwiddie, </em>together with <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Bennett </em>the trustees in <em>Morriss's </em>deed for the benefit of <em>Jones ; </em>setting forth their endorsements for <em>Morriss ; </em>his execution of the trust deed to <em>Garland </em>and <em>Smith </em>for their indemnity ; their payment of the endorsed notes; the sale under the trust deed, and their purchase of the land; <em>Morriss's </em>sale of 100 acres to <em>Dinwiddie; </em>and <em>Jones's </em>claim of a lien on the whole tract for purchase money. <em>Dinwiddie, </em>it was alleged, was in the possession of the whole 600 acres ; of 100 as purchaser from <em>Morriss, </em>and of the residue as <em>Morriss's </em>tenant at will. The prayer of the bill was, that the plaintiffs might be quieted in their title to the land, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>and have the possession thereof delivered to them ; and <em>~ </em>. ... \u201e tor general renet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADO\">- <em>Jones </em>answered, insisting on his lien for purchase money under the trust deed executed to <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Bennett, </em>the release of which, he said, it would be contrary to equity to exact from him, unless he were quieted and made secure in his title to the tract of 780 acres, against the claim set up thereto by <em>D. W. </em>and <em>C. Warwick; </em>especially as <em>Morriss </em>was notoriously insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-8\"><em>Morriss </em>answered, admitting all the allegations of the bill, and assenting to the relief prayed thereby.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b510-9\">. Process was duly served on <em>Dinwiddie; </em>but he long failed to answer the bill. The suit remained pending in the superior court of chancery until 1831, when it was duly transferred to the circuit superior court of law and chancery for the town of <em>Lynchburg. </em>In June 1832, on the motion of the plaintiffs, the court ordered that <em>Dinwiddie </em>should be brought in by a special messenger, to answer interrogatories. He was brought in accordingly on the 14th of June <em>1832; </em>when the plaintiffs propounded to him the interrogatories following: 1. Whether, under the conveyance made to him by <em>Morriss, </em>he claimed title to the 100 acres of land therein mentioned ? 2. Whether he would elect to have his contract with <em>Morriss </em>carried into execution, by a surrender of the plaintiffs\u2019 title to him, he accounting to them, as the assignees of <em>Morriss, </em>for the balance of the purchase money with interest; or to surrender his conveyance, and release his title under the same, accounting with the plaintiffs for the reasonable rents and profits of the land from the date of their purchase? To these interrogatories <em>Dinwiddie </em>answered, that he claimed no title to the 100 acres by virtue of <em>Moniss\u2019s </em>conveyance; and that he was not willing to have his contract with <em>Morriss </em>carried into execution at this late day, when the land had become greatly depreciated in value. By the leave of the court, he at the same time put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>in an answer to the bill; wherein he again declined the execution of his contract with <em>Morriss, </em>and claimed that the 500 dollars he had paid to <em>Morriss </em>should be refunded to him with interest. He also admitted that when he purchased the 100 acres, he was in possession of the whole tract, under a lease from <em>Morriss </em>for three years; and that he was still in possession of the whole at the time this suit was commenced; but he alleged that he then held the possession as tenant to the plaintiffs, the land having been leased to him from year to year, for several years, by <em>Coleman; </em>to whom he averred that he had paid the whole of the rents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b511-4\">The long pendency of <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>suit was owing to a cross suit instituted by <em>Jones. </em>His bill was filed in October 1820, against <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison, Morriss, D. W. </em>and <em>C. Warwick, Wvnfree, </em>and <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Bennett, </em>praying to be quieted in his title to the tract of 780 acres, and his possession thereof, as against the <em>Warwicks; </em>or, in case their title should be held superior to his, then that his lien on the tract of G00 acres, for the purchase money due him from <em>Morriss, </em>might be enforced, and the land sold to satisfy the same according to the provisions of <em>Morriss\u2019s </em>deed to <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Bennett. </em>Hereupon a controversy arose between <em>Jones </em>and the <em>Warwicks, </em>which Was long protracted. <em>Jones </em>dying, the suit of <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison </em>was revived against his administrator and heir, <em>Thomas Jones; </em>and the cross suit was revived in the name of the same party. In October 1825, an amended bill was filed by <em>Thomas Jones, </em>charging that <em>Morriss\u2019s </em>deed to <em>Wivfree </em>for the benefit of the <em>Warwicks </em>was never recorded according to the laws of the land, so that the same was void as to creditors and subsequent purchasers without notice. <em>Thomas Jones </em>having also died pending the controversy, the cross suit was revived in the names of his devisees, and the original suit was revived against them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A59o\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The cross suit was finally heard and determined on 8th of August \u00cd833. The court held that the deed of trust from <em>Morriss </em>to <em>Winfree </em>for the benefit of the <em>Warwicks, never having been recorded pursuarit to law in the county court of Campbell, </em>was void as against <em>Jesse Jones </em>and those claiming under him ; and therefore decreed that <em>Winfree </em>and the <em>Warwicks, </em>for the purpose of quieting the plaintiffs (the devisees of <em>Thomas Jones) </em>in their title to the tract of 780 acres in the proceedings mentioned, should, by a proper deed, release to the said plaintiffs all the right, title, interest and claim of them the said <em>Winfree </em>and <em>WarwicJcs </em>in and to the said tract: and that the defendant <em>Morriss </em>should pay the plaintiffs their costs of suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-4\">After the determination of the cross suit, namely, on the 4th of February 1834, the deposition of <em>Robert L. Coleman, </em>one of the plaintiffs in the original suit, was taken on behalf of <em>Morriss, </em>to be read as evidence between <em>Morriss </em>and his <em>codefendant Dinwiddie. Coleman </em>deposed, that shortly after the execution <em>of </em>the trust-deed to <em>Garland </em>and <em>Smith, Morriss </em>requested <em>Harrison </em>and the deponent to let <em>Dinwiddie </em>have the land which he <em>Morriss </em>had sold him: that they consented to do so, and proposed to <em>Dinwiddie </em>to complete his title as far as they could, upon his paying them 1500 dollars, the amount of his bonds to <em>Morriss </em>for the purchase money; which <em>Dinwiddie </em>refused to do: that there was a very great decline in the price of lands after <em>Dinwiddle's </em>purchase; and that deponent was always willing and desirous to take the 1500 dollars, the amount of <em>Dinwiddle's </em>bonds, for the land, and never could get it.\u2014 <em>Dinwiddie </em>excepted to this deposition, on the ground that the deponent was a party directly interested in the result of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b512-5\">The original suit of <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison </em>came on to be heard the 29th of January <em>1834; </em>when the court decreed, that as it appeared the representatives of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Jones </em>had been quieted in their title to the tract of 780 acres, therefore the plaintiffs should be forever quieted in their title to the tract of 600 acres, against the defendants and all claiming under them ; and that the defendant <em>Howard Bennett </em>(whose cotrustee <em>Moorman </em>was now dead) should release to the plaintiffs, who admitted themselves to be in possession of the land, all the right and title to the same, which was conveyed by <em>Morriss's </em>deed to the said <em>Moorman </em>and <em>Bennett. </em>\u201c And the court deeming it unreasonable that the defendant <em>John </em>Din<em>widdie </em>should have been so long delayed in his title to the 100 acres conveyed to him by <em>Robert Morriss </em>by deed of bargain and sale of the 1st day of May 1819 ; and that the plaintiffs were too late in tendering him a title; and he having elected to abandon said contract; doth adjudge, order and decree that the contract and deed last aforesaid be set aside as null and void.\u201d The court then proceeded to direct an account of the rents and profits of the land while it was held by <em>Dinwiddie, </em>either under the contract aforesaid or as tenant, and of all payments made by him to <em>Morriss </em>on account of his said purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-4\">After the last mentioned decree was rendered, the deposition of J. <em>N. Cardozo </em>was filed in the cause. This witness was examined on behalf of <em>Morriss. </em>Besides proving the terms of the contract between <em>Morriss </em>and <em>Dinwiddie, </em>and the understanding of those parties at the time, as detailed in a former part of this report, the deposition contained the following statement: \u201c This deponent thinks that <em>Dinwiddie </em>considered the use and occupancy of the land as more than equal to the interest of the 500 dollars,\u201d (the cash payment) \u201c this being tobacco land, and that article being in demand, and lands of this quality scarce.\u201d <em>Dinwiddieh </em>bonds, which (as already mentioned) were deposited in the custody of deponent, were kept by him 3 or 4, perhaps 5 years; and the deponent being then about to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>move from <em>Lynchburg, </em>the bonds were, with the consent ar)d in the presence of both <em>Morriss </em>and <em>Dinwiddie, </em>either destroyed, or placed in the hands of some other person ; deponent could not remember which.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuB\">On the 31st of January 1S35, the cause was further heard \u201c upon the decretal order of January 1834, the deposition of J. <em>N. Cardozo, </em>and the agreement of the counsel of the defendants <em>Morriss </em>and <em>Dinwiddie </em>of the rent at 160 dollars:\u201d On consideration whereof, the court, \u201c being of opinion that the deposition of <em>Cardozo </em>proves that the rent of the land was considered and estimated to be equal and more than equal to the interest of the money paid in hand, and from which it fairly results that the money was to be repaid by the defendant <em>Morriss </em>to <em>Dinwiddie </em>in the event of the former failing to make the latter a good and sufficient title to the 100 acres of land in the proceedings mentioned,\u201d\u2014 decreed that <em>Morriss </em>pay to <em>Dinwiddie </em>500 dollars with interest from the 14th of June 1832 until paid, subject to an offset of 150 dollars, the amount of the rent as agreed upon by the parties, to be credited as of that day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-5\"><em>Morriss </em>applied to a judge of this court for an appeal from the decrees of the 29th January 1834 and the 31st January 1835 ; which was allowed. In his petition, he assigned the following grounds of objection to the said decrees:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-6\">1. That <em>Dinwiddie, </em>having received a conveyance from <em>Morriss </em>and the possession of the land, and never having been evicted by any legal process or even threatened with eviction, could not surrender his title at his pleasure to <em>Coleman </em>and <em>Harrison, </em>and hold <em>Morriss </em>responsible for the purchase money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b514-7\">2.
