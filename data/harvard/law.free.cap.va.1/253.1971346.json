Lewis Willis.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b273-10\">The defendant as treasurer of <em>th&amp; Jockey Club, </em>agreed from the plaintiff a piece of ground, for the use of that <em>Club, </em>and by an agreement in writing, bound himself to pay the rent. He is individually liable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b273-11\">Declaration, as upon a parol agreement, made by the defendant, to rent of the plaintiff a piece of ground for the use of the <em>Jockey Club. </em>The plaintiff gave in evidence a written agreement, not under seal, corresponding- with that stated in the declaration, except that in the former, the defendant is styled <em>Treasurer of the Jockey Club. </em>The written agreement was properly admitted in evidence, and the variance is not material.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-12\">This was an action upon the case, brought by the appellee against the appellant, in the District Court of <em>jFrederickslmrg. </em>The declaration contains two count'. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>The first states; that a certain discourse was had between the plaintiff and the defendant, concerning the renting of a piece of ground belonging to the plaintiff, ^01\u2019 ^Ie use \u00b0f the <em>Jockey </em>Club, whereupon, the plaintiff, <em>{calledin the said agreement Colonel Willis) </em>agreed to rent the said ground to the defendant, for the use of the <em>Jockey </em>Club, for the term of seven years, and the defendant agreed to pay for the same, the sum of 30/., a year, the field to be enclosed by the plaintiff with a good fence, and the defendant in behalf of the <em>Jockey </em>Club, agreed to have the field restored to the plaintiff at the end of the term, with the fence in as good order as when it was received, and the defendant, in consideration of the plaintiffs promise to do every thing, See., on his part agreed to be done, promised to do every thing on his part to be performed : avers performance on the part of the plaintiff, and lays the breach, in the non-payment of two years rent, and in not restoring the field enclosed as the defendant received it. The second count, is an <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for the use and occupation of a race field, and an <em>assumpsit of the defendant </em>to pay, See,\u2014upon the general issue, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff. At the trial, the plaintiff' produced in evidence an agreement in writing, corresponding with that stated in the declaration, except that the defendant is stiled in the agreement, <em>Treasurer of the Jockey </em>Club, which description is omitted in the declaration. The Court, having over-ruled the motion of the defendant that this agreement should not go in evidence to the jury,\u2014an exception was taken to the opinion, and an appeal prayed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-5\">Warden, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">The plaintiff having declared upon a <em>parol </em>agreement, the Court ought not to have permitted him to give in evidence, an agreement in <em>writing. </em>The defendant might probably have made a different defence from what he did, if the case had been truly stated in the declaration. He might have shewn that he was no longer treasurer of the <em>Jockey Club ; </em>or that the plaintiff was himself a member of that society.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>But if this objection can be obviated, there is a ma-serial variance between the written agreement in evidence, and that declared upon. The declaration does not charge the defendant as <em>treasurer, </em>although, by the agreement, he had charged himself in that character. As treasurer, it is to be presumed he had funds in his hands to indemnify <em>himself; </em>and he would therefore have been authorised, (if the judgment had been rendered against him <em>in that </em>capacity,) to apply those funds to the discharge of it. But \u00e1s the case now stands, he can neither make such an appropriation of the funds, if he <em>have </em>them, nor can he have recourse against the members of the <em>Club, </em>if he have them not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-5\">Upon the substantial merits of the case, the defendant is not chargeable at all. He acted as agent for a society, to whom alone, the credit can be presumed to have been given. It is like the case of a factor who, when acting for a known principal, is never considered as being individually chargeable. 3 P. Wms. 299, 2 Str, 1168. The case of <em>Macbeath </em>v. <em>Haldimand, </em>1 <em>Term </em>Rep. 172, is much like the present. Suppose the appellant had ceased to be treasurer before the expiration of the seven years | it will not be contended that he could have been liable, under this contract, for rents accruing after that time, even if he were so, for rents antecedently due. But the declaration not charging him upon the <em>written </em>agreement, and in his true character, it was impossible for him to avail himself of such a circumstance, if the. facts would have warranted it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-8\">If these observations be correct, the plaintiff could not recover upon the first count; and if so, he could not go into proof to enable him to succeed upon the second. <em>Str. </em>648.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b275-9\">Washington, for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-10\">The first point made by the appellants counsel is9 that the declaration being upon a parol assumpsit, the written agreement was improperly admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b275-11\">No rule of law to warrant this objection is reeol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>lected. Where a <em>deed </em>is the foundation of the action, it ought to be declared upon, because the defendant may plead <em>non est </em>factum, and the Court, upon in\u00bb spection, may determine whether the instrument possess the necessary qualities or a deed JNo such reason, and, therefore, no such necessity, exists in the case of an agreement <em>not under seal. </em>It may be produced as evidence of the agreement stated in the declaration 5 but the plaintiff must prove the hand-writing of the defendant, and must produce such an agreement as substantially supports the charge as laid. Doing this, the defendant is exposed to no sort of inconvenience, because the declaration gives him complete notice of the allegation to which he must answer, and if it do not, the plaintiff must be non-suited. The defendant is at liberty to give in evidence, upon <em>non </em>assumpsit, any thing material for his defence. In an action upon the case for money lent, the plaintiff may give in evidence a promissory note. 2 <em>Str. </em>719. This is a very strong case, and not distinguishable, upon principle, from the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_f\">The second objection is founded upon a supposed variance between the declaration and the agreement. It is true, that in a special action upon the case, the allegations and the proofs must <em>agree; </em>and so they substantially do in the present instance. The naming of the appellant, <em>treasurer of the </em>club, in the agreement, is a mere <em>descriptio persons, </em>not affecting his responsibility. It is as unimportant as if he had been styled Esquire, or yeoman, in the agreement, and no notice had been taken of the title in the declaration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b276-7\">The third point is more connected with the merits of the case. It is contended that the appellant was not <em>personally </em>liable. This is by no means a novel case j it is no more than the agreement of one man to pay a sum of money for a third person. The agreement in question is not made with the <em>Jockey </em>Chib, nor with the <em>treasurer </em>of that <em>Club, </em>but with <em>William Ml Williams </em>for the benefit of the <em>Jockey </em>Club, and, there - fore, he makes himself personally responsible for theme</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The case of <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>The Duke of </em>Queensberry, 1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>101, isbynomeans sostronga case against the appellant as the present; and yet, it was there deiermined that the individuals who contracted for the benefit of a company were personally liable.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzJ\">But, at all events, we are entitled to recover upon the second count, notwithstanding the case of <em>Weaver </em>v. Burroughs, 1 <em>Str. </em>648, which is not law at this day.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b277-5\">Lyons, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG_\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">A parol agreement reduced to writing, does not in any manner change the nature of the contract; the writing is merely evidence of the parol agreement, and being the best evidence, ought to be produced, though not specially declared upon. We can discern no difference between this case and that cited from 2 Sir. 719, where, in an action for money lent, a promissory note was allowed to be given in evidence, to prove the charge laid in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The variance between the declaration and the agreement, in the former, omitting the addition of Treasurer, is not material; and if it were, the defendant might have taken advantage of it, as well in the present mode of declaring, as if the written agreement had been specially set forth. It was as unimportant to name the appellant, Treasurer, in the declaration, as it would have been to give the appellee the title of Colonel, because he was styled so in the agreement. We cannot presume that any circumstance existed to do away the responsibility of the appellant, because none is proved, or even pretended. The plaintiff cannot be presumed to give a credit to the members of a club, perhaps numerous, and dispersed through different parts of the country. The agreement is made with the appellant, and he binds <em>himself personally </em>to perform it. He is liable, therefore, whether he receives the money subscribed by the individual members of the Club, (as in the case of <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>The Duke of </em>Queensberry, cited at the bar,) or not. This is not like the case of merchants and partners, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>cause, in contracts made by them, they are all jointly severally bound for the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">In this, each subscriber is liable only for his proportion, and, therefore, an individual contracting with the treasurer, knows nothing of the state or value of the fund, which the treasurer does ; consequently, he cannot be supposed to go upon its credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Scott's ex. </em>2 Munf. 346. 348.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
