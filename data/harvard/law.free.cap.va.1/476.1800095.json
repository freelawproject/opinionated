Upon proper affidavit made before me, the sergeant will hold the within named <em>M. Homer to </em>bail, in the sum of 150 dollars.\u201d <em>Homer </em>was arrested, and <em>Hawkins </em>became bound as his appearance bail. The process was duly returned. But the <em>affidavit, </em>upon which the order of the alderman requiring bail, was founded, was <em>not returned or filed; </em>nor did it appear whether the <em>affidavit </em>was in writing or not. <em>Gibson </em>filed his declaration at the October rules 1822; and the defendant failing to appear, judgment by default was entered at the rules, against him and <em>Hawkins </em>as his appearance bail; which, at the November rules, was confirmed, and a writ of inquiry awarded. At the November term ensuing, <em>Homei, </em>without setting aside this office judgment, applied for and obtained a continuance; and the case was continued from term to term, till July term 1824; when <em>Hawkins </em>moved the court to discharge him from his obligation as appearance bail, on the ground, that no sufficient affidavit had been filed in the cause to justify the order requiring bail <em>(Homer </em>being now, not an inhabitant of <em>Virginia). </em>The court refused to discharge the bail. Then <em>Hawkins </em>being allowed to defend the suit for the principal, pleaded the general issue. The jury found a verdict for <em>Gibson, </em>for 112 dollars; whereupon the court gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>judgment against <em>Ilomer </em>and <em>Hawkins </em>liis appearance bail. And <em>Hawkins </em>appealed to the circuit court of <em>Henrico.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-4\">The circuit court adjourned the following questions to the general court: 1. Whether, under the statute authorising a judge of the general court, or a justice of the peace, to require bail in actions wherein appearance bail is not demandable of right, it is necessary that the judge or justice should return the affidavit required by the statute, to the court from which the process issues ? <em>2. </em>Whether, if it be necessary to return it, and it he not so returned, the appearance bail can in such caso he relieved, and if so, whether lie can be discharged on motion? 3. Ought the bail to he discharged, in this case, upon the whole matter appearing in the record?<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The general court certified its opinion to the circuit court (not deciding the two first questions adjourned) that \u201c the bail ought not in this case to be discharged.\u201d Whereupon the circuit court affirmed the judgment: and <em>Hawkins </em>appealed to-this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-4\"><em>Bacchus, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABC\">The statute giving a special authority to a judge or justice in vacation, upon proper affidavit, to require bail, it ought to appear that that authority was exactly pursued. 2 Salk. 475. pl. 14. 3 Stark. on Ev. part iv. pp. 1197, 8. The affidavit ought then to be in <em>writing </em>(indeed, the word <em>affidavit </em>imports a <em>written </em>oath) and it ought to be <em>filed ; </em>since, unless it be in writing and filed, it cannot be inspected by the court, to ascertain, whether it is a proper affidavit or not; whether it verifies the justice of the action, and shews probable cause to apprehend that the defendant will depart from the jurisdiction of the court, so as to avoid process of execution. Neither is there any alternative but either to require that the affidavit shah he in writing and filed, or to hold that the single justice, who makes the order, is the absolute judge of the propriety of the affidavit on which he founds it, subject to no controul or supervision, and that if a peijury be committed in such an affidavit, however palpable, the offender shall be exempt from prosecution. Our statute does not, indeed, in express terms, require, that the affidavit shall be in writing and filed; yet the very particularity with which the statute prescribes what the affidavit shall contain, in order to justify the justice in ordering bail, evinces, that it was the plain intent of the statute to require both.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-5\"><em>Lyons, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6P\">The english statutes expressly require, that the affidavit on which bail is ordered, shall be returned and filed, and prescribe when this shall be done, by whom, and to whom. 1 Tidd\u2019s Prac. ch. 8. Our statute is silent as to all these particulars; it requires only, that there shall be proper affidavit made to authorise a justice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>order bail, and that when bail has been required by ord<em>e</em>r of a justice, as well as when required by the plaintiff, the sheriff shall return on the writ, <em>the name of the bail by him taken, </em>and <em>the bail bond </em>or a copy of it, to the clerk\u2019s office,on the day of appearance. If the court shall hold it necessary to <em>return and file the affidavit, </em>it must go farther, and prescribe when, by whom, and to whom, it shall be returned; which were not to interpret but to make law. But suppose the affidavit ought to be filed: the bail could not be discharged, on motion made at the calling of the cause for trial, without even a notice of the motion : this motion was a surprise on the plaintiff: the proper course was, to have asked a rule on the plaintiff to shew cause why the bail should not be discharged, and thus to have given him an opportunity to produce the affidavit, or shew other cause. Again, the application to discharge the bail in this case, came too late; two years after bail required and entered, after judgment by default and writ of inquiry awarded, and after the defendant was gone, so that if the court discharged the appearance bail, it could not have made any effectual order requiring special bail. <em>Desborough </em>v. <em>Copinger, </em>8 T. R. 77. <em>2 </em>Com. Dig. Bail. K. 3. pp. <em>22-6.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-6\"><em>Bacchus, </em>in reply. Tn our practice, the plaintiff is always in court: wherefore, then, require notice of the motion, or a rule to shew cause ? If the motion was unexpected, the court might have obviated the surprise, by giving time to the plaintiff, if he had asked time, to produce the affidavit, or to shew that it was lost, and to prove its contents. This is an objection to form, not to substance. But, in truth, if it was necessary that a proper affidavit should not only be made, but <em>returned and filed, </em>then, no proper affidavit being returned and filed, the case was the same, as if there had been no affidavit; as if, in short, bail had been taken, when it had not been required, or had been unlawfully required. And, in such cases, the bail is taken at the plaintiff\u2019s peril; he is bound to proceed regularly, and not to require bail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>w^out lawful authority to do so, upon pain of having his suit dismissed with costs, at any time when the fact is shewn to the court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-5\"> See 1 Rev.

The motion was put, in that court, on the ground, that no sufficient affidavit had been filed in the case, to authorise the alderman\u2019s order requiring bail. It is not necessary to decide, whether the justice must have a <em>written affidavit </em>to justify his requiring bail? nor, whether that affidavit must be filed? The term <em>affidavit </em>in the statute, imports <em>an oath in writing; </em>but the statute is silent as to the filing. There are two other grounds, on which, I think, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">1. The objection could not be taken on <em>motion; </em>since it involved matters <em>aliunde </em>and not on the face of the record. It could only be made on a rule to shew cause why the bail should not be discharged, on the return of which the other party might be prepared to shew the affidavit, and that it was a <em>proper </em>one, in the terms of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">2. The objection came too late; being made two years after the writ of inquiry, and (it appears) after the defendant had left the state. In <em>Desborough </em>v. <em>Copinger, </em>the objection to the affidavit was held to be too late after the writ of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">On these grounds the judgment is to be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
