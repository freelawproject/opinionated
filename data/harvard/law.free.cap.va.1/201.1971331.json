But if he fail to do so, it does not authorise the entering of a judgment against him, for failing to take a bail bond, though, individually, he is liable to a penalty for the omission.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">This was a <em>supersedeas </em>to a judgment of the General Court. The case <em>was\u2014Johnson </em>brought an action on the case in the General Court, against one <em>Watson, </em>and the writ, which was directed to the Sheriff' of --County, was returned executed by <em>White, </em>thus, \u201c executed, <em>W. White, </em>d. s.\u201d without mentioning the name of his principal, or of the county in which he acted as Deputy Sheriff. No appearance being entered for <em>Watson, </em>a common order was entered against him, and against <em>William </em>White, Deputy Sheriff of ---\u2014 County, which was afterwards confirmed against the defendant and Sheriff\u2019, and a writ of enquiry was thereupon executed. The jury found damages for the plaintiff, and the judgment was entered up, against the defendant <em>Watson, </em>and <em>W. White, Deputy Sheriff of Louisa County. </em>To this judgment a writ of <em>supersedeas </em>was awarded by this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b221-12\"><em>Ronold, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b221-13\">The judgment is not warranted by any of the proceedings which appear in the record. The writ is not directed to the Sheriff of any county; it is not executed by the Deputy Sheriff\u2019 of any county; nor is the interlocutory judgment rendered against the Deputy-Sheriff of any county; and yet, final judgment is entered against <em>W. White </em>Deputy Sheriff of <em>Louisa </em>County. How did it judicially appear that <em>White, </em>who executed the writ, was Deputy Sheriff' of <em>Louisa </em>County? There might be two persons of that name, each of them Deputy Sheriffs of different Counties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>But if this objection could be removed, there is another, which must be fatal: the judgment is rendered against the <em>Deputy </em>instead of the <em>High </em>Sheriff,</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-8\">By the General Court law passed in <em>October, </em>1777, c. 14, \u00a7 14, if bail be not returned with a copy of the. bail bond, the remedy is against the Sheriff; and that the <em>principal </em>is intended, when the Legislature speak of the responsibility of the Sheriff generally, will appear evident, by referring to other laws upon this subject. Thus, by the act of the 27 th <em>George </em>II. c. 1, \u00a7 36, a remedy is given against <em>the Sheriff, </em>for not paying money received by him on an execution: and by the 3d <em>Geo. </em>Ill, c. 5, a specific remedy is provided in such a case, for the creditor, as well as for the <em>high Sheriff, </em>against the <em>deputy. </em>And this is exactly consonant with the principles of the common law, by which the High Sheriff alone is liable for any breach of duty in the office of Sheriff, and no action will lie against the deputy. <em>Cowp. Rep. </em>43.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-9\"><em>Duvall, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-10\">The Act of 3d <em>Geo. </em>III. c. 3, \u00a7 3, requires, that where the Deputy executes any writ, he shall indorse thereon, the day and month when the same was executed, and subscribe, as well the name of his principal, as his own. If the deputy, in 'the present case, had pursued this direction, it might have been known against whom to enter the judgment; and he ought not, by having omitted to perform this part of his duty, to be permitted to take advantage of his own misconduct. The declaration states the County in the caption;-\u2014and therefore it ought to be presumed, that <em>White </em>was the Deputy Sheriff of that County. As to the blank in the writ, that is cured by the act of <em>Jeofails </em>5, <em>Geo. </em>I. The Deputy Sheriffs in this country are very different from those officers in <em>England, </em>who act under a special authority from their principals. They qualify in open Court, with the same formalities which are observed in respect to High Sheriffs, and in many cases, they are recognised by our laws.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-11\"><em>Ronold, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-X\">Though the Deputy be punishable for a false return, in omitting to indorse on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>writ the name of his principal, yet this omission cannot warrant the entering up a judgment against him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b223-3\">The President</author>\n<p id=\"AJe\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The cases all prove that, in <em>England, </em>the remedy is against the High Sheriff only, (in whose name every thing is done,) for the official acts of his deputy; unless in instances where, by particular Statutes, a remedy is given against the deputy. The same principle of law prevailed in this country, and was general, until the year 1763; when a law was made, giving to the creditor, a remedy by motion against the Deputy Sheriff, for money received by him on an execution. By the same law, the Deputy was directed, under a penalty, to put the name of his principal, as well as his oivn, to all <em>mesne </em>process executed by him. But if he failed to do so, neither this, nor any other law, authorised the entering of a judgment against him, for not taking appearance bail upon such <em>mesne </em>process. The General Court law passed in 1777, warrants a judgment against the <em>Sheriff, </em>which certainly means the <em>principal, </em>and not the <em>deputy. </em>The practice in the General Court, both before and since the Revolution was to enter up judgment in such cases against the Deputy Sheriff. But we are of opinion that such practice was wrong, and unwarranted by any law.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The judgment therefore must be reversed, and the proceedings subsequent to the declaration set aside. The cause is to be remanded to the General Court, to be proceeded in <em>de novo, </em>from the return on the writ</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
