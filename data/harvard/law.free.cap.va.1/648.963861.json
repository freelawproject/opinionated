The deed was only executed by the grantor, and upon his acknowledgment was admitted to record. Two of the trustees expressly declined to act. On the 26th of November 1827, another deed was made by the same grantor to the two other trustees, conveying all the slaves mentioned in the deed of August 1827, as well as some others, and also the crop of tobacco, to secure to a party money advanced by him to pay off executions which had been levied upon the slave property mentioned in the first deed, one of which \u25a0 executions was for a debt due to a client, of greater amount than the value of the tobacco crop. The proceeds of the property conveyed by this deed are applied according to its provisions. It does not appear that the deed\u2019of August 1827 was made on previous consultation with, or received the subsequent ratification of, the creditors or trustees named therein, or that any claim was asserted under it until October 1832; when a bill is filed by a party not named in that deed, and, for aught that appears, not known until then as one embraced by the description of client creditor, asking a decree against the <em>cestui que trust </em>in the deed of November 1827 for the value of the tobacco crop. Held that the plaintiff has no title to the relief <em>sought.\u2014Per </em>Stanard, J. The deed of August 1827, being, when the deed of November 1827 was made, without the sanction of assent or ratification, could not in that predicament be any shield of the property against the levy of executions of creditors, nor any effectual impediment to the <em>bona fide </em>conveyance of the property by the grantor for valuable consideration.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b676-8\">A suit for alimony being brought by a wife against her husband, who has deserted her and left the commonwealth, and a sum of money being obtained for her by her attorney at law by a compromise of that suit, held that on a bill in equity, in the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>of the <em>feme </em>by her next friend, against the attorney for the money so obtained by him, a decree may be rendered for the same, although the husband be no party to the suit. 59 <em>r j</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ABH\">.

Wilson </em>of the first part, <em>George Booker, William M. Thornton, William F. Randolph </em>and <em>Samuel C. Anderson </em>of the second part, and <em>John V. Wilcox, William R. Johnson, John W. Nash, John Hughes </em>and <em>Allen Wilson </em>of the third part, whereby, after reciting that the said <em>Daniel A. Wilson </em>was indebted to <em>Wilcox </em>by bond and to <em>Johnson </em>by bond, that <em>Nash, Hughes </em>and <em>Allen Wilson </em>stood bound as sureties for him in another bond, and that <em>Allen Wilson </em>was his endorser on a note, it was witnessed that the said <em>Daniel A. Wilson </em>conveyed unto <em>Booker, Thornton, Randolph </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>the tract of land in <em>Cumberland </em>on which he then resided, and sundry slaves and other personal property. Then came the following clause: \u201calso my growing crop of tobacco and corn, subject to the deduction of the overseer\u2019s part, and subject to such disposition as the said <em>Booker, Thornton, Randolph </em>and <em>Anderson </em>may find it necessary to make of the said crop for the payment of any money due from me to the clients for whom I may have collected money, which money is to be first paid out of my part of said growing crop.\u201d The <em>habendum </em>was to <em>Booker, Thornton, Randolph </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>of the \u201c land and premises with its appurtenances, rents, profits, growing crops (with the reservations aforesaid) and future crops, together with the aforesaid slaves with the future increase of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>females of the same^ and all other personal property hereby conveyed.\u201d And the conveyance was declared to be upon trust that <em>Booker, Thornton, Randolph </em>and <em>Anderson </em>should permit the said <em>Daniel A. Wilson </em>to remain in possession of the property, applying the crops of each year, to the payment of the debts secured or intended to be secured by the deed, \u201c except so much as may be necessary for the support of the family and support of the plantation and payment of overseer, until the creditors and securities aforesaid, or some one of them, shall require;\u201d and then upon trust that they, or any one or more of them, should advertise the land and premises, crop on hand at the time, slaves with their increase, stock with its increase, and other personal property, and sell the same for cash, and out of the proceeds arising from the sale, first pay the expenses of executing the trust, next pay the debts mentioned in the recital of the deed, in a certain prescribed order, and then pay the balance to the said <em>Daniel A. Wilson. </em>This deed was executed only by <em>Daniel A. Wilson. </em>On the 27th of August 1S27, it was acknowledged by him in the court of <em>Cumberland </em>county, and admitted to record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-4\">In October 1827, sundry executions against <em>Daniel A. Wilson </em>were delivered to the sheriff of <em>Cumberland county; </em>to wit, a <em>fi. fa. </em>in favour of P. <em>T. Southall, </em>a <em>fi. fa. </em>in favour of <em>Thornton f Carrington, </em>a <em>venditioni exponas </em>in favour of <em>Miller f Andrew, </em>and a <em>fi. fa. </em>in favour of <em>Langhorne Sf Scruggs. </em>And there seem to have been others in favour of <em>George Booker </em>and of <em>Cather. </em>The greater part, if not the whole of the slave property mentioned in the deed of August 1827, was levied upon under these executions. <em>William B. Dob-son, </em>the deputy sheriff\u2019of <em>Cumberland, </em>deposed (in the suit herein after mentioned) that he levied the executions, and considered the property subject to them as amply sufficient to pay them <em>all; </em>but the property levied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>was not sold, in consequence of an arrangement en-<em>1 </em>. tered into between <em>dr. John Spencer </em>and <em>Daniel A. Wilson, </em>whereby <em>Spencer </em>assumed the payment of them all himself. Several of the executions were returned with endorsements by the creditors, shewing that they were satisfied; and some of the endorsements stated that they were satisfied by <em>Spencer's </em>executing his bonds to the execution creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b679-11\">On the 26th of November 1827, a deed was made between <em>Daniel A. Wilson </em>of the first part, <em>William M. Thornton </em>and <em>Samuel C. Anderson </em>of the second part, and dr. <em>John Spencer </em>of the third part, whereby, after reciting that <em>Wilson </em>was indebted to <em>Spencer </em>in the sum of 4203 dollars 9 cents, due on demand, by bond of that date, <em>Wilson </em>conveyed to <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson </em>sundry slaves (being all those mentioned in the deed of August 1827, as well as some others) \u201c and also the crop of tobacco which the said <em>Wilson </em>now has on hand, being the crop of the present year,\u201d upon trust that <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>when required by <em>Spencer, </em>should sell the slaves, or so many as would, with the net proceeds of the crop of tobacco, be sufficient to pay the costs of carrying the deed into effect and to discharge the debt and interest, upon such a credit as would make the proceeds payable on the 25th of December 1828. This deed was executed by <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Spencer, </em>and on the day of its date was acknowledged by <em>Wilson </em>in the court of <em>Cumberland </em>county and admitted to record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b679-13\">On the 25th of October 1832, <em>Nancy Ford, </em>by <em>James Muse </em>her next friend, commenced a suit in chancery in the circuit court of <em>Cumberland, </em>against the parties to this deed. The bill set forth, that in the year-she employed <em>Daniel A. Wilson, </em>as an attorney at law, to prosecute a suit in her behalf in the county court of <em>Cumberland, </em>against her husband <em>Hezeldah Ford </em>of the state of <em>Alabama, </em>for alimony. That such proceedings were adopted by <em>Wilson, </em>that he obtained for her (by com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>promise, as she is informed) the sum of 1000 dollars, the whole of which he, as her attorney, received. That, of the 1000 dollars, he accounted to her only for 250 dollars, leaving the balance of 750 dollars still due. That the matter thus remained until some time in the year 1827, when <em>Wilson, </em>finding himself ruinously involved, and desiring to secure to his clients all money he had collected for them as an attorney and had not paid over to them, made the deed of the 25th of August 1827, whereby he conveyed his then growing crop of tobacco and corn, deducting the overseer\u2019s part, in trust for the express and exclusive purpose of paying to clients any money which he had collected for them and had not paid over to them. That the complainant is informed and believes, and therefore charges, that her own debt of 750 dollars was the only one standing in that condition, and not otherwise secured; and consequently the crops aforesaid, with the reservation aforesaid, were in fact and in truth conveyed by the deed aforesaid for her exclusive advantage and benefit. That <em>Booker </em>and <em>Randolph </em>expressly declined to act as trustees in the execution of the deed; and before <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson </em>were required to execute it, <em>Wilson, </em>combining and confederating with <em>Spencer </em>to injure and defraud the complainant and to deprive her of the security aforesaid, made the deed <em>of the </em>26th of November 1827, whereby he conveyed to the said <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson </em>a large amount of other property, together with the crop of tobacco aforesaid, for the payment of a large debt due <em>Spencer </em>from <em>Wilson. </em>That the crops of corn and tobacco were matured, and the complainant does not know what became of the corn ; but she charges that by arrangement between <em>Wilson </em>and <em>Spencer, </em>without the knowledge of the complainant or of <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson, </em>the crop of tobacco was shipped to <em>Richmond, </em>and the proceeds, amounting to about 600 dollars, were received by <em>Spencer </em>under colour of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>his deed, and applied by him in satisfaction of his debt, in violation of the complainant\u2019s rights. The bill prayed that <em>Spencer </em>might be compelled to pay over to the complainant the sum of 600 dollars, with interest, in part satisfaction of her debt, and that <em>Wilson </em>might be required to pay her the balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b681-4\">The answer of <em>Spencer </em>stated, that in 1827 <em>Wilson </em>applied to him and others hereinafter named, to aid him in procuring from <em>Archer Taylor </em>of <em>Richmond </em>an advancement of money upon the faith of his (Wilson\u2019s) then crop of tobacco, in order to discharge executions, then in the hands of the sheriff of <em>Cumberland, </em>in favour of <em>George Boolcer </em>and <em>Miller Andrew </em>against <em>Wilson. </em>That the respondent and <em>William M. Thornton, Allen Wilson </em>and <em>John W. Wilson, </em>(the persons alluded to above,) consented to aid the said <em>Daniel A. Wilson, </em>and did procure from the said <em>Taylor </em>an advancement of 700 dollars upon the faith of the said crop of tobacco. That afterwards the respondent consented to become liable for the whole of the executions then in the hands of the sheriff of <em>Cumberland </em>against <em>Wilson, </em>upon condition that the money to be received from <em>Taylor </em>should be applied as aforesaid, and that <em>Wilson </em>should give respondent a deed of trust on the property on which the executions had been levied, and include in the deed a debt of 600 dollars due to the respondent from <em>Wilson, </em>and that the property so conveyed should be sold on a credit till the 25th of December 1828. That the respondent did not receive the sum of 700 dollars advanced by <em>Taylor, </em>but the same came to the hands of <em>Thornton, </em>and was by him paid to <em>Boolcer </em>and <em>Miller 8f Andrew, </em>in discharge of their executions.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> That the only reason why the crop of tobacco was included in the deed of trust was, that it was alleged to be worth more than the 700 dol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>lars, and it was intended the balance should be appropriated, as directed by the deed, in discharge of the debt therein specified. That <em>Taylor </em>received from the croP tobacco, after deducting expenses, only the sum of 558 dollars 20 cents, which was applied to the credit of the 700 dollars advanced by him. That the debt due to <em>Cather </em>and paid by respondent, amounting to <em>1339 </em>dollars 5 cents, was money which <em>Wilson </em>in his character of attorney had received for <em>Cather, </em>as respondent has heard and believes; and that the sum of about 60 dollars, part of the debt due to respondent, was also of that character. The respondent further states that the whole of the transactions between <em>Wilson </em>and him were without any notice of the complainant\u2019s claim. He requires from the complainant full proof of her debt, and that it belongs to the class described in the deed of the 25th of August 1827 under the general denomination of clients\u2019 debts. If it shall be found to belong to that class, he states that he has heard, and therefore charges, that <em>Wilson, </em>by agreement with the plaintiff, was to have a third or a fourth of whatever he received. He states that the whole of the property conveyed by the deed of November 1827 has been disposed of, and leaves due and unpaid a large balance of his debt, to wit, 900 dollars or thereabouts; and that the avails of the crop of tobacco were disposed of long before he had any notice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim. He objects to the claim of the complainant, that there is no evidence accompanying the deed of the 25th of August 1827, that she accepted it, and consented to abide by its stipulations. And he insists that the said deed created no lien whatever upon the tobacco in favour of that class of claims described in said deed as clients\u2019 debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b682-5\">As to all the defendants except <em>Spencer, </em>the bill was taken for confessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number><em>Wilson, </em>whose deposition was taken by leave of court, proved that he commenced suit for mrs. <em>Ford, </em>and made a compromise under which he received 1000 dollars, which was subject to an abatement of one fourth for his interest, according to the understanding when he was employed. He stated that he considered the amount thus due from him, to be due to her as a client, and intended to provide for its payment in that clause of the deed of August 1827, in which he mentioned his crop of tobacco as at the disposition of the trustees for the payment of any money due from him to clients. The debt to <em>Gather </em>as surviving partner was, he said, also a debt originally due to <em>Lynch &amp; Gather </em>as clients. He was unable to say what was the number of barrels of corn made from the crop growing on the plantation in August 1S27, nor how much was consumed upon the plantation, nor to whom it was sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-6\">An order was made directing the defendants <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson to </em>render before a commissioner an account of the funds that might have come to their hands under the deed of November 1827.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b683-7\">The record contained an account in these words: \u201cDr. <em>John Spencer </em>in account with <em>William M.

The trustees may have had a discretion to apply the growing crop to pay the plaintiff or other clients. But if they had such discretion, it was not exercised : and then the crop was subject to the debts specified, or to the power of <em>Wilson; </em>and in either predicament the plaintiff had no right. <em>Wilson </em>might at least be dealt with in respect to the crop for the purpose of satisfying the debt due from him to his client <em>Cather.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>V.

No decree could have been made in favour of the plaintiff, until the trustees under the deed of August 1827 had been called upon to account for the corn crop; nor until a report of all liens in favour of clients had been made.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b685-7\"><em>Taylor </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au5\">I. If there can be any case in which the husband need not be a party to a suit brought by the wife for her separate property, this must be deemed such a case; for here the subject of the suit had been previously recovered from the husband. There is no conceivable object to be attained by making him a party. The husband too is not within the commonwealth. Story\u2019s Eq.

The .appellant, having received the proceeds of the tobacco, ought to account to the appellee for the whole amount thereof. But for his intervention, the execution of <em>Cather </em>would have been satisfied without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the tobacco; and he has no equity, therefore, in respect to <em>Gather's </em>claim, which entitles him to a ratable share of the proceeds of the tobacco.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b686-4\">VI. Nothing seems to be known of the corn crop by any of the parties, and the case should be disposed of as though it had not existed.

In November 1827, when the deed was made conveying the crop of tobacco, among other property, to <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson </em>in trust for the benefit of the appellant, the deed of August was without the sanction of such previous assent or subsequent ratification ; and in that predicament it could be no shield of the property against the levy of executions of the creditors named therein, or other creditors, nor any effectual impediment to the <em>bona fide </em>conveyance by the grantor for valuable consideration.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In this view, the title under the deed of November 1827, which was such a conveyance, was paramount the claim asserted for the first time in 1832, under the hitherto dormant and inoperative conveyance of August 1827. But again, as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>sume that the deed of August 1827 was assented to by the trustees <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson: </em>they, having the legal title, have by the deed of November 1827 dedicated this crop of tobacco to the payment of <em>Spencer\u2019s </em>claim, without any notice to <em>Spencer </em>at least, and probably without any knowledge on their part, of the existence of the claim of the appellee; and the appellee, even if <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Anderson </em>could be made chargeable with this misapplication, could have no equity to pursue the fund into the hands of <em>Spencer, </em>who in law and equity is entitled to retain what he has fairly obtained. And furthermore, as he held the claim of a client creditor to a larger amount than the fund, if the deed of August had been fully accepted and acted under by the trustees, and the said trustees, under the discretion given by the reservation in that deed, had (though the deed of November had not been made) applied the fund to <em>Cather\u2019s </em>claim, in ignorance of the existence of that of the appellee, no effectual reclamation could have been made of the fund from the hands of <em>Cather.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In every view of this case, my opinion is that the appellee has no title to relief against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">She is entitled, however, to relief against the defendant <em>Wilson, </em>who is confessedly indebted to her in the sum of 500 dollars, with interest from the 25th of August 1827; and the court of equity was the proper forum for the recovery of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The other judges concurred with judge <em>Stanard, </em>in entering a decree in the following terms:</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">That the decree of the circuit court be reversed, and that the appellee and <em>James Muse </em>her next friend do pay unto the appellant his costs expended in the prosecution of his appeal. And this court proceeding to render such decree as the circuit court ought to have rendered, it is further decreed and ordered that the bill of the appellee be dismissed as to the appellant, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>the appellee and <em>James Muse </em>her next friend do pay unto the said appellant his costs by him about his defence in the said circuit court expended. And it is further decreed and ordered that the said <em>Daniel A. Wilson </em>do pay unto the appellee 500 dollars, with interest thereon from the 25th of August 1827 till paid, and also her costs by her expended in the prosecution of her suit in the said circuit court, including in those costs, the costs of the said circuit court above decreed to be paid by her to the appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-5\"> <em>Note by the reporter. </em>Though the decisions in <em>Walwyn </em>v. <em>Coutts, </em>3 Meriv. 707. 3 Sim. 14. 5 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 7. and <em>Garrard </em>v. <em>Lord Lauderdale, </em>3 Sim. 1. 5 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 1, were not cited in the argument of this case, and are not mentioned in this opinion, yet they were probably in the mind of the judge. There is no difficulty, however, in sustaining tire decision in this case, whether the doctrine of those cases be sanctioned or not. On this subject, see <em>Skipwith\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Cunningham &amp;c. 8 </em>Leigh 286-90. where those cases, and others involving the samo doctrine, are cited and commented on.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
