On the Chancery side of that Court, <em>Smock </em>filed a bill, stating, that <em>Beverley, </em>being possessed of <em>Stanard\u2019s </em>bond, given for a sum of money lost at unlawful gaming, assigned it to <em>Elliott, </em>who, afterwards understanding the nature of the consideration for which it had been given, delivered up that bond to <em>Stanard, </em>and obtained from him another in lieu thereof, upon which the judgment was obtained. The bill seeks a discovery of those circumstances, and prays for an injunction. <em>Elliott, </em>by his answer, insists that the assignment to him was made for a valuable consideration. That he is ignorant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the consideration for which <em>Stanard </em>gave his bond to <em>Beverley, </em>but that the whole transaction relative to , his obtaining the bond, was, on his part, fair and <em>bona fide, </em>and, as far as he knows and believes, in strict conformity to the laws of the land. He further states, that <em>Stanard </em>acknowledged that the debt was justly due, and promised that he would pay it. That he applied to <em>Stanard fot </em>payment, which not being made, he proposed to him to take in the bond, and an order drawn by <em>Beverley, </em>and to give a new obligation for the whole, to which <em>Stanard </em>readily consented. <em>Be</em>verley, who was also made a defendant, states in his answer, that a bond was given by <em>Stanard </em>to him for money won at gaming, amounting to 80/.; that he owed thirty-five barrels of corn to <em>Elliott, </em>which- not being able to pay when it was demanded, he assigned the above bond to him, and also drew an order for 10/. 10s. (making together the exact amount of the bond for which this judgment was recovered,) in discharge of the com debt, which <em>Elliott </em>accepted; that <em>Elliott </em>knew those sums were due on account of money won at gaming. Only one witness was examined, who proves the bond for 80/. to have been given for a gaming debt, and that, <em>after the </em>assignment, but before the execution of the new bond,, he informed <em>Elliott </em>of this fact</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b525-3\">The County Court perpetuated the injunction, from which <em>Elliott </em>appealed to the High Court of Chancery, and pending the appeal died. The suit being revived by his administrator, the decree was affirmed, from which an appeal was prayed to this Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b525-4\">Wickham, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-5\">I contend, first, that the decree in this cause was not warranted by the proofs exhibited ; and, 2dly, That a Court of Equity ought not to relieve in such a case as this, but leave the parties as the law had placed them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b525-6\">1st It is a rule, that the answer of one defendant is not evidence against another; and therefore <em>Beverley\u2019s </em>answer must be put out of the case; if so, there is no proof at all of notice to <em>Elliott, </em>prior to the assignment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>and therefore he is not liable to the original Equity attached to the bond. The case of <em>Buckner et al. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>&amp;c. <em>[ante, </em>p. 296) is a strong authority for the appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-9\">2dly. But if notice were proved, the appellee is not, I conceive, entitled to the relief prayed for. <em>Smock </em>can be in no better situation than <em>Stanard </em>would have been, had he been plaintiff in Equity. The matter relied upon in Equity, to defeat the legal advantage obtained by the appellant, might at Law have furnished a complete defence; but after a judgment obtained there, a Court of Equity will not relieve against an innocent assignee, without notice of the illegal consideration, so as to deprive him of the advantage which that judgment has given him. The Equity of an innocent assignee, who has fairly paid his money for this bond, is at least equal with that of the obligor, and therefore the Law must prevail.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b526-10\"><em>Lee, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-11\">I admit that in general, the answer of one defendant cannot be read for, or against another; but there are exceptions to the rule, and this case furnishes an example. For <em>Beverley </em>having assigned this debt to <em>Elliott, </em>there is a privity between them; and the latter, deriving his right under the former, is bound by his acts. <em>Beverley\u2019s </em>answer therefore, which acknowledges that the bond was given upon an illegal consideration, ought, as against <em>Elliott, </em>to be taken as evidence of that fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b526-12\">2dly. Whether <em>Elliott </em>had notice or not before the assignment of the bond, that it was given upon a gaming consideration, is immaterial, because the bond is by the Law absolutely void, and can never be made valid by assignment. The Statute considers it as being so tainted, that no shift or change w hatever can purge it of its original sin. It is the duty of all Courts to arrest the money before it is paid, though the parties may confederate to elude the Law, and therefore a Court of Equity is bound to interpose, though a judgment has been obtained. The case of <em>Buckner et al. </em>v. <em>Smith </em>&amp;c. is entirely unlike to the present s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>for the ground upon which that decision was made, was the fraud practised by <em>Beverley </em>upon Dixon, inducing him to purchase the bo id.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-6\">The bill having expressly charged notice, <em>anA Elliott </em>having declined answering it, the facts proved in the case and stated in his answer, furnish strong presmnplion that the charge is true. It is a rale, that where a naan defends himself on the ground of want of notice, he must in direct terms admit or deny it, if it be charged. A person claiming a gaming debt in a Court of justice, can never be considered as having equal Equity with the opposite party; because such a claim Is in itself iniquitous.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b527-7\">Lyons, I.</author>\n<p id=\"AFSx\">delivered the opinion of the Court. It has been rightly contended by the counsel for the appellee, that all bonds given for a gaming consideration are void, as between the parties; and it is equally true, that the assignee cannot stand in a better situation than the obligee, unless there be some particular circumstances in his favor independent of die mere assignment. But if an innocent man shall be Induced by the obligor to become a purchaser of such a bond, it is a deceit upon him, and he ought'not to be subject to the same Equity to' which the obligor was entitled against the obligee. In this case <em>Elliott </em>was induced by the debtor to take the bond, who renewed it, without disclosing his objection 5 after-wards suffered a judgment to pass at Law, and then resorts to a Court of Equity for relief. The province of that Court is to relieve against fraud, and not to sanction it, and in general it will leave the parties to the Law, even if their Equity were equal; much less will that Court interfere, where the Equity is altogether on the side of him who has obtained a legal advantage. As to the facts in the case, they are with the plaintiff at Law 5 his answer is contradicted by one witness only, without circumstances to strengthen the testimony, for the answer of the other defendant, as it could not benefit his eo-defendant, cannot injure him.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The Court entered a decree to the following effect, <em>vis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\"><em>William </em>Elliott, by his answer, having denied notice of the illegal consideration, upon which it is suggested by the bill, the bond from <em>Beverley Stanard </em>was given, and there appearing but one witness t\u00a9 contradict the answer in this respect, without sufficient circumstances to corroborate his testimony, <em>Elliott </em>ought to be considered as an innocent assignee of the said bond, and the subsequent bond taken by him of <em>Stanard </em>upon which the judgment was obtained, was not tainted, or effected by the illegal consideration of the first bond. That the decree which enjoins the plaintiff below from proceeding to execute his judgment is erroneous. The decree of the High Court of Chancery, and County Court, must be reversed with costs, the injunction obtained is to be dissolved, and the bill dismissed.<footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> <em>Corbin's adm. </em>v.
