One of the vendors dies after bequeathing what is due to her, and appoints her legatee executor. A lien being alleged to exist upon the land, the surviving vendor and the executor enter into bond with surety to indemnify the vendee, who thereupon pays most of the purchase money. Afterwards the vendee is compelled to pay a considerable sum to satisfy the lien, and one of the principal obligors being out of the commonwealth, and the other insolvent, he retains for his indemnity the assets of the surety (of whose estate be is administrator) against other creditors of the surety, some of equal and others of inferior degree. An action of covenant being then brought on the articles of sale, in the name of the vendor who survived, for the benefit of the <em>legatee of </em>the other, against the vendee, a trial is had, upon which both parties treat the amount of assets of the surety\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>estate retained by the administrator, as a satisfaction <em>pro tanto </em>of the indemnifying bond, and the difference between the amount so retained and the sum paid to satisfy the lien being credited, a verdict is found and judgment rendered for what is supposed to be the balance due of the purchase money. On a bill in equity by the vendee, in his own right and as administrator of the surety, against the surviving vendor and the legatee of the other, shewing the foregoing facts, and that, since the judgment, debts against the surety, alleged to be of superior dignity to that upon the indemnifying bond, have been demanded of the complainant and claimed by suit, Held, 1. That though none of the other debts against the surety\u2019s estate should appear to be of higher dignity than the claim on the indemnifying bond, still the complainant, as administrator of the surety, is rightly in equity, to obtain satisfaction for the payment made out of the surety\u2019s estate on account of the suretyship; and one of the principals having removed from the commonwealth, and the other being insolvent, he may stay in his hands the amount due from himself personally on the judgment, in part satisfaction of the claim of the surety\u2019s estate: 2. That if any of the debts against the surety\u2019s estate shall appear to be of higher dignity than the claim against the surety on the indemnifying bond, and it shall become necessary to apply to the payment of those debts any part of the assets of the surety\u2019s estate, the complainant will for so much have a -valid claim in his own right, and to that extent the injunction to the judgment should be perpetuated.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-4\">By articles of agreement entered into the 27th of September 1815, between <em>John Ware </em>and <em>Polhj Ware </em>of the one part and <em>Thomas Shores </em>of the other part, it was witnessed that <em>John Ware </em>and <em>Polly Ware </em>had sold to <em>Thomas Shores </em>certain lands, to wit, 410 acres of high land and 59 acres of islands, at the following prices, <em>to </em>wit, 8 dollars per acre for the high land, and 60 dollars per acre for the islands; and then, after setting forth that the late mrs. <em>Susanna Wilcox, </em>as administratrix of <em>Edmund Wilcox </em>deceased, had a mortgage on said lands (including certain land in the possession of <em>Washington Ware), </em>the amount of which could not then be ascertained, and that <em>John Forbes </em>as agent for <em>Thompson Snodgrass Sf Co. </em>had also a claim against the said lands, the amount of which could not then be ascertained, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>agreed that <em>John Ware </em>and <em>Polly Ware </em>should ascertain, as soon as they could, the amount of said claims, and have the same certified under the hands of the claimants, and <em>Shores </em>should retain in his hands and pay to the respective claimants two thirds thereof <em>(Washington Ware's </em>part of the land being bound for the other third). The articles then provided for the execution of a deed, the payment by <em>Shores </em>to <em>John </em>and <em>Polly Ware </em>of the residue of the purchase money over and beyond the said two thirds, and the delivery of possession of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\"><em>Shores </em>paid off the claim of mrs. <em>Wilcox, </em>and also paid to <em>John </em>and <em>Polly Ware </em>part of the purchase money. <em>Polly Ware, </em>by her will, bequeathed the balance due to her on account of the said purchase, and almost all the rest of her estate, to her brother <em>Washington Ware, </em>and appointed her brothers <em>Washington Ware </em>and <em>John Ware </em>her executors, of whom <em>Washington Ware </em>alone qualified as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-6\">On the 16th of April 1818, a bond was entered into by <em>John Ware, Washington Ware </em>and <em>William Pasteur </em>to <em>Thomas Shores, </em>in the penalty of 4000 dollars, whereby, after reciting that it was uncertain whether the said <em>John Forbes, </em>attorney as aforesaid, had any legal or equitable claim on the land sold to <em>Shores, </em>or against <em>Shores </em>as the holder thereof, and that <em>John Ware </em>and <em>Washington Ware, </em>as executor of <em>Polly Ware, </em>were desirous of drawing out of the hands of <em>Thomas Shores </em>the balance of the money remaining due for the purchase of the land, the condition was that if <em>John Ware, Washington Ware </em>and <em>William Pasteur </em>should save harmless and indemnify <em>Thomas Shores </em>for all costs or other damages he might sustain in consequence of his paying to the said <em>John </em>and <em>Washington </em>the balance of the said money, in case the said <em>John Forbes </em>agent as aforesaid, or any other person on account of his claim as agent, should recover any money, costs or damages of <em>Shores </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>in consequence of his purchase, or otherwise interrupt him i the possession of the said land, or in consequence 0f his paying over to the said <em>John </em>and <em>Washington </em>the balance of the said money, then the said obligation was <em>to </em>be void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-4\">A question arising at the time this bond was executed, whether <em>Shores </em>was bound for interest on the money while retained in his hands to satisfy the unascertained claims, this matter was not then adjusted, but <em>Shores </em>paid at the time 1200 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">An action of covenant was afterwards brought against Shores, in the name of <em>John Ware </em>as surviving covenantee of <em>John </em>and <em>Polly Ware, </em>for the benefit of the estate of <em>Polly Ware, </em>in which action a verdict was found and judgment rendered for the plaintiff against <em>Shores, </em>on the 27th of October 1830, for 2026 dollars 50 cents damages, wdth interest from the 22d of October 1822 till paid, and the costs. The next day the defendant moved the court to set aside the verdict and judgment, and grant him a new trial, upon the ground of a mistake of the jury in the estimation of damages, committed in the calculation of payments made by the defendant. Whereupon the plaintiff by his counsel agreed to release 1579 dollars 22J cents parcel of the damages assessed, as of the 22d of October 1822, and the defendant withdrew his application for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-6\">On the 10th of May 1831, <em>Thomas Shores, </em>in his own right and as administrator of the estate of <em>William Pasteur </em>deceased, exhibited a bill of injunction, setting forth that the payment of 1200 dollars made at the time the indemnifying bond was given, and other payments made from time to time, fully satisfied the whole purchase money exclusive of interest; that a decree had. been obtained in favour of <em>John Forbes </em>attorney in fact for <em>Thompson Snodgrass 8f Co. </em>subjecting the lands to sale to satisfy the' same, and complainant had purchased the land at the price of 1925 dollars 57 cents, being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>the two thirds to which his proportion of the land was subject; that being compelled to rely on the indemnifying bond for this sum, and the principal obligors therein being unable to refund the same, and <em>William 'Pasteur </em>the surety in that bond having died in embarrassed circumstances, he had, with a view of obtaining a preferable claim to the assets over other creditors, become the administrator of <em>Pasteur\u2019s </em>estate, the assets of which appeared, by the report of the commissioners who had settled his accounts, to amount to about 1600 dollars, and the amount in his hands as administrator of <em>Pasteur </em>he had retained, by virtue of his claim on <em>Pasteur </em>as surety in the indemnifying bond, against other creditors of <em>Pasteur, </em>some of equal and others of inferior degree; that nevertheless a claim has been set up, and a verdict and judgment rendered against him, for an alleged balance upon the original purchase. To shew how that balance is made up, he refers to a statement by which the jury were guided at the time of their verdict. He insists that injustice has been done in charging him with interest upon the purchase money before it was due, and also in charging him interest on the money kept in his hands for the claimants, which money he was at all times ready and willing to pay, if certificates had been produced to him, under the hands of the claimants, of the amount of their claims, and had only failed to pay because of the failure to produce such certificates. And inasmuch as the complainant, as the administrator of the estate of <em>Pasteur, </em>has a just claim against <em>Washington Ware, </em>on account of the assets of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate retained by virtue of the indemnifying bond in which <em>Pasteur </em>was the surety of <em>John </em>and <em>Washington Ware, </em>and <em>Washington Ware </em>is, by virtue of the will of <em>Polly Ware, </em>entitled to the benefit of the judgment obtained against the complainant, (there existing, as the complainant charges, no debts whatever against <em>Polhj Ware's </em>estate,) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>complainant insists that if the estate of <em>Polly Ware is </em>entitled to recover any thing of him, it is equitable and just that his demand as administrator of <em>Pasteur </em>should he set \u00b0ff against the same, and the said complainant allowed to retain the same in his hands, to be applied towards satisfying the creditors of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate, instead of resorting to an action at law to recover the amount so due to <em>Pasteur's </em>estate, which, if he were so to proceed, would in all probability be unavailing, as <em>Washington Ware </em>is without any visible property sufficient to satisfy the demand, and <em>John Ware </em>some years since left the commonwealth as an absconding debtor, and is not now an inhabitant of the same. The complainant farther states that a credit <em>for' 203 </em>dollars 12 cents was allowed by the jury, as the difference between what was supposed to be the amount of assets of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate, and the amount which the complainant had been compelled to pay under the decree in favour of <em>John Forbes </em>attorney in fact for <em>Thompson Snodgrass Sf Co. </em>This was upon the idea that the whole of the 1600 dollars would certainly be retained in the complainant\u2019s hands, towards satisfying bis demand. But the complainant sets forth, that since the verdict and judgment rendered against him, a debt due from <em>Pasteur </em>by judgment has been demanded from him <em>; </em>that a <em>scire facias </em>is also pending against him as administrator of <em>Pasteur, </em>upon a recognizance of special bail; and that these debts he may be compelled to pay as debts of superior dignity to his own. The bill also sets forth that <em>Pasteur </em>was in his lifetime the administrator of several estates, the accounts of which have not been settled, and it is yet uncertain whether the complainant will not be compelled to pay considerable sums on account thereof. <em>Washington Ware </em>and <em>John Ware </em>are prayed to be made defendants, and an injunction is asked to the judgment against the complainant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The statement of the jury, a copy whereof was exhibited with the bill, contains no credit of the 1200 dollars paid at the time the indemnifying bond was given. The amount, including interest to the 22d of October 1822, was, according to the calculation of the jury, 2230 dollars 30 cents. Then the following credit was given : \u201c 22d October 1822. <em>Cr. </em>by amount due <em>Thomas Shores </em>by <em>Pasteur\u2019s </em>estate, occasioned by not receiving from said estate sufficient to pay the debt to <em>Thompson Snodgrass if Co. </em>for which said <em>Pasteur </em>was security, <em>$ </em>203. 82.\u201d This sum being deducted, the statement concluded thus: <em>\u201c </em>JBy this amount due <em>W. Ware </em>22d October 1822, <em>\u00a7 </em>2026. 50.\u201d And subjoined was the verdict of the jury for 2026 dollars 50 cents damages, with interest from the 22d of October 1822.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-6\">The answer of <em>Washington Ware </em>alleges, in general terms, that in the action at law every just claim which the complainant brought forward was allowed. While, however, it controverts those allegations in the bill which were made to shew that injustice had been done in charging interest, the other specific allegations are left uncontradicted, the payment of 1200 dollars at the time of the execution of the indemnifying bond is admitted, and it is stated that the claim of <em>Forbes </em>amounted, when settled, to nearly 3000 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-7\">With his answer, <em>Washington Wa.re </em>filed a statement of his claim against <em>Shores, </em>according to which the amount in his favour, with interest calculated to the lGth of April 1818, was 2110 dollars 11 cents. This was without any deduction on account of the lien of <em>Forbes, </em>or of the 1200 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-8\">Against the defendant <em>John Ware, </em>the plaintiff proceeded in the mode prescribed by law in relation to absent defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-9\">The cause coming on to be heard before the circuit court of <em>Fluvanna </em>(to which the case had been removed) that court decreed that the injunction be dissolved, and the bill dismissed with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>Shores, </em>in his own right and as administrator <em>ofPasteur&gt; </em>petitioned this court for an appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Az\">By the petition it was admitted that it did not distinctly appear in the record on what account the sum of 1579 dollars <em>22 </em>cents was released as of the 22d of October 1822, but it was said to be fairly inferrible that it was the principal and interest of the 1200 dollars paid the 16th of April 1818, amounting to about 1524 dollars, and some other small item of omitted credit, or of error in the interest charged. It was, the petitioner contended, certainly not on account of the payment to <em>Forbes, </em>because the jury had already allowed on that account the supposed difference between this payment and <em>Pasteur's </em>funds in the petitioner\u2019s hands. And he insisted that in equity his right to use the payment to <em>Forbes </em>as a setoff against the judgment was perfectly clear, because in equity <em>Washington Ware </em>is principal debtor and principal creditor, and equity would not allow that the petitioner should retain the assets of the surety his intestate, and pay the claim of the principal debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">The appeal was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-6\"><em>C. Johnson </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\"><em>Lyons </em>and <em>Patton </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-8\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AH\">The record shews with satisfactory certainty, that in ascertaining the balance for which the jury\u2019s verdict was rendered, <em>Shores </em>was not credited for the payment of 1200 dollars confessedly received by the party for whose benefit the suit at law was prosecuted, nor was he credited for more than 203 dollars of the amount of the lien of <em>Forbes </em>attorney in fact of <em>Snodgrass ; </em>that on the trial of the case before the jury, both parties treated the amount of assets of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate, retained by <em>Shores </em>the administrator of <em>Pasteur </em>on account of his claim on the bond to indemnify him against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the said claim of <em>Forbes, </em>as a satisfaction <em>pro tanto </em>of that bond; and that the amount of the said lien of <em>Forbes </em>on the land purchased by <em>Shores </em>(being two thirds of the entire claim of <em>Forbes) </em>though not precisely shewn, was from 1800 to 2000 dollars. These facts are proved, 1st, by the statement of the appellee\u2019s claim on the covenant, which, excluding the credit for the payment of 1200 dollars, and the lien of <em>Forbes, </em>exhibits a balance of a little upwards of 2100 dollars. 2dly, By the statement shewing the manner in which the balance for which the verdict was rendered wms ascertained. 3dly, By the uncontradicted allegations of the bill. 4thly, By the admission of the answer, that the entire claim of <em>Forbes </em>was about 300 dollars. I am also satisfied, that in the adjustment of the credit which was allowed against the amount found by the verdict, the said sum of 203 dollars only was taken into account, as resulting from the lien of <em>Forbes, </em>and the residue of the lien was considered as covered by the assets retained of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate, so that the <em>Wares </em>have been charged with but the said 203 dollars on account of that lien. The judgment at lawq then, placed the parties in this predicament : <em>Shores </em>was indebted on his own account to the <em>Wares </em>in the amount of the judgment at law, and the <em>Wares </em>were indebted to <em>Shores </em>as administrator of <em>Pasteur, </em>in the amount of the assets of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate, that he had by retainer applied in part satisfaction of the claim on <em>Pasteur </em>as the surety of the <em>Wares </em>in the indemnifying bond : and such is still their predicament, if the retainer by <em>Shores </em>of the assets of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate has not been disturbed by other creditors of <em>Pasteur, </em>having claims of higher dignity than the claim on the indemnifying bond. Were this still the predicament of the parties, <em>Shores </em>as the administrator of <em>Pasteur </em>was rightly in a court of equity, to obtain satisfaction of a claim of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate for a payment made on a suretyship for the defendants, and at all events the bill ought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>not to be dismissed. As the bill suggests that one of principals <em>(John </em>Ware) had removed from the cotnmonwealth and the other was insolvent, the plaintiff had further title to stay in his hands the amount due from him personally on the judgment in favour of the <em>Wares, </em>in part satisfaction of the claim of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate, and which might become the claim of <em>Shores </em>in his own right, if the assets of <em>Pasteur </em>are charged by debts of higher dignity than that of <em>Shores </em>on the indemnifying bond. The bill further suggests that suits of the creditors of <em>Pasteur </em>are depending, in which the assets retained by <em>Shores </em>are claimed. The success of those suits, so far as they might withdraw the retained assets, would reinstate the claim of <em>Shores </em>in his own right to retain the purchase money for which the judgment was rendered, and to offset it against the judgment; and this arising since the rendition of the judgment, was an ample foundation for the title to relief in a court of equity. Had there been no other foundation for relief, the court below ought not to have dismissed the bill, but should at least have retained the injunction until the fate of the pending suits was ascertained, and to the extent that the assets retained might be charged by other creditors of <em>Pasteur, </em>have p\u00e9rpetuated the injunction. On the whole, my opinion is that the decree is erroneous, and ought to be reversed with costs, and the following entered as the decree of this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">\u201c The court is of opinion that it appears with sufficient certainty, that on the trial of the action in which the judgment injoined in this case was rendered, no credit was given to the appellant in respect of the lien of <em>Forbes </em>attorney in fact of <em>Snodgrass, </em>except the sum of 203 dollars 82 cents, credited, in the statement by which the jury ascertained the balance for which the verdict was rendered, as the excess of that lien above the assets of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate retained by the appellant as the administrator of <em>Pasteur, </em>in virtue of his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>on <em>Pasteur </em>as the surety in the indemnifying bond ; and that the sum agreed as a credit against the amount of the verdict, was for the omission of the jury to credit the appellant 1200 dollars paid by him when the indemnifying bond was given, and for miscalculations of payments made by the appellant to the <em>Wares, </em>and did not include any allowance for the lien of <em>Forbes. </em>The court is further of opinion that instead of dissolving the injunction and dismissing the bill, the court below should have directed a commissioner to ascertain the amount of <em>Forbes's </em>lien, whether discharged by <em>Shores </em>or still outstanding, and the amount of the assets of <em>Pasteur's </em>estate that was retained by the appellant to indemnify or reimburse him for the lien of <em>Forbes, </em>and the amount (if any) that other creditors of <em>Pasteur </em>may have charged on the assets so retained ; that for the amount of the assets so retained, so far as they have not been charged by creditors of <em>Pasteur, </em>the principals in the indemnifying bond <em>(John Ware </em>and <em>Washington </em>Ware) are responsible to the appellant as the administrator of <em>Pasteur, </em>and so far as they may have been charged by other creditors, are responsible to the appellant in his own right, and the appellant is entitled to set off these responsibilities (first, that which may accrue in his own right, and then that accruing to him as administrator of <em>Pasteur) </em>against the judgment, and have a perpetual injunction to the judgment to the extent of such setoff) and, for the excess (if any) of the said responsibilities above the judgment, to a decree against the said principals in the indemnifying bond, in the right in which such excess may be due to him; and that the said decree is erroneous. Decree therefore reversed with costs, injunction ordered to be reinstated, and cause remanded to circuit court for further proceedings to be had therein in conformity with the foregoing principles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The other judges concurring, decree entered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
