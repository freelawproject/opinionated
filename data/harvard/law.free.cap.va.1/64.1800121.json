This demurrer was overruled by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-10\">And he pleaded, 1. <em>nul tied record; </em>to which the plaintiffs replied generally; and the court, on inspection, found that there was such a record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-11\">2. He pleaded a <em>special plea, </em>in these words, viz : \u201cAnd the said defendant, by leave of the court <em>be. </em>for further plea <em>be. </em>says, that the said plaintiffs ought not to have or maintain their action aforesaid thereof against him; because he says, that at the date of the emanation of the said <em>scire facias, </em>the said <em>William Fouchee </em>was not married to the said Mildred, as is alleged in their <em>declaration; </em>and of this he puts himself upon the country.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-12\">To this second plea, the plaintiffs replied, by way of <em>estoppel, </em>that the plaintiff <em>Mildred </em>recovered the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>against <em>Thomas Buck </em>and <em>Anne </em>his wife, at October term 1821; that, on the 11th May 1822, the plaintiff <em>Mildred </em>sued out a <em>capias ad satisfaciendum </em>against <em>Buck and wife, </em>upon which <em>Buck </em>being taken in execution, he surrendered property in discharge of his body, and gave a forthcoming bond for the property, with one <em>Blakemore </em>his surety; and, that a motion being made, at October term 1822, for an award of execution on this forthcoming bond, <em>Buck </em>and <em>Blakemore, </em>his surety, resisted the motion, and moved the court to quash the bond; and the court did accordingly quash the bond, and the execution in consequence of which it had been taken, \u201c it appearing to the satisfaction of the court, as had been insisted by the counsel for <em>Buck, </em>that the plaintiff <em>Mildred, </em>soon after the rendition of the judgment upon which the execution was issued, intermarried with <em>William Fouchee, </em>and was at the time the execution issued, and at the time the forthcoming bond was taken, a <em>feme covert, </em>and that a <em>scire facias </em>ought to have been awarded against the said <em>Thomas Buck </em>and <em>Anne </em>his wife, before execution on the said judgment could regularly be issued.\u201d The replication sets forth all these proceedings, at large <em>in hcec verba, </em>and prays judgment, if <em>Buck </em>be not thereby estopped from pleading the matter of his second plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-4\">To this replication, <em>Buck </em>demurred generally: the plaintiffs joined in the demurrer: and the court held that the law was for the plaintiffs, and gave judgment for the debt in the <em>sci.fa. </em>mentioned.

It was argued again, by the same counsel at the present term. Both arguments preceded- the appointment of the reporter, and no note of them was preserved.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b79-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Green, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AAz\">The real questions in this cause arise out of the <em>second </em>plea, alleging that the plaintiff was not married at the time of the emanation of the <em>scire facias, </em>the replication thereto, and the general demurrer to the replication, which leads us up to the first fault in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\">There was, indeed, a <em>special </em>demurrer to the <em>scire facias, </em>for the want of an allegation of the time and place of the suggested marriage of the plaintiffs, which will be noticed, incidentally, in considering the first objection to the plea; which is, that it pleads in <em>bar </em>matter which goes only in <em>abatement. </em>This, if true, is an error of substance, and fatal upon a general demurrer. To notice a few of the many adjudged cases to that effect: <em>Isam &amp; Paget </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>Cro. Eliz. 202. <em>Justice </em>v. <em>White, </em>1 Mod. 239. <em>Wallis </em>v. <em>Savil, </em>Lut. 41. <em>Crosse </em>v. <em>Bilson, </em>2 Ld. Raym. 1016. In these cases, matters going only in <em>abatement, </em>being pleaded in <em>bar, </em>and the pleadings terminating in <em>general demurrers, </em>judgments were given against the defendants for that cause only, and for the reason assigned by chief justice <em>Holt, </em>in the last mentioned case, that a plea in <em>bar, </em>admitting that the suit is well brought, and opposing nothing but matter in <em>abatement </em>to the plaintiff\u2019s demand, judgment final should be given for the plaintiff, as in case of <em>nil dicit, </em>or any other plea containing no matter of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">All the elementary writers and reported cases which I have seen, treat the matter of this plea, when pleaded to an action by husband and wife, as going in <em>abatement </em>only; and I have met with no suggestion, any where, to the contrary, which is entitled to the least respect. 1 Chitt. plead. 441.

Comb. 131. in which the matter was pleaded in <em>abatement, </em>as appears by Comber-back\u2019s report of the case; as it was in <em>Bickerstaffe and wife </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>v. <em>Percy, </em>2 Lev. 207. 3 Keb. 810. as appears by Keble\u2019s report. In Theloall\u2019s Dig. lib. II. c. 2. \u00a7 12. (citing 7 H. 6. 13. and 50 Ed. 3. 15.) it is said, \u201cso in assize by baron and feme, or debt, or trespass, <em>not his feme </em>is a good plea <em>to the writ: </em>but in dower, or appeal of the death of her husband, it ought to be <em>ne unques accouple </em>in lawful matrimony with the deceased:\u201d and Ibid. \u00a7 13. (citing truly 11 H. 4. 13.) \u201cIn appeal by baron of the ravishment of his feme, it was pleaded <em>ne unques accouple </em>&amp;c. and the plea was accepted.\u201d 4 Vin. Abr. Baron &amp; Feme, C. b. pl. 23. 24. p. 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">These are all the reported cases that I have met with, in which this matter has been pleaded to an action by husband and wife, except those of <em>Machell and wife </em>v. Garrett, 3 Salk. 64. 12 Mod. 276. and <em>Jones\u2019s </em>case, Comb. 473. the reports of which do not inform us, whether the pleas were in <em>abatement </em>or in <em>bar. </em>The case, however, of <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Dodemead and wife, </em>2 Ld. Raym. 1504. in the decision of which the courts of common pleas and king\u2019s bench concurred, is decisive of this question. There, to a <em>scire facias </em>by,husband and wife, upon a judgment obtained <em>by the wife dum sola, </em>and which suggested the intermarriage of the plaintiffs after the judgment, without stating the time or place of marriage, the defendants demurred specially for that <em>cause; </em>and judgment was given for the <em>plaintiffs; the </em>court holding, that although all material facts, which go to the <em>point of the action, </em>must be pleaded with a venue, yet that such as go only to the <em>person of the plaintiff, </em>or to the <em>point of the writ, </em>need not be so stated, they being only in <em>abatement; </em>and that the question, whether married or not, was matter of the latter character.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Upon this mass of uncontroverted evidence of the uniform opinions of the profession upon this subject, from the time of Ed. 3. downwards, we may safely conclude, that the plea of never married, to an action by husband and wife, in personal actions at least, is only proper in <em>abatement, </em>without going into the large field of inquiry as to the grounds of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>tinction, upon principle, between matter in <em>abatement </em>and matter in <em>bar. </em>I shall only add, that it is a settled rule, that the question, whether one suing in <em>autre droit </em>(as an executor or administrator) be entitled to the character he assumes, is a matter in <em>abatement </em>only. And a husband; suing with his wife for her <em>clloses in action, </em>sues in her right only; for if he die before recovery, the right and action survive to her; or if she die, he can neither claim the subject, nor prosecute the action, <em>as husband. </em>And this distinguishes the case of a husband and wife suing for <em>her </em>property, from those of a widow suing for her dower, or a wife appealing another of the death of her husband, or a husband appealing another of the ravishment of his wife, in which they sue in their own right, and the marriage, and that a <em>lawful </em>marriage, is an indispensable ingredient in their title, the want of which goes in <em>bar </em>of their suit; while, in the other case, a marriage in fact, whether lawful or not, is sufficient; as was decided in several of the cases before cited, <em>Alleyne and wife </em>v. Grey, <em>Jones\u2019s case, </em>and <em>Machell and wife </em>v. <em>Garrett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">But suppose tills matter might be properly pleaded in <em>bar, </em>die plea is liable to several other objections, which arc fatal upon general demurrer. The <em>scire facias </em>suggests a marriage <em>after the judgment </em>and <em>before the emanation of the writ. </em>The plea is, that the plaintiffs were not married <em>at the time of the emanation </em>of the writ. These allegations are not inconsistent with each other, and the last docs not negative the first; for there might have been a marriage <em>after </em>the judgment, as suggested in the <em>scire facias, </em>which might have been dissolved by a divorce <em>before </em>the emanation of the <em>scire facias, </em>and so the plaintiffs not manned <em>at the date </em>of die <em>scire facias, </em>as alleged in the plea. And this must be considered as the effect of the plea; for if it was intended to deny the fact of the marriage, the plea should have averred that the plaintiffs were never married and might then have properly concluded to the country, sine/ then diere would have been a direct affirmative and negative, in respect to the. same fact. When a plea is equivocal, st is to bo taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>most strongly against the pleader, 1 Chitt. plead. 521. The <em>scire facias </em>did not suggest a continuance ot the marriage at the time of suing it out, nor was it necessary that it should: that was an intendment of law, which presumes an existing state of things to continue until the contrary is shewn. And no issue can be taken on a legal inference, nor can it be denied in pleading, but the facts which avoid it must be stated, so as to enable the court to judge of their legal effect. Every material fact averred by one party, and not denied by the other, in pleading, is admitted: And the averment that the plaintiffs were not married <em>at the date, </em>of the <em>scire facias, </em>admitted that they were married <em>before, </em>as alleged on the other side; as, in <em>Alleyne and wife </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>the plea that the plaintiffs were not <em>lawfully </em>married, was held to be an admission that they had (as they alleged) been married in <em>fact, </em>and only to put the <em>lawfulness </em>of the marriage in issue. The legal inference, that the marriage, once existing, continued, could only be repelled, by shewing the fact by which it was dissolved, or ceased to continue. That could only be by a divorce from the bonds of matrimony. A divorce from bed and board does not dissolve the marriage, nor affect the marital rights of the husband in respect to his wife\u2019s <em>choses in action. Stephens </em>v. <em>Tott, </em>Mo. 665. <em>Motam </em>v. <em>Motam, </em>Roll\u2019s Rep. 426. cited 18 Vin. Abr. prohibition Q. pl. 10. 11. p. 3. And a divorce could only be the consequence of a legislative act, or a judicial sentence. The plea in question, therefore, proposed to refer to the jury, all these questions of law, and the effect of the act dissolving the marriage; all of which should have been referred to the court, by a plea distinctly stating the matter by which it was insisted the marriage had been dissolved; as was done in the case before cited 39 Ed. 3. 33. when the plea stated a divorce by an ecclesiastical court specified, and that from the bonds of matrimony, on account of the marriage being before the age of assent, and a subsequent dissent. Upon the ground, then, that tire plea neither denied directly any facts suggested in the <em>scire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>facias, </em>nor alleged any fact directly to avoid their effect, it was fatally defective, even if it had concluded, as it ought to have done, with a verification.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">If, however, it were admitted, that the matter of the plea was pleadable in bar, and well pleaded in other respects, the conclusion to the country was an error of substance and fatal on a general demurrer. This was the only ground of the former judgment of the court given in this case; which, after the fullest consideration, I still think was right. After a conclusion to the country, all pleading is closed except to <em>demur, </em>or join issue by a <em>similiter ; </em>and as no issue can be made up, without an express averment on the one side, and a direct negative on the other, of the same fact, it is error to conclude a plea to the country, which does not directly deny some matter directly averred on the other side. The plea in this case denied nothing which had been alleged on the other side, but sought to avoid the matter alleged on the part of the plaintiffs, by the allegation of a distinct fact, that the parties were not married <em>at the date </em>of the <em>scire facias, to </em>which they ought to have had an opportunity of replying. That such an improper conclusion is fatal on general demurrer, is uniformly affirmed, by the adjudged <em>cases; </em>of which those of <em>Cowper </em>v. <em>Towers, </em>1 Lutw. 98. and <em>Charleston </em>v. <em>Finney, </em>1 Sid. 215. are strongly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Without considering the effect of the estoppel relied on, I think the judgment should be affirmed upon the manifold defects of the plea in matters of substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">The other judges concurred, and the judgment was affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
