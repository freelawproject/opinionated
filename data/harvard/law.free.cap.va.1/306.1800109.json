The condition was, that whereas <em>Patton </em>had sued out a <em>fieri facias </em>against <em>Andrew </em>and <em>Thomas Harper, </em>and <em>Hugh Harper </em>their appearance bail, upon a judgment of the county court <em>of Rockbridge, </em>amounting with interest &amp;c. to <em>\u00a3 </em>72.14.0. and directed to the sheriff of that county, and the sheriff, by virtue of the said writ, \u201c had taken the following property, belonging to the said <em>Andrew Harper </em>&amp;c. to satisfy the same, to wit\u201d [here the property was specified] \u201c and the said <em>Andrew </em>and <em>Thomas Harper </em>&amp;c. being desirous of keeping the same in their possession until the day of sale thereof, had tendered <em>James Anderson, </em>a\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>security for the forthcoming and delivery of the property at the day and place of sale ; now, if the above bound <em>Andrew Harper, Thomas Harper, Hugh Harper </em>and <em>James Anderson, </em>or either of them, should deliver the said property to the sheriff or either of his deputies at the court house of the county, on the 15th January next, then and there to be sold to satisfy the said <em>Patton\u2019s </em>execution, then the obligation to he void &amp;c.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-3\">As to the question, whether the debt had been paid, the case was thus: The forthcoming bond was forfeited, and a notice was given to the three <em>Harpers </em>and <em>Anderson </em>their surety, that a motion would be made for an award of execution upon it, at March term 1820. On receiving that notice, <em>Andrew Harper </em>went to <em>Patton, </em>and requested him not to proceed upon the <em>notice, </em>and <em>to take a </em>parcel <em>of </em>flour, which <em>Harper </em>then had at <em>Lindsey\u2019s </em>mill in <em>Rockbridge, </em>in part satisfaction of the debt: but <em>Patton </em>refused to purchase the flour, or to decline proceeding with his motion. The request was urged again, and again rejected. But, at length, <em>Patton </em>was induced by <em>Harper\u2019s </em>urgent solicitations, to forbear his motion on the <em>notice; </em>and agreed at <em>Harper\u2019s </em>request, to send the flour to <em>Richmond, </em>with the understanding, that the net proceeds should be applied to his credit on the forthcoming bond, and that some indulgence should be given for the residue of the debt. <em>Harper </em>was told by <em>Patton </em>that he should send the flour to <em>his </em>commission merchant in <em>Richmond, </em>to which <em>Harper </em>made no objection. In pursuance of this arrangement, <em>Patton </em>stayed his then intended proceeding on the forthcoming bond, (by which the debt was perfectly secured, the <em>Harpers </em>and their surety being all in good circumstances) : and, shortly after-wards, he caused the flour to be boated to <em>Richmond, </em>an,d consigned it to his own commission merchant there, with directions to remit the proceeds to him at <em>Baltimore </em>(where ho expected to be) about the 1st May 1820, by which time it was supposed the proceeds of the flour would be in die commission merchant\u2019s hands. The commission merchant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>wrote to <em>Patton </em>informing him that the flour had been received and sold, and that the proceeds should be remitted to him according to his directions. Soon after receiving this letter, <em>Patton </em>left <em>Rockbridge </em>for <em>Baltimore, </em>and on j^s way Either, learned that the commission merchant had failed. He immediately took measures to secure the money, but without success: it was intirely lost. Indeed, <em>Patton </em>lost by the failure of the commission merchant, a large sum, the proceeds of other flour he had consigned to him; and several other merchants of <em>Lexington </em>in <em>Rockbridge </em>(where <em>Patton </em>resides) sustained losses by this failure. At the time <em>Patton </em>consigned <em>Harper\u2019s </em>flour to the commission merchant, he was in good credit. An attempt had been made to settle this controversy, by arbitration; and <em>Harper </em>had distinctly admitted before the arbitrators, that <em>Patton </em>had exerted all the diligence in his power, to carry the arrangement with <em>Harper </em>into effect, in causing the flour to be sold, and endeavouring to obtain the proceeds, and that if the flour had been sunk in the river on its way from <em>Rockbridge </em>to <em>Richmond, </em>it would have sunk his (Harper\u2019s) flour; but he contended, that he knew nothing of the commission merchant, that he was not his agent, and that he ceased to be responsible, after the flour had reached its destination, and its value was ascertained. The net proceeds of the flour wore not equal to the debt, but <em>Harper </em>had paid <em>Patton </em>the balance, before the motion on the forthcoming bond: so that the only question now was, whether or no, <em>Harper </em>was entitled to credit for the net proceeds of the flour? in other words, which of the parties ought to bear .the loss resulting from the failure of the commission merchant who sold it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-4\">Upon this state of facts the county court held, that <em>Harper </em>was entitled to the credit claimed for the flour, and so the debt due on the forthcoming bond had been paid in full; and therefore overruled <em>Patton\u2019s </em>motion for an award of execution upon it. <em>Patton </em>appealed to the circuit court, which reversed the judgment of the county court, and en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>jered judgment for <em>Patton </em>against all the obligors in the bond: but this judgment was, in its form, not a mere award of execution on the forthcoming bond, but a judgment, that <em>Patton </em>should recover of the obligors, the penalty of the bond, to be discharged by the debt mentioned in the condition, with interest and costs, subject to credit for the sums which had been paid <em>in cash. </em>And then <em>they </em>appealed to ibis court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-4\"><em>Johnson, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqT\">The bond on which the motion was made, being a statutory bond, if its terms do not conform with the provisions of the statute, the summary remedy by motion, given by the statute, cannot be sustained. This bond does not pursue the provisions of the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. <em>134. \u00a7 16. The </em>recital in the condition, <em>leaves it </em>uncertain, <em>whose </em>property was taken in execution; it states, that, the execution was levied on property belonging to <em>A. Harper &amp;c. </em>and then, that <em>A. </em>and T. <em>Harper &amp;c. </em>were desirous of keeping possession till the day of sale. The <em>&amp;c. </em>is no where explained. Nor does the condition state, that upon the execution of the bond, the property which had been taken in execution, was returned to the owner or owners : if it was not so returned, the bond never had any obligation, and it could not be forfeited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-7\">The judgment of the circuit court, also, is irregular. It is an original judgment for the penalty of the bond, to be discharged by payment of the debt mentioned in the condition. But the bond itself had the force of a judgment, and the court should only have awarded execution upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-8\">These objections are technical; and if they should prevail, they will not decide the point in controversy. I have little care for the fate of them. For,</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b321-9\">I insist, that upon the plain justice of the case, the judgment of the circuit court was wrong, and that of the county court right. The net proceeds of the flour sent to <em>Richmond, </em>must he considered as so much paid by H. to P. in satisfaction of the debt <em>pro tanto. </em>While it was <em>in transitu </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>from <em>Rockbridge </em>to <em>Richmond, </em>while it lay unsold in the hands of the commission merchant, while the proceeds of the sales rained uncollected by him, it may safely be admitted, the subject was <em>Harper\u2019s </em>property, and therefore, that the risk of loss was his also. But the moment the. proceeds of sales were received by the commission merchant, the money belonged to <em>Patton, </em>simply, exclusively, absolutely. <em>Harper </em>had no right or power over it, in any way; it was not passed to his credit; it was irrecoverably gone from him. The absolute right to the money, the power to direct the disposition of it at pleasure, to give the commission merchant credit for it as long as he pleased, to direct the time when, the place to which, the manner how, it should be remitted to him; all, in fine, that constituted property in the subject, was in <em>Patton. </em>And, in fact, he exercised complete ownership over it: he consigned the flour to the commission merchant, without any intimation that <em>Harper </em>had any interest in it; he directed that it should be sold, and that the proceeds should be remitted to himself, at <em>Baltimore, </em>at a comparatively distant day, giving credit to the commission merchant in the meantime for the amount. It was, actually passed to his credit, and mixed up with his other funds in the merchant\u2019s hands. <em>Hqrper </em>had no right to demand the money, and no right of action to recover it of the commission merchant; nor any right to adopt any legal means to save or secure it, if he had apprehended a loss. <em>Patton </em>alone could, or can now, maintain an action for it. Should the agent retrieve his affairs, <em>Patton </em>may yet, and <em>Harper </em>never can, recover it of him. The money was, therefore, from the moment it got into the hands of the commission merchant, and it is still, <em>Patton\u2019s </em>money, paid him by <em>Harper; </em>and, if it shall be ultimately lost (which cannot as yet be certain), the loss must fall on the owner.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-7\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZE\">left to the court, without any remark, the objections taken to the form of the forthcoming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>bond, and to the regularity of the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">Upon the merits, the judgment of the circuit court was right. The transaction was of a singular character, and the case must be decided on its own peculiar circumstances. <em>Patton </em>had prosecuted his claim against <em>Harper, </em>to the last stage; the debt was perfectly secure; the means of recovery sure and speedy: his debtor had no reason to ask, and he no motive to give, indulgence at any risk whatever to himself: and it is hardly to be imagined, that the one intended to incur any risk, or that the other wished or expected him to do so. The whole object of both parties, was, to give the debtor time to convert his flour into money, with which to pay the debt, and to ensure to the creditor the certain application of the proceeds to the debt. To accomplish these objects, <em>Harper </em>constituted <em>Patton </em>his agent, to send the flour to market, to have it sold, to receive the proceeds, and credit him for them; and as <em>Patton </em>was not expected to execute this agency in person, he proposed, and the other consented, that he should employ his own commission merchant as a sub-agent in the business. If <em>Patton </em>undertook this agency for <em>Harper, </em>in perfect good faith, and executed it with diligence, <em>Harper, </em>his principal, was bound to bear any loss that might happen, without his default. If he was honest in recommending the sub-agent, and faithful and industrious to save the proceeds of the property in the wreck of the sub-agent\u2019s affairs, <em>Harper </em>must bear the loss occasioned by the sub-agent\u2019s default; for he was <em>Harper's </em>own agent, employed by <em>Patton, </em>with his acquiescence and approbation. Both parties knew, that the proceeds of the flour must, in the nature of things, remain for some time, in the hands of the commission merchant: both, then, <em>Harper </em>as well as <em>Patton, </em>intended that he should be trusted with them. Admitting, then, as <em>Harper </em>most explicitly admitted, the integrity and diligence of <em>Patton's </em>conduct, how can he be held to bear this unlookcd for loss ? It is said, that after the money was received by the commission merchant, <em>Bar-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number><em>per </em>had no right to demand it of him, or to sue him for it: that there was no privity of contract between them; that <em>Patton </em>alone had, and he only even now has, a right to demand and sue for the money; therefore, it was and is his money; and therefore, this was a payment by <em>Harper </em>to <em>Patton. </em>But, if the flour was <em>Harper's </em>property, the proceeds of it were his property too; and if the commission merchant was the agent of <em>Harper, </em>employed by <em>Patton </em>his other agent, to dispose of his property, it is not perceived, why <em>Harper </em>might not, and may not, maintain an action for the proceeds of his flour, as so much money had and received by the commission merchant to his use.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b324-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>in reply. Upon the doctrine of the law of agency, <em>Patton </em>made the proceeds of the flour his own, by giving the commission merchant credit for them, to answer his own purposes: for he authorised him to hold them from March till May, at which time he directed him to remit them to himself at <em>Baltimore ; </em>meanwhile, they were put to his credit, and mixed with his other funds in the commission merchant\u2019s hands. <em>Paley on Agency, p. 45.

I admit, that no sale of the flour by <em>Harper </em>to <em>Patton, </em>was intended or effected by this transaction: <em>Patton </em>agreed to take <em>Harper's </em>flour, send it to <em>Richmond, </em>and have it turned into money: therefore, all fair risks on the flour were to be incurred by <em>Harper, </em>while it remained his. If the agreement had been, that it should be sold on a credit, (which does not seem to have been the fact), <em>Harper, </em>I think, would have hazarded the solvency of the purchaser : but so soon as the flour was turned into money, and that money in the hands of the commission merchant, it became, I think, <em>Patton's </em>money, and a payment by <em>Harper </em>of his debt. We are not told, that in sending the flour to the merchant, <em>Patton </em>gave him any information, that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>Harper s </em>flour : lie treated it precisely as his own, sent it to <em>h</em>is own commission merchant, to whom he was m the habit of sending his produce, and directed him to sell it, and remit the money to him at <em>Baltimore. </em>Suppose, after the money was in the merchant\u2019s hands, <em>Harper </em>had been in <em>Richmond, </em>and, having a most pressing call for money there, had applied to this merchant for it: would he have got it? would not the merchant have told him, \u201cI know nothing of you in this business; I have received flour from <em>M,r. Patton, </em>have sold it according to his directions, and am bound, both by those same directions and my own letter to him, to remit the proceeds to him at Baltimore?\" could <em>Harper </em>have enforced his demand ? No. Between him and the commission merchant, there was no contract, no privity. If <em>Harper </em>had seen the merchant about to abscond full-handed, he could not have saved the debt, as one due to him, by attachment or any other process. This, then, was no longer his property, or <em>Ms </em>money. Whose then? <em>Patton\u2019s. </em>The merchant had passed it to bis credit, along with all his other funds in his hands. Is it not clear, that ibis was the idea of the parties ? <em>Harper </em>bad parted with all control over the flour, with the understanding that it should go to <em>Patton?s </em>agent, and the proceeds be a payment, <em>pro tanto, </em>of liis debt: when ? whenever received by <em>Patton\u2019s </em>agent. Tt appears, that <em>Patton </em>was in the habit of sending produce to this same agent to sell; this proves, that he thought his money safe in his hands. We may fairly conclude, then, that he had no objection to that risk in regard to this flour, which he was constantly incurring in all his other produce. Nor do we hear, that he made any difference in this consignment; that he informed the merchant, that this was not <em>his </em>flour, nor at his risk, or desired him to enter it as <em>Harper\u2019s </em>flour, and to credit <em>him </em>by the proceeds: on the contrary <em>Patton\u2019s </em>orders were, \u201c sell this flour, and remit the proceeds to <em>me </em>at <em>Baltimore, </em>about the 1st of May, when I expect to he there.\u201d Suppose <em>Patton </em>had gone to <em>Richmond, </em>immediately after the flour was sold; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>and, having occasion for the money, had made application to the merchant for it: ought he hot to have paid it to him ? Suppose <em>Patton </em>had' got timely notice of his tottering condition, could he not have made any arrangement in regard to this money, precisely as he could for his other funds in the merchant\u2019s hands ? These are the <em>indicia </em>of property: they all prove, that it was in <em>Patton. </em>I must conclude, then,, that, both from the meaning of the parties, and the operation of the law, this was a payment to him. The money in the merchants hands was his; and his must be the loss from that merchant\u2019s failure.</p>\n<author id=\"b326-3\">Green, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Avq\">I think the judgment of the circuit court, should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The substance of the transaction was, that <em>Harper </em>constituted <em>Patton </em>his agent, to dispose of his flour for him, in the usual course of <em>Patton's </em>business, and to apply its proceeds, when received, to <em>Harper's </em>credit with him : and an authority to dispose of it through the instrumentality of a sub-agent, was not only implied from the nature of the transaction, but more strongly, from the contemporary declaration made by <em>Patton </em>to Harper, that he should dispose of it through tire agency of a commission merchant, with whom he usually dealt, and whose solvency and integrity he had no reason to doubt. And <em>Harper </em>admitted, that <em>Patton </em>had used all the diligence in his power, to carry the arrangement into effect, in causing the flour to be sold, and endeavouring to secure the proceeds. Suppose the arrangement, had been, for <em>Harper's </em>accommodation, and in order to induce some other creditor to forbear, that <em>Patton </em>should send the flour to his commission merchant to be sold, and should account for the proceeds to such other creditor; could such other creditor have held him accountable for the proceeds, though never received by him, and that without any default in him? The circumstance, that <em>Patton </em>alone could maintain an action against the commission merchant (if that were admitted) does not vary the case: for, in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>case, he would be held accountable to Harper, only as a trustee for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">There is no valid objection to the form of the forthcoming bond, or the judgment. It is sufficient, that the bond recites the levying of the execution, and upon what specific property: if that had been the property of a stranger, the bond would have been nevertheless good and binding. The irregularity in the terms of the judgment is only matter of form.</p>\n<author id=\"b327-5\">Coalter, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A41S\">I am of opinion, that the judgment of the circuit court must be affirmed. I cannot perceive how the circumstance, that the merchant entrusted to sell the flour, was the commission merchant who usually transacted <em>Patton\u2019s </em>business in <em>Richmond, </em>can affect this case. It is said, that <em>Patton </em>confided his other business to him, and therefore all he wanted was to get the flour into his hands, as he would then be sure of the money, so soon as the flour was sold. No doubt, he thought it would be safe in his hands : if he had not thought so, if he entertained a suspicion of the agent, he ought to be held accountable for not making his suspicions known. The more confidence he had, the more innocent and honest he is. He acted with good faith. Both parties are equally innocent: and the question is, who shall bear the loss ? The debtor, who has gained time from his creditor, to try and make his crop available to discharge his debt ? or the creditor, who has granted this indulgence, and moreover rendered services, without compensation, in sending the flour to market ?</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The debt has not been actually paid to the creditor. There has been an effort to pay it; but the money has been lost, without the fault or neglect of either party. It seems to me, that the case must be decided, as it would be <em>\\i Patton </em>had had no particular commission merchant in <em>Richmond, </em>but the flour had been sent to one named by either party, and agreed on by both, to be the person to whom it was to be sent; or, as if <em>Patton </em>had been authorised to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Send it to any one he might select, and had made the selection with due caution and care.</p>\n<p id=\"APk\">The question is, whether <em>Patton, </em>by himself or his agents ever received this money <em>in discharge </em>of this debt? Was the merchant his agent to collect this debt for him ? to receive the money from <em>Harper, </em>or from the sale of his effects, for <em>Patton, </em>so that, so soon as the effects were sold, and the money received, the payment of the debt was complete, as much so as if it had been paid into <em>Patton\u2019s </em>own hands, and he had given a receipt therefor ? It is admitted, that <em>Patton </em>was to be at no risk in the transmission of the flour. He had a right to have the proceeds remitted to him <em>at Lexington, </em>or at some other equally convenient place. His debtor was bound to seek and pay him his debt, he had an execution hanging over him, which would force a payment into his hands <em>at home: </em>therefore, it cannot be supposed, that he was to travel to <em>Richmond, </em>to collect it there, unless perfectly convenient for him to do so: or that he was to be at the risk of its remittance to him from thence. He received no premium for any risk, and was to he at none. This seems to be admitted on all hands :, and yet it is insisted, that he must lose the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ5\">Suppose the merchant had not failed, but had remitted the money in bank bills, and they had been lost. This could not be <em>Patton\u2019s </em>loss, unless the risk of remittance be thrown on him. Suppose the remittance had been in a bill of exchange, believed at the time to be good, but was dishonoured, and finally proved good for nothing: it seems to be admitted, that if such a bill had been taken in payment for the flour, the loss would have been <em>Harper\u2019s. </em>Should it be otherwise, if the money had been paid for the flour, and instantly laid out in a bill, for the purpose of remittance ?</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">But why was <em>Patton </em>to have any thing to do with the flour ? His aid was called in, no doubt, that he might be certain, that the money, when received, would be paid into his hands. Suppose this object had been effected in some other way: suppose, for example, <em>Harper </em>had said to Pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>ton, \u201c </em>T will send this flour to such a merchant in <em>Richmond: </em>... . 1 will assign the bill of lading to you : 1 will moreover write to the merchant, that my property is under execution for your debt, and that the net proceeds of the flour, when received, are to be paid to you; that he shall consider this as an <em>irrevocable </em>order in your favour for those proceeds, and shall pay the same over to you or your order, as if you yourself had sent the flour to him.\u201d The flour is received and sold for cash, and the merchant fails. Surely, this would be no payment of the debt by <em>Harper. </em>I cannot well see how such a case would he materially variant from that before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">It is admitted, that <em>Patton </em>has been guilty of no negligence ; that he was to receive no benefit by the transaction, but on the contrary, submitted to delay, and encountered .some trouble, for <em>nothing; </em>and this, at the pressing solicitation of his debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">But it is said the merchant was the agent of both parties, in different stages of the transaction : that, in receiving and selling the flour, and even in receiving the money for it, he was the agent of <em>Harper, </em>but that, from the moment he had accomplished the receipt of the money, be was the agent of <em>Patton, </em>and answerable to him alone for his conduct, since he knew nothing of <em>Harper </em>in the business, and could only be responsible to him, in a controversy to which <em>Patton </em>was a party : that the moment ho sold, and the money was received, <em>Harper's </em>risk ceased ; it was then <em>Patton's </em>money. How so ? True, he has a right of action for it: but so he would have had, if the flour had been lost by the negligence of the -merchant; or if he had, without authority, sold it on a credit, and the debt had been lost; in which cases, it is admitted, the loss must have been <em>Harper's. </em>The <em>liability </em>of the merchant to <em>Patton </em>then, cannot be the test of the question, <em>who is to bear the loss. </em>He would have been in like manner liable, if the contract between <em>Harper </em>and <em>Patton </em>had expressly stipulated, that, until the money was actually paid into <em>Patton's </em>hands, it should be at <em>Harper's </em>risk. Nor would these have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>contradictory, unlawful, or unreasonable stipulations. It would only have been <em>expressly </em>stipulating for what appears to me to be the legal and necessary meaning and result of the contract that was made. The merchant (it seems to me) held <em>Harper\u2019s </em>money to be paid over to his creditor, who had also a lien on it in his hands, or rather an absolute right to enforce payment of it, but he was not less <em>Harper\u2019s </em>agent for the purpose of <em>paying over, </em>than he was his agent for <em>receiving </em>and <em>selling; </em>nor can he be otherwise considered, merely because he did not know <em>Harper </em>in the transaction. This also would equally have been the case, if there had been an express stipulation (unknown to him) between <em>Harper </em>and <em>Patton, </em>that all was to be at <em>Harper\u2019s </em>risk, though transacted in <em>Patton\u2019s </em>name, until the money was paid over. He stood (as it seems to me) in the nature of an acceptor of <em>Harper\u2019s </em>draft, in favour of <em>Patton, </em>to pay the proceeds of the flour over to him as soon as they were received.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">If <em>Patton </em>had drawn on the merchant for the proceeds of this flour, to be paid the moment it was sold and the proceeds received, (which would have been a method of drawing it out of his hands, with as little risk as possible to <em>Harper), </em>and this order had been presented and accepted, on the day of sale, for the net proceeds, naming the sum, for which the flour was sold, and (the acceptor failing at the instant) the draft had been dishonoured : would this have been <em>Patton\u2019s </em>loss? or, suppose he had arrived in <em>Richmond, </em>an hour after the sale and receipt of the money, and had demanded it in vain. In either case, would it have been a payment by <em>Harper </em>of his debt ? If it would, it must be because the money was to be at <em>Patton\u2019s </em>risk, whether in a course of remittance or otherwise, from the <em>moment the </em>merchant received it, it being then a <em>complete payment to him, </em>not simply a right in him to receive and enforce the payment of it, to be placed to <em>Harper\u2019s </em>credit, when received.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">On the whole, I think that the merchant, though responsible to <em>Patton, </em>was, nevertheless, so far as it regards the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>question of risk, as much the agent of <em>Harper, to pay over the 'money, </em>as ho was <em>to receive and sell the flour ; </em>and that, until the proceeds were actually so paid over, unless some fault in <em>Patton </em>should occasion loss, the whole risk was on <em>Harper.</em></p>\n<author id=\"b331-9\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AtBY\">The question is, on whom the loss occasioned by the failure of the commission merchant, shall fall ?</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">The arrangement between the parties certainly constituted a bailment. But the question, as to the loss, depends not so much on any principle peculiar to the law of bailments, as on the intention of the parties, as to the time when the net proceeds of the flour were to be applied to the credit of <em>Harper </em>on the forthcoming bond. If it was intended, that the money should be thus applied, at the moment it got <em>into the hands of the </em>commission merchant, then the receipt of the money by him, made it, <em>ipso facto, Patton\u2019s </em>money : and, consequently, the loss of it must fall on him. If, on the contrary, it was not intended by the parties, that the net proceeds of the flour should he applied to the credit of <em>Harper </em>until <em>Patton </em>himself had received them, or had applied them to his own use, or until <em>by due </em>diligence, he might have so received or applied them, then it is manifest, that the mere receipt of the money by the commission merchant., did not make it <em>Patton\u2019s </em>money; and,.consequently, that as <em>Patton </em>has been guilty of no negligence, the loss must fall, not on him, hut oil <em>Harper. </em>Bearing these principles in mind, let us look at the situation of the parties, and the terms of the contract. <em>Patton\u2019s </em>debt was perfectly secure, and he had already resorted to legal measures to enforce payment of it; and that object would have been speedily accomplished, if the law had been left to take its course. Overcome by <em>Harper\u2019s </em>repeated and urgent solicitations, he consented, most reluctantly, for <em>Harper\u2019s </em>accommodation, to suspend legal proceedings, and to send the flour to <em>Richmond, </em>to be sold by the instrumentality of a third person, with the understanding, that the net proceed\u00ae <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>should be applied to the credit of the forthcoming bond. Did the parties intend, that <em>Patton </em>should take on himself the risk of the insolvency of the agent of sales ? Did they intend that <em>Patton </em>should be debited with the net proceeds of the flour, although they might never come to his hands ? In the situation in which the parties stood towards each other, it would have been most unreasonable in <em>Harper </em>to ask such a stipulation, and folly in <em>Patton </em>to have acceded to it. No such stipulation can be inferred from the case presented by the record. The contract undoubtedly was, that the proceeds of the flour should be applied to the debit of <em>Patton, </em>when they should be received by him. This view of the case is not changed by the circumstance, that the person selected to sell the flour was the commission merchant who transacted <em>Patton\u2019s </em>own business: he was selected, not because he was <em>Patton's </em>merchant, but because he was believed to be a safe hand. Nor is it material, that <em>Patton </em>might have sustained an action against the commission merchant : he might also have sustained an action against the common carrier, by whom the flour was sent to <em>Richmond, </em>if that carrier had violated his trust by selling the flour, and applying the proceeds to his own <em>use; </em>and yet, in that case, no body would jtretend, that the loss, if the carrier proved insolvent, would fall on <em>Patton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The objections taken to the bond, are not valid. The bond recites the levying of the execution, and the property on which it was levied; and even if that property had belonged to a stranger, it would not impair the obligation of the bond. And, from the nature of the transaction, the property which had been taken by the sheriff in execution, must have been restored to the owner, upon the execution of the bond for the forthcoming and delivery of it: if it had not been so restored, that would have been a substantive ground of defence; but nothing of the kind was pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The irregularity in the terms of the judgment is merely formal.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Judgment of the circuit court affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
