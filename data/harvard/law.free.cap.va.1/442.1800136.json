October.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b454-5\">A <em>fi. fa. </em>is sued out by M. &amp; M. on judgment recovered by them: they indorse on the writ, that it is for benefit of H.: the sheriff levies it, and takes forthcoming bond payable to H: Held, the bond is naught.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b454-6\">(Absent <em>Green, </em>J.)</p>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\"><em>Mays &amp; M\u2019Clung </em>recovered judgement against <em>Meze, </em>in the circuit court of <em>Greenbrier, </em>and thereupon sued out a <em>fieri facias, </em>on which they indorsed, that the judgment and execution were for the benefit of <em>Howver. </em>The sheriff levied the execution on the defendant\u2019s property, and took a forthcoming bond from him, payable, not to the plaintiffs <em>Mays &amp; M\u2019Clung, </em>but to <em>Howver. The </em>bond was forfeited: and <em>Howver </em>moved the circuit court, in his own name, for judgment and award of execution upon it; and the court awarded execution accordingly. <em>Meze </em>applied to this court for a <em>supersedeas, </em>which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-8\"><em>Daniel, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APx\">The bond is naught. The statute requiring forthcoming bonds to be taken <em>payable to the creditor, </em>intends, that they shall be made payable <em>to the plaintiff on the record; </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. \u00a7 1. 15. 16. p. 524. 530. The bond must pursue <em>the </em>judgment and execution, otherwise it has no foundation to support it: it is, in truth, a part of the process of execution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AbM\">No counsel for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b454-10\">\n<em>Per curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AQq\">The statute first provides, that all persons who recover judgment in any court of record, may, at their election, prosecute writs of <em>fieri facias </em>&amp;c. and then, that if the owner of the goods (taken on a <em>fi. fa.) </em>shall give sufficient security to the sheriff to have the goods forthcoming at the day of sale, it shall be lawful for the sheriff to take a bond from the debtor and sureties, <em>payable to the creditor, </em>reciting &amp;c. <em>The </em>creditor to whom the bond is to <em>be made </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>payable, is the person entitled to sue out the execution; the plaintiff on the record. No other person can be known to the officer, or to the court itself, as the creditor. To no other person, then, can the bond be taken. In <em>Downman </em>v. <em>Chinn, </em>2 Wash. 189. a forthcoming bond made payable to the <em>sheriff, </em>was given up, on all hands, as faulty. The judgment of the circuit court must be reversed, and the forthcoming bond quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
