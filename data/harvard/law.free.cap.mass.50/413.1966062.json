The parties submitted the case to the decision of the court on the following facts agreed:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-8\">\u201c The demanded premises were a part of the real estate of Selden Spencer, deceased. The tenant Hinsdale, in right of his wife, Harriet Hinsdale, became entitled, on the decease of said Selden, to the possession of one undivided sixth part of his real estate, in common with the said Selden\u2019s other heirs. George Spencer and John W. Spencer were each entitled to an undivided sixth part of said real estate, in common with the other heirs. The demandant recovered judgment at the February term 1844, of the court of common pleas, against said George Spencer and John W. Spencer, for the sum of $1566 damage, and $14-65 costs, upon which judgment he sued out a writ of execution, on the 11th of March 1844, and caused the same to be levied upon the two undivided sixths of the real estate aforesaid, which are demanded in this suit. The same was attached upon the demandant\u2019s original writ against said George and John W. on the 18th of May 1842. The land levied upon, as aforesaid, is the same which said George and John W. owned, as heirs of said Selden, and which they held in common with said Henry Hinsdale, and Harriet, his wife, and the other heirs of said Selden.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-9\">\u201c The tenant Hinsdale claims no title to any part of said</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>land, except to one undivided sixth, in right of his wife, as before stated. At the commencement of this action, he was in possession of the whole premises, undivided, with the consent of the other cotenants ; but he neither admits nor denies, and has never admitted nor denied, the demandant\u2019s right to the demanded premises, as a cotenant. If he is properly joined in this action, he is to be <em>defaulted; </em>otherwise, the demandant discontinues as to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">\u201c The tenant Barrows disclaims all title to one undivided sixth part of the demanded premises, and has never been in possession, except so far as he was made tenant in common by force of the levy of an execution, as hereinafter mentioned. He claims title to one undivided sixth of the premises described in the demandant\u2019s writ, by virtue of a levy of an execution thereon, issued on a judgment recovered by him, as administrator of the estate of Lucy Spencer, against George Spencer aforesaid, the same having been attached, upon his original writ against said George, on the 28th of June 1842.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The officer who made the attachment on the demandant\u2019s original writ, above mentioned, against George and John TV.

And the demandant\u2019s levy was insufficient, as the return did not show, as is required by Rev.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AH\">The tenant Barrows disclaims as to one sixth, but insists on his better title to one sixth, in virtue of a levy of execution on the same, as the property of George Spencer. The demandant claims the two sixths, in virtue of his levy on the same, as the property of John W. Spencer and George Spencer, on a joint judgment against the two. The tenant\u2019s levy was prior to the demandant\u2019s, but the demandant\u2019s was made in pursuance of an attachment, on mesne process, which preceded that of the tenant. If that attachment was valid, and the levy regular, the demandant has the elder and better. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>title to the one sixth in controversy, taken by each as the property of George Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The first objection is, that the attachment was not valid, because the officer who made it did not sign his return until after the tenant\u2019s attachment. But it does appear that whilst the action was pending in the court of common pleas, the officer was allowed to come in and amend his return by signing it. We think it was perfectly competent for that court to permit such amendment; and, when made, it proves that the attachment was made at the time stated in the return. The return, when amended, is to have the same effect as if it had been so made originally. Any other construction would lead to uncertainty, and make the rights of parties depend upon unsatisfactory parol proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">We have considered it, as if the fact of such amendment being made after the tenant\u2019s attachment were judicially proved, because the case comes before us by an agreed statement embracing that fact. But if the question had arisen, in the course of the trial, on a question of title, and, to prove the fact and time of attachment, a certified copy of the writ and return from the record of the court of common pleas, all appearing complete and correct, had been given in evidence, it is doubtful, to say the least, whether evidence would have been admissible to show that the return had been signed after the cause came into the court of common pleas, in pursuance of an order of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">An objection was taken to the demandant\u2019s levy, viz. that it does not distinctly appear by the return that the land was taken, appraised \u2022 and set off, and the time when it was set off. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>73, \u00a7 23. We think this objection is not sustained by the proof. The return of the officer certifies acts done, which constitute a taking or seizing. He caused it to be appraised, and delivered possession and seizin to the creditor\u2019s attorney, and left him in quiet possession; which could only be done on the premises. The date of the oath, the appraiser\u2019s certificate and the return, being all of the same dav, prove the time of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\n<em>Judgment for the demandant for the one sixth not disclaimed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
