The arbitrators awarded that B. should pay a certain sum to A. in fulfilment of the contract for building the first mentioned house, and that another certain sum remained to be advanced by B. to A. in fulfilment of the contract for building the other house. Held, that the arbitrators had not decided all the matters submitted to them, and that their award was therefore bad.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-6\">Assumpsit on the following agreement, made between the plaintiff and defendant on the 30th of March 1842:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">\u201c Whereas the said Pollard and Houston did, on the 29th of October 1840, make and execute an agreement in writing, under seal, wherein and whereby the said Houston contracted to build a dwelling-house and out buildings for the said Pollard, and upon the land of the said Pollard, as therein is set forth and expressed: And whereas a certain hill for materials furnished and labor done upon said dwelling-house and out buildings, by the procurement of the said Pollard, hath been exhibited and claimed by the said Pollard, which is hereunto annexed, and certain charges for extra work and materials have been made by the said Houston, as done and furnished for said house: And whereas the said Pollard</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-9\">alleges that the work and materials done and furnished by said Houston, upon said house, are had and defective, and the said Houston alleges that the claims of the said Pollard are not justly due and allowable: Now it is hereby agreed, that all the said matters in dispute between the said Pollard and the said Houston, and all matters respecting the building of the said houses, and as to the time, mode and amount of payment, if any, to be made by the said Pollard, and all other claims arising or accruing to either party from or under the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>contract, shall be referred to Horatio M.

This might not be fatal, if the particulars had not been specified in the submission. But here it appears, on the face of the award, that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>matters submitted have not been decided. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Phillipps, </em>4 Bing.

Unless it expressly appears, by the award, that all the matters submitted have been decided, or unless the implication that they have been decided is unavoidable, the award is bad. Here there is no such implication. The case of <em>Rider </em>v. <em>Fisher, 5 </em>Scott, 86, and 3 Bing. N. R. 874, cannot be distinguished from the case at bar. There the arbitrators were to determine on all claims, differences and disputes relating to alleged defects and imperfections in a building, and relating to the accuracy of claims for extra work, and deductions for omissions, and to ascertain what balance, if any, might be due to the builder. The award was, that a certain sum should be paid to the builder, and received by him, in full satisfaction of all matters in difference between the parties, and referred by them. The award was held to he bad. Tindal, C. J. said, \u201c the arbitrators have not done that which they were required to do. There are three distinct subjects matter upon which they were called upon to decide ; the alleged defects and imperfections in the building, the charge made for extra work and deductions for omissions, and the balance due in respect of those extras and omissions. Two of these they leave altogether untouched ; and they have left it uncertain whether the balance they direct to be paid is a general balance, or confined to the balance of the account for extras and omissions.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-5\"><em>Whiting, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdL\">Every reasonable intendment is made, in the modern cases, in favor of an award, and the ancient niceties are disregarded. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Brockenbrough, </em>1 Rand. 449. <em>Coupland </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>2.Call, 106. <em>King </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>Charlt. 287. <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Williamson, </em>2 Har. &amp; Gill, 62. <em>Karthaus </em>v. <em>Ferrer, </em>1 Pet. 222.

They need not state the process by which they come to their result. It will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>be intended that arbitrators have decided on all matters referred to them, unless the contrary cleai-Iy appears, even when they do not state that they have awarded \u201cof or concerning the premises.\u201d <em>A fortiori, </em>will this be intended when they do thus state, as in the case at bar. <em>Crofton </em>v. <em>Connor, </em>1 Bro.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auv\">The court are of opinion that the award is not valid and cannot be supported. The arbitrators have not found whether any thing remained to be done, towards the completion of the houses, according to the contracts which were referred to them; especially respecting the second house, which was alleged not to be finished.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">We take the rule to be, that when the claims on both sides are for debts, or pecuniary claims, or for damages capable of being liquidated, ascertained, and reduced to a sum certain, if the arbitrators, professing to decide on the whole subject, find a balance due to the one from the other, such an award is final and conclusive, although the particulars, from which that balance resulted, are not stated. And in this case, had :t been left to the arbitrators, not to direct the specific performance of any acts for completing and finishing the buildings according to contract, but to assess damages for all deficiencies, we are inclined to think the award of a balance to be paid would have been good. But even if it was within their authority to find damages for the non-performance of the contract, in finishing and completing the buildings, instead of directing a specific performance of the contract, by making good the deficiencies, yet it was clearly within their authority to direct such things to be done specifically; and the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>stipulated to do and perform what should thus be directed. Now this award, finding a balance on the pecuniary claims, leaves it wholly uncertain, whether the arbitrators decided on the fact that there was or was not any such deficiencies, and if there were, that they allowed any compensation for them, in damages, in stating the balance of the account. We think it would be carrying the' doctrine of intendment too far, to assume that they decided against all claims for specific performance on both sides, merely because they have said nothing on the subject; nor is the award aided by the general statement that they have made their award <em>\u201c of </em>and concerning the premises, and the whole subject matter thereof.\u201d It must appear, on the award, with reasonable certainty, what the rights of the parties respectively are, so as to prevent future controversy and litigation. Should actions\u2019now be brought on the original contract, for alleged breaches, in not performing the stipulations therein contained, the defendant could not hold up this award as a bar, and show clearly therefrom that the subject matter <em>of </em>such breach had been passed upon and decided by arbitrators mutually chosen. Without referring to the numerous authorities cited in the full and able argument, one recent case appears to us to be in point. <em>Rider </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>3 Bing. N. R. 874, and 5 Scott, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
