At the trial in the court of common pleas, before <em>Warren, </em>J. evidence was introduced tending to show the following facts: That in November 1840, the defendants, and Charles A. Brown, who has since died, were the owners of five eighths of the barque Creole: That the defendants, before the 30th of said November, authorized the said Brown, as their agent, to purchase their proportion of the outfits of said barque which was then fitting for a whaling voyage; but that they made no advance to said Brown: That on the 30th of said November, the said Brown, as such agent, purchased of the plaintiffs the cordage in question \u2014 the same being a necessary part of the outfit of said barque \u2014 on a credit of six months, and, as agent as aforesaid, gave to the plaintiffs a note therefor, payable in six months : That the defendants, about two months after this purchase, made a settlement with said' Brown, and paid him their proportion of the outfits, with a commission for his services.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-9\">It did not appear in evidence whether Brown was or was not instructed to purchase on a credit; and there was no evidence that the defendants knew that the cordage was purchased upon a credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-10\">The defendants, upon this evidence, contended that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>were not liable for the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim; but the court instructed the jury that the defendants were so liable, and a verdict was returned for the plaintiffs. The defendants alleged exceptions to the said instruction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-5\"><em>M. S. </em>Clarke, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anc\">As the authority of Brown was only to purchase the defendants\u2019 proportion of the outfits of the Creole, he was their special agent, and they are not liable for his acts beyond the extent of the authority conferred on him. Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 17, 126, 127, 131. Long on Sales, (Rand\u2019s ed.) 397. <em>Fenn </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>3 T. R. 757. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Colt, 7 </em>Johns. 390. So far as can be ascertained from the evidence in the case, if Brown was authorized to buy on credit at all, it was on demand, or at two months at the furthest. The plaintiffs were bound to show that six months\u2019 credit was usual in cases like this <em>; </em>but they have not shown it; and the defendants insist that such credit is unusual. The evidence shows that the defendants, being ignorant that the purchase was on credit, paid Brown in two months ; whereby they suffered an injury. This fact, being part of the <em>res gestee, </em>is strong proof that Brown had no authority to buy on longer credit than two months, and also rebuts the presumption arising from the fact that the defendants furnished him with no funds before the purchase.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b100-6\"><em>W. Gray, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b100-7\">Wilde, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">This is an action of assumpsit for the price of a quantity of cordage purchased of the plaintiffs by the defendants\u2019 agent; and the defence is, that <em>the agent </em>was not authorized to make the purchase on a credit. That he was not in terms expressly so authorized is admitted ; but he was authorized to make the purchase, and no funds were advanced to him, to enable him to purchase for cash. This, by implication, unquestionably authorized him to make the purchase on the defendants\u2019 credit. When an agent is authorized to do an act for his employer, all the means necessary for the accomplishment of the act are impliedly included in the authority, unless the agent be in some particular expressly restricted. Thus, if an agent is employed to procure a note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>or bill to be discounted, he may, unless expressly restricted, indorse it in the name of his employer, and thereby bind him. So an authority to a broker to effect a policy will authorize him to adjust a loss under the policy. Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 58 \u2014 60. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>1 Campb. 43, <em>note. </em>Without doubt, therefore, the defendants\u2019 agent was authorized to purchase on credit, and to bind the defendants to pay the purchase money. This authority is necessarily implied from the admitted fact, that the agent was not furnished with any funds wherewith to pay the purchase money; and certainly he was not bound to advance his own funds, nor to become chargeable himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">It has been objected, that a longer time of credit was allowed than was usual in like pinchases, and that the defendants were thereby led to believe that their agent had paid for the cordage, and that, about two months after the purchase, they paid him the amount. There is no foundation for this objection. It is not admitted by the plaintiffs that six months was an unusually long credit in like purchases; nor would it be \u2022material, if it were admitted. The plaintiffs are not responsible for the misconduct of the defendants\u2019 agent. If the defendants have been deceived by him, their remedy is against him. That can be no defence in this action. It is not material whether the agent was authorized to give a note in the defendants\u2019 names; for, whether he was or not, the defendants are liable in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
