The funds were not received by the bank but were fraudulently appropriated by Lupis. Plaintiffs contend that the funds were delivered to Lupis at the bank upon his representation that the bank would pay ten per cent interest on the deposit if left with the bank for one year. The defendant contends that the whole transaction took place outside the bank and was a personal transaction between Lupis and the plaintiff Rose, not binding on the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>At the close of the main charge, defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to submit that question to the jury. The request was refused and the court stated that there was no evidence in the record that any transaction took place outside of the bank. Defendant\u2019s counsel duly excepted. The statement and refusal to charge constituted reversible error. If there was testimony that the transactions took place outside of the bank and the money was appropriated by Lupis, the defendant was entitled to have that question submitted to the jury. The record contains evidence which would have justified the jury in finding that the transactions or part of them took place outside the bank. <em>(Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>148 App. Div. 363; affd., 210 N.
