The motion to quash was properly denied. Mr. Branch in Sec. 508 of his Annotated P. C. cites Howell v. State, 29 Texas App., 592; Brown v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 597, and a score of other cases holding that when an offense may be committed in various ways, \u2014 not repugnant to each other, \u2014 same may be alleged to have been committed in some or all of the ways referred to. It being alleged that appellant was doing three things, each of which was and is a misdemeanor, and which clearly were not repugnant to each other, and that as a result of some one or all of said unlawful acts he struck and killed,\u2014 it must be apparent that the State was making application of the rule above referred to, and that its pleadings were correct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>and might be supported by proof of anyone or all of the violations which appellant is said to have committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">We find twelve bills of exception, each and all of which have been examined and considered, but none are deemed to merit discussion or to exhibit error. The facts show appellant\u2019s guilt, and there being no tenable complaint of any matter of procedure, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
