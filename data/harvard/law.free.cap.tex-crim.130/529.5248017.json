Bolden won appellant\u2019s money. He (Bolden) put $111 in a sack and handed it to his wife. Porter McGee grabbed the sack. At this juncture, we quote from the testimony of Bolden: \u201cAt that time I was standing right here at the table, and my wife was standing right here (indicating) and she was tying up the sack, and Porter was right behind her, \u2014 I don\u2019t know exactly where he was then, because I wasn\u2019t paying any attention at the time, but anyway he grabbed the sack from around behind her, and she says \u2018Don\u2019t do that,\u2019 and she tried to hold on to it, and when she turned around, pulling against the sack, he pulled his gun. Porter McGee had hold of the sack at the same time, just as my wife had said, \u2018Don\u2019t do that.\u2019 Well, he snatched the sack and the rest of them hollered \u2018Don\u2019t do that,\u2019 and he said \u2018Everybody be still,\u2019 and backed out with his gun on us. * * * He drew the gun on my wife first to get that sack and I believe he said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u2018Turn it loose,\u2019 I don\u2019t know exactly what he said. I was not scared until I saw him with the gun \u2014 that is the only thing that excited me. He took the money from my wife, \u2014 just pulled it out of her hands and the gun was how come him to get the money.\u201d He testified, further, that shortly before McGee committed the robbery appellant and McGee had left the house together. McGee testified to the effect that appellant induced him to commit the offense, and that he gave all of the money to appellant except the small change. The sheriff testified that he went to appellant\u2019s home sometime after the robbery and told him that he thought he had the money that had been taken on the occasion of the robbery. Appellant at first entered a denial. However, he finally told a negro to get the money. He brought about twenty dollars to appellant. The officer insisted that appellant had more of the money. Appellant then told the negro to go get the rest of it. The negro returned in a few minutes with about twenty dollars tied up in a handkerchief. When the officer still insisted that all of the money had not been returned, appellant again sent the negro away. He returned with about twenty dollars. Appellant then told the officer that he would borrow enough to pay the balance if he would not prosecute him.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">We deem the evidence sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">It is shown in bill of exception No. 3 that Porter McGee, who was called by the State, at first denied that appellant had anything to do with the perpetration of the robbery. However, he later testified that appellant induced him to commit the offense. The district attorney then asked said witness why he had testified at first that appellant had nothing to do with the robbery. Over appellant\u2019s objection that the testimony was irrelevant, immaterial and prejudicial, the witness answered \u201cI testified that way because he (appellant) promised to get me out of it, that is the defendant, John Miller, promised to get me out of it if I would make a witness for him on the stand.\u201d We deem said testimony to have been relevant and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In the cross-examination of McGee, appellant elicited from him the fact that he had agreed to plead guilty to the charge of robbery. In view of such testimony, we would not feel warranted in holding that bill of exception No. 2 manifests reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"ASi\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
