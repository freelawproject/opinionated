The State introduced in evidence appellant\u2019s written confession in which he fully admitted his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">While the sheriff was testifying he was asked by appellant\u2019s counsel to state why appellant made the confession. He replied in effect that he made it because he was guilty. Appellant\u2019s objection to the answer was sustained and the court promptly instructed the jury to disregard it. In the light of the record, the opinion is expressed that reversible error is not presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">Appellant testified in his own behalf.
