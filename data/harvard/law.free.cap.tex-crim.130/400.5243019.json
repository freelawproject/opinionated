However, the alleged affidavit is not before this court. The right to a statement of facts under the provisions of .Art. 760, sub. 6, C. C. P., is conditioned upon compliance with the statute. Among the essential provisions is that which prescribes that the affidavit must be made by the accused. It is also necessary that the record show that the affidavit was filed and called to the attention of the trial court. The article in question is discussed in Texas Jur., Vol. 4, p. 415, sec. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">We find nothing in the record which would authorize a reversal of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
