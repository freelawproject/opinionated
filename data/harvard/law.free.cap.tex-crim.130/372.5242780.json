By recent Constitutional Amendments and statutory enactments thereunder practically the status of what was formerly called the \u201clocal option\u201d law has been restored, so far as the procedure in prosecutions under the present laws is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">Forms for indictments or informations thereunder which have been approved in many cases will be found in Wilson\u2019s Texas Crim. Forms, 4th Ed., Form No. 314, p. 169, and in Branch\u2019s Ann. Texas P. C., Sec. 1220, page 689. Many authorities are cited under each reference holding good indictments under the forms prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">We call attention of prosecutors and trial judges to the fact that the description in the indictment or information of the liquor dealt with in some localities must be kept in mind because in some places in the State under our present laws a given location may be a \u201cdry area\u201d (as now designated) so far as the sale, etc., of spirituous intoxicating liquor is concerned, and at the same time be \u201cwet area\u201d as it relates to sales, etc., of malt liquor, although such liquor may be intoxicating.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-12\">Because of defective pleading on the part of the State, the judgment must be reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed under the present complaint and information.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">\n<em>Reversed and prosecution ordered dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
