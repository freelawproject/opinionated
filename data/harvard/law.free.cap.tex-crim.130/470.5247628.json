The exact question was before this court in Bryant v. State, 87 S. W. (2d) 722, and Smitham v. State, 87 S. W. (2d) 724, in which cases it was held that a slot machine, although it could not legally be possessed, was a subject of robbery. Therefore, the appellant\u2019s - contention in the present instance must be held untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">Deeming the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
