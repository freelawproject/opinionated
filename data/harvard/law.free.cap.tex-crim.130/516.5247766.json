It is essential that the bond be approved by the district judge and also by the sheriff. See Art. 818, C. C. P., 1925; also Bell v. State, 89 S. W.

Appellant was convicted of assault to murder without malice aforethought. He defended upon the ground that he was drunk. Appellant did not testify but his written confession was introduced in evidence from which we take the following quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-11\">\u201cI had been drinking a lot of whisky before we left Gilmer to go to Lumpy\u2019s, and I was nearly drunk when I started out to Lumpy\u2019s with my brother. From the time I left town until the fight came up I didn\u2019t drink any whisky or beer or anything else. As near as I can remember, the place Lumpy and I had a fight was down by Mr. Taylor Martin\u2019s place, and after I sobered up I remembered cutting him with a knife, but I don\u2019t remember how many times I cut him. I cut him with a knife, but I don\u2019t know how many times I cut him. I wasn\u2019t mad at him, and we haven\u2019t never had a cross of any kind. He has been a good friend of mine, and I sure hate it that I cut him, but I was just crazy drunk. I don\u2019t remember having no fuss with him, or what the trouble come up about. I don\u2019t know who started the trouble and he didn\u2019t hit me that I know anything about. He didn\u2019t make any effort to injure me in any way that I know of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">The injured party was confined in a sanitarium for some two or three weeks by reason of the wounds inflicted upon him by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The court submitted the issue of temporary insanity from the use of ardent spirits; also charged on the use of a deadly weapon; on malice, which was properly defined; and on murder with malice aforethought. At the request of the appellant, the court gave an additional charge on the subject of temporary insanity induced by intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Taking into consideration the evidence, the verdict and the judgment rendered, it is deemed that the proper disposition of the appeal is to order an affirmance of the judgment, which is accordingly done.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
