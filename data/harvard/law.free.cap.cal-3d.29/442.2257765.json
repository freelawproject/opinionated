Our reading of the complaint persuades us that the publications in question could not reasonably be found libelous and that plaintiffs pleading of a conspiracy to slander is deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">The lawsuit was begun in September 1979. A first amended complaint names Betty Harris, Joann Ruden, Erwin Okun, and Does 1 through 1,000 as defendants and alleges 10 causes of action against various combinations of those defendants. Demurrers by Harris, Ruden, and Okun were sustained as to the first, seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth causes, overruled as to the second, third, fifth, and sixth causes, and ordered off calendar as to the fourth cause (because it names only Doe defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">In response to the present petitions, we issued alternative writs of mandate inviting plaintiff and the trial court to show cause why the demurrers to the second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action should not be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">Factual Context of the Alleged Defamation</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">The first cause of action is not directly before us; but its introductory paragraphs, setting out background facts, are incorporated into each of the four causes whose sufficiency we now weigh. The paragraphs allege:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Plaintiff is a limited partnership that purchases, manages, develops, and sells real property. In 1977 it bought 10 acres of Beverly Hills property with a view to building condominiums. The property, then under a building moratorium pending determination of zoning, adjoined city-owned parcels. Plaintiff had discussed with city officials the possi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>bility of a land exchange so that plaintiff and the city each would own contiguous land. The discussions concluded successfully on November 28, 1978, when the city council agreed to the land exchange and adopted a zoning ordinance allowing plaintiff to construct condominiums on all its newly acquired property.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">To prevent construction, defendants circulated and then filed a petition to allow the electorate to reject or accept the ordinance. Consequently the council placed it on the ballot for an election held March 9, 1979. It was rejected and thus repealed. Defendants were \u201cmotiviated by ill will toward [plaintiff]\u201d and \u201ccampaigned against the passage of Proposition B in order to stop [plaintiff\u2019s] condominium project, among other ways, by defaming [plaintiff]. Said defendants variously and falsely accused [plaintiff] of corrupt and collusive activities in connection with City officials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Second Cause oe Action</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The second cause alleges that Harris and Does 101 through 200 wrote this letter to the editor of the Los Angeles Times, wherein it was published on January 28, 1979:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201cSetting the Record Straight</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201cThe article regarding a controversial land swap between the Beverly Hills City Council and a developer of luxury condominiums (\u2018Land Swap Stirs Up Beverly Hills\u2019 by Sam Kaplan, Dec. 26) missed the point entirely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">\u201cTo set the record straight:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">\u201cWhile the area in contention\u2014adjacent to Beverly Hills\u2019 civic center\u2014is known as the industrial area, it also houses the city\u2019s vital municipal services facilities. It is the site of the city\u2019s refuse transfer station, vehicle maintenance garages and all the other indispensable operations that make a city function. It is also the site of a water treatment plant that the city council abandoned in 1976.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">\u201cThis action was followed by the council\u2019s abandoning the city\u2019s own water wells in the midst of the recent drought. It was this incredible move that caused a number of citizens to become suspicious of the council\u2019s motives. Beverly Hills residents were thus forced to become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>completely dependent upon one very expensive source of water, that supplied by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Even the MWD\u2019s general manager advised the city against this decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201cNevertheless, this was done despite the fact that in 1974 the voters of Beverly Hills had passed, by a two-thirds majority, a $3.75 million bond issue to refurbish the city\u2019s water wells and treatment facilities. The only council member opposed to the bond issue and retention of the city\u2019s wells was Richard Stone, an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cMysteriously, one week after the voters approved the refurbishing of their water system, the city announced that its cost projections to revitalize the wells were $5 million short. Amazingly, a year later the claim went up to $12 million more than the voter-approved bonds. But, without asking the voters again, in December, 1976, the council closed down the wells and sold off the land on which they were located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201cNot until April 12, 1977, did Richard Stone, at that time the mayor of Beverly Hills, reveal that David Rowen, representing a developer, had become a client of Stone\u2019s. The abandoned treatment plant is now earmarked for the developers in a landswap deal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Further it is alleged: The letter referred to plaintiff as the \u201cdeveloper\u201d (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 460) and was intended and reasonably understood to mean that plaintiff \u201chad (a) conspired for a period of years with Councilman Stone to cause the City to abandon its water well system in order to make the water treatment plant obsolete and allow [plaintiff] to acquire the property on which the water treatment plant was located for [plaintiff\u2019s] private gain and (b) conspired to commit, and did commit, the crimes of bribery and corruption.\u201d The letter \u201cas applied to [plaintiff], is false\u201d and omits facts that, if included, \u201cwould not have caused the readers ... to believe that plaintiff had acted as intimated in the [letter].\u201d Harris wrote the letter \u201ceither intentionally knowing it was false or with reckless disregard for\u201d truth. She did it \u201cto injure [plaintiff] and stop any development by it\u201d and was \u201cmotivated by malice and ill will toward plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Was the letter libelous? Clearly it permits a nondefamatory interpretation. The facts that in April 1977 plaintiff \u201chad become a client of [council member] Stone\u201d (who in 1974 had opposed retention of the city\u2019s wells), that in 1976 the wells and water treatment plant were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>abandoned, and that in 1979 the treatment-plant site was \u201cearmarked for the developers [plaintiff] in a landswap deal\u201d do not necessarily imply wrongdoing. There is no explicit statement that Stone had represented plaintiff for any substantial period before April 1977 or was improperly influenced by plaintiff in his handling of city affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Nonetheless a writing\u2019s susceptibility to innocent meaning does not in itself preclude a finding that an ordinary reader would understand it in a libelous sense. <em>(MacLeod </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 536, 546-551 [343 P.2d 36]; see <em>Forsher </em>v. <em>Bugliosi </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 792, 803, 805 [163 Cal.Rptr. 628, 608 P.2d 716].) To show libelous meaning, plaintiff alleges by way of innuendo that the letter was understood to mean that plaintiff \u201cconspired\u201d with Stone to cause the city to abandon its wells so as to make the treatment plant obsolete and allow plaintiff to acquire the site \u201cfor private gain,\u201d and that plaintiff \u201cconspired to commit, and did commit, the crimes of bribery and corruption.\u201d  However, \u201cit is not the purpose of an innuendo to \u2018beget an action\u2019, and the meaning of the language complained of may not be enlarged or extended thereby. [Citations.] In other words, it is the office of the innuendo to merely explain or interpret, without enlarging, the alleged libelous publication.\u201d <em>(Bates </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1931) 213 Cal. 438, 442-443 [2 P.2d 383].)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Here, plaintiff\u2019s innuendo allegations are not supported by the letter\u2019s words. The implications deprecatory to plaintiff are mere opinion, not libelous.  \u201cAn essential element of libel ... is that the publication in question must contain a false statement of <em>fact. . . . </em>This requirement ... is constitutionally based. The reason for the rule, well stated by the high court, is that \u2018Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea. However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of other ideas.\u2019 <em>(Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 339-340, fn. omitted ....)[)!] The critical determination of whether the allegedly defamatory statement constitutes fact or opinion is a question of law. [Citations.] The distinction frequently is a difficult one, and what constitutes a statement of fact in one context may be treated as a statement of opinion in another, in light of the nature and content of the communication taken as a whole. Thus, where potentially defamatory statements are published in a public debate, a heated labor dispute, or in another setting in which the audience may anticipate efforts by the parties to persuade others to their positions by use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole, language which generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>might be considered as statements of fact may well assume the character of statements of opinion.\u201d <em>(Gregory </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 596, 600-601 [131 Cal.Rptr. 641, 552 P.2d 425].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><em>Gregory </em>also confirms that, short of accusations of crime or personal dishonesty, the First Amendment protects even sharp attacks on the character, motives, or moral qualifications of \u201ca public officer or ... an active participant in a labor dispute.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 604.) There is an analogous leeway for criticism of an individual who voluntarily injects himself or herself into public controversy and so becomes a \u201cpublic figure.\u201d (See <em>Vegod Corp. </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 763, 767, 769 [160 Cal.Rptr. 97, 603 P.2d 14].)  Plaintiffs participation here made it a public figure. <em>(Greenbelt Pub. Assn. </em>v. <em>Bresler </em>(1970) 398 U.S. 6, 8-9 [26 L.Ed.2d 6, 11-12, 90 S.Ct. 1537] (developer seeking variances to build high-density housing \u201cclearly fell within even the most restrictive definition of a \u2018public figure\u2019\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">By those standards the Harris letter is not defamatory. It does criticize abandonment of the wells and treatment plant as unwise, \u201cincredible,\u201d a product of \u201csuspicious\u201d motives, and a flouting of the voters\u2019 wishes. It reports Councilman Stone\u2019s April 1977 revelation that he had become plaintiffs attorney but asserts no conduct by Stone other than his being the only council member to oppose the water-supply bond issue three years earlier. The implication that he and other council members were motivated by selfish interest rather than the public good is well within the bounds of protected political debate. <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 277, 289-291 [112 Cal.Rptr. 609].) A statement regarding (1) a public official\u2019s business, social, or political affiliations, and (2) how those affiliations seem reflected in decision-making hardly constitutes a libelous charge of bribery and corruption. A contrary ruling would inhibit a significant segment of the discourse vital in a democracy. (See <em>Desert Sun Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 49 [158 Cal.Rptr. 519]; <em>Sierra Breeze </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 86 Cal.App.3d 102 [149 Cal.Rptr. 914].)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Plaintiff argues that the letter\u2019s title (\u201cTo Set the Record Straight\u201d) and the words \u201cmysteriously\u201d and \u201camazingly\u201d in its next-to-last paragraph suggest that the writer knew of unstated improprieties between plaintiff and Stone. (See Rest.2d Torts, \u00a7 566 (\u201ca statement in the form of an opinion ... is actionable only if it implies the allegation of undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>closed defamatory facts as the basis for the opinion\u201d).) The letter\u2019s apparent aim, though, was to disclose whatever pertinent facts were known to the writer. \u201cMysteriously\u201d and \u201camazingly\u201d suggest that she did not have knowledge of underlying reasons for the council\u2019s actions, though the words also may imply an opinion that the reasons might be subject to severe criticism if revealed. Rather than implying unstated facts, the letter seems \u201ccautiously phrased in terms of apparency.\u201d <em>(Gregory, </em>supra, 17 Cal.3d at p. 603; <em>Information Control Corp. </em>v. <em>Genesis One Computer Corp. </em>(9th Cir. 1980) 611 F.2d 781, 783 (California law).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><em>Good Government Group of Seal Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 672 [150 Cal.Rptr. 258, 586 P.2d 572] is distinguishable. Defendants there stated that plaintiff and other council members \u201cextorted by blackmail $100,000 from [a developer]\u201d in exchange for concessions to the city. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 678.) This court pointed out that, though some charges of \u201cblackmail\u201d may in context not be susceptible of libelous interpretation <em>(Greenbelt Pub. Assn. </em>v. <em>Bresler, supra, </em>398 U.S. 6), the Seal Beach publication could be found defamatory because it omitted the fact that the $100,000 was paid to the city rather than to plaintiff and his colleagues. (22 Cal.3d at pp. 681, 683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Third Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The third cause alleges that Okun and Does 201 through 300 wrote an open letter to the mayor that was published in the Beverly Hills Courier on October 13, 1978. Only the last six of the letter\u2019s twenty-four paragraphs are alleged to be libelous. The first 18, incorporated as an exhibit, address the merits of the controversy alleged in the first cause of action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The last six state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cThe entire industrial zone scenario reads uncomfortably like a John D. MacDonald novel of Florida land wheeler-dealers mired up to their necks in deception of the public. [If] One of our elected officials has already disqualified himself from voting because of real or potential conflict of interest. [II] You [Mayor Tilem] have now exhibited prejudice publicly to those in opposition and should disqualify yourself, [IT] One of the three council-members left is a real estate developer, obviously sympathetic to fellow builders and realtors, though he has no business interests in the city. [II] That leaves two, and we elected five to the council to represent us. [11] Isn\u2019t it time to remove the clouds of suspicion, innuendo, rumor, secret talks and shrouded negotiation and return the matter to the people in the form of a referendum?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The innuendo pleading is directed solely at the first sentence, concerning the John D. MacDonald novel. It is alleged that the novel, titled <em>Condominium, </em>\u201cis about a fictional company, the Marliss Corporation, which bribes public officials and engages in other illegal activities so that it can build dangerously defective buildings.\u201d Okun\u2019s letter is alleged to have referred to plaintiff as the \u201cFlorida land wheeler-dealers\u201d and to have been intended and reasonably understood as meaning that plaintiff \u201cwas engaging in illegal and collusive activities similar to those of the Marliss Corporation in Condominium.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>allegations of falsity, omission of material facts, and malice are parallel to those in the second cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Clearly the letter\u2019s statement about the novel is one that \u201cassume[s] the character ... of opinion\u201d when \u201cpotentially defamatory statements are published in a public debate, a heated labor dispute, or in another setting in which the audience may anticipate efforts ... to persuade ... by use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole\u201d <em>(Gregory, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 601). Though perhaps it imputes vigorous lobbying to plaintiff and denounces plaintiff\u2019s project as inimical to the city\u2019s interest, the letter cannot fairly be read as charging bribery or other crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Fifth Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The fifth cause (\u201cConspiracy to Commit Libel\u201d) alleges that beginning in January 1978 Harris, Ruden, Okun, and Does 401 through 500 \u201cconspired to discredit [plaintiff] and destroy its reputation in the community for the purpose of stopping any development by [plaintiff],\u201d that they did the acts described in the first, second, and third causes of action (incorporated by reference) in furtherance of the conspiracy, and that they \u201cwere motivated by malice and ill will toward [plaintiff].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">A complaint for civil conspiracy states a cause of action only when it alleges the commission of a civil wrong that causes damage. Though conspiracy may render additional parties liable for the wrong, the conspiracy itself is not actionable without a wrong. <em>(Unruh </em>v. <em>Truck Insurance Exchange </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 616, 631 [102 Cal.Rptr. 815, 498 P.2d 1063]; <em>Chicago Title Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Great Western Financial Corp. </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 305, 316 [70 Cal.Rptr. 849, 444 P.2d 481]; <em>Pettitt </em>v. <em>Levy </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 484, 491 [104 Cal.Rptr. 650].) Accordingly the demurrer to the fifth cause should have been sustained if no actionable conduct is alleged in the first, second, or third causes. Having established the insufficiency of the second and third, we turn to the first.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The statements that the first cause identifies as libelous appear in an \u201cArgument Against Proposition B\u201d allegedly prepared by Harris, Ruden, and Does 1 through 100 and included in the \u201cSample Ballot and Voter Information Pamphlet\u201d mailed to the voters in connection with the election on March 6, 1979. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>\u201cArgument Against Proposition B</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cBeverly Hills has only one Industrial Area to sustain us as an independent city. <em>We must keep it for our community needs and not allow it to be zoned away.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\n<em>\u201cVote No on Proposition B.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">\u201cWe need a place for police cars, carpentry and paint shops, city truck maintenance, park equipment, trash disposal, water facilities and other lifeline services essential to our community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">\u201cThese indispensable city services enable Beverly Hills to operate efficiently and at low cost. They must be contained in the Industrial Area for they are unpleasant neighbors. <em>We cannot afford to allow developers to take over the only suitable location within our city for these vital needs.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">\u201cEvery citizen approved General Plan designated this land to be saved for municipal and service use. The developers hired one of our Councilmen, subsequently the Fair Political Practices Commission ruled the Councilman had a conflict of interest.

They will sell condominiums at up to $1,000,000.00 each, which the taxpayers will subsidize. They will get city maintained landscaping.

The argument states that the developers (plaintiff) \u201chired one of our Councilmen, subsequently the Fair Political Practices Commission ruled the Councilman had a conflict of interest.\u201d That plaintiff \u201chired\u201d a councilman conveys no more than they formed a business relationship. What of the FPPC ruling? One of the commission\u2019s functions is to issue advisory rulings that concern possible conflict of interest involving state or local public officials. Good faith compliance with a ruling is generally a defense against enforcement of civil or criminal sanctions. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 83114, 87100 et seq.) The fact of a ruling that a councilman had a conflict of interest does not imply that he acted improperly on matters affected by the conflict but only that he was advised against doing so. The ballot argument does not mention bribery or other crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>nal conduct and does not imply undisclosed knowledge of wrongdoing. Like the letters in the second and third causes, the ballot argument could not reasonably have been interpreted by its probable readers as having a libelous meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Sixth Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The sixth cause is for \u201cconspiracy to commit slander.\u201d It alleges that defendants Harris, Ruden, Okun, and Does 501 through 600 \u201cconspired to discredit [plaintiff] and destroy its reputation in the community for the purpose of stopping any development by [plaintiff],\u201d that they \u201cdid the acts described in this Sixth Cause of Action in furtherance of the aforesaid conspiracy,\u201d and that they \u201cwere motivated by malice and ill will toward [plaintiff].\u201d As with the fifth cause, the sufficiency of the sixth depends on whether it alleges actionable wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">It purports to do so only by incorporating paragraphs of the fourth cause. The sole misconduct that those paragraphs allege is the making of a \u201cslanderous statement\u201d by \u201cdefendants does 301 through 400.\u201d There is no allegation of wrongful conduct by any of the defendant-conspirators-\u2014Harris, Ruden, Okun, and Does 501 through 600. Accordingly, the sixth cause fails to state a claim against any defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Though that defect regarding parties requires sustaining the demurrer to the sixth cause, it might not preclude an amendment identifying some individual as both one of the Does 501 through 600 and one of the Does 301 through 400. (See <em>Marasco </em>v. <em>Wadsworth </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 82 [145 Cal.Rptr. 843, 578 P.2d 90]; <em>Smeltzley </em>v. <em>Nicholson Mfg. Co. </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 932 [136 Cal.Rptr. 269, 559 P.2d 624, 85 A.L.R.3d 121]; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Insurance Co. </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 596 [15 Cal.Rptr. 817, 364 P.2d 681].) Thus we consider whether the fourth cause sufficiently alleges actionable wrongdoing by Does 301 through 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">The sole purportedly wrongful act charged appears in this allegation: \u201c[Plaintiff] is informed and believes and, based on such information and belief, alleges that within one year last past, defendants Does 301 through 400, inclusive, made the following oral statement (the \u2018Slanderous Statement\u2019): that [plaintiff] had entered into a corrupt relationship with Councilman Stone, and Stone, pursuant to this arrangement, had improperly influenced the City Planning Commission and staff and the City Council in order to favor [plaintiff] in zoning and land trades with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the City and had unlawfully used his influence as a City. Councilman for the private gain of [plaintiff]. Defendants Does 301 through 400, inclusive, made the Slanderous Statement to members of the Beverly Hills community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">By way of innuendo it is alleged that the \u201cSlanderous Statement\u201d was intended and understood to mean that plaintiff \u201chad committed the crimes of bribery and corruption.\u201d Falsity and malice are alleged in the same manner as in the second and third causes of action, except that there is no allegation of omission of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Defendants contend the allegation of slander is fatally inexact as to time and place of utterance and persons addressed. Yet the pleading does seem certain enough in those respects.  Less particularity is required when it appears that defendant has superior knowledge of the facts, so long as the pleading gives notice of the issues sufficient to enable preparation of a defense. <em>(Bradley </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>(1973) 30 Cal.App.3d 818, 825 [106 Cal.Rptr. 718]; <em>Schessler </em>v. <em>Keck </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 827, 835 [271 P.2d 588] (upholding pleading on information and belief).) Nor is the allegation defective for failure to state the exact words of the alleged slander. Notwithstanding an early dictum cited here <em>(Haub </em>v. <em>Friermuth </em>(1905) 1 Cal.App. 556, 557 [82 P. 571]), we conclude that slander can be charged by alleging the substance of the defamatory statement. (See <em>Lipman </em>v. <em>Brisbane Elementary Sch. Dist. </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 224, 235 [11 Cal.Rptr. 97, 359 P.2d 465]; <em>Schessler </em>v. <em>Keck, supra, </em>125 Cal.App.2d 827, 830 (sustaining allegation of statement that \u201cplaintiff was being treated for syphilis ... and ... should not be employed as a cook\u201d); cf. <em>des Granges </em>v. <em>Crall </em>(1915) 27 Cal.App. 313, 315 [149 P. 777] (requiring exact pleading of words of libel).)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Might a trier of fact reasonably find that the alleged statement conveyed a slanderous meaning?<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> More particularly, might a \u201cmember of the Beverly Hills community\u201d properly be found to understand the statement as charging that plaintiff \u201chad committed the crimes of bribery and corruption\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The complaint makes clear that the statement was part of the debate over whether the city should permit plaintiff\u2019s condominium project.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus it was in a \u201csetting in which the audience may anticipate efforts ... to persuade ... by use of epithets, fiery rhetoric or hyperbole\u201d <em>(Gregory, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d at p. 601).  The vague charge that plaintiff \u201centered into a corrupt relationship with Councilman Stone\u201d was not a factual assertion of crime but rather an expression of opinion. In context, \u201ccorrupt\u201d implied moral criticism of objectives and methods, not the occurrence of bribery. Equally deprecatory words often have been ruled nondefamatory in parallel circumstances. <em>(Good Government Group of Seal Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d 672, 678, 681 (\u201cchicanery and machinations\u201d); <em>Gregory, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 596, 599, 603 (labor union officer charged with \u201cseek[ing] personal gain and political prestige rather than [serving] the best interests of the members\u201d); <em>Desert Sun Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>97 Cal.App.3d 49 (\u201cchicanery\u201d); <em>Sierra Breeze </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.3d 102 (charge that county supervisor \u201cvote[d] to squander property tax funds\u201d); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>37 Cal.App.3d 277, 284, 288-291 (city manager said to be not \u201cdedicated to efficiently and honestly administer the affairs of the City\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The charge that \u201cpursuant to this arrangement\u201d Councilman Stone \u201cimproperly\u201d and \u201cunlawfully\u201d influenced the city in favor of plaintiff is merely rhetorical hyperbole. \u201cAn allegedly defamatory statement may constitute a fact in one context but an opinion in another, depending upon the nature and content of the communication taken as a whole.\u201d <em>(Good Government Group of Seal Beach, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d 672, 680.) In <em>Good Government </em>a statement that city council members \u201cextorted by blackmail $100,000 from [a developer]\u201d was held subject to defamatory interpretation because it described a specific incident and failed to explain that the $100,000 was paid to the city. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 681, 683.) Here the use of \u201cimproperly\u201d and \u201cunlawfully,\u201d unadorned by reference to or insinuation of undisclosed knowledge of a particular criminal act, could not be understood to be more than a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>stitutionally protected expression of severe disapproval of noncriminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Leave to Amend?</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">On the sustaining of demurrers to the second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action should plaintiff be given leave to amend? Sufficiency of the second, third, and fifth causes turns on the presence of libel in two letters and a ballot argument. Each of those documents is nonlibelous when read in light of circumstances alleged here that would have to be considered even if omitted from an amended pleading <em>(Reichert </em>v. <em>General Ins. Co. </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 822, 836-837 [69 Cal.Rptr. 321, 442 P.2d 377]). Accordingly, leave to amend those three causes should be denied because \u201cthere are no circumstances under which an amendment would serve any useful purpose\u201d <em>(Routh </em>v. <em>Quinn </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 488, 493-494 [127 P.2d 1, 149 A.L.R. 215]) and \u201cspeedy resolution of cases involving free speech is desirable\u201d to avoid \u201ca chilling effect upon the exercise of First Amendment rights\u201d <em>(Good Government, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 685).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The sixth cause, on the other hand, turns on the allegedly slanderous nature of an oral statement that is set forth only in substance. Though the statement as presently pleaded could not be found defamatory, the form of the sixth cause does not preclude the possibility of an amendment that would allege slander in furtherance of the conspiracy charged against Okun, Harris, and Ruden. Leave to amend thus should be granted.  <em>(Youngman </em>v. <em>Nevada Irrigation Dist. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 240, 245 [74 Cal.Rptr. 398, 449 P.2d 462] (\u201cIf there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action, it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend\u201d); <em>MacLeod </em>v. <em>Tribune Publishing Co. </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 536, 542 [343 P.2d 36]; <em>Lemoge Electric </em>v. <em>County of San Mateo </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 659, 664 [297 P.2d 638] (\u201cgreat liberality should be exercised in permitting a plaintiff to amend\u201d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Let a peremptory writ issue, directing respondent court (1) to vacate its order overruling petitioners\u2019 demurrers to the second, third, fifth, and sixth causes of action, and (2) to issue an order sustaining the demurrers to the second, third, and fifth causes of action without leave to amend and sustaining the demurrers to the sixth cause of action with leave to amend.

The assertions add nothing to the complaint\u2019s allegations that the statements are false.

[II] If the \u2018doz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>en\u2019 you are referring to are the individuals who have addressed the council on the zoning matter, you are putting down some very fine, dedicated people, including several elected representatives of civic and community-action groups.
