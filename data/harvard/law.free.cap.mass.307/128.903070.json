The auditor found for the plaintiff. The case was tried to a jury upon the auditor\u2019s report and testimony of witnesses, including the plaintiff and the defendant. There was a verdict for the plaintiff. To the denial of a motion of the defendant for a direction of verdict in his favor, the defendant excepted. The sole contention now made by him is that this motion should have been granted, for the reason that the plaintiff as matter of law on the evidence was guilty of contributory negligence. This contention cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The burden of proving contributory negligence of the plaintiff was on the defendant. G. L. (Ter. Bd.) c. 231, \u00a7 85. The auditor, however, found affirmatively in express terms \u201cthat the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care when this accident happened.\u201d This ultimate finding did not purport to be based solely upon the subsidiary findings of the auditor and consequently imported findings of subsidiary facts \u2014 not necessarily inconsistent with express subsidiary findings \u2014 sufficient to support the ultimate finding. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Smith, ante, </em>64.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">There are no express subsidiary findings of the auditor necessarily inconsistent with the ultimate finding \u2014 or the subsidiary findings imported thereby-\u2014that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care. There is no necessary inconsistency between this ultimate finding and the finding that while the plaintiff \u201cwas fully cognizant of the risk incurred by him in the performance of his official duties on this occasion and hence was bound to be on the alert in. looking out not only for his own safety but for that of the public as well, he nevertheless had reason to expect that he would not be exposed to dangers which could have been avoided if proper precautions had been taken, especially when the work of removing the milk wagon from the hole was being done by a person with the defendant\u2019s known experience and achievements in that particular fine.\u201d These findings considered together, do not disclose that the finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care was vitiated by any error of law. A person, though \u201cbound to be on the alert in looking out ... for his own safety\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>may rely to some extent on the expectation that \u201che would not be exposed\u201d by another person \u201cto dangers . which could have been avoided if proper precautions had been taken,\u201d and still be in the exercise of due care. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>197 Mass. 332, 336; <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>231 Mass. 160, 162; <em>Hennessey </em>v. <em>Moynihan, </em>272 Mass. 165, 168. The finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care was not necessarily inconsistent with his having relied to some extent on the defendant\u2019s acting without negligence toward him. And there is no necessary inconsistency between the finding that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care and the findings that \u201cWhen the wagon was being attached to the towing car the plaintiff, in the line and discharge of his duty, had been standing a short distance north of the southerly end of the hole and about three or four feet west of the left side of the wagon. He was then facing the milk wagon and observing the defendant\u2019s movements, but just before the towing car was set in motion his attention was diverted, owing to the fact that some man, whose identity was unknown, approached him and asked a couple of questions. This incident caused the plaintiff to turn his head toward the man who was speaking to him and he did not know that at about the same moment the defendant had set the towing car in motion.\u201d It could not have been ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff was negligent in standing where he did or in permitting his attention to be diverted temporarily in the manner described. See <em>Patrick </em>v. <em>Pote, </em>117 Mass. 297, 301; <em>Gile </em>v. <em>J. W. Bishop Co. </em>184 Mass. 413; <em>Pickwick </em>v. <em>McCauliffe, </em>193 Mass. 70; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>197 Mass. 332, 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The affirmative finding of the auditor that the plaintiff was in the exercise of due care tended to rebut any testimony to the contrary. And the plaintiff was entitled to the benefit of this finding as evidence to be weighed by the jury, even as against his own testimony. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Smith, ante, </em>64. In this state of the evidence it could not have been ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. Whether his testimony, standing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>alone, would require a different conclusion need not be considered. We do not intimate that it would.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
