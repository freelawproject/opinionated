The plaintiff, according to his testimony, was pushing a two wheel empty \u201chand truck\u201d \u201calong a runway.\u201d About fifteen feet behind him the plaintiff saw an employee of the defendant pushing \u201ca steel lunch wagon weighing about five hundred pounds,\u201d food from which was sold by the defendant to its members who worked at the \u201crubber plant\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> where the plaintiff worked. The plaintiff was stopped for about three seconds \u201cat the door of the building\u201d by a fellow employee crossing his path, when the lunch wagon behind him, pushed by the defendant\u2019s employee, hit the back of the plaintiff\u2019s right leg and broke a bone. \u201cIt all happened within two seconds.\u201d The only question raised is whether there was evidence to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\">Despite the lack of precise detail in the record we think that there was enough to support a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by negligence of the defendant\u2019s employee, and that it could not properly be ruled as matter of law that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent. Although there is no description of the \u201csteel lunch wagon\u201d we think it a reasonable inference that such a vehicle used to carry food for sale to workers at a \u201cplant\u201d and being pushed by a man was of such size, shape and construction that it could be handled with reasonable facility and could be turned or stopped to meet such conditions as would be likely to arise where workmen were about. The jury could infer that if the plaintiff was conscious of the presence of the defendant\u2019s employee fifteen feet behind the plaintiff, that employee could have seen the plaintiff fifteen feet ahead of him and could have stopped the \u201clunch wagon\u201d instead of pushing it against the plaintiff, or that if he could not do so he should not have been following the plaintiff so closely. <em>Illinois Central Railroad </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>207 Fed. 311, 314-315. It is not shown that the plaintiff himself was negligent in stopping when a fellow employee crossed his path.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>The analogy between a case like the present and a rear-end collision of two automobiles on the public highway is not a particularly close one, but in so far as it has force this case would seem to resemble <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>R. F. Owens Co. </em>252 Mass. 47, 54, <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>New England Transportation Co. </em>273 Mass. 275, and <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Bragdon, </em>289 Mass. 595, 597-598, rather than <em>Buda </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>302 Mass. 411, and other cases cited by the defendant. Compare <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>298 Mass. 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\">There was no evidence that the defendant was exempt from liability as a charitable corporation, even though it was incorporated under R. L. c. 125 (now G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 180). See <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Massachusetts General Hospital, </em>120 Mass. 432; <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Franklin Square House, </em>200 Mass. 465; <em>Beverly Hospital </em>v. <em>Early, </em>292 Mass. 201, 202, and cases cited. Chapter 125 permitted incorporation for many purposes which were not charitable at all. See the title of the chapter and \u00a7 2. <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Holyoke Young Men\u2019s Christian Association, </em>165 Mass. 280. Moreover it does not appear that the defendant\u2019s employee at the time of the accident was engaged in any charitable activity. So far as appears his work had to do with the seemingly commercial activity of selling food. See <em>McKay </em>v. <em>Morgan Memorial Cooperative Industries &amp; Stores, Inc. </em>272 Mass. 121, 124; <em>Reavey </em>v. <em>Guild of St. Agnes, </em>284 Mass. 300, 301-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-4\"> The plant of the Plymouth Rubber Company, Inc. \u2014\u2022 Reporter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
