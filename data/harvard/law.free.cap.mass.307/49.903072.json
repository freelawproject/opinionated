The judge found that the collision was caused by negligence of both operators, and therefore judgment was rendered in favor of the then defendant Cambria.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Afterwards the present action of tort, for alleged negligence of Jeffery causing damage to Cambria\u2019s automobile, was tried. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff Cambria for $838.35; but the judge under leave reserved (G. L. [Ter. Ed.] c. 231, \u00a7 120) entered a verdict for the defendant Jeffery on the ground that the earlier judgment had adjudicated that the present plaintiff Cambria through his servant was guilty of contributory negligence, and reported the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">A fact merely found in a case becomes adjudicated only when it is shown to have been a basis of the relief, denial of relief, or other ultimate right established by the judgment. <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Olsen, </em>294 Mass. 507, 509, 510. <em>Tighe </em>v. <em>Skillings, </em>297 Mass. 504, 508. <em>Whittemore </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Falmouth, </em>304 Mass. 72, 74. <em>North Carolina Railroad </em>v. <em>Story, </em>268 U. S. 288, 294. Freeman, Judgments (5th ed. 1925) \u00a7\u00a7 697, 698. Compare on the facts <em>Long </em>v. <em>MacDougall, </em>273 Mass. 386, <em>Browne </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>300 Mass. 107, <em>Gilley </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>94 Vt. 135, and <em>Winters </em>v. <em>Bisaillon, </em>153 Ore. 509, 104 Am. L. R. 968.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The earlier judgment was in effect that Jeffery could not recover against Cambria. The sole basis for that judgment was the finding that Jeffery was guilty of contributory negligence. The further finding that Cambria\u2019s servant was negligent had no effect, and could have none, in producing that judgment. Therefore that judgment did not adjudicate that Cambria\u2019s servant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\n<em>Verdict under leave reserved set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\n<em>Judgment upon the verdict returned by the jury.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
