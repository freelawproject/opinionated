Following the opening address of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the jury, on motion of the defendant the judge directed a verdict in his favor. To this the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">The plaintiff does not here contend that the statement of his counsel to the jury was not a complete statement of the facts on which he relied. See <em>Mulvaney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>293 Mass. 32, 33. His contention here is that an act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>an employee of the defendant which caused his injury \u201cwas within the apparent or real scope of his employment for which the defendant is liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The facts stated by counsel for the plaintiff in his opening address to the jury are here summarized. The defendant owned and operated a \u201ctavern\u201d where alcoholic beverages were sold. The plaintiff entered the' defendant\u2019s \u201ctavern\u201d one evening, purchased a glass of beer, sat down at a table, and drank it. Later he bought another glass of beer, again sat down at the table, and had consumed a part of the beer when he \u201cdozed off to sleep.\u201d Thereupon the bartender, who was an employee of the defendant and in charge of the premises, with another \u201cpatron\u201d of the tavern gathered some papers, placed them under the foot of the sleeping plaintiff, and \u201cstarted a little blaze.\u201d As a result, the plaintiff\u2019s trousers caught fire, his leg was seriously burned, medical attendance was required, and he was unable to return to his work for five weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">At the time of the plaintiff\u2019s injury the defendant\u2019s premises were in charge of the bartender. It does not appear that the defendant was present. There was nothing in the statement of facts made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel in his opening to warrant a finding that the acts of the bartender which caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury had any connection with the work he was hired to do. In doing it he was not acting in the interest or for the benefit of his employer. The act was done solely for a purpose of his own. Since he was not acting within the scope of his employment the defendant was not liable for the consequences of his act. <em>Walton </em>v. <em>New York Central Sleeping Car Co. </em>139 Mass. 556. <em>Bowler </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>162 Mass. 319. <em>Fairbanks </em>v. <em>Boston Storage Warehouse Co. </em>189 Mass. 419. <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Holyoke Machine Co. </em>233 Mass. 573. <em>Ciarmataro </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>275 Mass. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">The alcoholic beverages control commission, established by St. 1933, c. 120, \u00a7 2 (inserted in G. L. [Ter. Ed.] as c. 6, \u00a7 43), was directed by G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 138, \u00a7 24, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 376, \u00a7 2, to make with the approval of the Governor and Council, various \u201cregulations,\u201d including a regulation for the \u201cproper and orderly conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of the licensed business \u201d of selling alcoholic beverages. The plaintiff contends in his brief that the commission had made the regulation that: \u201cNo licensee for the sale of alcoholic beverages shall permit any disorder, disturbance or illegality of any kind to take place in or on the licensed premises. The licensee shall be responsible therefor, whether present or not.\u201d But no mention of the making of such a regulation by the board was included in the opening address of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to the jury, nor does the fact that the commission had made such a regulation appear in the bill of exceptions, which states: \u201cAll the facts and evidence material to the questions involved are herein contained.\u201d Since the record does not show that this regulation was made by the board, we are not called upon to consider what would be the effect of the violation of such a regulation. See <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Pallotta, </em>274 Mass. 110, 113; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>273 Mass. 557, 564; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>158 Mass. 218<em>.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">8<em>.
