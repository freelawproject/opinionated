The respondent set up the agreement as a bar. The judge ruled that the agreement did not prevent the granting of the petition and entered a decree for partition and sale. The respondent appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>It has been frequently stated as a general rule that every cotenant is entitled as a matter of right to a partition, and that one cannot be required to hold a tenancy in common against his consent. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Starbuck, </em>10 Mass. 5. <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>13 Mass. 504. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>170 Mass. 68. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>179 Mass. 200. <em>Cronan </em>v. <em>Cronan, </em>286 Mass. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The effect of an agreement between tenants in common to hold their land for a certain period has not been recently considered by this court. <em>Black </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>1 Pick. 150. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Dewerson, </em>3 Met. 544. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>170 Mass. 68, 69.

Real Property, \u00a7 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The agreement was executed at the time the property was purchased, nearly fifteen years before the filing of the present petition. The premises have been occupied by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>parties and their families, but, as time went on, their relations have become somewhat strained. The agreement fixes no time for its duration. It not only purports to bind the parties while they remain coowners but it may extend to successive purchasers of the interest of each of the parties. If either party desired to sell, she was required to offer to sell to the other party. The latter was not required to purchase on the terms offered and, if she declined, the party desiring to sell must then find a customer for her share. The judge found that the petitioner did not make a reasonable and diligent effort to procure a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser in accordance with the agreement. But, by the terms of the agreement, the customer must not only be willing to purchase the petitioner\u2019s one half undivided interest in the property but he must in addition be willing to purchase subject to the obligations of the agreement in reference to the subsequent sale of his interest. The party not desiring to sell had thirty days after she was notified that a purchaser had been found to accept him \u201cunder the same terms and conditions as the parties hereto may be bounden at the time being,\u201d or to purchase herself at the price that the customer was to pay. It was optional with this tenant whether she would accept the purchaser or buy the share of the selling tenant. If she accepted the purchaser he became bound by the terms of the agreement in selling his share. The party not desiring to sell can thus extend the agreement to successive purchasers. The alienation of the property may be restricted over a long period of years. As a practical matter, the situation is not much different from what it would have been if the agreement expressly provided that there could be no sale without the consent of all tenants in common. The agreement unduly restricts the alienation of the property for an unreasonable length of time. Accordingly, it does not come within the general rule that an agreement postponing partition for a reasonable time will bar partition, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Brasseale, </em>213 Ala. 387; <em>Haeussler </em>v. <em>Missouri Iron Co. </em>110 Mo. 188, and as the operation of the agreement may result in restricting the alienation of the property for years, contingent in sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>stance upon a sale being made with the consent of both parties, the agreement imposing such a restraint upon the alienation of an estate in fee simple for a period beyond that fixed by the rule against perpetuities is contrary to public policy and cannot be enforced. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>18 Pick. 455. <em>Blackstone Bank </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>21 Pick. 42. <em>Gleason </em>v. <em>Fayerweather, </em>4 Gray, 348. <em>Winsor </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>157 Mass. 362, 364. <em>Cushing </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>164 Mass. 287. <em>Southard </em>v. <em>Southard, </em>210 Mass. 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
