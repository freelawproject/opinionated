At the time of the accident the plaintiff was standing on the Bedfern property at about the boundary line between that property and the defendant\u2019s premises. The defendant\u2019s house \u201csat seventeen feet\u201d from that line. The defendant\u2019s employees were shingling the house, and one Oikle, a carpenter in the defendant\u2019s employ, was applying \u201ca . .'. frieze board, which is a piece of wood one inch thick and six inches wide, which runs along the edge of the roof from the back of the roof to the gutter.\u201d The plaintiff saw an object above his head in the air, coming from the direction of the defendant\u2019s house, and \u201cimmediately thereafter he was struck on the head and felled to the ground.\u201d He was unconscious for some period of time. He was assisted by some of the defendant\u2019s employees and later by the defendant, and was taken to a hospital by Oikle, who told a physician who was then present that \u201che thought that a board blew off the roof and hit the plaintiff.\u201d At the time of the accident the wind was blowing from the direction of the defendant\u2019s house \u201charder than usual.\u201d In Boston it was then blowing at a velocity of about twenty-two miles an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">After the plaintiff had regained consciousness he noticed a piece of wood near him on the Bedfern land. It was \u201cabout six inches wide and about fifteen to eighteen inches long, all sides being straight except one side which was diagonal, which formed a point.\u201d On the same day, after the accident occurred, a piece of board was seen on the Bedfern land about two feet from the line. It was \u201ccut at a forty-five degree angle, similar to a mortise board on top of a door casing.\u201d There was blood on this board, and there was a piece of tar paper which had blood spots on it, and also \u201cblood on the ground\u201d of the Bedfern premises \u2018/near the fine.\u201d Before the accident there were no boards or pieces of boards on the Bedfern side, of the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The defendant filed five requests for rulings, the first, third and fifth of which read as follows: \u201c(\u00cd) There is no evidence to warrant a finding that the injuries sustained by the plaintiff resulted from the negligence of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ant. ... (3) The burden of proving negligence is upon the plaintiff, and he has not sustained the burden of showing that the defendant was negligent. ... (5) That a written memorandum of the findings of facts be filed with a decision in this case.\u201d The judge made the following finding: \u201cIn above entitled action enter finding for the plaintiff for $500. Defendant\u2019s requests for rulings #1, 3, 5, denied, #2, 4, allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">In view of what is hereinafter said relating to the denial of the defendant\u2019s first request and of the fact that the judge granted the defendant\u2019s fourth request that \u201cTo establish liability negligence on the part of the defendant must be positively shown, and as matter of law cannot be left to surmise, speculation or conjecture,\u201d a ruling at least sufficiently favorable to the defendant as to the burden of proof (see <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., ante, </em>246, 250), we think there was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s third request.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s fifth request. The judge could not be required to make findings of fact in writing. <em>Castano </em>v. <em>Leone, </em>278 Mass. 429, 431, and cases cited. The case is distinguishable from cases where requested rulings are denied as not being applicable to the facts found and the judge fails to state the facts found upon which the refusals are based. See Rule 27 of the District Courts (1932) as amended October 1, 1937; <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Sparks, </em>306 Mass. 80, 85. In the present case the only obligation resting on the judge was to pass upon pertinent requests for rulings of law and to decide the case. <em>Maglio </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>268 Mass. 135, 137.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">We are also of opinion that the judge did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s first request, set forth above, to the effect that there was no evidence to warrant a finding that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendant. The plaintiff was \u201cnot bound to point out the exact way in which the accident occurred nor to exclude the possibility that it might have happened in some other way than that claimed\u201d by him. He \u201cwas only bound to show in evidence a greater likelihood that . . . [his] injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>'came from an act of negligence for which the . . . [defendant is] responsible, than from a cause for which . . . [he is] not liable.\u2019\u201d <em>Koczur </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>306 Mass. 121, 124. <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Accident Co., ante, </em>246, 250, and cases cited. While the case is somewhat close, we think that it cannot be said that the judge was not warranted by the preponderance of the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom in finding, as he impliedly did by his general finding for the plaintiff, that the injuries sustained were caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence. On all the evidence the judge could find that the plaintiff was struck by a piece of board which had been cut off by the defendant or his employees in the course of constructing his house, and could reasonably infer that it was blown or came from the roof of the defendant\u2019s house as a result of negligence for which the defendant was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
