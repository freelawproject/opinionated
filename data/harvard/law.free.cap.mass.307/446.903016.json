The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on each count but under leave reserved, upon motion of the defendant, the judge ordered that a verdict be entered for the defendant on each count. The plaintiff duly excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">The evidence tended to show the following facts. The plaintiff purchased the real estate involved from the defendant on May 20, 1935, and gave a mortgage back in part payment of the purchase price. At that time the defendant had not received the bill for the taxes for the year 1935, which the mortgage deed provided were to be paid by the plaintiff. The defendant was represented by counsel when the papers were passed. At the request of the plaintiff he promised that the tax bill for 1935 would be sent to the plaintiff when received by the defendant. A similar promise was made later by a clerk employed by the defendant. The plaintiff did not pay the 1935 tax bill, and made no inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>about it when he paid the taxes \u201cfor 1936.\u201d The tax bill for 1935 was not sent to the plaintiff and \u201cthe first he heard about it afterwards was when he received a letter dated March 18, 1937\u201d requesting him to \u201ccome to the defendant\u2019s office\u201d because the 1935 taxes had not been paid; the plaintiff then conferred with his counsel, but so far as appears did nothing more about the matter until after April 3, 1937, when he received a letter from the defendant\u2019s counsel stating that if the taxes for 1935 were not paid on or before April 13, 1937, foreclosure proceedings would be begun. On April 4, 1937, the plaintiff conferred with the defendant\u2019s counsel, who stated that he would give the plaintiff an opportunity to see what he could do about obtaining an abatement of the costs and interest due on the taxes to the city. Thereafter the plaintiff was continually \u201cin conference with . . . [his counsel] and the assessors.\u201d On April 28, 1937, the plaintiff received a letter from the defendant\u2019s counsel containing a copy of a foreclosure advertisement which was published in the Dorchester Beacon. This notice appeared in two issues of that newspaper before it was withdrawn by the defendant upon the payment by the plaintiff of the 1935 taxes, and costs and interest thereon, and costs of the foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">It is unnecessary to consider questions concerning the authority of the defendant\u2019s counsel or employees to make the promises upon which the plaintiff relies, since it is not shown that any of them was supported by consideration. There is nothing to show that, when the papers by which the defendant conveyed the premises involved to the plaintiff and the plaintiff gave the mortgage back were passed, the promise of the defendant\u2019s counsel, that the tax bill for 1935 would be sent to the plaintiff when received by the defendant, was any part of the consideration for the purchase of the real estate by the plaintiff or a condition thereof. Clearly the subsequent promise of the defendant\u2019s employee cannot be said to be other than gratuitous. The record does not disclose that the promise of the defendant\u2019s counsel, to refrain from foreclosing the mortgage until the plaintiff had an opportunity to secure an abatement of the costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>interest due the city on the 1935 tax, was other than one of indulgence which created no liability on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
