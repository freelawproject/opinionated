C. 2947.061,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to wit, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>\u201cThe court shall hear any such motion within sixty days after the filing date thereof and shall enter its ruling thereon within ten days thereafter,\u201d is mandatory, so as to divest of jurisdiction a trial court which fails to comply therewith. We find, however, that the jurisdictional posture of this case is not such as to permit us to resolve this otherwise justiciable issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">It is elementary that every action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest (Civ. R. 17[A], and paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Cleveland Paint &amp; Color Co. </em>v. <em>Bauer Manufacturing Co. </em>[1951], 155 Ohio St. 17), and that one having no right or interest to protect ordinarily may not invoke the jurisdiction of a court. (67 Corpus Juris Secundum 898, Parties, Section 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The issue presented to us is primarily of interest to Cooper and other persons who have been placed under the control of correctional institutions throughout the state. It is their future, and, possibly, liberty which are at stake, yet they do not appear as parties to this action. Instead, we have before us an action initiated by the Superintendent of the Lebanon Correctional Institution, the person entrusted with the <em>care </em>and <em>custody </em>of Cooper. Although not raised by the parties herein, it is essential that we ascertain whether the superintendent, in his official capacity, has sufficient interest in the subject matter of this action to permit him to raise this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">As stated in <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>Morton </em>(1972), 405 U. S. 727, 31 L. Ed. 2d 636, 641: \u201c* * * Where <em>the </em>party does not rely on any specific statute authorizing invocation of the judicial process, the question of standing depends upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>whether the party has alleged such a \u2018personal stake in the outcome of the controversy,\u2019 <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U. S. 186 * * * as to ensure that \u2018the dispute sought to be adjudicated will be presented in an adversary context and in a form historically viewed as capable of judicial resolution. \u2019 <em>Flast </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>392 U. S. 83 * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">An examination of the petition filed reveals no allegation that the superintendent has a personal stake in the outcome of this case. He has no authority or duties other than those conferred by statute, and we find no statute authorizing him to question the jurisdiction of appellee in this instance. The superintendent is entrusted with the \u201ccare and custody\u201d of Cooper, but he has no authority to question an authentic order of a court calling for the release of an individual to the custody of the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The wisdom of this jurisdictional requirement, that a party must have standing to raise an issue, is well illustrated by the instant case. Few cases present a better example of an instance in which the nature of the parties is such as to not assure adjudication in accordance with the historical connotations of the adversary process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">It is an elementary concept of law that a party lacks standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless he has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the subject matter of the action. \"We conclude, therefore, that neither this court nor the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to determine this cause on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In so holding, we intimate no view on the merits of the issue raised, nor on the judgment in <em>State, ex rel. Dallman, </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas, supra </em>(32 Ohio App. 2d 102), which was certified as being in conflict with the decision reached below.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>In accordance with the reasons set forth herein, this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-6\">O\u2019Neill, O.
