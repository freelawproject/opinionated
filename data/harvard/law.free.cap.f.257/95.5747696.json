EVANS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"APY\">A statement of the character and scope of this patent and a description of the infringing fire escape, as well as a carefully prepared opinion by Judge Sanborn, appears in 246 Fed. 947. <em>In view </em>of the description there appearing, it is unnecessary for us to deal with more than one question, that of infringement by the Smyth fire escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Appellant\u2019s principal attack on the decree arises out of the defense of noninfringement, so far as it relates to the ladder which it built on the Smyth building. Agreeing, as we do, with the conclusions of the District Judge, we will briefly consider this phase of the case-. Much of the difficulty in determining this question is due to the use, by expert witnesses and others, of the words \u201ctorsional\u201d and \u201crigidity.\u201d Appellant claims that its ladder has no torsional member, such as is referred to in claim No. 3. In -fact, it claims its ladder is rigid, and a torsional <em>member is </em>required only in a flexible ladder. In other words, appellant claims that the Cowles patent does not cover a ladder that is braced or stayed so as to be rigid.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">It seems to us too much emphasis is placed upon the strict definition of words used by witnesses, as distinguished from the real meaning of the witnesses who testified. For example, rigidity in a ladder is necessarily a relative term. The longer the ladder, and the fewer and less effective the braces, the greater the flexibility, the less the rigidity. The size and character of the material may also affect its rigidity. Likewise the \u201cdevice for aiding in the support of the other side thereof and mechanism co-operating with said last-mentioned supporting device\u201d may well be said to describe a \u201ctorsional member,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>as well as \u201cmeans for twisting the rod,\u201d and this member would nevertheless add to the ladder\u2019s rigidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Appellant\u2019s \u201csleeve,\u201d which passes from the outside to the inner side of the ladder and constructed in the manner disclosed by the testimony, appears to us to be the mechanical equivalent of element 3 in claims 1 and 2, regardless of whether .the witness calls it \u201ca torsional member\u201d or \u201can anti-torsional rod.\u201d- It is worthy of notice that nowhere in the claim does patentee refer to this element as a \u201ctorsional rod.\u201d The only place where the word \u201ctorsional\u201d appears is in claim 3, and there patentee speaks of a \u201crod subject to torsional strain.\u201d The Patent Office, speaking of the Seymour patent, which appellant claims it followed, and referring particularly to this sleeve says: \u201cIt is rather the rigidity of the sleeve which is its distinguishing character.\u201d Of course, the sleeve itself was rigid, and it imparted to the ladder added rigidity. Each step in the ladder contributed likewise to its rigidity.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">But appellant trespassed on patentee\u2019s rights when it adopted the means that, incidentally perhaps, added rigidity to its ladder, but clearly, and as we think purposely, provided a supporting device for the other side of the ladder, just as was described by Cowles in his patent. Rigidity as such was obtainable in many ways. If it was rigidity alone that appellant sought, it was most unfortunate in adopting the means pre-empted by appellee. Results, other than rigidity, which the testimony indicated were extremely desirable, were accomplished by these means which Cowles covered by his patent, and appellant cannot well complain when adjudged a trespasser for using this one \u201cmeans\u201d or its equivalent, out of the dozens th\u00e1t were open to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The experiments made by plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses with the Smyth structure prove only too conclusively that the \u201csleeve\u201d which appellant used served the same object and was for the same purpose as the \u201cmeans for supporting the other side thereof\u201d described and defined in the Cowles patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">By r\u00e9ason of the particular \u201cmeans for supporting the other side thereof\u201d described in the third claim of the patent, we conclude there is no infringement thereof disclosed by appellant\u2019s fire escape constructed on the Smyth building.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The decree is modified, so far as it adjudges appellant to have infringed claim 3 of the patent by the so-called Smyth structure, and, as modified, is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
