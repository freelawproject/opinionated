At the same time the tug Gallagher was also approaching Throgg\u2019s Neck from New York. She had in tow five light sand scows arranged tandem .in such wise that from the bow of the tug to the end of the last boat' was not over 700 feet. Simultaneously the tug O\u2019Brien, with one boat- on a hawser (length of tow measured as above not over 300 feet), was traveling in the same direction as the Gallagher, slightly astern of that tug\u2019s tow, and overtaking the Gallagher rather rapidly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b740-12\">For the -heaviest vessels of this flotilla the channel off Throgg\u2019s Neck is upwards of three-eighths of a mile wide, and all boats either entering or leaving Long Island Sound and following the customary channel must round the red buoy off Throgg\u2019s Neck. The Gallagher and P\u00e9rth Amboy saw each other timely and agreed to pass starboard to starboard. Consequently the Gallagher kept as close\u2019to the Throgg\u2019s, Neck side of the channel as was proper and rounded the red buoy close to; but the Perth Amboy scarcely changed her course. She did go slightly to port, but substantially navigated as she would have done, had neither the Gallagher nor the O\u2019Brien been about to pass her. Some time after the exchange of whistles between Perth Amboy and Gallagher, similar whistles were blown by the Perth Amboy and O\u2019Brien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b740-13\">While rounding the red buoy aforesaid, the wind naturally caused the light tow of the Gallagher to stream over toward the Perth Amboy\u2019s course, while the same wind, acting on the Perth Amboy\u2019s tow before she rounded the buoy,' tended to keep that tow in line with its own tug. Thus, while the tugs Perth Amb\u00f3y and Gallagher passed each other with a good clearance, their tows were bound to pass by a comparatively small margin, and there was nothing to prevent the O\u2019Brien perceiving that such would be the case. Nevertheless the O\u2019Brien did not keep behind the Gallagher, but continued into the narrow, and probably narrowing, channel way between the two tows. In result her tow came in collision with one of the boats in charge of the Perth Amboy, both vessels were injured, and these libels were filed to recover damages therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b740-14\">The Perth Amboy and her tow are owned by the same corporation. The court below held the Perth Amboy solely at fault, and dismissed the libel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>her owners, and sustained that of the owner of the O\u2019Brien\u2019s tow against the Perth Amboy alone. Thereupon the owner of the latter tug took these appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b741-4\">Harrington, Bigham &amp; Englar, of New York City (George E.

She sought and understood the intention of both the Gallagher and O\u2019Brien. There was no reason why she should not have given them both room to make a starboard to starboard passage; there was plenty of water and plenty of time. A majority of this court, however, are also of opinion that the O\u2019Brien was at fault, because she saw, or ought to have seen, that the Perth Amboy was not giving her as much room as she needed under existing conditions of wind and tide, there was no reason for her endeavoring to pass the Gallagher while rounding Throgg\u2019s Neck, and she therefore navigated negligently under the circumstances in endeavoring to pass between the two other tows. It is a ease of close shaving, and The Volunteer, 242 Fed. 921, 155 C. C. A. 509, is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">The decrees appealed from are modified, so as to hold the O\u2019Brien also at fault, and the causes remitted, with directions to enter decrees not inconsistent with this opinion. The appellant will recover the costs of this court</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
