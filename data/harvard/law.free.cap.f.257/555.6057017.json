The collector made default, and the Delaware &amp; Hudson Company moved to dismiss the bill on various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>grounds not necessary to mention, which motion the District Judge granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Our decision in Rensselaer &amp; Saratoga R. R. Co., v. Irwin, 249 Fed. 726, 161 C. C. A. 636, and the decision of the Court of Appeals of the state of New York in Rensselaer &amp; Saratoga R. R. Co. v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Co., 217 N. Y. 692, 112 N. E. 1072, which were the subject of discussion on the argument may be referred to. We see nothing in the latter decision to prevent the courts of the state of New York determining the controversy as to. future dividends between the corporations and that with the collector too (if he should not remove the case under section 33 of the Judicial Code [Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1096, Comp. St. \u00a7 1015]), as a new question; but as it depends wholly upon the construction of the lease executed hy the Rensselaer &amp; Saratoga Railroad Company to the Delaware &amp; Hudson Company May 1, 1871, and both parties are citizens of the state of New York, we have no jurisdiction of the present suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The court below is therefore directed to dismiss the bill without prejudice against the defendant Delaware &amp; Hudson Company.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
