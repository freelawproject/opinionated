Robinson, 245 Fed. 556, 569, 158 C. C. A. 22), was decided by that court, and is now brought before us by this appeal. A mere statement of our conclusions must suffice. It will be sufficiently intelligible, by reference to the former opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">The letter and transfer of September 29, 1914, and the acceptance by Robinson, are now claimed by his assignee to have constituted a cancellation in prsesenti of the contract of July, 1908, operating only against royalty thereafter accruing, and are claimed by the Miami Company to have been a rescission ab initio, or else to have been wholly ineffective because tendered as the latter and accepted as the former, without meeting of minds. For convenience, we denominate the first of these two conflicting theories as \u201ccancellation\u201d and the second as \u201crescission.\u201d The documents are not necessarily inconsistent with an intent to tender rescission, but the whole record does not justify that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The reasons supporting this conclusion are: (a) There is nothing improbable in supposing that the company would be willing to lose what it had invested and take its chances on being compelled to pay royalty until September 29, if it could escape future royalty and get rid of the relations with Robinson, (b) No grounds for rescission existed or had been claimed; and the letter states no claim of cause for rescission, but only alleges breaches which would justify cancellation, (c) The letter demands no repayment of the consideration paid (except remotely under the name of damages for breach), (d) The company\u2019s amended answer did not allege rescission, but only \u201crenouncement,\u201d and did not ask relief appropriate to rescission, (e) Upon the trial, both parties and the court treated the transaction as a cancellation, and neither by assigned error or by brief or argument in this court did the company complain; on the contrary, it acquiesced in the theory that, if it was liable at all, its liability ceased on September 29. (f) Even in the company\u2019s application for rehearing in this court, upon the former appeal, the theory of cancellation seems to be depended upon, and the theory of rescission is, at best, only suggested. Not until the court below, after remand, was asked to enter final decree, was the defense of rescission ever distinctly and clearly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Such circumstances as indicate\u2014and there are some which do \u2014the intent to tender rescission are, we think, overborne by these facts just recited. In any event, it is clear that the tender was\u2014at best for defendant\u2014ambiguous, and was open to be interpreted as a cancellation. Robinson did so interpret it, he accepted it under such interpretation, and he continued to act under that interpretation during the remainder of the litigation, and, apparently still acting thereunder, sold his interest to Allen. During all this time, the company was bound to know that its offer was capable of being considered a cancellation, and that Robinson was so considering it and was acting accordingly thereon. Upon the ordinary principles of estoppel, the company cannot now claim that its offer should receive the other construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> During the progress of this litigation, each party has assumed positions inconsistent with its former action, and it is impossible to give effect to all these shifts. By its application for rehearing on the former appeal, the company impressed upon us the injustice of compelling' it to continue bound by the contract after cancellation; now it wishes us to find that there had been no cancellation and that it is still bound. It calls our attention to the fact that, in opposing this application, Robinson\u2019s counsel denied that he hacFaccepted the offer of September 29. Perhaps this denial was not seriously intended; perhaps it can be explained because of some misunderstanding; but, in any event, it was wholly ineffective. When Robinson, at the end of the first trial, claimed a decree upon the theory that his right to royalties continued until September 29, and then ceased because this cancellation had been made, and when he obtained the decree based on that theory, and successfully maintained it on appeal, he thereby accepted the offer as upon that theory, there was a cancellation by mutual consent, and the subject was closed. It became Robinson\u2019s duty to retransfer whatever of value, if anything, remained with him and to which he was not entitled. This he (by his assignee) has now done, by surrendering the right to recover damages and profits accruing before September 29 from infringement by others. This was belated, but the statute of limitations has not run, and nothing has been lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">From these considerations, all of which appear without dispute, it is evident that the decree below was right in its substantial result; and it is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
