At the oral argument, counsel properly conceded that, if the statute applied to foreign corporations, \u201cthe debt or judgment\u201d specified in the statute must be limited to a debt incurred in Montana or a judgment based thereon; otherwise, the act would'be clearly unconstitutional, as Montana is without power to make Illinois directors of a South Dakota corporation liable upon a debt incurred in Missouri to a Missouri corporation.' That the judgment was rendered in Montana raises no presumption that the debt was there incurred. Proof of this fact would be essential; the fact itself must therefore be alleged in the declaration.
