At the close of plaintiffs case, the Special Civil Part judge dismissed the complaint, concluding that plaintiff failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that Luis \u201coccupied\u201d defendant\u2019s premises. <em>We </em>affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Defendant and her grandchildren are the only \u201coccupants\u201d named in her written lease with plaintiff. On December 14,1995, defendant\u2019s twenty-six year-old son, Luis, was charged with pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>session of heroin, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:35-10a, and remaining in an area for the purpose of illegally obtaining heroin, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-2.1b. The arrest occurred approximately one block away from defendant\u2019s apartment, but apparently in the same apartment complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On March 12, 1996, plaintiff served defendant with a \u201cNotice Terminating Lease\u201d which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">You have permitted Luis Alicea, while an occupant of your premises, to engage in DRUG RELATED ACTIVITY upon the leased premises. Such activity occurred on December 14, 1995, wherein Luis Alicea was arrested and charged with Possession of Heroin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">During trial, plaintiff called the police officer who arrested Luis. He testified that upon Luis\u2019 arrest he stated he lived in defendant\u2019s apartment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff also presented its realty manager who resided in an apartment near defendant\u2019s. She testified that, during the time of Luis\u2019 arrest she observed Luis enter and leave defendant\u2019s apartment \u201cevery day.\u201d She was asked: \u201cSo he was <em>visiting </em>there every day until last week?\u201d (emphasis added), and she responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Under <em>N.J.SA </em>2A:18-61.1(p), a tenant may be evicted if the landlord establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the tenant has committed a drug offense under the CDRA \u201cwithin or upon the leased premises or the building or complex of buildings and land appurtenant thereto\u201d; or (2) the tenant permits or permitted \u201csuch a person\u201d to occupy the premises \u201ccontinuously or intermittently.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">This provision is part of the Anti-Eviction Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:18-61.1 to -61.12, which is remedial legislation deserving of liberal construction. <em>447 Assocs. v. Miranda, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>522, 529, 559 A.2d 1362 (1989). The Act establishes that \u201ctenants may not be removed from their residential premises except on one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>various enumerated grounds constituting \u2018good cause.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528, 559 A.2d 1362 (quoting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2AH8-61.1). The Act was intended to address the critical shortage of residential housing and to prevent \u201cthe dispossession of tenants who are paying their rent and generally complying with their obligations as tenants.\u201d <em>Riverview Realty, Inc. v. Williamson, </em>284 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 568, 665 A.2d 1150 (App.Div.1995). Thus, it should be construed \u201cso as to allow a tenant to understand what the consequences may be as a result of his or her actions while residing in the leased premises.\u201d <em>Housing Auth. v. Williams, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>561, 565, 623 A.2d 318 (Law Div.1993) (tenant\u2019s conviction for conspiracy to distribute drugs was not a basis to evict under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:18-61.1(n)).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">With these statutory principles in mind, we are satisfied that, to justify the ultimate sanction of eviction under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:18-61.1(p), a tenant must not only \u201cpermit\u201d a drug offender to occupy the leased premises, but must also tolerate the offender\u2019s occupancy of the premises knowing that such person has violated the CDRA. Otherwise, a tenant who has not committed a drug crime, and who does not know that the person who occupies the leased premises has committed such an offense, would be subject to eviction. In essence, the innocent and unknowing tenant would be subject to removal based solely on the criminal act of another. This result obviously runs contrary to the remedial purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">Applying the standard under <em>R. </em>4:37-2(b); <em>see also Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 535-36, 666 A.2d 146 (1995), we are convinced that the Special Civil Part judge properly granted defendant\u2019s motion for an involuntary dismissal. Accepting plaintiffs argument that Luis\u2019 statement to the police about his residence raised a legitimate inference that he \u201coccupied\u201d defendant\u2019s apartment on December 14, 1995, the day of his arrest, it does not logically follow that she knew of Luis\u2019 drug arrest and nevertheless countenanced his occupancy in the premises after that date. The record is entirely silent with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>defendant\u2019s knowledge of Luis\u2019 encounter with the law. Moreover, all the realty manager was able to say was that defendant \u201cvisited\u201d defendant\u2019s apartment \u201cevery day.\u201d But this evidence did not support a reasonable inference of Luis\u2019 \u201coccupancy,\u201d which is a \u201c[tjaking possession of property and use of the same; [as in] a tenant\u2019s use of leased premises.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>743 (6th Ed.1991). Nor did this testimony establish defendant\u2019s knowledge of Luis\u2019 arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> Defendant did not object to the testimony on hearsay grounds. <em>See NJ.R.E. </em>801(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\"> Apparently, defendant concedes that Luis committed the drug offense within the \"complex of buildings\u201d in which her apartment building is situate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
