During the visit, either defendant or Ash\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>wife telephoned a nearby convenience store to find out what time it closed. Defendant and Ash then left the Ash residence and proceeded to the convenience store. According to the proprietor, Ash stood near the register while defendant walked around the store selecting items to purchase. When defendant walked over to the cash register, Ash pulled a handgun and demanded money from the proprietor. Ash grabbed a blue money bag and defendant, allegedly, reached his hand into the cash register and removed money. Both men then fled the market.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The proprietor was able to identify Ash. He was unable to identify defendant but did describe defendant to the police. Ultimately, Ash\u2019s wife turned Ash in to the police. Ash confessed to the crime, led the police to the money bag, and showed them to a nearby river into which he had thrown the weapon. Both the money bag and the weapon were recovered. Ash provided the police with defendant\u2019s name and told them that defendant had given him the gun shortly before they entered the convenience store. Ash also told the police that it was defendant\u2019s idea to commit the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">At trial, the State called the following witnesses: the proprietor; Ash\u2019s wife; a baby-sitter, whom Ash employed after the robbery; Ash\u2019s brother, who observed defendant and Ash using crack cocaine the evening of the armed robbery; and Sergeant Ashbock to whom Ash had given his written confession. The baby-sitter indicated that, after he returned home from the convenience store, Ash gave her $40 to watch his child and that he had a large sum of money. Ash\u2019s brother testified that he saw Ash and defendant smoking crack cocaine outside of his own residence that night and that defendant admitted that he and Ash had committed a robbery. Ash, who pled guilty to armed robbery and was sentenced prior to defendant\u2019s trial, did not testify for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>During the cross-examination of Sergeant Ashbock, defense counsel elicited information that Ashbock had learned during Ash\u2019s confession. The elicited testimony was exculpatory towards defendant. During the redirect of Sergeant Ashbock, the prosecutor elicited, without objection of defense counsel, that, according to Ash\u2019s confession, defendant had supplied the gun that was used in the robbery and that defendant planned the robbery while Ash and defendant were en route to the convenience store.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that the admission of testimony about Ash\u2019s confession was reversible error. Defendant also contends that the failure to object on this point illustrates the ineffective assistance rendered by his counsel. In response, the State contends that the redirect examination of Sergeant Ashbock was permitted because defendant\u2019s cross-examination about Ash\u2019s statement \u201copened the door\u201d to the entire content of the confession, thus rendering the redirect examination a \u201ctag along.\u201d Additionally, the State contends that defendant\u2019s conviction should be affirmed and that any analysis of defense counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness should be decided later in a future proceeding seeking post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment \u201cguarantees the right of a criminal defendant \u2018to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019 The right of confrontation includes the right to cross-examine witnesses.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 <em>U.S. </em>200, 206, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1702, 1706-07, 95 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>176, 185 (1987). This right also extends to criminal defendants facing state prosecution. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 13 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>923 (1965). Admission of a pre-trial confession by a co-defendant violates the accused\u2019s right of cross-examination under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., Bruton v. United States, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>123, 126, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1620, 1622, 20 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>476, 479 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>In <em>State v. Laboy, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 302-305, 637 A.2d 184 (App.Div.1994), this court discussed in detail the interests protected by the Confrontation Clause and particularly noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">Our Supreme Court has taken a parallel course in protecting the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation under New Jersey\u2019s common law. <em>See State v. Maristany, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>299, 627 A.2d 1066 (1993); <em>State v. Manning, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>417, 421-22, 413 A.2d 605 (1980); <em>State v. Young, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>152, 156-57, 215 A.2d 352 (1965); <em>State v. Colon, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 612, 588 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1991), <em>cf. State v. Gross, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>1, 11, 577 A.2d 806 (1990). Indeed, it can fairly be said that the Court has been more protective of the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine than its federal counterpart. Several years before the United States Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Bruton, </em>our Court held that an out-of-court confession of one defendant could not be used against the other and that a limiting instruction would not suffice to eradicate the potential for prejudice as to the non-confessing defendant. <em>State v. Young, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>at 157, 215 A.2d 352.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\"><em>[Laboy, supra, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 304-05, 637 A.2d 184.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We concluded that the admission of an officer\u2019s testimony regarding an out-of-court statement by a co-defendant that incriminated the defendant, \u201cclearly violated [the defendant\u2019s] right of confrontation under the Federal Constitution and New Jersey\u2019s common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305, 637 A.2d 184.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The State argues that <em>State v. Powers, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>346, 370 A.2d 854 (1977), and <em>State v. Abrams, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>232, 356 A.2d 26 (App.Div.1976), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>342, 370 A.2d 852 (1977), permit the use of inculpatory statements against defendant because they are intrinsically intertwined with Ash\u2019s statements against his penal interest. The State\u2019s argument ignores other decisions of this court and the Supreme Court and must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">In <em>State v. Colon, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>608, 588 A.2d 440 (App.Div.1991), the defendant was driving co-defendant\u2019s car at a high rate of speed on the Turnpike when he was pulled over. A state trooper discovered three vials of crack cocaine on the console and then searched the car, finding a bag containing over five pounds of crack cocaine in front of the driver\u2019s seat. Defendant admitted that the three vials of cocaine were his but maintained that he was unaware of the bag of cocaine and had merely agreed to drive the car in exchange for the three vials of crack. At trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>defendant called a police officer who testified that the co-defendant had told him that she, the co-defendant, had purchased the cocaine in the Bronx. The police officer also testified that he discovered that the co-defendant was extensively involved in drug trafficking. Defendant was apparently attempting to demonstrate that he had fallen into the situation innocently. While the co-defendant did not testify, the court admitted these statements as declarations against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">On cross-examination, the officer was asked what the co-defendant had said regarding the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the cocaine, and the officer replied, \u201c[s]he advised me that he knew the cocaine was in the car. He knew the amount of the cocaine and he knew where it was going.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 588 A.2d 440. The State contended that the inculpatory portions of the statement were admissible under the doctrine of continuing trustworthiness as \u201ctag along\u201d pursuant to <em>Abrams, supra, </em>and <em>Powers, supra. </em>We noted that in those cases it was the <em>exculpatory </em>material that was admitted by the trial court. <em>Colon, supra, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 611\u201412, 588 A.2d 440. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">The facts, however, were the converse of those here, where the question addresses the admissibility against defendant of the part of a codefendant\u2019s confession that is inculpatory as to the defendant where defendant had introduced the portion of codefendant\u2019s confession that may exculpate him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">The rationale underlying <em>Powers </em>and <em>Abrams </em>does not lie in the mere fact that the self-incriminatory and the exculpatory statements were made side-by-side. It lies in the fact that the latter was intrinsic to the former. In <em>Abrams, </em>the declarant codefendant, Smith, admitted selling cocaine to an undercover detective but denied that she had obtained the contraband from defendant Abrams. As the Appellate Division said, that exculpatory declaration formed part of the declaration against interest because \u201cit intensifies her personal criminal responsibility for the transaction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 612, 588 A.2d 440 (quoting <em>Abrams, supra, </em>140 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 235, 356 A.2d 26).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">We later concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">We do not overlook the State\u2019s argument that fairness to the prosecution requires that since defendant was permitted to introduce that part of [the co-defendant\u2019s] statement which favored the defense, the incriminating portion should also be received in order to convey the complete meaning of what the declarant was saying. The argument, while superficially attractive, misses the evidential princi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>pie that marks the distinction between the two facets of what [co-defendant] said. On the one hand, we have a statement admitted under an exception to the hearsay rule because of its guarantee of testimonial trustworthiness as a declaration against interest. The theory of trustworthiness which supports the exception is that the statement so far subjects the declarant to criminal liability \u201cthat a reasonable man [woman] in his [her] position would not have made the statement unless he [she] believed it to be true____\u201d [Former] <em>N.J.R. Evid. </em>63(10). The statement inculpating defendant, on the other hand, carries no such guarantee and, in fact, because of its self-serving nature, is presumed to be unreliable, something which is aggravated by the absence of any opportunity for cross-examination. We therefore see no lack of fairness to the State in precluding it from countering a presumably trustworthy statement with one that is presumably untrustworthy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\"><em>[Colon, </em>246 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 613, 588 A.2d 440 (alterations in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">We also noted that former <em>N.J.R.E. </em>63(10) barred the introduction of a declaration against interest \u201cagainst a defendant other than the declarant in a criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614, 588 A.2d 440 (quoting <em>N.J.R.E. </em>63(10)). We concluded that the defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed on these bases. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Current <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(25) contains the hearsay exception for a statement against interest and allows for the admission of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary, proprietary, or social interest, or so far tended to subject declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid declarant\u2019s claim against another, that a reasonable person in declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true. <em>Such a statement is admissible against an accused in a criminal action only if the accused was the declarant</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJz\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">In <em>State v. Maristany, supra, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>at 308, 627 A.2d 1066, a trooper testified at trial that the co-defendant had stated out of court that the defendant had placed a blue bag containing cocaine in the trunk of the car and that the co-defendant was unaware of what was in it. The Supreme Court agreed with the Appellate Division that these statements were \u201crank hearsay\u201d and stated that the \u201cstatement possesses all of the invidious attributes of hearsay. Made after cocaine had been discovered, [co-defendant\u2019s] self-serving, exculpatory statement lacks reliability. Further, the statement serves to incriminate defendant without affording him the opportunity to cross-examine [the co-defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309, 627 A.2d 1066. The Court concluded that the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>of this evidence violated former <em>N.J.R.E. </em>63 and violated the defendant\u2019s fundamental right to confront witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 310, 627 A.2d 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The facts of this case are identical to those in <em>Colon </em>and similar to those in <em>Maristany </em>and <em>Laboy. </em>In each case, a police officer testified regarding a statement made by a co-defendant that tended to inculpate the defendant. In each case, the co-defendant did not testify. In <em>Colon </em>and in this case, the defendant first obtained testimony from the officer regarding statements by the co-defendant which tended to exculpate the defendant. The court in <em>Maristany, Colon, </em>and <em>Laboy </em>all concluded that the admission of the co-defendant\u2019s statements inculpating the defendant was prejudicial error requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The rationale employed in those cases requires the reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. Although defense counsel failed to object, we cannot conclude that the error was harmless. The issue is whether the error is plain error. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2. Plain error is reversible if it is \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also R. </em>1:7-2. The test is whether the possibility of injustice is \u201csufficient to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result that it otherwise might not have reached.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 336, 273 A.2d 1 (1971). Since Ash\u2019s confession, which was not subject to cross-examination, completely undermined the defense offered by defendant, its admission raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the error led the jury to a result that it otherwise might not have reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">We conclude that admitting Ashbock\u2019s testimony regarding Ash\u2019s out-of-court confession clearly violated defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the federal Constitution and New Jersey\u2019s common law, thus warranting reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Even if the error discussed in Part I of this opinion were harmless, it is clear that other judicial error in this trial warrants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. The trial judge\u2019s failure to give a cautionary instruction on the admission of evidence about defendant\u2019s use of crack cocaine on the evening of the armed robbery <em>and </em>the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury properly on accomplice liability and the gradations of robbery are of such magnitude that defendant\u2019s conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">On a motion <em>in limine, </em>defendant\u2019s counsel sought to prevent the introduction of any evidence that defendant and Ash were observed smoking crack cocaine on the evening of the robbery after they arrived home from the convenience store. The State contended that the use of drugs was evidence of motive to commit the crime, i.e., defendant and Ash needed money to purchase drugs. Although on appeal defendant contends that the judge erred in permitting the State to introduce this evidence, the correctness of that contention need not be addressed. The more significant error was the failure of the trial judge, once he decided to admit the evidence, to give the jury any cautionary instruction limiting the use of that testimony as required by <em>State v. G.S., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>460, 678 A.2d 1092 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In <em>G.S., </em>the Supreme Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">There is an unavoidable tension inherent in other-crime evidence. The evidence of other crimes invariably is both probative and prejudicial. The prejudice of other-crime evidence is its tendency to demonstrate a criminal predisposition; therefore, it poses a distinct risk that it will distract a jury from an independent consideration of the evidence that bears directly on guilt itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 468, 678 A.2d 1092 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The Court additionally stressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">The narrow issue, which divided the Appellate Division, is whether, as a result of the trial court\u2019s instructions, the use of that evidence by the jury was improper and prejudicial. Recognizing the special dangers posed by the conflicting impacts of other-crime evidence, this Court has required that when a trial court admits such evidence, <em>the court must specifically instruct the jury about that evidence\u2019s limited relevance.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-12\">[Id. at 469, 678 A.2d 1092 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>G.S. </em>instructs that a reversal is mandated when a limited instruction is not given unless the absence of a limiting instruction is deemed harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 678 A.2d 1092. The courts of this State have often enunciated this principle. <em>See, e.g., State v. Oliver, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>141, 627 A.2d 144 (1993); <em>State v. Cofield, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>328, 605 A.2d 230 (1992); <em>State v. Stevens, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>289, 304, 558 A.2d 833 (1989); <em>State v. Cusick, </em>219 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 467, 530 A.2d 806 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>54, 532 A.2d 1118 (1987). We hold that the failure to give a limiting instruction in this instance was not harmless error. This conclusion becomes clearer when we consider the testimony of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Defendant readily admitted that he was with Ash in the convenience store during the armed robbery. Defendant, however, denied any involvement in the armed robbery and specifically denied having any knowledge that Ash possessed a weapon or intended to use the weapon to rob the convenience store. Defendant\u2019s testimony contradicted the testimony of the victim in some key respects. The victim indicated that defendant did not seem surprised when Ash withdrew the gun, that defendant grabbed money from the cash register, and that defendant fled the store before Ash. Without a limiting instruction, the jury might make the impermissible inference that, as a crack cocaine user, defendant was a \u201cbad person\u201d and not one who should be believed. <em>See Cofield, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 328, 605 A.2d 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Defendant claims that it was plain error for the trial court to fail to instruct the jury on second-degree robbery and to instruct them that defendant must have shared the co-defendant\u2019s specific purpose to use the weapon in order for defendant to be convicted of first-degree robbery. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">The trial judge instructed the jury that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">In order to convict the defendant of the charge of robbery in the first degree, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the following: One, that the defendant was in the course of committing a theft; two, that while in the course of committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>a theft, Jason Ash threatened [the victim] with bodily injury or inflicted bodily injury upon him, three, that Jason Ash was armed with a deadly weapon; four, that the defendant was an accomplice of Jason Ash; and five, that the defendant acted purposely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In <em>State v. White, </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>122, 484 A.2d 691 (1984), the Court was faced with the question of whether an accomplice, not holding a weapon, can be found guilty of an armed <em>Graves </em>Act offense. The Court noted that \u201c[b]y definition an accomplice must be a person who acts with the <em>purpose </em>of promoting or facilitating the commission of <em>the </em>substantive offense for which he is charged as an accomplice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 484 A.2d 691. The Court pointed out that \u201c[f]or both the accomplice and his partner to be guilty, \u2018it is essential that they shared in the intent which is the crime\u2019s basic element....\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Fair, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>77, 95, 211 A.2d 359 (1965)).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The Court further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">An accomplice may be guilty of armed robbery even though he did not personally possess or use the firearm in the course of the commission of the robbery. The accomplice has committed the same crime as the individual who possessed or used the gun if the accomplice had the purpose to promote or facilitate that crime, namely, robbery with the use of a firearm____ One is the alter ego of the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\"><em>[Id </em>at 130, 211 A.2d 359.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The Court also noted that \u201c[i]t is possible for an accomplice to be guilty of robbery and for his compatriot to be guilty of armed robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 211 A.2d 359. In that respect, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">[I]f the accomplice, though found guilty only of robbery, knew or had reason to know before the crime was committed that his partner would possess or use a firearm while the crime was being committed, or during the immediate flight thereafter, the trial court should apply the Graves Act. If the accomplice did not know or have reason to know beforehand that his partner would possess or use a firearm during those periods, then the Graves Act would be inapplicable. The deterrent effect \u2014 the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>\u2014 of the Graves Act is preserved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">\n<em>[Ibid]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">These principles were thereafter applied in <em>State v. Weeks, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>396, 526 A.2d 1077 (1987). In <em>Weeks, </em>there was abundant evidence that the defendant was guilty of robbery based on the defendant\u2019s serving as a \u201cwheel man\u201d in an armed robbery of a bakery. The Court stated that \u201cwhat we find troubling is the fact that the jury may not have known that an essential element of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>accomplice liability charged is that the accomplice share the <em>purpose </em>to commit an <em>armed robbery.\u201d Id. </em>at 405, 526 A.2d 1077. The Court noted that the trial court\u2019s instruction \u201cdid not clearly require the jury to find that defendant had shared the purpose to commit a robbery <em>with a weapon.\u201d Ibid. </em>The Court concluded that the erroneous instruction, along with other trial court errors, required reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 526 A.2d 1077. <em>Accord State v. Bielkiewicz, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>520, 527, 632 A.2d 277 (App.Div.1993); <em>State v. Hammock, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>320, 322, 519 A.2d 364 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Here, each impropriety in the jury charge constitutes plain error, and each omission, independent of the other, requires a reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction because each omission was plain error. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2; <em>see also State v. Martin, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>2, 15, 573 A.2d 1359 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Because of the series of errors we have discussed, we do not find it necessary to consider points five through nine, raised in defendant\u2019s brief on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">We do note, however, as to point five, that <em>N.J.R.E. </em>607 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">Except as otherwise provided by Rules 405 and 608, for the purpose of impairing or supporting the credibility of a witness, any party including the party calling the witness may examine the witness and introduce extrinsic evidence relevant to the issue of credibility____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-11\">[76zA]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">In <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 255, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>203, 133 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>137 (1993), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-15\">That the credibility of a witness may be impeached on cross-examination is well settled. The scope of cross-examination is a matter resting in the broad discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-16\">Cross-examination relating to a witness\u2019s credibility need not be based on evidence adduced at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-17\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-18\">\u201cA party may introduce extrinsic evidence relevant to credibility, whether or not that extrinsic evidence bears upon the subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>matter of the action.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>588, 603, 524 A.2d 826 (App.Div.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In this case, it was the defendant\u2019s counsel who raised the employment issue on direct examination and elicited the testimony that defendant earned between $500 and $600 a week in an apparent effort to demonstrate that the defendant did not have a financial motive for the crime. The State\u2019s cross-examination rebutted this point and was designed to affect the credibility of the defendant. It was not designed to prove that the defendant was indigent and more likely to commit the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Point six addresses allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. We see no useful purpose to parse the record and discuss each particular claim of prosecutorial misconduct. We are satisfied that, prior to the retrial of this matter, the prosecutor will read both the entire record of this trial and defendant\u2019s brief as filed with this court and will thus be made aware of defendant\u2019s particular criticisms. We presume that the prosecutor assigned to the State\u2019s case will adhere to the principles enunciated in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>Ramseur, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>123, 524 A.2d 188 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>947, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2433, 124 L.Ed.2d 653 (1993), the cases cited therein, and Canon 5 of the <em>Canons of Professional Ethics </em>which provides that \u201c[t]he primary duty of a lawyer engaged in public prosecution is not to convict, but to see that justice is done.\u201d <em>See also State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 104-05, 293 A.2d 176 (1972) (citing <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 <em>U.S. </em>78, 88, 55 <em>S.Ct. </em>629, 633, 79 <em>L.Ed. </em>1314, 1321 (1935)).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Additionally, defendant\u2019s contention that he was provided ineffective assistance of counsel (point seven), that the trial judge erred when he imposed sentence without first conducting a separate hearing as to the applicability of the <em>Graves </em>Act (point eight), and that the sentence actually imposed was excessive (point nine), are rendered moot by our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-15\"> It was error to merge count five into count one. A conviction for unlawful possession of a handgun should not merge with robbery while armed with the same gun. <em>See, e.g., State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 22, 510 A.2d 681 (App.Div.1986); <em>State v. Anderson, </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>340, 359, 486 A.2d 1311 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>283, 501 A.2d 946 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-7\"> The victim contended that defendant fled the market first. Defendant testified that Ash fled the market and that he followed Ash.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\"> Although the cross-examination was designed to affect defendant's credibility, we do not wish to imply that the actual questions asked were proper. They were not.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-8\">In defendant\u2019s case, defendant testified on direct examination that at the time of the robbery he was employed and earning approximately $500 to $600 per week. On cross-examination, the prosecutor introduced into evidence a report prepared by the detective who interviewed defendant. The prosecutor asked defendant to read the report. The following colloquy ensued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">Q. Okay, so you would agree that you told the police that you are unemployed at that time, would you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">A. No, I wouldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">Q. So when this document that was a docket report written by a detective in this case indicates that you are were unemployed at that time, that\u2019s inaccurate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">A. Are you asking me a question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">Q. I\u2019m asking if this is inaccurate information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-14\">A. Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-15\">Defendant\u2019s counsel failed to object. This error should not recur at defendant\u2019s retrial. We also note, that defendant has not raised this point on appeal.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
