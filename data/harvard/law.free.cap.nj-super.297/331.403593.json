We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Chez Sez VIII, Inc., t/a United Video, David Porten, t/a Adult Entertainment Center, Hamilton Amusement Center, Inc., t/a Video Express, L.O.J., Inc., t/a The Emporium, and Vito J. Fruggiero, Inc., t/a Red Barn Books (collectively referred to as plaintiffs) are retail book and video stores which sell and rent adult materials including video tapes, as well as provide private viewing booths for such materials. Plaintiffs obtained a judgment declaring <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-12.2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violative of their First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">The challenge to the statute here concerns essentially the provisions relating to booths or enclosures. The Law Division Judge granted preliminary restraints<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against enforcement of the subject statute because he considered it a content based restriction on free expression since it only applied to \u201csexually oriented businesses.\u201d Applying strict scrutiny, the judge concluded that although the statute promoted a significant government interest in reducing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, it was not the least restrictive means of achieving that goal. Additionally, the judge was of the opinion the statute was void for vagueness because ordinary persons would not know which type of booth facilitated sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">On appeal the State essentially argues: (1) the statute is a content neutral regulation, designed to ameliorate secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, and (2) the statute is under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>standable to persons of average intelligence. Alternatively, it argues that if the statute is found to be vague, we should construe it in such a manner as to allow it to stand and excise any constitutional defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Governor Whitman signed into law Senate Bill No. 342 of 1995 (S-342) which, among other things, prohibits in Section 2 <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-12.2) commercial establishments from providing booths or similar enclosures \u201cwhich facilitate sexual activity.\u201d <em>L. </em>1995, c. 167, eff. Sept. 3, 1995. Thus, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-12.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">Sexually oriented businesses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">a.

The Senate Judiciary Committee in considering S-342 was made aware of the substantial public health interests of other states and the means they employed in regulating private enclosures provided by adult entertainment establishments. Essentially, those jurisdictions were concerned with unsanitary conditions and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases fostered by private enclosures in buildings of public accommodation.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Judicial inquiry is limited when reviewing legislative notice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the legislative action was informed by various consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>ations. The Senate Judiciary Committee considered a memorandum by the Chief of the Judiciary Section in the Office of Legislative Services outlining the concern that private booths provided by sexually oriented businesses encourage anonymous sexual activity and are conducive to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. The Legislature was made aware that the Third Circuit recently upheld a Delaware statute regulating such private booths or enclosures in <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n on Adult Entertainment Est., </em>10 F.3d 123 (3rd Cir.1993). Additionally a newspaper article in the <em>Atlantic City Press </em>was brought to the Committee\u2019s attention which described how New Jersey men often enter peepshow booths and gesture through an aperture known as a \u201cglory hole\u201d to an adjoining booth and engage in anonymous sexual acts. It was with this background that the Legislature enacted S-342.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The distinctions between speech and conduct are often difficult to parse, but when conduct is regulated solely because of its expressive attributes the Supreme Court has consistently held the regulation unconstitutional. <em>See e.g., United States v. Eichman, </em>496 <em>U.S. </em>310, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2404, 110 L.Ed.2d 287 (1990) (burning flag); <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., </em>393 <em>U.S. </em>503, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>733, 21 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>731 (1969) (wearing black arm bands); <em>Brown v. Louisiana, </em>383 <em>U.S. </em>131, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>719, 15 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>637 (1966) (participating in a sit-in); <em>Stromberg v. California, </em>283 <em>U.S. </em>359, 51 <em>S.Ct. </em>532, 75 <em>L.Ed. </em>1117 (1931) (flying a red flag). Thus, the First Amendment has been construed by various courts to protect sexually explicit expression of various types. <em>TK\u2019s Video, Inc. v. Denton County, Tex., </em>24 <em>F.</em>3d 705, 707 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n on Adult Entertainment Est., </em>10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>F.3d 123, 130 (3rd Cir.1993); <em>see e.g., Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>560, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2456, 115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>504 (1991) (live nude dancing in adult book store and nightclub). While this form of expression is protected, the protection afforded it has been characterized as \u201conly marginal[ ].\u201d <em>Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., supra, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>at 566, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2460, 115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 511. The Supreme Court in <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>50, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) recognized that \u201cSpecified Sexual Activities\u201d may not be totally abrogated but its protection is \u201clesser [in] magnitude than the interest in untrammeled political debate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2452, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 326. Moreover, a State \u201cmay legitimately use the content of these materials as the basis for placing them in a different classification.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 70-71, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2452, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">A plain reading of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-12.2 makes clear that it does not purport to ban the viewing of sexually explicit material. Rather, it prohibits commercial establishments that offer sexually explicit material for distribution from providing \u201cbooths, screens, enclosures or other devices which facilitate sexual activity by patrons.\u201d N.J.S.A 2C:33-12.2b. On its face the statute is intended to regulate sexual conduct as a health problem, not the materials presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In <em>Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., </em>478 <em>U.S. </em>697, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>3172, 92 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>568 (1986), the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider whether the First Amendment barred enforcement of a statute which authorized the closure of a business that promoted prostitution and lewdness. In <em>Arcara, </em>the defendant was an adult bookstore in New York which provided booths for private viewing of sexually explicit videos. A police officer observed instances of prostitution at the premises and reported that the owners appeared aware of the sexual activity. As a result, a complaint was filed to close the store pursuant to New York Public Health Law \u00a7 2329. New York Public Health Law \u00a7 2320 designated a premises as a public health nuisance when used or maintained for the purpose of lewdness or prostitution. Under \u00a7 2329, a building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>housing a public health nuisance could be closed for up to one year. In rejecting defendant\u2019s First Amendment argument, the Court \u201cunderscored the fallacy of seeking to use the First Amendment as a cloak for obviously unlawful public sexual conduct by the diaphanous device of attributing protected expressive attributes to that conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 705, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3176, 92 L.Ed.2d at 577. The Court held that sexual activity was not absolutely protected and that First Amendment protection did not attach by \u201cmerely linking the words \u2018sex\u2019 and \u2018books.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The Court in <em>Arcara </em>also rejected defendant\u2019s argument that the statutory effect of closing the store for one year impermissibly interfered with its protected right to sell books. <em>Id. </em>at 705-706, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3177, 92 L.Ed.2d at 577. The Court noted that civil and criminal remedies may affect First Amendment protected activities, but the proscription here was less offensive because defendant could sell the materials at other locations absent the nuisance. <em>Id. </em>at 706, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3177, 92 L.Ed.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">When a statute favors one speaker over another, it is a form of content-based regulation. <em>Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>\u2014\u2014, \u2014\u2014, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>2510, 2516, 132 L.Ed.2d 700, 715 (1995); <em>Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>789, 804, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2118, 2128, 80 L.Ed.2d 772, 786 (1984). \u201cThe government must abstain from regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.\u201d <em>Rosenberger v. Univ. of Virginia, supra, </em>515 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 115 <em>S.Ct. at </em>2516, 132 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Under current jurisprudence, a statute aimed directly at the suppression of sexually explicit material is considered content-based and \u201cpresumptively violates the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n Adult Entertainment Est., supra, </em>10 F.3d at 130; <em>see R.A.V v. City of St. Paul, </em>505 <em>U.S. </em>377, 382, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>2538, 2542, 120 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>305, 317 (1992); <em>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., </em>502 <em>U.S. </em>105, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991). A content-based regulation is uneon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>stitutional unless \u201cnecessary to serve a compelling state interest and ... narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\u201d <em>Perry Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Ass\u2019n., </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>37, 45, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794, 804 (1983); <em>see Carey v. Brown, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>455, 461, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2286, 2290, 65 L.Ed.2d 263, 270 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Law Division here was of the opinion that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-12.2 was a content-based regulation because \u201c[t]he plain words of the statute limit its operation to \u2018sexually oriented businesses.\u2019 \u201d The judge deduced that if the statute were content neutral it would apply to all businesses which facilitate anonymous sexual activity and not only those which distribute or make available adult material. Apparently, he believed that the statute was a form of viewpoint discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">However, where the statute\u2019s overall purpose is aimed at the secondary effects of speech, it is considered content neutral and thus scrutinized under the traditional time, place and manner standard. <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n Adult Entertainment Est., supra, </em>10 F.3d at 130; see <em>Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., supra, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>at 566, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2460, 115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 511-512; <em>Renton v.

Content neutral statutes are \u201cthose that \u2018are <em>justified </em>without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., supra, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 48, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 929, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 38 (quoting <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board v.

It did not regulate the content of materials viewed, but was aimed at the incidental effects which result from the use of closed booths, such as the spread of AIDS and other communicable diseases that are the potential product of unprotected sex. The Third Circuit held that the government had a substantial interest in reducing or eliminating private booths which facilitate such sexual activity. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Delaware\u2019s statute expressly stated that it was intended to \u201celiminate the possibility of the spread of, or infection by, communicable diseases.\u201d <em>Del.Code Ann. </em>tit. 24, \u00a7 1631(a) (1992). The statute\u2019s legislative history reflected the Delaware Senate\u2019s concern about \u201canonymous sex,\u201d noting that such activity often took place at adult entertainment establishments and posed a threat to public health, and that private booths were \u201c\u2018little more than masturbation booths\u2019 ...

Therefore, the Third Circuit concluded that the Delaware Legislature\u2019s decision to ban private booths was not \u201ca mere unsupported legislative preference for open booths or because the legislature arbitrarily and irrationally believed that closed booths contribute to a serious health problem.\u201d <em>Mitchell, supra, </em>10 F.3d at 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Likewise the record supports the New Jersey Legislature\u2019s decision to ban booths which facilitate sexual activity in sexually oriented businesses. The Legislature was aware of the dangers to public health, particularly the current concern regarding the spread of AIDS, that such anonymous sexual encounters present, and the measures that other jurisdictions have taken in an attempt to minimize these dangers. <em>Cf. Behringer Est. v. Princeton Med. Ctr., </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>597, 630-631, 592 A.2d 1251 (Law Div.1991) (explaining the transmittal and dangers of Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome [AIDS]). More particularly, the Legislature was cognizant of the fact that private booths which facilitate sexual activity by patrons are conducive to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Accordingly, the Law Division Judge correctly recognized that New Jersey has a substantial interest in eliminating such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>booths that lead to \u201cgenerally unhygienic condition[s]\u201d and transmittal of communicable diseases. The Legislature could take notice of what has occurred in other states and could act on that information without waiting for the collection of similar information in this State from the operation of establishments catering to sexually oriented business. This was a reasonable, if not prudent, exercise of legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The second prong of the <em>Renton </em>analysis requires us to consider whether the enacted regulation is narrowly tailored to the government\u2019s significant interest in public health. <em>See Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., supra, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 52, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 931, 89 L.Ed.2d at 41. In general, where a statute affects speech, as opposed to activity, the means chosen to achieve the government\u2019s interest cannot be substantially broader than necessary. <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 796-800, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2757-2758, 105 L.Ed.2d at 678-680. A content neutral regulation is not tested under the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d standard, but rather the restriction is considered \u201cnarrowly tailored \u2018so long as the ... regulation promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n on Adult Entertainment Est., supra, </em>10 F.3d at 137 (citing <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 799, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2758, 105 L.Ed.2d at 680 (quoting <em>United States v. Albertini, </em>472 <em>U.S. </em>675, 689, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2897, 2906, 86 L.Ed.2d 536, 548 (1985))). \u201c[T]he regulation \u2018need not be the least-restrictive or least-intrusive means of doing so,\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n on Adult Entertainment Est., supra, </em>10 <em>F.3d </em>at 143 (citing <em>Ward v.

Rock Against Racism, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 800, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2758, <em>105 L.Ed.2d </em>at 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\"><em>Mitchell </em>rejected the bookstore\u2019s argument that there were better means to achieve the government\u2019s interest in preventing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>the spread of sexually transmitted disease, noting that while there may be many options available to a Legislature, it was not the proper function of the judiciary to substitute its judgment for that of the Legislature. <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n on Adult Entertainment Est., supra, </em>10 F.3d at 143. The State \u201cdid not have to show that \u2018[t]he open booth regulation appears to be the least burdensome means of controlling offensive and illegal activity within the booths that can be imagined.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144 (quoting <em>Wall Distribs., Inc. v. City of Newport News, supra, </em>782 <em>F.</em>2d at 1170). The regulation was held not offensive to First Amendment protection because adult materials may still be viewed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">In the case at bar, the Law Division Judge applied strict scrutiny and found the statute was not the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d to address the problem, construing it to be a complete ban on all booths. In so doing, the judge misinterpreted the statute. As we construe the statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on its face, only booths or areas screened or enclosed so as to preclude visibility from public areas facilitate sexual activity and are prohibited on premises occupied by sexually oriented businesses. Given this construction, the statute does not ban booths which do not facilitate sexual activity. The appropriate standard to determine tailoring is under the content neutral time, place and manner analysis, <em>i.e., </em>whether a substantial government interest would be \u201cachieved less effectively absent the regulation.\u201d <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 799, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2758, 105 L.Ed.2d at 680 (quoting <em>United States v. Albertini, supra, </em>472 <em>U.S. </em>at 689, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2906, 86 L.Ed.2d at 548).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">New Jersey\u2019s Legislature was presented with a substantial, if not compelling problem \u2014 the spread of sexually transmitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>disease through anonymous sexual activity occurring in adult bookstores\u2019 private booths. To resolve this public health concern, the Legislature prohibited commercial adult entertainment establishments from providing \u201cbooths, screens, enclosures or other devices which facilitate sexual activity by patrons.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-12.2b. Other jurisdictions place specific physical restrictions on the types of booths permitted, in effect requiring the inside of the booth to be visible from public areas of the establishment. <em>See e.g., Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n on Adult Entertainment Est., supra, </em>10 F.3d at 142 (open on one side to a public room); <em>Bamon Corp. v. City of Dayton, </em>923 <em>F.2d </em>470 (6th Cir.1991) (removal of doors); <em>Doe v. City of Minneapolis, </em>898 <em>F.</em>2d 612 (8th Cir.1990) (open on one side); <em>Berg v. Health &amp; Hospital Corp., </em>865 F.2d 797 (7th Cir.1989) (open on one side to a public room); <em>Wall Distribs., Inc. v. City of Newport News, supra, </em>782 <em>F.</em>2d 1165 (visible from continuous aisle); <em>Suburban Video, Inc. v. City of Delafield, </em>694 <em>F.Supp. </em>585 (E.D.Wis.1988) (removal of doors). The rationale behind such requirements is that visibility deters sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">New Jersey\u2019s statute, while not specifying physical requirements, accomplishes the same result. As we construe the Act, enclosures meeting other jurisdictions\u2019 physical requirements would be permissible under the State\u2019s statute. For example, if the interior of a booth is visible to a public room it would not be considered conducive to sexual activity any more than other areas of the business that are open to the public and visible to visitors, customers and store personnel. Thus, New Jersey\u2019s statute embraces all the physical requirements of other jurisdictions, and leaves it to each proprietor to design a viewing area which will not facilitate sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The final prong of the <em>Renton </em>analysis is whether there are reasonable alternative channels of communication available for the restricted form of \u201cspeech.\u201d <em>See Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., supra, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>at 53, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 932, 89 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 41. \u201c[A] restriction on expressive activity may be invalid if the remaining modes of communication are inadequate.\u201d <em>Members of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 812, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2132, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 791. It is not enough that there be alternative modes of communication, those modes must be practical. <em>New Jersey Citizen Action v. Edison Tp., </em>797 <em>F.</em>2d 1250, 1261 (3d Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">In holding that the Delaware ban on private viewing booths permitted ample alternative channels of communication, <em>Mitchell v. Comm\u2019n on Adult Entertainment Est., supra, </em>10 <em>F.3d </em>at 144 noted that \u201c[n]othing in [the Delaware Act] limits the number of viewing booths or the type of material that can be shown within the booths.\u201d Nor did the statute preclude rental or purchase of such material.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">With respect to this aspect, we consider \u201cwhether those methods not prohibited by the challenged regulation (viewing the films, etc., with an open door) are equivalent to the prohibited methods (viewing the films, etc., behind a closed door).\u201d <em>Berg v. Health &amp; Hospital Corp., supra, </em>865 F.2d at 803. <em>Berg </em>upheld legislation which required booths to be open on one side because it did not limit the available materials and did not prohibit people from watching films in individual enclosures. The \u2018Viewing public\u201d was not \u201c \u2018denied access to the market or ... unable to satisfy its appetite for sexually explicit fare.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>at 62, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2448, 49 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 321).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">N.J.S.A 2C:33-12.2 likewise leaves ample alternative modes for viewing adult materials. They may still be purchased or rented. In addition, nothing in the statute prohibits the use of coin-operated vending machines to view these materials, even in booths, so long as these booths do not facilitate sexual activity. Hence, the statute does not deny access to these materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the statute must be more exacting because it is a penal law which intrudes upon free expression. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 592, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985) (\u201cThe scrutiny to be accorded legislation that trenches upon first amendment liberties must be especially scrupulous.\u201d); <em>see also Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>85, 119 n. 16, 462 A.2d 573 (1983). The owners of sexually oriented businesses also argued that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-12.2 was unconstitutionally vague because it does not define what type of enclosure facilitates sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">The vagueness doctrine is premised on the notion that the law must \u201cgive the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>104, 108, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>2294, 2298, 33 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>222, 227 (1972); <em>see also Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 118, 462 A.2d 573 (\u201cVague laws deprive citizens of adequate notice of proscribed conduct, and fail to provide officials with guidelines sufficient to prevent arbitrary and erratic enforcement.\u201d). Statutes are void if their \u201cprohibitions are not clearly defined.\u201d <em>Grayned v. City of Rockford, supra, </em>408 <em>U.S. </em>at 108, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2298, 33 L.Ed.2d at 227. Statutes need not be meticulous in specificity, but should be afforded \u201cflexibility and reasonable breadth,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 110, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2300, 33 L.Ed.2d at 227, given the nature of the problem and wide range of human conduct. <em>See Smith v. Goguen, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>566, 581, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1242, 1251, 39 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>605, 616 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">In determining vagueness, a common sense approach is appropriate in construing the enactment, <em>see SDJ, Inc. v. City of Houston, </em>837 F.2d 1268, 1278 (5th Cir.1988), in terms of the persons who may be subject to it, <em>Town Tobacconist v. Kimmelman, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>at 118-120, 462 A.2d 573, and in context with its intended purpose. <em>State v. Cameron, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 591, 498 A.2d 1217. Since the challenge here to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-12.2 is not as applied, the statute must be reviewed on its face to determine if it is \u201cimpermissibly vague in all its applications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 498 A.2d 1217 (quoting <em>Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>489, 495-497, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1186, 1192, 71 L.Ed.2d 362, 369 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Central Ave. Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Las Cruces, </em>845 <em>F.Supp. </em>1499 (D.N.M.1994), held a penal statute impermissibly vague in relation to adult entertainment. There the district court held the Las Cruces ordinance void for vagueness because it failed to define \u201csexual activity\u201d or \u201cspecified anatomical areas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1503-1504. When terms are defined, however, a vagueness argument generally fails. <em>See e.g., Young v. American Mini Theatres, supra, </em>427 <em>U.S. </em>at 60-62, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2447-2448, 49 L.Ed.2d at 320-321; <em>Berg v.

Here, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-12.2 clearly defines specified sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In addition, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:33-12.2a(4) contains the verb \u201cfacilitate,\u201d which has uniformly been found not to offend the vagueness doctrine. <em>See e.g., Matter of Kaster, </em>454 <em>N.W.</em>2d 876 (Iowa 1990) (reasoning that proscribed criminal activity was clearly defined and \u201cfacilitate\u201d in the context of a forfeiture statute was not vague); <em>People v. Chastain, </em>733 P.2d 1206, 1209 (Colo.1987) (recognizing broad definition of proscribed tools which facilitate burglary reflected Legislature\u2019s understanding that \u201ca burglar\u2019s choice of tool is limited only by his imagination and ingenuity\u201d); <em>State v. Bush, </em>195 <em>Mont. </em>475, 636 P.2d 849, 852 (1981) (facilitate is common word giving fair warning of prohibited conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In holding the open booth ordinance in <em>Berg v. Health &amp; Hospital Corp. </em>not vague and that people of common intelligence could identify which establishments were subject to the ordinance, the Seventh Circuit reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">the ordinance and its regulations <em>plainly are directed, at those establishments which provide individual booths where high-risk sexual activity may occur and to businesses that offer as part of their business the entertainment to be viewed within the enclosure. </em>And, although the term \u201centertainment\u201d is arguably general, when read in the particular context of this ordinance, it cannot be said that it is beyond the grasp of persons of ordinary intelligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\"><em>[Berg v. Health &amp; Hospital Corp., supra, </em>865 <em>F.2d </em>at 803 (citations omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">New Jersey\u2019s statute is not vague. It adequately defines the proscribed conduct and instructs owners of commercial establishments not to facilitate such conduct on their premises by providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>booths, enclosures or other devices not open to any public area. For example, booths which do not have apertures known as \u201cglory holes\u201d in their walls and are also open to public view would not be violative of the statute. The use and configuration of booths and enclosures, and their appropriate lighting is otherwise left by the Legislature to common sense and the informed discretion of a reasonable person. Through simple supervision, owners can monitor and detect the activities of their patrons.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The order declaring <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-12 unconstitutional is reversed.
