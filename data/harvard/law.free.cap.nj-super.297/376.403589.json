The jury acquit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>ted defendant of possession of a handgun without a permit. The court sentenced defendant to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment with five years of parole ineligibility on the first robbery count. The other two robbery counts and the possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose were merged into the first robbery count. Regarding the endangering the welfare of a child, the court sentenced defendant to four years imprisonment to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed on the first robbery count. Thus, defendant\u2019s aggregate term is nineteen years imprisonment with five years of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Defendant appeals and makes the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">DEFENDANT WAS DENIED A FAIR TRIAL WHEN THE TRIAL JUDGE ALLOWED THE PROSECUTOR TO CROSS-EXAMINE DEFENDANT AND THEN COMMENT IN SUMMATION ON IRRELEVANT AND PREJUDICIAL INFORMATION CONCERNING DEFENDANT\u2019S LACK OF EMPLOYMENT AND THE NUMBER OF GIRLFRIENDS HE HAD ON THE DATE THAT THE ROBBERIES WERE COMMITTED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">THE TRIAL JUDGE ERRED BY REFUSING TO SANITIZE DEFENDANT\u2019S PRIOR CONVICTION FOR RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY THAT WAS USED TO IMPEACH HIS CREDIBILITY WHEN HE TOOK THE STAND. <em>POINT III</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-10\">SINCE THE STATE DID NOT PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT [A.J.] WAS THE VICTIM OF A THEFT, THE CONVICTION ON COUNT THREE OF THE INDICTMENT MUST BE VACATED (Not raised below.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-11\">\n<em>POINT TV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-12\">DEFENDANT\u2019S CONVICTION AND SENTENCE FOR ENDANGERING THE WELFARE OF A CHILD (COUNT FOUR) MUST BE MERGED INTO HIS CONVICTION AND SENTENCE FOR ARMED ROBBERY (COUNT ONE). IN THE ALTERNATIVE, DEFENDANT\u2019S CONSECUTIVE SENTENCE ON COUNT FOUR MUST BE VACATED AND A CONCURRENT SENTENCE IMPOSED. (Partially raised below.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-13\">\n<em>POINT V</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-14\">DEFENDANT\u2019S SENTENCE IS MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE AND UNDULY PUNITIVE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-15\">We conclude that defendant\u2019s second contention has merit and, therefore, we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>On December 18, 1992, at approximately 2:00 p.m., Daneka Claiborne, her cousin, Tasheila Ward, and a five-year-old girl, were walking down 14th Avenue in Newark between 14th and 15th Streets. A grey Pontiac containing three black males and one white male stopped across the street and slightly in front of them. Claiborne and Ward claimed that they made eye contact with and recognized the black male in the passenger seat as someone they knew as \u201cSmalls.\u201d They identified defendant in court as \u201cSmalls.\u201d After defendant saw them, he allegedly passed a handgun to the driver of the car, a \u201ctall dark skinned skinny guy\u201d later identified as Daniel Magnum.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">After receiving the gun, Magnum walked over to the three girls and demanded that they give him their jewelry. When they refused, he pointed the gun at A.J.\u2019s head and threatened to shoot her if they did not comply. Claiborne and Ward then handed their jewelry to Magnum. Magnum then proceeded to the car and entered the back seat, which was driven from the scene by the white male who had taken the driver\u2019s position. Defendant, \u201cSmalls,\u201d was sitting stooped down in the passenger seat during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Claiborne and Ward were interviewed by Officer Michael Krayanski after the robbery and by Detective Frank Huff three days later. Claiborne told them that one of the robbers was \u201cSmalls\u201d and later was able to tell Detective Huff where she thought \u201cSmalls\u201d lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Huff learned that defendant\u2019s nickname was \u201cSmalls\u201d after Magnum was arrested and identified by Claiborne as the robber. On April 7, 1993, Huff showed Claiborne a six photograph array which included defendant\u2019s picture. Claiborne identified defendant as \u201csomeone else in the car\u201d and signed the picture. Defendant was arrested two weeks later. Claiborne and Ward both identified defendant in court as the person who passed the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Defendant, who admitted that he was known in the neighborhood as \u201cSmalls,\u201d took the stand on his own behalf and denied having had anything to do with the robbery of the three girls. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>testified that on the date and time in question he had stopped at a store on 14th Avenue and 16th Street while walking from his girlfriend\u2019s house on 19th Street. While in the store, Daniel Magnum and a Puerto Rican male named \u201cFrank\u201d offered to drive defendant to Newton Street, where his other girlfriend lived. As he was entering the car, he saw three girls on the comer of 15th Street and waved to one of them after he thought he heard her say \u201chey, Smalls.\u201d He admitted knowing Daneka Claiborne \u201cfrom the street\u201d but did not know if she was one of the three girls on the comer. He testified that Claiborne was once his girlfriend in 1990, but that they broke up when Claiborne discovered that he had impregnated one of her friends. After he got in the car, he was driven directly to Newton Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Prior to trial, the prosecutor informed the court that defendant previously had been convicted of third degree receiving stolen property. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-7a. The court ruled that the conviction would be admissible under <em>State v. Sands, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>127, 386 A.2d 378 (1978), and <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:81-12 to impeach defendant if he testified. The court rejected defense counsel\u2019s contention that the conviction, if admitted into evidence, would have to be sanitized as required in <em>State v. Brunson, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>377, 625 A.2d 1085 (1993). When defendant testified, the jury was informed that defendant previously had been convicted of receiving stolen property.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">In <em>Brunson, </em>the Court refined its ruling in <em>State v. Sands, supra. Brunson </em>recognized that the introduction into evidence of defendant\u2019s prior conviction of a crime similar to a crime for which defendant is being tried \u201cis doubtless highly prejudicial, and that prejudice is unlikely to be cured by a limiting instruction.\u201d 132 <em>N.J. </em>at 391, 625 A.2d 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">To minimize the prejudice, but effect the \u25a0 legislative policy behind <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-12, the Court in <em>Brunson </em>announced this compromise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">[I]n those eases in which a testifying defendant previously has been convicted of a crime <em>that is the same or similar to the offense charged, </em>the State may introduce evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction limited to the degree of the crime and the date of the offense but excluding any evidence of the specific crime of which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>defendant was convicted. That method of impeachment will insure that a prior offender does not appear to the jury as a citizen of unassailable veracity and simultaneously will protect a defendant against the risk of impermissible use by the jury of prior-conviction evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 391, 625 A.2d 1085 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-7\"><em>See State v. L.J.P., </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 443, 637 A.2d 532 (App.Div.1994) (stating that in <em>post-Brunson </em>retrial for sexual assault, defendant\u2019s prior sexual assault convictions had to be sanitized); <em>State v. Williams, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>514, 515, 631 A.2d 1285 (Law Div.1993) (noting that prior convictions of unlawful possession of handgun had to be sanitized at trial of same charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">In the present case, we are persuaded that defendant\u2019s prior conviction for receiving stolen property should have been sanitized because it was sufficiently similar to the robbery charges for which defendant was being tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">Robbery is the use of force or the threat of force in the course of committing a theft. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-la. It is a first degree crime if the perpetrator \u201cis armed with, or uses or threatens the immediate use of a deadly weapon\u201d in the course of committing a theft. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-lb. Theft, therefore, is an <em>element of </em>robbery. <em>See State v. Sewell, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>133, 138, 603 A.2d 21 (1992). Robbery can be characterized as an aggravated form of theft. <em>See State v. Battle, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 260, 507 A.2d 297 (App.Div.) (characterizing robbery as \u201ca theft attended by a simple assault\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>560, 523 A.2d 194 (1986); <em>see also, State v. Sewell, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 503, 577 A.2d 537 (App.Div.1990), <em>aff'd, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>133, 603 A.2d 21 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">In the present case, defendant conceded his presence in the neighborhood where the crime was committed, being in the company of Magnum, and seeing at least one of the victims. The jury had to determine whether defendant\u2019s presence was innocent coincidence or indicated criminal participation, as the victims had testified. Because theft is an element of robbery, informing the jury that defendant previously had been convicted of a theft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>offense<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had the capacity to infect the jury\u2019s deliberations with prejudice beyond the probative value of a prior conviction regarding the credibility issue. We conclude, therefore, that this case presents an example of what <em>Brunson </em>described as a similar crime. Accordingly, the convictions must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In light of our determination regarding the sanitization issue we need not address defendant\u2019s other contentions. We observe, however, regarding defendant\u2019s first contention, that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant about his employment status and defendant\u2019s numerous girlfriends was excessive and had the potential of prejudicing defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. On retrial, the trial court shall exercise appropriate control of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination regarding those matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-13\"> <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:20-7a defines the offense of receiving stolen property as a theft. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-14\">A person is guilty of theft if he knowingly receives or brings into this State movable property of another knowing that it has been stolen, or believing that it is probably stolen.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
