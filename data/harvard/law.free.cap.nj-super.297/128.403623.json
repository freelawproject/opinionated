BROADER SOCIAL CONTEXT OF TALK RADIO.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">We reject plaintiffs contentions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">In January 1992, plaintiff, who is \u201cengaged in the business of monitoring radio broadcasts,\u201d began monitoring and taping defendant Bob Grant\u2019s talk-radio program broadcast by defendant WABC Radio, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> each weekday afternoon. Defendant Don Bouloukos was the general manager of WABC during the time of the incidents set forth in plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">Plaintiff began complaining about Grant\u2019s broadcasts in 1988, asserting that Grant, through his program, contributed to a climate of racism. His original complaints were lodged by calling Grant to confront him on the air about the views that he expressed during his broadcasts. The telephone calls were heated and confrontational.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">In 1992, plaintiff wrote several letters to the president of WABC complaining about Grant\u2019s program. In one letter dated April 4, 1992, plaintiff requested that WABC \u201cdo the right thing by replacing Bob Grant.\u201d In the same letter, plaintiff boasted that one of his tapes \u201cinfluenced the Jewish National Fund to replace Grant with Leon Charney as Master of Ceremonies for their 90th annual gala event this past January.\u201d In the letter plaintiff also said that he believed that \u201cBob Grant is evil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>In a letter to an executive of WABC dated October 13, 1992, plaintiff stated, \u201cI will not rest until ... Grant [is] no longer heard on commercial radio in this area.\u201d In the same letter, plaintiff went on to say that the First Amendment \u201cguarantees our right to continually speak out, to peacefully assemble, and to boycott sponsors regarding this problem.\u201d In addition, the letter spoke of plaintiffs efforts in removing two other \u201chatemongers\u201d from other radio stations in 1991 and 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In a letter dated November 24, 1992, plaintiff alleged that \u201cWABC Radio engages in overt racism against people of African ancestry every single day for several hours.\u201d The same letter stated that \u201cracial slurs are uttered by host Bob Grant ... on a regular basis at WABC.\u201d Because plaintiff perceived that WABC had taken no action to correct the problem, plaintiff further stated: \u201cI am now commencing a public campaign against Capital Cities/ABC and its executives, who have willfully neglected to address this situation. I am now going, public, in broadcast and in print, to name those responsible for allowing [Bob Grant] to divide our society along racial lines.\u201d Plaintiff concluded this letter by stating, \u201cI hereby charge you with racism.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In furtherance of his mission to remove Grant from the radio, plaintiff wrote newspapers articles and letters to various publications complaining about Grant\u2019s radio broadcast. In these articles and letters, plaintiff accused Grant of uttering \u201cracial slurs\u201d during his broadcast. Further, he described Grant\u2019s show as a perpetual \u201chatefest\u201d against Black people laced with racial slurs and occasional \u201cinvocations to violence.\u201d Moreover, he continued to tape Grant\u2019s show and provide copies of the tapes to other people and organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">In one instance, plaintiff provided a tape of one of Grant\u2019s shows to school officials in Neptune. On the tape, David C. Clark, a Neptune teacher who had called Grant\u2019s show, complained about Black History month and the curriculum that he was required to teach during that period. After school system officials heard the tape, Clark was suspended with pay. Shortly after Clark\u2019s sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>pension, plaintiff sent a letter to <em>The Asbwry Park Press, </em>contending that Grant was responsible for Clark\u2019s suspension. <em>The Asbwry Park Press </em>published plaintiffs letter on March 9, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Moreover, plaintiff sent tapes of defendant\u2019s show to Washington Media Associates. Washington Media Associates informed plaintiff that the \u201cmaterial\u201d that he provided would be useful to demonstrate \u201chow talk radio has helped to poison the waters relative to the Clinton presidency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">During plaintiffs campaign to remove Grant from the radio, Grant discussed plaintiff on his radio broadcast. He referred to plaintiff as a \u201cstalker\u201d because of his activities and called plaintiff \u201csome little weasel,\u201d \u201ca vicious swine,\u201d and \u201ca sick cookie,\u201d among other things.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">On June 10,1993, an article about plaintiff was published in <em>The Daily Challenge. </em>The title of the article was \u201cKeeping The Tapes On Hate Radio \u2018Hate-Gate.\u2019\u201d The article described plaintiffs activities in monitoring \u201chate radio programs\u201d and referred to plaintiff as a \u201cman on a mission.\u201d Further, the article quoted unnamed persons who labeled plaintiff \u201c \u2018possessed by the ancestors\u2019 ... \u2018crazy\u2019 ... or more \u2018obsessed than possessed.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">In early October 1994, plaintiff provided a tape of one of Grant\u2019s radio broadcasts to the Reverend Reginald T. Jackson, who furnished copies to the Lautenberg and Haytaian campaigns for the United States Senate. The tape became an issue during a debate between the candidates.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">On October 26, 1994, the day after the debate, Grant said the following on the air:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">[W]hat in heaven\u2019s name possessed you [Lautenberg] to come up with thaf^-with that ridiculous tape that has been compiled by a virtual stalker____ [Y]ou can stalk somebody physically, or yon could stalk someone psychologically, or you could stalk someone the way George Wilson has been stalking me. Now, he\u2019s a guy \u2014 we haven\u2019t really wanted to mention his name in the past, we didn\u2019t want to give him the publicity because that\u2019s what he craves. But he\u2019s a guy who\u2019s been compiling tapes on me \u2014I\u2019m his whole life. I am told that because his wife supports him he doesn\u2019t have to work for a living and therefore he has all the time in the world to do nothing but tape record \u201cThe Bob Grant show,\u201d \u201cJay Diamond Show,\u201d any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>show, and he has this obsession____ I also hear that this individual that I\u2019ve talked about has been in Marlboro State Hospital.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That\u2019s in Marlboro, New Jersey. Now, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been told. Now, this guy can\u2019t remain anonymous and do all these things.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">On February 13, 1995, Neptune High School teacher David C. Clark died of cancer. On that same day, in response to a caller\u2019s comments about Clark\u2019s death, Grant said the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">Well, as you know, or maybe you don\u2019t know, I signed a deal with Simon &amp; Schuster. At long last I\u2019m really in the process of writing a book. And, naturally, when I talked to my editor over there at the publishing house they told me some of the things that they thought that readers would be interested in. One was unusual phone calls that I\u2019ve received. And by unusual they mean the consequences of a call, perhaps, the ramifications of a call, and certainly the David Clark story will be told completely in the book. I haven\u2019t been able to tell the entire story on the air for a couple of reasons. But the entire story will be told, and even the person \u2014 the person who really was responsible for David C. Clark being exposed. You know, when a person calls \u201cThe Bob Grant Show,\u201d like you, Ed of Belmar, that\u2019s all we know. You\u2019re Ed of Belmar. However \u2014 however, if there\u2019s someone who knows who you are and they don\u2019t like what you say, and they are a sick, no good, pot smoking, wife beating skunk \u2014 and this guy knows I\u2019m talking about him, he\u2019s getting nervous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-9\">ED: Is that Westfield media monitor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-10\">BOB GRANT: Yes, from Westfield, right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b167-12\">We first address plaintiffs assertion that the trial judge erred in dismissing his libel claim because Grant\u2019s statement \u201csick, no good, pot smoking, wife beating skunk\u201d is actionable. Although in the statement Grant does not specifically refer to plaintiff by name in response to the caller\u2019s question, Grant sufficiently identifies plaintiff as the person to whom the comments were directed. There had been many prior references to plaintiff as the \u201cWestfield media monitor\u201d during plaintiffs and Grant\u2019s \u201cpublic feud\u201d over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-13\">The resolution of this issue depends on \u201cwhether the language used is reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>Kotlikoff v. The Community News, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>62, 67, 444 A.2d 1086 (1982). \u201cWhether the meaning of a statement is susceptible of a defamatory meaning is a question of law for the court. In determining whether the statements are defamatory, we must consider the content, verifiability, and context of the challenged statements.\u201d <em>Ward v. Zelikovsky, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>516, 529, 643 A.2d 972 (1994) (citations omitted). We note, however, that plaintiff only challenges the \u201cwife-beating\u201d portion of the comment. He asserts no claim based on the remainder of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u201cCourts begin their review to determine whether a statement is susceptible of a defamatory meaning by looking \u2018to the fair and natural meaning which will be given it by reasonable persons of ordinary intelligence\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). \u201cThe court must consider all the words used not merely a particular phrase or sentence.\u201d <em>Cole v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., Inc., </em>386 <em>Mass. </em>303, 435 N.E.2d 1021, 1025, <em>cert. denied, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>1037, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>449, 74 L.Ed.2d 603 (1982). Therefore, our focus must be on the defendant\u2019s entire statement, not just \u201cwife-beating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Here, Grant\u2019s full remark was \u201csick, no good, pot smoking, wife beating skunk.\u201d We acknowledge that the words \u201cwife-beating,\u201d taken alone, could be defamatory, especially in light of our society\u2019s heightened awareness of domestic violence. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-18. When \u201cwife-beating\u201d is considered in the context with the remaining words, however, we are satisfied that the language is mere name-calling or verbal abuse. \u201cThe common law has always differentiated sharply between genuinely defamatory communications as opposed to obscenities, vulgarities, insults, epithets, name calling, and other verbal abuse.\u201d Rodney A. Smolla, <em>Law of Defamation </em>\u00a7 4.03 at 4-12 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">As to verifiability, we agree that whether plaintiff is a \u201cwife-beater\u201d is capable of being verified. Nonetheless, Grant used \u201cwife-beating\u201d as a descriptive adjective for the noun \u201cskunk.\u201d We think it inappropriate, under these circumstances, to separate \u201cwife-beating\u201d from the remaining remarks by Grant. Grant engaged in \u201cnon-defamatory name calling.\u201d <em>Ward, supra, </em>136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 530, 643 A.2d 972. \u201cThere are some statements that are in form statements of opinion, or <em>even of fact, </em>which cannot reasonably be understood to be meant literally and seriously and are obviously mere vituperation and abuse.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, </em>\u00a7 566 Comment e. (emphasis added). We are satisfied that this is the case here, despite the ability to verify whether plaintiff is a \u201cwife-beater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">We next consider the context. We examine \u201cthe statement in its totality in the context in which it was uttered or published.\u201d <em>Cole, supra, </em>435 N.E.2d at 1025. \u201c[T]he context to be considered is both narrowly linguistic and broadly social.\u201d <em>Ollman v. Evans, </em>750 F.2d 970, 982 (D.C.Cir.1984)(en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 <em>U.S. </em>1127, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>2662, 86 L.Ed.2d 278 (1985). \u201cThe listener\u2019s reasonable interpretation, which will be based in part on the context in which the statement appears, is the proper measure for whether the statement is actionable.\u201d <em>Ward, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 532, 643 A.2d 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Here, Grant\u2019s remarks were made in the context of a long time \u201cwar of words\u201d between plaintiff and Grant. Plaintiff was a radio monitor who commenced a public campaign to vanquish Grant from the airwaves because plaintiff perceived that Grant was dividing \u201cour society along racial lines.\u201d Plaintiff taped Grant\u2019s show and provided those tapes to others and wrote letters to Grant\u2019s employer and to the media complaining about Grant and his talk show. Furthermore, a published article about plaintiff dated June 10, 1993, stated that plaintiff had \u201cmonitored \u2018hate radio programs\u2019... for over five years.\u201d The article discussed plaintiffs claims that \u201che has gotten people fired for \u2018broadcasting hate\u2019 \u201d and that \u201che is currently out to nail Bob Grant.\u201d Plaintiffs efforts to get rid of Grant began in 1988. Grant, in response, had referred to plaintiff as a \u201cstalker\u201d and other unflattering terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">In addition to the above circumstances, when considering context we also look at the \u201cmedium by which the statement is disseminated and the audience to which it is published.\u201d <em>Cole, supra, </em>435 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1025. Grant made his remarks during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>broadcast of his controversial talk-radio show. Grant\u2019s listeners knew that he would make provocative and caustic remarks during his broadcast.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">Indeed \u201c[t]he ordinary reasonable recipient of a communication naturally discounts to some degree statements made in the heat of vitriolic battle, because the recipient understands and anticipates the human tendency to exaggerate positions during the passions and prejudices of the moment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\"><em>[Ward, supra, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 532-33, 643 A.2d 972 (quoting Smolla, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.08[4][b](ii], at 6-35)(alteration in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">Further, Grant\u2019s listeners were aware of his verbal feud with plaintiff. They knew about plaintiff\u2019s monitoring and his efforts to remove Grant from the airways. Moreover, the listeners were aware of plaintiffs involvement in the David C. Clark incident involving the Neptune School District.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Grant made his remarks during a conversation with a caller about the death of David Clark, who died earlier on the same date. The caller and Grant were discussing the tragedy of Clark\u2019s death and a book that Grant intended to write, which would include \u201cthe David Clark story,\u201d when Grant, who perceived that plaintiff was responsible for Clark\u2019s suspension, made his comment. In this context, we conclude that any listener \u201cmust have perceived that the word[s] [were] no more than rhetorical hyperbole, a vigorous epithet used by\u201d Grant who perceived that plaintiff was responsible for the misfortune visited upon David Clark. <em>Greenbelt Coop. Publ\u2019g. Ass\u2019n. v. Bresler, </em>398 <em>U.S. </em>6, 14, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>1537, 1542, 26 L.Ed.2d 6, 15 (1970). <em>Cf. National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees v.

Plaintiff, as a result of his activities regarding Grant, became a limited public figure. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 <em>U.S. </em>323, 351, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2997, 3013, 41 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>789, 811 (1974).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">Those who step into areas of public dispute, who choose the pleasures and distractions of controversy, must be willing to bear criticism, disparagement, and even wounding assessments. Perhaps it would be better if disputation were conducted in measured phrases and calibrated assessments, and with strict avoidance of the ad hominem; better, that is, if the opinion and editorial pages of the public press were modeled on The Federalist Papers. But that is not the world in which we live, ever have lived, or are ever likely to know, and the law of the first amendment must not try to make public dispute safe and comfortable for all the participants. That would only stifle the debate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\"><em>[Ollman, supra, </em>750 <em>F.2d </em>at 993 (Bork, J. concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The motion judge properly concluded that the statement was not actionable and appropriately applied the criteria set forth in <em>Brill v.

The motion judge concluded that this count was so intertwined with the dismissed defamation count that it could not stand on its own. He stated: \u201cI do not find there is that separateness there that in this context would allow it to be recognized.\u201d Although we agree that summary judgment should have been granted, we do so for different reasons. \u201c[A]n order or judgment will be affirmed on appeal if it is correct even though the judge gave the wrong reasons for it.\u201d <em>Ellison v.

Time, Inc., </em>406 <em>F.Supp. </em>858, 861 (W.D.Pa.1976)(alteration in original)). \u201cHowever, there must be an appropriate nexus between the plaintiff and the matter that is newsworthy or of legitimate public interest.\u201d <em>Romaine v. Kallinger, supra, </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>at 302, 537 A.2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">\u201cThe nexus requirement is construed very liberally, and is much broader than the definition for limited public figure status in defamation, which requires the plaintiff to voluntarily thrust himself into a public controversy.\u201d Smolla, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 10.04[2][b][iii], at 10-35. Here, as previously stated, plaintiff voluntarily injected himself into a public controversy. \u201c[T]he nexus requirement for the newsworthiness privilege in a private facts claim merely requires that a logical connection exist between the plaintiff and the newsworthy matter.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>We are satisfied that there is an appropriate nexus here. Plaintiff, by his actions, engaged in a public debate with Grant over the propriety of Grant\u2019s views, as expressed on his radio broadcast. In fact, plaintiff vowed to have Grant removed from the airways. Plaintiff stated that he would \u201cexhaust every avenue to rid the airwaves of this societal menace.\u201d Plaintiff, whose actions were known to the public, was described in a published article as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cmore obsessed than possessed.\u201d Further, Grant referred to plaintiff as a \u201cstalker,\u201d someone who had \u201cstalked [him] for years.\u201d He also called plaintiff a \u201csick cookie to have this obsession with me.\u201d Under these circumstances, we conclude that a sufficient connection existed between plaintiff and the fact that he was hospitalized. <em>Cf. Gilbert v. Medical Economics Co., </em>665 F.2d 305 (10th Cir.1981) (holding that a sufficient nexus existed between disclosure of the name, photograph, psychiatric history, and marital problems of an anesthesiologist and a story of legitimate public interest concerning a medical malpractice claim involving the plaintiff).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Moreover, in determining whether the newsworthiness privilege applies, we should balance \u201cthe relative newsworthiness of the publication against its level of offensiveness and intrusiveness into private matters.\u201d Smolla, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 10.04[2][b][iv], at 10-35. The factors to be considered in the balance are: \u201c \u2018(1) the social value of the facts published; (2) the depth of the article\u2019s intrusion into ostensibly private affairs, and (3) the extent to which the party voluntarily acceded to a position of public notoriety.\u2019 \u201d <em>Briscoe v. Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>4 Cal.3d 529, 93 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>866, 875, 483 P.2d 34, 43 (1971)(quoting <em>Kapellas v. Kofman, </em>1 <em>Cal.3d </em>20, 81 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>360, 370, 459 P.2d 912, 922 (1969)). \u201c[T]he assessment of public interest includes a determination whether the person \u201cvoluntarily and knowingly engaged in conduct that one in his position should reasonably know would implicate a legitimate public interest, engendering the real possibility of public attention and scrutiny.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dairy Stores, Inc. v. Sentinel Publ\u2019g. Co., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>125, 144, 516 A.2d 220 (1986)(quoting <em>Sisler v. Gannett Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>Inc., </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>256, 274, 516 A.2d 1083 (1986)).
