The record, including evidence of defendant\u2019s voluntary accompaniment of the detectives to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>precinct, and the conversational, non-accusatory nature of the discussion, and the fact that the defendant was offered food and left alone for periods of time, supports the hearing court\u2019s findings. We see no reason to disturb the hearing court\u2019s credibility determinations <em>(see, People v Prochilo, </em>41 NY2d 759, 761).</p>\n<judges id=\"AYcP\">Concur \u2014 Lerner, P.
