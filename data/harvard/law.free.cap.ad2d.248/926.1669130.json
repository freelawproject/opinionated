Memorandum: The determination of the New York State Commissioner of Human Rights (Commissioner) that respondent, the Wackenhut Corporation (Wackenhut), discriminated against complainant by terminating her employment as a security guard in retaliation for her prior complaints of gender discrimination is supported by substantial evidence <em>(see, </em>Executive Law \u00a7 298; <em>Matter of Consolidated Edison Co. v State Div. of Human Rights [Easton], </em>77 NY2d 411, 415, <em>rearg denied </em>78 NY2d 909). Complainant established a prima facie case of retaliation <em>(see, Matter of Milonas v Rosa, </em>217 AD2d 825, 825-826, <em>Iv denied </em>87 NY2d 806). Although Wackenhut produced evidence \u201carticulating a legitimate, independent and nondiscriminatory reason for its action\u201d <em>(Matter of Milonas v Rosa, supra, </em>at 826), the Commissioner\u2019s finding that the reason proffered was pretextual <em>(see, Matter of Miller Brewing Co. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>66 NY2d 937, 939) is supported by substantial evidence. In addition, Wackenhut failed to prove that complainant did not exercise diligent efforts to mitigate her damages <em>(see, Matter of Walter Motor Truck Co. v New York State Human Rights Ap</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number><em>peal Bd., </em>72 AD2d 635, 636). Thus, the award of back pay was proper. (Executive Law Proceeding Transferred by Order of Supreme Court, Monroe County, Wisner, J.)</p>\n<judges id=\"Ah66\">Present \u2014 Den-man, P.
