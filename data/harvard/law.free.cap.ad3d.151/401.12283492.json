Wittner, J.), rendered November 1, 2013, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of robbery in the first degree, and sentencing him, as a second violent felony offender, to a term of 10 years, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-12\">In 2011, defendant followed the victim, who did not recognize defendant, into a building and demanded money. Defendant pulled out a kitchen knife about seven inches long, stated he would not hurt her, and told her to give him $12. The victim handed him a $20 bill, which prompted defendant to ask for another, and she complied. Defendant ran out of the building and ended up at a Duane Reade store. The victim told a bystander what occurred, and several bystanders found defendant in the Duane Reade and waited for him to exit. As defendant exited and attempted to flee, several bystanders tackled him. Defendant was held down by two men, and one bystander saw a small kitchen steak knife on the ground. When two po<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>lice officers arrived, they stood up defendant and transported him to the stationhouse. During processing, the officers recovered two packs of cigarettes from defendant, and he told an officer that he robbed a woman with a knife because he needed cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">During trial, defendant raised a defense of lack of criminal responsibility by mental disease or defect. Defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Eric Goldsmith, reviewed documents, including the criminal complaint, indictment, voluntary disclosure form, and defendant\u2019s medical records. In addition, Dr. Goldsmith interviewed defendant several times and interviewed his family members. Dr. Goldsmith opined that defendant was experiencing schizophrenic conditions, including loud voices that told him he should do what he needed to get cigarettes, and that defendant believed something bad would happen if he did not follow the voice\u2019s command. Specifically, Dr. Goldsmith opined that defendant could not determine whether what he actually did was wrong or against commonly held moral principles. Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s conclusions were largely based on self-reporting by defendant, such as defendant stating that he had used a butter knife during the robbery, he only asked for $20, and he walked away after taking the money. Dr. Goldsmith also concluded that a violent act was uncharacteristic of defendant because defendant had stated he had no history of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The People\u2019s expert, Dr. Jason Hershberger, reviewed the complaint, the knife, defendant\u2019s medical records, and Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s report. He interviewed defendant and conducted a mental status exam, and concluded that at the time of the robbery, defendant did not suffer from any delusions and that his memory was fine. Dr. Hershberger noted that medical records from just after the arrest showed defendant was not suffering from delusions or hearing any voices, which was unusual because in his expert opinion, delusions do not come and go that fast. Dr. Hershberger stated that it strained medical believability that defendant would experience such intense and controlling delusions, but not suffer from any psychotic delusions 10 days before or 2 days after the robbery. Dr. Hersh-berger also stated that defendant\u2019s account attempted to minimize the crime and evade responsibility. Moreover, Dr. Hershberger contended that defendant knew his actions were wrong, because defendant \u201chid the weapon under his clothes\u201d as he was walking, revealing it only after he was alone with the victim, and that he ran away afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The court properly exercised its discretion in admitting evidence that defendant had been released from prison a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>months before the robbery, and denying counsel\u2019s request to redact that information from defendant\u2019s medical records. In support of the defense of lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect, the defense psychiatric expert testified that defendant had been stable throughout his years in custody, when he received proper treatment for his schizophrenia. However, after he was released, he no longer received treatment, he became unstable, he began hearing voices, and he committed the robbery a few months later. Evidence of defendant\u2019s confinement in prison was \u201cinextricably interwoven\u201d with the expert\u2019s testimony and conclusion <em>(People v Ventimiglia, </em>52 NY2d 350, 361 [1981]). The court minimized the possible prejudice by excluding evidence of defendant\u2019s underlying conviction and only admitted references to his imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The court properly rejected defendant\u2019s suggested use of terms such as \u201cinstitution\u201d or \u201cfacility,\u201d rather than \u201cprison,\u201d because such terms might have confused the jury, or led it to speculate on the circumstances surrounding his confinement. Moreover, the court instructed the jury that the evidence was admitted solely for the purpose of evaluating the expert\u2019s opinion. Thus, the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudicial effect, which was avoided by the court\u2019s thorough limiting instructions <em>(see generally People v Bradley, </em>20 NY3d 128, 133 [2012]).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The dissent claims that the trial court infringed on defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense when the court prevented defendant\u2019s expert from expanding on his answers provided during cross-examination about defendant\u2019s prior violent act. Defendant did not preserve his claim regarding the alleged limitations on his expert\u2019s testimony, and we decline to review it in the interest of justice. As an alternative holding, we find no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">At trial, the People asked Dr. Goldsmith if he was aware that defendant had committed a serious violent crime in his past. Dr. Goldsmith answered that he was aware defendant was \u201cconvicted of a serious violent act, which was later overturned on appeal, which he later then took a plea to, an <em>Alford </em>plea.\u201d The People asked to strike the answer, requesting Dr. Goldsmith answer with a yes or no to the question. After defense counsel\u2019s objection, the court stated the People\u2019s question stands, and that Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s previous answer would be stricken. Further, the court informed the jury that the ques <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>tion was being asked not for the truth of the statement, but whether or not it would have influenced the doctor\u2019s conclusion if he knew of certain facts. In response to the question, Dr. Goldsmith stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The People then asked that if he was aware that defendant had put a pillow over a woman\u2019s face and choked her, whether \u201cthat would be a violent act, right?\u201d Dr. Goldsmith answered it \u201cwould be a violent act.\u201d Dr. Goldsmith then stated that he was aware there was an allegation that defendant had committed a violent crime in the past. The People asked, \u201c[I]t\u2019s fair to say then that when the defendant tells you he has absolutely no violence in his past that\u2019s not a completely accurate statement, correct?,\u201d to which Dr. Goldsmith responded, \u201c[I]ncorrect.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Goldsmith then answered that it was still his opinion that this robbery was out of character for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\">The dissent states that because the court struck Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s answer and instructed him to answer in a \u201cyes or no or I don\u2019t know\u201d capacity, the court infringed on counsel\u2019s ability to present a defense. The doctor\u2019s reference to an <em>Alford </em>plea went beyond the People\u2019s question. Further, defense counsel failed to revisit this issue on redirect by exploring the basis of Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s response that his opinion was unchanged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any event, Dr. Goldsmith did not change his conclusion, and ultimately his answer was \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d which required no further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Moreover, the court gave curative instructions as to why these questions were being asked, and repeatedly instructed the jury during this exchange that the questions were only to determine whether the doctor\u2019s conclusion would have been influenced based on these facts. Finally, during the jury charge, the court again explained that the information that defendant was in a institution or was in prison was not introduced to show the jury that he committed this particular crime or that he has a propensity to commit crimes, but was submitted only for the jury to assess the basis of the experts\u2019 opinions and the accuracy of information the experts relied upon. Even if the court had allowed Dr. Goldsmith to discuss the <em>Alford </em>plea in his answer, there is no reason to assume that would change the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>Many of the facts that Dr. Goldsmith relied on were refuted by evidence in the record, which showed defendant was not being truthful. Thus, there was an ample basis in the record for the jury to reject Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s conclusion. For example, defendant reported to Dr. Goldsmith that he had walked away after the robbery, but witnesses saw defendant run away. Defendant also misinformed Dr. Goldsmith that he asked for $20, when in reality he had asked for exactly $12. Further, defendant told Dr. Goldsmith he had used a butter knife in the robbery, but Dr. Goldsmith discovered from other sources that defendant had used a serrated steak knife to threaten the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Defendant has not made a CPL 440.10 motion, and his ineffectiveness claim cannot be resolved based on the current record on appeal <em>(see generally People v Rivera, </em>71 NY2d 705, 709 [1988]). In the alternative, to the extent the record permits review, we conclude that defendant received effective assistance of counsel <em>(see People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 713-714 [1998]; <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668 [1984]). Defendant has not shown that any of counsel\u2019s alleged deficiencies fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, or that, viewed individually or collectively, they deprived defendant of a fair trial or affected the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The only issue at trial was whether defendant proved his affirmative defense under Penal Law \u00a7 40.15 by establishing that he did not appreciate the wrongfulness of the robbery he committed. Defendant has not shown that any of counsel\u2019s alleged errors and omissions had any effect on the jury\u2019s decision to credit the People\u2019s expert witness, who effectively rebutted the defense\u2019s expert\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">We reject the dissent\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s question during voir dire about defendant having a criminal case involving a \u201csexual incident\u201d could not have been a strategic decision. Raising the issue during voir dire may have had several possible strategic purposes, as explained by the court to the panel. Specifically, immediately after counsel\u2019s question, the court noted that counsel was \u201cbringing it up, defense counsel, because it may come out. So he wants to make sure that \u2014 he\u2019s not conceding that [defendant] did or didn\u2019t do anything, but his background, this defendant\u2019s whole life may come up again about things he did or didn\u2019t do in his life in your evaluation of the psychiatric evaluation.\u201d Without an expanded record, which requires a 440.10 motion, we cannot say there was no objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>reasonable strategy in probing the jurors about their personal beliefs on this issue <em>(see generally Benevento </em>at 712).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\">Counsel himself raised the strategic value earlier to the court. Specifically, after the court had explained that the defense expert could be questioned about a prior violent act without using the word \u201crape,\u201d counsel explained that he had a concern about the ruling. Counsel stated that voir dire would be critical here, and that during voir dire he wanted to find out how much it could affect the jurors to learn about the felony conviction for rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Defense counsel\u2019s reference to a sexual incident was only made during voir dire, and was not admitted into evidence at any point during trial. Moreover, immediately after counsel\u2019s use of the words \u201csexual incident,\u201d the court interjected and gave a curative instruction to the panel. The court explained that defendant may or may not have a prior record, that it would not be evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt here, and that the jurors may learn certain information about defendant\u2019s background being admissible only to the extent that it effects each psychiatrist\u2019s opinion. The court reminded the panel that an event from defendant\u2019s past was not evidence of the instant crime, was not admissible, and that the jurors \u201cmay consider that in evaluating the reliability of the expert\u2019s opinion\u201d that defendant did not know the consequences of his actions. As the court immediately clarified counsel\u2019s statements and assured the prospective jurors that this was only a hypothetical situation, any possible prejudice was cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Pursuant to the court\u2019s ruling, defense counsel redacted references to defendant\u2019s prior sexual assault conviction from his medical records. Although, counsel attempted to redact these references, he did not completely obscure or darken the underlying text in all the exhibits. His failure to foresee that the underlying text could be read in certain light angles does not provide a basis to reverse on ineffective assistance grounds. Only some of the exhibits containing these redactions were requested and published to the jury. Of the exhibits published to the jury, it is speculative to conclude that the jury read the redacted information, and the obscured text did not contain the underlying details of defendant\u2019s prior violent act. In light of the above, counsel\u2019s failure to completely obscure the text did not change the jury\u2019s verdict nor deprive defendant of meaningful representation <em>(see Benevento </em>at 714 [\u201cwhether defendant would have been acquitted of the charges but for counsel\u2019s errors is relevant, but not dispositive\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>With regard to defendant\u2019s remaining ineffectiveness claims, we likewise find that the present, unexpanded record fails to show defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel under either the state or federal standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to conduct any inquiry into whether a highly publicized mass murder committed by a mentally ill man during defendant\u2019s trial affected the jurors\u2019 ability to continue serving. Other than the fact that both crimes involved a mentally ill man, there was no resemblance between the two cases, and no reason to make an inquiry <em>(see People v Moore, </em>42 NY2d 421, 433-434 [1977], <em>cert denied </em>434 US 987 [1977]; <em>People v Figueroa, </em>4 AD3d 118, 119 [1st Dept 2004], <em>lv denied </em>2 NY3d 799 [2004]; <em>see also People v Shulman, </em>6 NY3d 1, 32 [2005], <em>cert denied </em>547 US 1043 [2006]).</p>\n<judges id=\"AUB2\">Concur\u2014Richter, Gische and Webber, JJ.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\">. While the dissent states Dr. Goldsmith \u201cwas not allowed to explain his reasons for doubting that defendant had committed those acts\u201d after answering \u201cincorrect,\u201d the record shows that right afterwards, Dr. Goldsmith actually answered several questions uninterrupted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">. We note there may have been a good reason why counsel did not pursue this on redirect, because it might have had involved the jury in the collateral issue of why someone takes an <em>Alford, </em>plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b182-6\">. In fact, later during voir dire, a juror did volunteer that he or she had zero tolerance\u201d as to sexual misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b183-5\">Acosta, P.J., and Manzanet-Daniels, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar1q\">dissent in a memorandum by Manzanet-Daniels, J., as follows: The trial court infringed on defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense when it allowed the prosecutor to question defendant\u2019s psychiatric expert about the graphic particulars of defendant\u2019s prior rape conviction (which was subsequently vacated on appeal), yet prevented him from explaining why he had doubts that defendant had committed that crime. Moreover, defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel by defense counsel\u2019s references to the conviction during voir dire and the submission of inadequately redacted exhibits that served as a reminder of the lurid details of the prior crime, despite the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling precluding that evidence. I would accordingly reverse defendant\u2019s conviction for robbery in the first degree, and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Defendant suffers from schizophrenia. He has auditory and visual hallucinations as well as paranoid delusions. Over the 30 years since his diagnosis, defendant has been in various psychiatric hospitals and other institutionalized settings and on and off medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In 2011, defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree for forcibly stealing property with a dangerous instrument. Prior to trial, defense counsel moved to exclude evidence of defendant\u2019s 2005 conviction for rape in the first degree. The conviction was reversed by this Court upon a finding that the trial court had erred in precluding the defense from investigating the complainant\u2019s prior claims of molestation by her doctors, which, if proven to be false, could have been used to undermine her veracity and account of what had transpired (72 AD3d 552 [1st Dept 2010], <em>lv denied </em>15 NY3d 756 [2010]). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>After the reversal, defendant entered an <em>Alford </em>plea in exchange for a sentence resulting in his near immediate release.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\">The prosecution argued that it ought to be allowed to question the defense\u2019s psychiatric expert about the prior conviction because Dr. Goldsmith based his opinion, in part, on the aberrational nature of defendant\u2019s threat of violence during the robbery. Defense counsel noted that the conviction had been reversed, and that defendant had subsequently entered an <em>Alford </em>plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The trial court agreed that the evidence of the prior rape would be unduly prejudicial. Nonetheless, the trial court ruled that the prosecution could ask Dr. Goldsmith whether the fact that defendant had committed a prior violent act would affect his opinion concerning defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility. While prohibiting any evidence that the crime involved rape or sexual assault, the court permitted the prosecution to elicit the underlying facts of the crime, namely, that defendant had allegedly put a pillow over a woman\u2019s face and strangled her.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">When defense counsel tried to object, the trial court silenced him, stating, \u201cExcuse me. They were proven beyond a reasonable doubt and the verdict is overturned only because of something Justice Goodman did. He chose to plead guilty in an <em>Alford </em>plea.\u201d Defense counsel registered an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The court found that questioning about the rape would be unduly prejudicial, but stated that the defense expert could be cross-examined concerning the basis of his opinion that defendant was nonviolent. The court suggested that the prosecutor \u201ccome up with some language about a violent act without mentioning rape,\u201d while acknowledging, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you could do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">At trial, the defense called Dr. Goldsmith as a witness. Dr. Goldsmith testified that defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic who suffered from both auditory and visual hallucinations. Defendant was diagnosed at the age of 25 and had been hospitalized multiple times beginning in the 1980s. Dr. Goldsmith opined that defendant had been fairly stable while receiving treatment, but noted that when he relocated back to New York City, he was unable to re-enroll at St. Luke\u2019s/ Roosevelt, and wasn\u2019t receiving therapy. He began drinking again, worsening his delusional state. It was in this paranoid and hallucinatory state of mind that defendant committed the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">During cross, the prosecutor asked Dr. Goldsmith, \u201c[B]y now you\u2019re aware the defendant had committed a serious violent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>crime in the past, correct?\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s objection to the question was overruled. Dr. Goldsmith answered that he was aware defendant had been \u201cconvicted of a serious violent act,\u201d but noted that the conviction had been overturned on appeal and that defendant had subsequently entered an <em>Alford </em>plea. The prosecution posed the question again, and defense counsel again objected, following which a sidebar was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">When proceedings resumed, the trial court instructed the jury that the question stood but that Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s answer was stricken and that the jury was to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The prosecution posed the question again to the defense expert. Before Dr. Goldsmith could answer, the court intructed the witness, \u201c[T]hat\u2019s a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no.\u2019 \u201d Upon defense counsel\u2019s objection, the court clarified that Dr. Goldsmith could respond \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Dr. Goldsmith replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d whereupon the prosecution demanded, \u201cAnd if you were aware that the defendant put a pillow over a woman\u2019s face and choked her that would be a violent act, right?\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s objection was overruled, and Dr. Goldsmith answered, \u201c[T]hat would be a violent act.\u201d The prosecution asked whether Dr. Goldsmith was aware that there was an allegation that defendant had committed a violent crime in the past, to which the expert replied, \u201cCorrect.\u201d The prosecution then asked, \u201cAnd it\u2019s fair to say that when the defendant tells you he has absolutely no violence in his past that\u2019s not a completely accurate statement, correct?\u201d Dr. Goldsmith replied, \u201c[I]ncorrect,\u201d but was not allowed to explain his reasons for doubting that defendant had committed those acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial. The court infringed on counsel\u2019s ability to present a defense by allowing the prosecution to question defendant\u2019s expert about certain aspects of defendant\u2019s prior rape conviction, yet preventing Dr. Goldsmith from explaining why he had doubts defendant had committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Dr. Goldsmith testified that defendant\u2019s prior conviction did not alter his opinion concerning defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the crime. The prosecution aggressively cross-examined Dr. Goldsmith concerning this point, asking, \u201cAnd it\u2019s fair to say then that when the defendant tells you he has absolutely no violence in his past that\u2019s not a completely accurate statement, correct?\u201d Any attempt to explain that defendant had entered an <em>Alford </em>plea and had not in fact admitted the elements of the prior crime was rebuffed by the trial court. Indeed, the trial court struck Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s explanation concerning why the prior conviction had not altered his opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>and instructed the jury to disregard his response. Later, in summation, the prosecution argued that the jury should not believe Dr. Goldsmith because he refused to acknowledge defendant\u2019s prior rape conviction. The prosecutor asserted that \u201c [everything he premised his opinion on . . . crumbles when scrutinized even slightly,\u201d noting that none of his expertise could explain \u201chow he completely sticks to that conclusion in the face of the facts being markedly different from what he believes them to be when he initially made that conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">Defendant\u2019s expert was precluded from explaining why he doubted that defendant had committed the prior rape. The rape conviction was not overturned simply \u201cbecause of something Judge Goodman did,\u201d as the trial court asserted. The complainant in the rape case, a patient at a mental health treatment center, had made claims of sexual abuse against several of her doctors. The trial court precluded the defense from investigating the details of those prior claims, despite the fact that they were relevant to her credibility. After the conviction was overturned, defendant was offered a plea that would result in his immediate release from prison. Ultimately, he entered an <em>Alford </em>plea in exchange for a sentence of time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">By failing to allow Dr. Goldsmith to explain the circumstances surrounding the prior conviction, the trial court gave the jury a \u201cdistorted impression\u201d of the facts <em>(People v </em>Carroll, 95 NY2d 375, 386 [2000]), namely, that Dr. Goldsmith had simply ignored the conviction in arriving at his opinions. It prevented defendant from rebutting the prosecutions\u2019s claim that Dr. Goldsmith lacked credibility or that defendant had lied to his expert, depriving defendant of his due process right to present a defense <em>(see People v Hudy, </em>73 NY2d 40, 56-58 [1988] [defendant denied due process where the trial court prevented him from presenting evidence challenging the credibility of the complainant], <em>abrogated on other grounds by Carmell v Texas, </em>529 US 513 [2000]).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The majority attempts to minimize the impact of the trial court\u2019s ruling restricting Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s testimony, asserting that Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s references to an <em>Alford </em>plea \u201cwent beyond the People\u2019s question.\u201d It cannot seriously be denied that by disallowing a reference to the plea, and limiting the expert to \u201cyes,\u201d \u201cno,\u201d or an \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d answer, the trial court effectively deprived the doctor of any effective means of rebutting the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that defendant had a serious violent history, as well as thoroughly undermined the expert\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The court\u2019s restriction on Dr. Goldsmith\u2019s testimony pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>vented defendant from being able to rebut the prosecution\u2019s attack on the credibility of the expert upon whom defendant\u2019s entire defense rested and skewed the trial in the People\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">I would also find that defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel when his attorney during voir dire told the jury that defendant had been convicted of a sexual assault and submitted inadequately redacted exhibits containing references to the details of the rape and defendant\u2019s conviction. The claim is properly raised on direct appeal, since defendant has met his burden of establishing the absence of a legitimate explanation or discernible strategy for counsel\u2019s actions <em>(see People v Jarvis, </em>25 NY3d 968 [2015]; <em>People v Cleophus, </em>81 AD3d 844 [2d Dept 2011]).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">To demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel under the federal standard, a defendant must show that but for counsel\u2019s error, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that . . . the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d <em>(Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668, 694 [1984]). The prejudice component under the state standard of meaningful representation \u201cfocuses on the fairness of the process as a whole,\u201d requiring reversal \u201cwhenever a defendant is deprived of a fair trial\u201d <em>(People v Caban, </em>5 NY3d 143, 156 [2005] [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Almost immediately after beginning voir dire, counsel told the panel of jurors that they would hear that defendant had a prior criminal case for a \u201csexual incident.\u201d The jury learned the details of the prior conviction for sexual assault when defense counsel failed to properly redact the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Defense counsel introduced highly prejudicial evidence without any strategic or legitimate explanation for doing so <em>(see e.g. People v Stefanovich, </em>136 AD3d 1375, 1378 [4th Dept 2016] [reversing conviction where defense counsel referred to prior sexual offense during voir dire, perceiving no \u201cdiscernible benefit\u201d to defense counsel\u2019s strategy, concluding he took \u201can inexplicably prejudicial course of action by allowing the jury to know the defendant (wa)s a registered sex offender\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)], <em>lv denied </em>27 NY3d 1139 [2016]; <em>People v Jarvis, </em>113 AD3d 1058, 1059-1060 [4th Dept 2014] [no strategic explanation for defense attorney\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of prejudicial and previously excluded evidence that the defendant had threatened a prosecution witness], <em>affd </em>25 NY3d 968 [2015]; <em>People v Cleophus, </em>81 AD3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>846 [\u201cno valid tactical reason\u201d for defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of the minutes of defendant\u2019s prior guilty plea when such evidence was statutorily excludable]). The evidence of the prior rape conviction had already been excluded by the trial court so there was no danger of the prosecutor introducing or relying on the rape conviction. Indeed, had the prosecution done so, defendant would have had grounds for a mistrial. An argument that the door would have inevitably opened by virtue of other trial evidence is speculative at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The evidence of defendant\u2019s prior rape conviction was highly prejudicial given the nature and severity of the crime. The jury learned not only that defendant had a rape conviction, but that he had been sentenced to 21 years on account of the violent crime. The inadequate redactions provided graphic reminders of defendant\u2019s criminal past, including references to \u201cserving a twenty-one year sentence for violent sexual crimes,\u201d and \u201cfore-ting] the [victim] to have sexual intercourse with him.\u201d That this evidence was highly prejudicial is patent from the fact that the court determined initially to exclude it.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Defendant has shown that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d and that as a result thereof he was deprived of a fair trial <em>(see People v Caban, </em>5 NY3d at 155-156; <em>People v Garcia, </em>19 AD3d 17, 20 [2005]). I would accordingly reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b187-8\"> It should be noted that co-counsel made a motion for a mistrial on these grounds, affording defense counsel the opportunity to explain his strategy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
