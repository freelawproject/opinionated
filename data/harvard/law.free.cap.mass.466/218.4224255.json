The question before us is whether, on the ground of mutual mistake, the policy should be reformed by striking that indorsement. It is undisputed that both the insurance company\u2019s agent and the homeowner mistakenly believed that the policy did not contain such a limitation of liability, but that neither conveyed her mistaken belief to the other. We conclude that, absent full, clear, and decisive proof of some prior agreement between the parties as to coverage for animal bites different from that contained in the policy, there was no mutual mistake warranting reformation of the policy. We accordingly reverse the entry of partial summary judgment in the insured\u2019s favor ordering such reformation, and order the entry of separate and final judgment for the insurer on the reformation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">1. Background'.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In March, 2006, Alan and Katherine Fowler purchased a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy from the Horace Mann Insurance Company (Horace Mann). The policy was to replace a previous policy the Fowlers had purchased through the Massachusetts Property Insurance Underwriting Association\u2019s assigned risk pool (\u201cFAIR plan\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The FAIR plan was considerably more expensive than commercial homeowner\u2019s insurance policies, and the Fowlers sought a more affordable option.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">On March 10, 2006, Katherine<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *met with Barbara Bode,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Horace Mann\u2019s agent, at Bode\u2019s office to prepare an application for homeowner\u2019s insurance through Horace Mann. Bode requested a copy of the declarations page for the Fowlers\u2019 FAIR plan policy; the declarations page indicated that the personal liability limit was $500,000. Bode asked Katherine if she owned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>certain specific breeds of dog, and Katherine answered, \u201c[N]o.\u201d Katherine added that she owned an American Bull Dog (which was not among the breeds Bode had named). Katherine did not express any concern as to the potential risk for the American Bull Dog breed, nor did she ask any questions about coverage for dog-related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Bode printed Katherine\u2019s completed application form, and they both signed the form. Katherine gave Bode a check for $310, representing forty per cent of the total premium cost. The policy was substantially less expensive than Katherine\u2019s then-existing FAIR plan policy. Bode provided Katherine a \u201cVerification of Coverage\u201d sheet, showing personal liability limits of $500,000, and informed Katherine that a full policy would be mailed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">When Katherine received the full policy, she \u201cskimmed\u201d through it. The policy contained an \u201cAnimal Liability Endorsement\u201d (indorsement)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which limited coverage to $25,000 for claims arising from animal bites, and precluded any coverage for bites by certain listed breeds of dog; the Fowlers\u2019 American Bull Dog was not among the excluded breeds. According to Katherine\u2019s affidavit, when she purchased the policy after meeting with Bode, she mistakenly assumed that the policy provided the full $500,000 in liability coverage for claims involving animal bites. Bode states in her affidavit that she, too, mistakenly believed that the policy would provide full liability coverage for dog bite claims if the dog was not one of the listed excluded breeds, although she never conveyed this belief to Katherine. Indeed, during their meeting, Bode and Katherine did not discuss coverage for animal bite claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-18\">On June 17, 2006, plaintiff Scott Caron was bitten in the face and severely injured by the Fowlers\u2019 dog. He and his wife Caryn brought an action against the Fowlers in the Superior Court. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>jury found for the Carons and awarded them $250,559.96, including prejudgment interest. Horace Mann paid $25,000 of this judgment, maintaining that, due to the indorsement, such was the extent of its liability. The Carons reached a settlement with the Fowlers regarding the balance of the judgment, and became assignees of the Fowlers\u2019 claims against Horace Mann.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The Carons then commenced an action in the Superior Court against Horace Mann alleging, among other claims,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the Fowlers and Horace Mann were mutually mistaken as to the application of the indorsement, and thus that the policy should be reformed by striking the indorsement. A Superior Court judge granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Carons on this claim, and denied Horace Mann\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment on all counts. The judge allowed the Carons\u2019 motion for entry of separate and final judgment on the reformation claim, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Horace Mann moved to correct the judgment, Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (a), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), and the judge issued an amended final judgment against Horace Mann, totaling $225,559.96, with interest in the amount of $77,197.80. Horace Mann appealed, and we granted its application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). \u201cBecause our review is de novo, we accord no deference to the decision of the motion judge.\u201d <em>DeWolfe </em>v. <em>Hingham Ctr., Ltd., </em>464 Mass. 795, 799 (2013). In order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment on a claim for reformation due to mutual mistake, the moving party must establish \u201cthat the undisputed material facts fully, clearly, and decisively show[] a mutual mistake.\u201d <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>414 Mass. 747, 756 (1993) <em>(Polaroid).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>b. <em>Mutual mistake, </em>i. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. </em>Insurance policies may be reformed under the same principles as any other contract. See <em>Polaroid, supra </em>at 756. The \u201cdoctrine of reformation is driven by respect for the parties\u2019 intent and \u2018gives effect to the terms mutually agreed upon by the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berezin </em>v. <em>Regency Sav. Bank, </em>234 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2000), quoting <em>Southeastern Ins. Agency, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co., </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 642, 646 (1995), <em>S.C., </em>423 Mass. 1008 (1996) <em>(Southeastern Ins. Agency). </em>\u201cIf the language of a written instrument does not reflect the true intent of both parties, the mutual mistake is reformable.\u201d <em>Polaroid, supra. </em>See 2 G. Couch, Insurance \u00a7 27:1 (3d. rev. ed. 2010) (\u201cEquity will reform a contract which, by reason of mutual mistake, does not express the real agreement between the parties\u201d). \u201cThe mistake must either be mutual... or be made by one party and known to the other party\u201d (citations omitted), <em>Polaroid, supra, </em>and \u201cmust relate to an essential element of the agreement.\u201d <em>LaFleur </em>v. <em>C.C. Pierce Co., </em>398 Mass. 254, 257-258 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Here, there is no dispute that, under the policy as written, coverage for claims arising from a bite by the Fowlers\u2019 dog was limited to $25,000. It is also undisputed that Horace Mann fully intended the indorsement to be included in the policy and to limit the Fowlers\u2019 coverage for animal bite claims. Indeed, the indorsement was mandatory in all Horace Mann policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The summary judgment record indicates, however, that Katherine mistakenly believed that the policy provided up to $500,000 in personal liability coverage for \u201cany incident at all,\u201d including claims resulting from a dog bite. Nonetheless, nothing in the record suggests that Katherine expressed this understanding to Bode, Horace Mann\u2019s agent, and Katherine undisputedly did not ask Bode any questions regarding the extent of coverage for animal bite claims. Bode, in turn, testified at her deposition that she also mistakenly believed that the policy would provide coverage up to the $500,000 personal liability limit for a dog bite claim, but that she neither conveyed this understanding to Katherine nor even discussed coverage for dog bite liability with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">The question before us, then, is whether Bode\u2019s misunderstand<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ing of the indorsement, which was never expressed to Katherine, but which tracks Katherine\u2019s own misunderstanding, provides a basis by which the Carons may claim mutual mistake. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>57 Mass. App. Ct. 350, 354 (2003) (\u201cthe pertinent intent [for analyzing mutual mistake] . . . must be the intent of the agent . . . who participated in negotiating the contract, not the intent of the principal. . . who did not\u201d). The rationale underlying the mutual mistake doctrine compels us to answer in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"AII\">The mutual mistake doctrine exists to effectuate the agreement intended by the parties to a contract where the contract language fails to capture that agreement. Central to this doctrine is the fundamental underpinning that the parties had reached an agreement on a point which they intended to enshrine in the written contract but which, for some reason, was mistakenly omitted from that written contract. See <em>Sancta Maria Hosp. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>369 Mass. 586, 595-596 (1976) (\u201cthis court will not decree a reformation unless we are convinced that the parties <em>expressed agreement </em>and an <em>intention to be bound </em>in accordance with the terms that we are asked to establish and enforce\u201d [emphasis supplied]); <em>German Am. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>131 Mass. 316, 317 (1881) (\u201cIt must appear beyond reasonable doubt that the precise terms of a contract had been orally agreed upon between the parties, and that the written instrument afterwards signed fails to be, as it was intended, an execution of the previous agreement\u201d). See also 2 G. Couch, Insurance, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 27:3 (\u201cA mistake is mutual where the parties have agreed to accomplish a particular object by the policy, and the policy as executed was insufficient to effectuate the intention\u201d); 66 Am. Jur. 2d Reformation of Instruments \u00a7 21 (2011) (\u201cA party may be entitled to reform a contract on a theory of mutual mistake if, at the time of contracting, both parties were laboring under the same misapprehension as to a particular, essential fact; the minds of the parties must have met and reached a prior existing agreement that the written document fails to express\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AWX\">Here, Bode\u2019s misunderstanding as to the application of the indorsement cannot serve as the necessary prerequisite to a claim of mutual mistake. Although her misunderstanding is consistent with Katherine\u2019s misunderstanding, it is not a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201cexpressed agreement\u201d because Bode never communicated this misunderstanding to Katherine.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Sancta Maria Hosp. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, supra. </em>Where Bode never discussed the extent of coverage for animal bite claims with Katherine, Katherine\u2019s mistaken assumption that her policy included the full $500,000 in personal liability coverage for animal bites lacks \u201c[t]he essential element of mutuality in the mistake,\u201d <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shapiro, </em>286 Mass. 577, 582 (1934), to warrant reformation. This is particularly so given that Katherine never expressed her misunderstanding to Bode or to Horace Mann. See <em>Tupper </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>319 Mass. 105, 108 (1946) (\u201cunexpressed intent of one of the parties cannot control the legal effect of what was done\u201d). But see <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Shapiro, supra </em>at 581-582.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>That Katherine silently harbored an assumption<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the policy would provide the full $500,000 in liability coverage for \u201cany incident at all\u201d is not a basis for reformation of a policy whose written \u201canimal liability endorsement\u201d plainly contradicts such an assumption, a policy which Katherine only \u201cskimpmed] through.\u201d See <em>LaFleur </em>v. <em>C.C. Pierce Co., </em>398 Mass. 254, 257-258 (1986) (\u201cA contract will not be rescinded for mutual mistake where one party was aware at the time the contract was signed that he had limited knowledge as to essential facts, but nonetheless assumed the risk that circumstances would prove to be other than as expected\u201d); <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Northwestern Nat. Ins. Co., </em>267 Mass. 571, 574-575 (1929) (\u201cinsured is presumed to have assented to the terms of [a] new policy if it is retained without reading or read without complaint and rejection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Simply put, the written policy indisputably limited liability coverage for claims stemming from a bite by the Fowlers\u2019 dog to $25,000, and nothing in the record \u201cfully, clearly, and decisively\u201d demonstrates that this amount of coverage fails to reflect a previous agreement between the parties to the policy. See <em>Polaroid, supra </em>at 756. Thus, there is no basis upon which to reform the contract.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>Sancta Maria Hosp. </em>v. <em>Cambridge, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>ii. <em>Defendant\u2019s cross motion for summary judgment. </em>Having concluded that the Carons are not entitled to summary judgment on the reformation claim, we consider whether such judgment may properly enter in favor of Horace Mann. \u201c[A] party moving for summary judgment in a case in which the opposing party will have the burden of proof at trial is entitled to summary judgment if he [or she] demonstrates . . . that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">As stated, the undisputed material facts demonstrate that Bode and Katherine never discussed animal liability coverage, and thus their independent mistakes as to such coverage were in no way mutual. The Carons, as the party seeking reformation, would have the burden at trial of establishing \u201cfully, clearly, and decisively\u201d that the parties were mutually mistaken as to the coverage for animal bites. See <em>Polaroid, supra. </em>Even viewing this undisputed factual record in the light most favorable to the Carons, it is clear that they have \u201cno reasonable expectation of proving\u201d that a mutual mistake existed between Horace Mann and the Fowlers. See <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., supra. </em>Accordingly, Horace Mann is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the reformation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment granting separate and final judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ment in favor of the Carons on count three of the complaint is vacated and set aside.

Bode told Katherine to contact her when the Fowlers were eligible.

The insurer issued the policy but failed to include the reduced rate clause in the policy despite charging the insured according to the lower rate. <em>Id. </em>The court permitted reformation of the contract to reflect the lower rate, notwithstanding a finding by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>motion judge that \u201cthere was no \u2018stipulation\u2019 or \u2018agreement\u2019 [between the parties] that the policy should contain [the reduced rate clause].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 580.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The court determined, however, that the parties had implicitly reached an agreement that the policy would contain the lower rate by virtue of the insured\u2019s application explicitly requesting the reduced rate and the insurer\u2019s issuance of apolicy pursuant to that application. <em>Id. </em>at 581-582.

Bode also testified, however, that she saw only the general liability limits set forth on the declarations page of the prior policy, and never saw or had knowledge of any applicable exclusions and indorsements, including any possible animal bite indorsement. Katherine testified that she simply \u201cassumed\u201d the prior policy did not limit her coverage for animal bites, as she incorrectly assumed for the policy at issue here.
