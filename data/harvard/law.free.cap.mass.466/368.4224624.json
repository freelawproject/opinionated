The defendants contend that the bylaws require only that one annual shareholders\u2019 meeting be held each fiscal year for each of the Funds. We conclude that \u201con at least an annual basis\u201d means that an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting for each of the Funds must be held no later than one year and thirty days (395 days) after the last annual shareholders\u2019 meeting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant Funds are closed-end investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-5(a)(1)(2) (2006), that are organized as Massachusetts business trusts under G. L. c. 182.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>The plaintiffs are the second-largest beneficial owners of preferred shares of each of the Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Each of the Funds is governed by its Amended and Restated Agreement and Declaration of Trust (declaration of trust), dated August 14, 2003, and October 4, 2004, respectively. These declarations of trust are identical in all respects relevant to this case. Article IV, \u00a7 1, of each declaration of trust requires the Funds to hold an annual meeting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cAn initial annual meeting of Shareholders or special meeting in lieu thereof shall be called to be held not more than fifteen months after Shares are first sold pursuant to a public offering; subsequent annual meetings of Shareholders or special meetings in lieu thereof (each an \u2018annual meeting\u2019) shall be held as specified in the Bylaws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Section 10.2 of each of the Funds\u2019 bylaws<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">\u201cExcept as provided in the next sentence, regular meetings of the Shareholders for the election of Trustees . . . shall be held, so long as Common Shares are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, <em>on at least an annual basis, </em>on such day and at such place as shall be designated by the Trustees. In the event that such a meeting is not held in any annual period if so required, whether the omission be by oversight or otherwise, a subsequent special meeting may be called by the Trustees and held in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>lieu of such meeting with the same effect as if held within such annual period.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In addition to these provisions in the declarations of trust and bylaws regarding an annual meeting, because the Funds\u2019 shares are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, they must also comply with \u00a7 302.00 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual (NYSE manual), which requires them \u201cto hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting during each fiscal year.\u201d* <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The PIMCO Income Strategy Fund held its first annual meeting on November 16, 2004. In subsequent fiscal years, both Funds held joint annual meetings on December 15, 2005;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> December 14, 2006; December 18, 2007; December 16, 2008; December 16, 2009; and December 14, 2010. The Funds\u2019 proxy statement issued on November 12, 2010, stated that \u201c[i]t is currently anticipated that each Fund\u2019s next annual meeting of Shareholders after the [December 14, 2010] Meeting . . . will be held in December[,] 2011.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">On September 21, 2011, Brigade delivered to the Funds a written notice stating Brigade\u2019s intent to nominate one of their partners for election as a preferred shares trustee of each fund at the 2011 annual meeting. On October 11, 2011, the Funds issued a press release stating that their joint annual meeting was being rescheduled to July 31, 2012, the last day of the Funds\u2019 2012 fiscal year.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">On December 1, 2011, Brigade filed a verified complaint in the Superior Court alleging that the Funds intended to commit a breach of \u00a7 10.2 of the bylaws by postponing the annual meeting to a date that was nineteen months after the Funds\u2019 last annual meeting on December 14, 2010. The complaint sought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>among other things, an injunction requiring the Funds \u201cto hold the 2011 annual meeting ... as soon as practical,\u201d and a declaration that \u00a7 10.2 of the Funds\u2019 bylaws requires \u201cthat a meeting of shareholders for the election of trustees ... is held at least once within any [twelve] month period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery to \u201cunderstand the Funds\u2019 interpretation of the [b]ylaws and [to] uncover what reasons, if any, the Funds\u2019 trustees intend to advance as purported justification for the delay of the 2011 annual meeting.\u201d A judge in the Superior Court denied the motion after hearing, concluding that the discovery that was requested did not \u201cgo to the issue of what the bylaws mean,\u201d and that she did not thinlc that the Funds had committed a breach of the bylaws by delaying the annual meeting based \u201con the plain language of the bylaws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. On February 21,2012, another judge in the Superior Court interpreted the bylaws differently and granted summary judgment to Brigade. This judge ruled that the Funds\u2019 postponement of their annual shareholder meeting to July 31, 2012, violated \u00a7 10.2 of the bylaws, and ordered the Funds to \u201chold the annual shareholder meeting for the year 2011 as soon as practicable after the date of this order.\u201d The judge also declared that \u00a7 10.2 of the bylaws requires the Funds \u201cto schedule future annual shareholder meetings in or within twelve months of their last annual shareholder meetings.\u201d The judge noted that, \u201c[i]f the [bjylaws permitted the [Fjunds to hold a meeting once every calendar year or every fiscal year, then the Funds could effectively disenfranchise [their] shareholders for extended periods by holding meetings [twenty-three] months apart,\u201d for instance, by holding \u201cshareholder meetings in December, 2012, then January, 2013 (after providing shareholders with at least seven days notice) and then [holding] their next meeting in December, 2014.\u201d The judge reasoned that the requirement that annual shareholder meetings be held \u201con an annual basis\u201d reflects \u201c[s]ound corporate governance principles\u201d that ensure that shareholders have a \u201ctimely and essential voice\u201d where every twelve months they can \u201capprove or disapprove the Funds\u2019 directions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Judgment entered on February 29, 2012, but on March 15, 2012, a single justice of the Appeals Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a stay of the judgment pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 6 (a), as appearing in 454 Mass 1601 (2009). The single justice determined from \u201c[rjeading the various provisions of the by-laws together, and viewing the by-laws in the background context set by the [New York Stock Exchange] rules, ... the only hard and fast, enforceable commitment that the [Funds] made was to hold an annual shareholders meeting once per fiscal year.\u201d Therefore, he concluded that Brigade was \u201cunlikely to be able to succeed in showing that [they] had a contractual right to require that the next shareholder meeting be held earlier than July 31, 2012.\u201d As a result of the stay of the judgment pending appeal, the Funds\u2019 annual shareholders\u2019 meetings took place on July 31, 2012, rendering moot any appeal of the judge\u2019s order to hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d However, the appeal of that part of the judgment that declares that the Funds must schedule all future annual shareholder meetings \u201cin or within twelve months\u201d of their last annual shareholder meeting is not moot. We transferred the Fund\u2019s appeal to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo to determine \u2018whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Go-Best Assets Ltd. </em>v. <em>Citizens Bank of Mass., </em>463 Mass. 50, 54 (2012), quoting <em>Augat Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), as amended, 436 Mass. 1404 (2002); <em>Kourovacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 711-712 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">A corporation\u2019s articles of organization and its bylaws are a contract between the shareholders and the corporation. See <em>Chokel </em>v. <em>Genzyme Corp., </em>449 Mass. 272, 275 (2007) (articles of organization); <em>Geneneral Convention of the New Jerusalem in the United States of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>MacKenzie, </em>449 Mass. 832, 835 (2007) (MacKenzie) (bylaws). So, too, a declaration of trust and a business trust\u2019s bylaws are a contract between the trustees of the trust and the shareholders that defines the rights of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>trust\u2019s shareholders.8 <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>State St. Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>311 Mass. 299, 305-306 (1942). See generally Annot., 88 A.L.R.3d 704, 729-730 (1978) (declaration of trust is \u201cdeterminative of the nature of the organization and of the details of its operation\u201d). We therefore interpret them according to traditional principles of contract law. <em>MacKenzie, supra. </em>\u201cThe words of a contract must be considered in the context of the entire contract rather than in isolation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhen the words of a contract are clear, they must be construed in their usual and ordinary sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cContract language is ambiguous \u2018only if it is susceptible of more than one meaning and reasonably intelligent persons would differ as to which meaning is the proper one.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southern Union Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>458 Mass. 812, 820 (2011), quoting <em>Citation Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Gomez, </em>426 Mass. 379, 381 (1998). \u201c[E]xtrinsic evidence may be admitted when a contract is ambiguous on its face or as applied to the subject matter.\u201d <em>MacKenzie, supra </em>at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The requirement in \u00a7 10.2 of the bylaws that the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting \u201cshall be held, so long as Common Shares are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on at least an annual basis,\u201d clearly means that an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting must be held, at the very least, once every fiscal year. \u201cNormally, a dictionary definition of a term is strong evidence of its common meaning.\u201d <em>Matter of the Liquidation of Am. Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>440 Mass. 796, 801 (2004). \u201cAnnual\u201d is commonly defined as \u201cyearly\u201d or \u201crecurring once every year\u201d. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 997 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \u201cannual meeting\u201d as \u201cyearly meeting of shareholders\u201d); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 75 (3d ed. 1992) (defining \u201cannual\u201d as \u201c[rjecurring, done, or performed every year\u201d); Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary 56 (3d college ed. 1988) (defining \u201cannual\u201d as \u201chappening or appearing once a year\u201d). Although \u00a7 10.2 does not explicitly declare whether the \u201cannual basis\u201d refers to a fiscal or a calendar year, it implicitly recognizes that the Funds are subject to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>New York Stock Exchange\u2019s requirement that its listed companies hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting, and \u00a7 302.00 of the NYSE manual requires such meetings to be held \u201ceach fiscal year.\u201d Because, wholly apart from the bylaws, the Funds are subject to this requirement under \u00a7 302.00 of the NYSE manual, it would be contrary to common sense for \u00a7 10.2 to be interpreted to require an annual shareholders meeting each calendar year, where the Funds\u2019 fiscal year and the calendar year might not coincide.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Boston, Inc., </em>438 Mass. 187, 195 (2002), quoting <em>Cadle Co. </em>v. <em>Vargas, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 361, 366 (2002) (\u201cCommon sense is as much a part of contract interpretation as is the dictionary or the arsenal of canons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">On its face, however, \u00a7 10.2 is ambiguous as to whether the annual shareholders\u2019 meetings must be held at approximate twelve month intervals in different fiscal years, as the judge concluded on summary judgment and as Brigade contends, or at any time during a fiscal year, regardless of the interval of time between them, as the single justice concluded and as the Funds contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The Funds point to language in \u00a7 10.2 that suggests that the requirement to hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting remains only \u201cso long as Common Shares are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange,\u201d and contend that the bylaws impose no obligation regarding the frequency of the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting beyond that imposed by the NYSE manual to hold it each fiscal year. We disagree. The bylaws could have provided that the annual shareholders\u2019 meeting be held no more frequently than required by the NYSE manual or could have expressly incorporated the time period required by \u00a7 302.00 of the NYSE manual, but they do not. Where the Funds intended to limit the bylaws to requirements imposed by law, the Funds knew how to do so. For example, \u00a7 10.1 of the bylaws states that shareholders have the power to vote with respect to any manager or advisor \u201cto the extent required by the 1940 Act.\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 10.6(c) of the bylaws provides that any shareholder who intends to nominate a person for election as a trustee shall deliver \u201cany . . . information . . . required by paragraphs (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>(d), (e), and (f) of Item 401 of Regulations S-K [17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.401 (2010)] or paragraph (b) of Item 22 of Rule 14a-101 [Schedule 14A] [17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-101 (2011)] under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78a et seq. (2006 &amp; Supp. V)].\u201d We decline to interpret the bylaws as implicitly adopting or incorporating by reference the time period required in the NYSE manual, where they do not do so explicitly. See <em>NSTAR Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>462 Mass. 381, 394 (2012), quoting <em>Northrop Grumman Info. Tech., Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>535 F.3d 1339, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (\u201cthe language used in a contract to incorporate extrinsic material by reference . . . must clearly communicate that the purpose of the reference is to incorporate the referenced material into the contract [rather than merely to acknowledge that the referenced material is relevant to the contract, e.g., as background law or negotiating history]\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The Funds also argue that \u201con an annual basis\u201d should not be interpreted to mean \u201cat least every twelve months\u201d because \u00a7 10.6(c) of the bylaws expressly recognizes that the trustees permissibly might schedule an \u201cannual meeting\u201d more than thirteen months after the previous \u201cannual meeting.\u201d We interpret \u00a7 10.6 quite differently, and conclude that \u00a7 10.6(c), when read in conjunction with \u00a7 10.6(a) and \u00a7 10.2, suggests that regular annual shareholders\u2019 meetings must be scheduled no later than one year and thirty days after the previous year\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Section 10.6(c) of the bylaws details the notice provisions that shareholders must follow in order to bring a nomination for election as trustee or any other proposal before an \u201cannual meeting.\u201d It provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cTo be timely, the Shareholder Notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>of the Trust not less than forty-five (45) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the first anniversary date of the date on which the Trust first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year\u2019s annual meeting; . . . provided, . . . however, if and only if the annual meeting is not scheduled to be held within a period that commences thirty (30) days before the first anniversary date of the annual meeting for the preceding year <em>and ends thirty (30) days after such anniversary date </em>(an annual meeting date outside such period being referred to herein as an \u201cOther Annual Meeting Date\u201d), such Shareholder Notice must be given in the manner provided herein by the later of the close of business on (i) the date forty-five (45) days prior to such Other Annual Meeting Date or (ii) the tenth (10th) business day following the date such Other Annual Meeting Date is first publicly announced or disclosed\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">However, \u00a7 10.6(a) provides that, as used in \u00a7 10.6, \u201cthe term \u2018annual meeting\u2019 refers to any annual meeting of Shareholders <em>as well as </em>any special meeting held in lieu of an annual meeting\u201d (emphasis added). Under \u00a7 10.2, a \u201cspecial meeting held in lieu of an annual meeting\u201d may be called by the trustees where an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting is not held during the required annual period for any reason, including an omission \u201cby oversight.\u201d Section 10.2 also provides that \u201c[i]n the event that such a meeting is not held in any annual period ... a <em>subsequent </em>special meeting may be called by the Trustees and held in lieu of such meeting\u201d (emphasis added). Therefore, under \u00a7 10.2, a \u201cspecial meeting held in lieu of an annual meeting,\u201d where it is held, takes place \u201csubsequent\u201d to the \u201cannual period\u201d where an annual meeting of shareholders should have been held.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that, read in conjunction with \u00a7 10.6(a) and \u00a7 10.2, \u00a7 10.6(c) suggests that a regular annual shareholder meeting must be scheduled within the \u201cannual period,\u201d and that the \u201cannual period\u201d ends thirty days after the anniversary date of the last annual meeting. Any annual meeting held after the \u201cannual period\u201d is not a regular an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>nual shareholder meeting but a \u201cspecial meeting held in lieu of an annual meeting\u201d that is governed by different notice requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">This interpretation of the bylaws is consistent with how the Funds themselves appeared to interpret the phrase \u201con at least an annual basis\u201d until Brigade declared their intent to nominate a new trustee and the trustees delayed the meeting from its anticipated December 14, 2010, date to July 31, 2011. Until then, no regular annual shareholder meeting had been held more than thirty days after the anniversary date of the last annual meeting. See <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>411 Mass. 39, 59 (1991) (in interpreting contract, \u201cconduct of the parties after the signing of the agreements is . . . indicative of their intent\u201d); <em>Pittsfield &amp; N. Adams R.R. </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany R.R., </em>260 Mass. 390, 398 (1927), quoting <em>Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Dutcher, </em>95 U.S. 269, 273 (1877) (\u201cThere is no surer way to find out what parties meant, than to see what they have done\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">This interpretation is also more consistent with the usual meaning of \u201con at least an annual basis\u201d than the Funds\u2019 interpretation, which, as the judge noted in allowing Brigade\u2019s motion for summary judgment, potentially would have allowed the Funds to hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting in the first month of their fiscal year and not be required again to hold an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting until the last month of their next fiscal year, twenty-three months later, which would be closer to a biennial than an annual basis. See <em>Woogmaster </em>v. <em>Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Ins. Co., </em>312 Mass. 479, 481 (1942) (contracts should be construed to give words \u201ctheir usual and ordinary significance, unless it appears that they are to be given a peculiar or technical meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">To the extent that there is any ambiguity in the bylaws as to when a regular annual shareholders\u2019 meeting must be held, we construe the ambiguous provisions against the drafters, which here are the Funds. See <em>Benalcazar </em>v. <em>Goldsmith, </em>400 Mass. 111, 114 (1987), and cases cited. Moreover, where \u201cbylaw provisions are unclear, we resolve any doubt in favor of the stockholders\u2019 electoral rights.\u201d <em>Airgas Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>8 A.3d 1182, 1188 (Del. 2010).

The right of shareholders to vote for the trustees of a business trust is one of the most important rights arising from stock ownership. See <em>Albert E. Touchet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Touchet, </em>264 Mass. 499, 509 (1928), quoting <em>Camden &amp; Atl. R.R. </em>v. <em>Elkins, </em>37 N.J. Eq. 273, 276 (1883) (\u201cThe right to hold elections for the directors of a corporation, and to vote at such elections, is a right that is inherent in the ownership of stock\u201d); <em>Preston </em>v. <em>Allison, </em>650 A.2d 646, 649 (Del. 1994) (\u201cstockholder\u2019s ability to participate in corporate governance through the election of directors is a fundamental part of our corporate law\u201d); <em>ER Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>735 F. Supp. 1094, 1100 (D. Mass. 1990) (\u201cone of the most sacred rights of any shareholder is to participate in corporate democracy\u201d). See generally 5 W.M. Fletcher, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations \u00a7 2025, at 143 (rev. ed. 2011). The ability to nominate and elect different trustees is a crucial means for shareholders to prevent the entrenchment of poorly performing trustees. See <em>MM Cos. </em>v. <em>Liquid Audio, Inc., </em>813 A.2d 1118, 1127 (Del. 2003) (\u201cif the stockholders are not satisfied with the management or actions of their elected representatives on the board of directors, the power of corporate democracy is available to the stockholders to replace the incumbent directors when they stand for re-election\u201d); <em>Aronson </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>473 A.2d 805, 811 (Del. 1984), overruled on other grounds by <em>Brehm </em>v. <em>Eisner, 1A6 </em>A.2d 244 (Del. 2000) (\u201cThe machinery of corporate democracy and the derivative suit are potent tools to redress the conduct of a torpid or unfaithful management\u201d). Delay in holding a shareholder election diminishes electoral rights by allowing these trustees to become more deeply entrenched and to continue to harm the interests of shareholders. See <em>ER Holdings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton, Co., supra </em>at 1101 (\u201cThe Board\u2019s suggestion that its proffered special meeting does not endanger shareholder voting rights, but merely delays them, misses the point. Courts have consistently recognized the irreparable harm associated with delay in these contexts\u201d). Cf. Alterbaum, Control Share Acts, Closed-End Funds, and the Battle for Corporate Control, 17 Stan. J.L. Bus. &amp; Fin. 310, 332 (2012) (\u201cthe pressure imposed by takeover attempts on closed-end funds forces the funds\u2019 management to engage in value creating activities that raise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>share prices\u201d). Accordingly, we hold that any ambiguity in \u00a7 10.2 must be construed in favor of allowing the shareholders a timely and effective means of holding the trustees accountable.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Based on all these considerations, we interpret the Funds\u2019 bylaws to require that the Funds schedule future annual shareholders\u2019 meetings no later than thirty days after the anniversary of their last annual shareholders\u2019 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment requiring the Funds \u201cto schedule future annual meetings in or within twelve months of their last annual shareholder meetings\u201d is affirmed as modified to require the Funds to schedule future annual shareholders\u2019 meetings no later than thirty days after the anniversary of their last annual shareholders\u2019 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, Professor Jesse M.

These certificates, which resemble certificates for shares of stock in a corporation and are issued and transferred in like manner, entitle the holders to share rat-ably in the income of the property, and, upon termination of the trust, in the proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-9\"><em>Hecht </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>265 U.S. 144, 146-147 (1924). See G. L. c. 182, \u00a7 1 (defining business trust as \u201ca trust operating under a written instrument or declaration of trust, the beneficial interest under which is divided into transferable certificates of participation or shares\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">A Massachusetts business trust may operate in a similar fashion to a corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-11\">\u201cTitle to property in one case is held by the corporation and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>other by trustees; centralized management is effected in one by a board of directors and in the other by trustees; the continuity of both the corporation and the trust is uninterrupted by the death of a stockholder or shareholder; the transfer of beneficial interests in both is readily and easily accomplished by the transfer of the shares and the shareholders in each seek limited personal liability. The sum total of these distinctive features of a business trust has brought trusts into such close resemblance to corporations that they have been frequently considered as corporations, sometimes by virtue of constitutional or statutory provisions and sometimes without such provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\"><em>State St. Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>311 Mass. 299, 302-303 (1942).
