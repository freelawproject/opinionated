L. c. 149, \u00a7\u00a7 148 and 150 (Wage Act), are intended to be the exclusive remedy for the recovery of unpaid wages under Massachusetts law, preempting common-law breach of contract and related quasi-contract claims. We conclude that they are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Cyrus D. Lipsitt filed suit against the defendants, the Franklin D. Roosevelt American Heritage Center, Inc. (Heritage Center), and its president, Joseph J. Plaud, for failing to pay approximately $117,500 in compensation he claimed was owed to him under an employment contract. The complaint asserted claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and violations of the Wage Act, among others. A judge in the Superior Court dismissed all but Lipsitt\u2019s claim under the Wage Act, reasoning that the Wage Act is the exclusive remedy for the recovery of unpaid wages, thereby preempting his common-law claims. Further, because Wage Act claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations, G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, the judge ruled that Lipsitt\u2019s potential recovery would be limited to wages earned but unpaid during the three-year period preceding the filing of the suit. After voluntarily dismissing the remaining portion of his Wage Act claim with prejudice, Lipsitt appealed from the earlier dismissal, and we transferred his appeal to this court on our own motion. We reverse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting as true all factual allegations in the complaint and favorable inferences drawn therefrom. <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers 1-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011), and cases cited. We may also consider exhibits attached to the complaint and items appearing in the record. <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., </em>462 Mass. 164, 165-166 (2012), citing <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. 474, 477 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Plaud founded the Heritage Center in 2004 for the purpose of establishing a museum to showcase his collection of memorabilia focused on President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Just prior to the Heritage Center\u2019s opening, Plaud offered Lipsitt the position of museum director, and the parties agreed that Lipsitt would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>paid $2,000 per month for June and July, 2004, after which his salary would increase to $4,167 per month. Payments were to be made on the 15th and 30th of each month. The parties memorialized their agreement in October, 2004.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Heritage Center experienced financial difficulties from its inception. Lipsitt never received the full salary due to him under the contract, but continued to work for the Heritage Center based on Plaud\u2019s continuing representations to Lipsitt that the arrearages would be paid in full once debts owed to Plaud by third parties were paid. Most of the salary Lipsitt did in fact receive was paid from Plaud\u2019s personal checking account. Based on his desire to see the Heritage Center succeed and his belief that Plaud would honor his repeated promises to pay the back salary in full, Lipsitt continued to work for the Heritage Center through the summer of 2007.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In July, 2007, the city of Worcester, which owned the building where the Heritage Center was located, decided not to renew its lease with the Center and the Center closed its doors. Initially, Plaud intended to reopen the Center at a new location in Chicopee in late 2007, and Lipsitt continued to work for the Center performing tasks relative to the intended relocation. Ultimately, Plaud abandoned the relocation plan, and the Center never reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On September 17, 2008, Lipsitt filed a complaint with the Attorney General for nonpayment of wages pursuant to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150. On April 22, 2010, after an investigation, the Attorney General settled various Wage Act complaints with the Heritage Center and, on the same day, issued Lipsitt a right-to-sue letter. Lipsitt filed this action in Superior Court on September 20, 2010, seeking damages of approximately $117,500, a figure that apparently represents the roughly $127,000 he claims he is owed, minus the $9,000 in restitution he received from the Heritage Center pursuant to the terms of its settlement with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Attorney General. The complaint asserted claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, fraud and deceit, violations of the Wage Act, and violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety pursuant to Mass R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), arguing that the Wage Act creates a comprehensive statutory remedy for the recovery of unpaid wages, thereby precluding Lipsitt\u2019s common-law claims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and fraud and deceit. As to the Wage Act claim, the defendants argued it was time barred because more than three years had elapsed since the termination of Lipsitt\u2019s employment with the Heritage Center, which they contend occurred on July 31, 2007. Further, the defendants argued that G. L. c. 93A does not apply to employment relationships. Finally, Plaud argued that Lipsitt had failed to allege sufficient facts to pierce the corporate veil, which is a prerequisite to imposing individual liability on Plaud for the common-law claims. A judge in the Superior Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the common-law claims and the G. L. c. 93A claim, but not as to any portion of the Wage Act claim that alleged nonpayment of wages within the three-year period preceding the filing of the complaint.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Following the dismissal of the majority of his claims, Lipsitt moved to amend his complaint to plead sufficient facts to pierce the corporate veil and hold Plaud individually liable. The judge denied the motion principally on the basis that the amendment was futile where Lipsitt\u2019s common-law claims had aheady been dismissed as preempted. Subsequent depositions in the case cast doubt on the viability of Lipsitt\u2019s claim that he was employed by the Heritage Center (and thus owed salary) as of September 17, 2007 (three years prior to the commencement of the action), and Lipsitt moved to voluntarily dismiss the remaining Wage Act claim with prejudice so that he could appeal the dismissal of his common-law claims. Given the much longer six-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>statute of limitations for contract claims, G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2, and the fact that the majority of Lipsitt\u2019s damages in the form of unpaid salary accrued between six and three years prior to the commencement of the Superior Court action, the survival of the contract claim was vital to any meaningful recovery. Lipsitt appeals from the dismissal of his contract and quantum meruit claims, and from the dismissal of Plaud as a defendant in his individual capacity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Dismissal of common-law claims. </em>The Wage Act requires \u201c[ejvery person having employees in his service\u201d to pay \u201ceach such employee the wages earned\u201d within a fixed period after the end of each pay period. G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148. While acknowledging that there is \u201cscant precedent\u201d regarding whether the Wage Act preempts common-law claims for the recovery of unpaid wages, the motion judge nonetheless con-eluded that \u201c[i]n enacting the Wage Act, the legislature created a comprehensive vehicle for recovering unpaid wages\u201d and, accordingly, intended to preempt Lipsitt\u2019s common-law claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u201cIt is well established that \u2018an existing common law remedy is not to be taken away by statute unless by direct enactment or necessary implication.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eyssi </em>v. Lawrence, 416 Mass. 194, 199-200 (1993), quoting <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 521 (1980).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Where the statute does not contain any express language concerning the availability of common-law remedies, we consider the possibility of implied preemption. <em>Elyssi </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra. </em>This court has \u201clong held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>statutory repeal of the common law will not be lightly inferred; the Legislature\u2019s \u2018intent must be manifest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Passatempo </em>v. <em>McMenimen, </em>461 Mass. 279, 290 (2012), quoting <em>Comey </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Mass. 11, 20 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u201cThe purpose of the Wage Act is \u2018to prevent the unreasonable detention of wages.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., </em>462 Mass. 164, 170 (2012), quoting <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>435 Mass. 718, 720 (2002). See <em>American Mut. Liab. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>340 Mass. 144, 147 (1959). The Wage Act \u201cwas intended and designed to protect wage earners from the long-term detention of wages by unscrupulous employers as well as protect society from irresponsible employees who receive and spend lump sum wages.\u201d <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., supra, </em>quoting <em>Cumpata </em>v. <em>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>113 F. Supp. 2d 164, 167 (D. Mass. 2000). When the Wage Act was first enacted in 1886, its application \u201cwas initially limited to employees of a \u2018manufacturing, mining or quarrying, mercantile, railroad, street railway, telegraph, telephone and municipal corporation and every incorporated express company and water company.\u2019 \u201d <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., supra </em>at 171 &amp; n.6, quoting St. 1886 c. 87, \u00a7 1. Since that time, the \u201cLegislature has broadened the scope of employees covered, the type of eligible compensation, and the remedies available to employees whose rights have been violated\u201d (footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., supra </em>at 171. The private right of action that is at issue here, however, did not exist until the Legislature amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the Wage Act in 1993. Statute 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 182, codified at G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, \u201cdramatically increased\u201d the remedies available to employees, by authorizing a private right of action, including provisions for treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., supra </em>at 171 n.8. The Legislature later made treble damages mandatory by St. 2008, c. 80, \u00a7 5, superseding our decision in <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>The Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. 698, 709 (2005).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Thus, despite the arguably \u201ccomprehensive\u201d nature of the Wage Act in its current form, the earliest the Legislature collectively could have formed or manifested an intent to preempt common-law remedies was on the creation of the private right of action by the 1993 amendments. Unfortunately, the legislative record of the 1993 amendments sheds little light on the question. Instead, it demonstrates that the driving force behind the 1993 amendments was a desire to transfer enforcement of the Wage Act from the Department of Labor and Industries (department) to the Attorney General, amid criticism that the department was not aggressively enforcing the Wage Act for political reasons.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See St. 1993, c. 110, \u00a7 269 (transferring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>enforcement of Wage Act to office of Attorney General). It is inferable that the Legislature contemporaneously created the private right of action as a means further to ensure rigorous enforcement of the Wage Act, but this underlying purpose does not by itself suggest an intent to abrogate the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Essentially, where there is no indication of legislative intent to preempt the common law, the question is one of practicality. We must decide whether the common-law remedy is preempted by \u201cnecessary implication.\u201d <em>Eyssi </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>416 Mass. 194, 199-200 (1993), quoting <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, </em>381 Mass. 507, 521 (1980). Virtually all the cases on which the defendants (and the judge below) rely are distinguishable because they find an implied preclusion of common-law actions where \u201cthe legislature creates a new right or duty that \u2018is wholly the creature of statute [and] does not exist at common law.\u2019 \u201d Mansfield <em>vs. </em>Pitney Bowes, Inc., U.S. Dist. Ct., No. 12-1031-DJC, slip op. at 6 (D. Mass. Mar. 12, 2013) (Mansfield), quoting <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>362 Mass. 334, 338 (1972).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In contrast, the right of an employee to sue for breach of contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>or on a quasi-contract theory arising from the nonpayment of wages is so long standing and fundamental that it requires no citation. Lipsitt\u2019s claims for breach of contract, or, in the alternative, quantum meruit, do not depend on proving a violation of some statutorily created right. His claims for unpaid wages due him under an employment agreement were cognizable well prior to the creation of the Wage Act\u2019s private right of action in the 1993 amendments. Indeed, for much of the Wage Act\u2019s existence before then, an employee\u2019s principal recourse for the nonpayment of wages would have been to file a contract or quasi-contract action. As previously stated, \u201cstatutory repeal of the common law will not be lightly inferred; the Legislature\u2019s \u2018intent must be manifest. \u2019 \u201d <em>Passatempo </em>v. <em>McMenimen, </em>461 Mass. 279, 290 (2012). Had the Legislature intended the Wage Act \u2014 which was designed to <em>enhance </em>the rights of employees with respect to the payment of wages, see <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., </em>462 Mass. 164, 171 &amp; n.8 (2012) \u2014 to abrogate these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>long-standing common-law causes of action, \u201cwe think it would have done so explicitly.\u201d <em>Eyssi </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>416 Mass. 194, 200 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In <em>Passatempo </em>v. <em>McMenimen, supra, </em>we considered whether a provision of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 181, which grants to buyers of insurance the right of rescission against insurance companies whose officers or agents induced the sale of insurance by fraud, was intended to exclude other \u201clong-standing\u201d common-law remedies against insurance companies and their agents for fraud or misrepresentation. As to the right to bring suit against an agent individually, we reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">\u201cGiven the Legislature\u2019s expansion of the types of misrepresentation for which agents and employees could be criminally sanctioned, the heightened criminal sanctions it imposed on them, and its approval of expanded civil liability against the companies for which they sold insurance, it seems most unlikely that the Legislature intended to change course by insulating agents from this long-established right of action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\"><em>Passatempo </em>v. <em>McMenimen, supra </em>at 289. As to the ability of an insured to seek remedies other than rescission against the companies themselves, we stated: \u201c[T]he Legislature\u2019s desire to enhance deterrence makes it doubtful that the Legislature would have intended to preempt civil remedies other than rescission against insurance companies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Analogous in purpose to G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 181, the Wage Act is clearly intended to deter the nonpayment of wages through the imposition of enhanced penalties and remedies not available at common law. See <em>Melia </em>v. <em>Zenhire, Inc., supra. </em>Where, as is the case with the Wage Act, a statute is designed to <em>enhance </em>certain rights, we will not read it to abrogate common-law actions aimed at perfecting those same rights unless the statute requires such a reading by express language or necessary implication. <em>Eyssi </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The minimal practical impact that the continued existence of a common-law right to recover unpaid wages will have on the enforcement scheme established by the Wage Act further supports our conclusion that the Wage Act does not preempt the common law by necessary implication. On this point, the defendants argue that the continued existence of a common-law cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>of action for unpaid wages will frustrate the purposes of the Wage Act\u2019s requirement that an employee report a Wage Act claim to the Attorney General\u2019s office before proceeding in court. We disagree. First, we note that the reporting requirement in G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 150, \u201cis intended simply to ensure that the Attorney General receives notice of the alleged violations, so that she may investigate and prosecute such violations at her discretion.\u201d <em>Depianti </em>v. <em>Jan-Pro Franchising Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>465 Mass. 607, 612 (2013), citing <em>Nahigian </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>233 F. Supp. 2d 151, 164 (D. Mass. 2002). \u201c[Ujnlike the filing requirement in [the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B], the filing requirement in \u00a7 150 triggers no mandatory agency investigation or administrative adjudicatory action\u201d and therefore does not operate \u201cas the necessary first step in a comprehensive remedial scheme. ...\u201d <em>Depianti </em>v. <em>Jan-Pro Franchising Int\u2019l, Inc., supra </em>at 613-614. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5 (filing of complaint with Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination [MCAD] triggers mandatory \u201cprompt investigation\u201d by that agency, after which, if allegations prove credible, MCAD shall \u201cimmediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful practice complained of . . .by conference, conciliation and persuasion\u201d). Although we will not speculate on every single reason an employee might chose to pursue a common-law contract or quasi-contract claim <em>in lieu of </em>a Wage Act claim, we suspect this will largely occur only in cases such as this one, where an employee\u2019s Wage Act claims are time barred.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This is true for the simple reason that it would be foolhardy for an employee to forgo the mandatory award of treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees provided by the Wage Act in the event the employee prevails on such a claim. Some plaintiffs may choose to plead common-law claims in addition to or in the alternative to Wage Act claims, if, for instance, there is some dispute over the applicability of the Wage Act that cannot be resolved at the pleadings stage. See Mansfield, <em>supra </em>at 8 n.5.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Moreover, for cases where an employee\u2019s Wage Act claims <em>are </em>time barred, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the employee would have little reason to report the claim to the Attorney General\u2019s office in the first place, as he or she would be unable to bring the claim in court. We therefore doubt that our holding today will have any appreciable effect on the reporting of Wage Act claims or the enforcement scheme generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The fact that, in cases like the present one, an employer whose Wage Act liability for treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees has been extinguished will nonetheless be exposed to simple contract liability for an additional three-year period is consistent with both the public policy objectives underlying the Wage Act and the status of an employment agreement as a contract like any other. In <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Townsend Oil Co., </em>464 Mass. 1, 6-7 (2012), we held that an employee whose claim for unpaid overtime pursuant to G. L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A, was time barred under that statute\u2019s two-year statute of limitations could nonetheless assert a claim for unpaid wages under the Wage Act, with his recovery limited to uncompensated time worked at the regular rate instead of the premium statutory overtime rate. In so holding, we \u201c[struck] a balance between the Legislature\u2019s intent behind the Wage Act that employees receive timely payment of wages, . . . and the Legislature\u2019s intent to draw a nominal distinction between overtime wages and regular wages by establishing different statute of limitations periods\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Townsend Oil Co., supra </em>at 7, citing <em>Mogilevsky </em>v. <em>Bally Total Fitness Corp., </em>263 F. Supp. 2d 164, 169-170 (D. Mass. 2003). With the Wage Act, the Legislature has subjected employers to enhanced penalties for the unreasonable detention or nonpayment of wages, including mandatory treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees, while at the same time establishing a relatively short, three-year statute of limitations. It does not upset this balance to continue to subject employers to normal contract liability for the full six-year statute of limitations period applicable to contracts generally. See Mansfield, <em>supra </em>at 8 (\u201cthe statute can also be seen to simply create an alternate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>remedial option: the statute creates a right to treble damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs that does not exist in the common law and balances this right with a shortened recovery period\u201d). Particularly where an employee\u2019s Wage Act claims are time barred, we see no good reason why, given the strong presumption against implied abrogation of the common law, that employee cannot seek to recover those unpaid wages by bringing a contract or quasi-contract claim. See <em>Passatempo </em>v. <em>McMenimen, </em>461 Mass. 279, 297 (2012) (\u201cContrary to [the defendant\u2019s] assertions, the mere fact that the G. L. c. 93A violations alleged would also support a common-law tort claim does not make them subject to the shorter, three-year statute of limitations.\u201d); <em>Rita </em>v. <em>Carella, </em>394 Mass. 822, 822-823 (1985) (tenants who brought action alleging landlord charged rent in excess of maximum lawful rent entitled to pursue G. L. c. 93A claim, which carried four-year statute of limitations, where one-year statute of limitations applicable to rent control ordinance had expired).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">b. <em>Dismissal of Plaud as a defendant. </em>Lipsitt also challenges the dismissal of Plaud as a defendant on the ground that Lipsitt failed to plead sufficient facts to pierce the Heritage Center\u2019s corporate veil and hold Plaud personally hable for the Center\u2019s liabilities. A complaint \u201cdoes not need detailed factual allegations\u201d to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, but \u201crequires more than labels and conclusions\u201d and must contain \u201c \u2018allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)\u2019 an entitlement to relief.\u201d <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008), quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 557 (2007). Here, the judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">\u201cLipsitt has alleged only that \u2018Plaud failed to observe the corporate formalities, paid Lipsitt from his personal checking account and otherwise co-mingled his personal business with that of the [Heritage Center].\u2019 . . . This allegation is insufficient under <em>[Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor </em>Co.]\u2019s plausibility standard to establish Plaud\u2019s individual liability under <em>[Evans </em>v. <em>Multicon Constr. Corp., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 728 (1991)]. Therefore, Plaud must be dismissed as a defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>Evans </em>v. <em>Multicon Constr.

All factors should be considered, \u201cbut the exercise is, of course, not one in counting.\u201d <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Multicon Constr. Corp., supra </em>at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Although the doctrine of corporate disregard is an equitable tool that is only to be employed by courts \u201cin rare situations, to ignore corporate formalities, where such disregard is necessary to provide a meaningful remedy for injuries and to avoid injustice,\u201d <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>M.C.K., Inc., supra </em>at 555, we are concerned today only with whether Lipsitt\u2019s complaint contained sufficient factual allegations to survive a motion to dismiss this claim,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> not whether the facts once fully developed will ultimately justify piercing the corporate veil and holding Plaud personally liable. The factual allegations in the original complaint, which included that Plaud intended to pay Lipsitt\u2019s back salary once debts owed to Plaud were paid,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that the Heritage Center had not filed any corporate tax returns, and that any salary Lipsitt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>did in fact receive was paid from Plaud\u2019s personal checking account and without any withholdings, were sufficient under the <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>plausibility standard to survive a motion to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 636. The factual allegations contained in the original complaint, although not as detailed as they might have been, touched on at least half of the factors set forth in <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Multicon Constr. Corp., supra, </em>and \u201cplausibly suggest\u201d an entitlement to relief. Accordingly, Plaud should not have been dismissed as a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">c. <em>Denial of motion to amend. </em>Alternatively, Lipsitt\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to plead his veil piercing claim with more specificity should have been allowed. \u201cA party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served and prior to entry of an order of dismissal. . . . Otherwise a party may amend his pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 15 (a), 365 Mass. 761 (1974). \u201cAlthough leave to amend is within the discretion of the judge, leave should be granted unless there appears some good reason for denying the motion.\u201d <em>Goulet </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., </em>399 Mass. 547, 549 (1987), citing <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>372 Mass. 288, 289 (1977). \u201cSuch reasons include \u2018undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party ...[,] futility of amendment, etc.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goulet </em>v. <em>Whitin Mach. Works, Inc., supra </em>at 549-550, quoting <em>Castellucci </em>v. <em>United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., supra </em>at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The judge denied the motion to amend \u201cfor the reasons set forth in [Plaud\u2019s] memorandum in opposition at pages 3-9 inclusive.\u201d That section of Plaud\u2019s opposition argued that the proposed amendment was futile where Lipsitt\u2019s underlying common-law claims had already been dismissed as statutorily preempted, and where Lipsitt\u2019s proposed amended complaint did not, in Plaud\u2019s view, cure the deficiencies of the original complaint.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The first part of Plaud\u2019s futility argument is rendered moot by our decision today reinstating Lipsitt\u2019s common-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit. Further, because the factual allegations in Lipsitt\u2019s original complaint were sufficient to state a claim for corporate disregard, it follows that a fortiori, Lipsitt\u2019s amended complaint, which expands on and supplements those factual allegations, is also sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"A5x\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>Because the Legislature did not intend the Wage Act to be the exclusive remedy for the recovery of unpaid wages, Lipsitt\u2019s common-law claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit should not have been dismissed. Further, because Lipsitt pleaded sufficient facts to state a claim against Plaud on a theory of piercing the corporate veil \u2014 or, in the alternative, should have been allowed to amend his complaint in that regard \u2014 Plaud should not have been dismissed as a defendant. The judgment of dismissal is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"ARX\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Cyrus D. Lipsitt also appeals from the judge\u2019s dismissal of Joseph J. Plaud as a defendant in his individual capacity, on the ground that the complaint failed to plead sufficient facts to state a claim for piercing the corporate veil, as well as the judge\u2019s denial of Lipsitt\u2019s motion to amend his complaint to correct any deficiencies in the pleading of this theory of liability. The Wage Act provides for individual liability for corporate officers, see G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 148; <em>Wiedmann </em>v. <em>The Bradford Group, Inc., </em>444 Mass. 698, 711 (2005), and therefore piercing the corporate veil is relevant only in relation to Lipsitt\u2019s claims against Plaud for breach of contract and quantum meruit. Because our decision reinstates those common-law claims, we reach this issue as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\">The complaint alleges that the parties entered into a written agreement in August, 2004, but a copy of the contract included in the record indicates it was executed on October 14, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The exact date that Lipsitt terminated his employment with the Heritage Center is the subject of dispute, with the defendants contending it occurred on July 31, 2007, and Lipsitt contending it occurred sometime after that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The defendants also moved to dismiss the entire complaint, arguing that the settlement with the Attorney General operated as an accord and satisfaction of all of Lipsitt\u2019s claims.

Because the \u201cright to have service charges imposed by [a service employer] distributed only to certain categories of employees is created by [G.

Compare <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Reilly, supra </em>at 338-339 (statute imposing fine as sole remedy available against workers engaged in unlawful strike held not to preempt employer\u2019s petition for injunctive relief where \u201cthe duty sought to be enforced is contractual in nature and is not wholly the creature of statute. . . . There is nothing in the enactment of [the statute that] would warrant the conclusion that this enactment was intended to restrict previously existing common law remedies for breach of contract in the employer-employee context\u201d), with <em>School Comm. of Lowell </em>v. <em>Mayor of Lowell, </em>265 Mass. 353, 357 (1928) (\u201cThe duty [of municipalities to raise taxes for the benefit of the public schools] which the petitioners seek to have enforced is \u2018wholly the creature of statute.\u2019 It does not exist at common law.

Cf. <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Sara Lee Corp., </em>508 F.3d 181, 192-195 (4th Cir. 2007), and cases cited (employees\u2019 State law claims for breach of contract, negligence, and fraud preempted by Federal Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA] enforcement scheme where those State claims \u201call depended] on establishing that [the employer] violated the FLSA\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b272-21\">We note that even in this case, where the Wage Act claims ultimately proved to be time barred, Lipsitt still filed a complaint with the Attorney General\u2019s office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b272-24\">However, where a complaint is filed within the three-year period for bringing claims under the Wage Act and the Wage Act plainly applies to all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>the damages sought, it would make little sense for a plaintiff to add a common-law claim against a corporate officer where the key issue will be whether that corporate officer is individually liable under a veil-piercing theory. This is so because individual liability of corporate officers is clear under the Wage Act, see G.
