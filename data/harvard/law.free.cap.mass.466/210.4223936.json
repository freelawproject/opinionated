Following binding arbitration mandated under the collective bargaining agreement, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>arbitrator found that the city had violated the collective bargaining agreement and awarded the officer damages and reinstatement to his original position. The city filed a motion in the Superior Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, to vacate the award. A Superior Court judge denied the city\u2019s motion and allowed the union\u2019s cross motion to confirm the award. The city appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The city argues, and we agree, that assignment and transfer of officers within the Boston police department (department) are nondelegable statutory powers of the Boston police commissioner (commissioner), see St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1, and, accordingly, that the grievance arbitrator exceeded his authority in reversing the officer\u2019s transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\"><em>Background and prior proceedings. </em>In 1989, the city and the union underwent interest arbitration<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as part of a collective bargaining process. The city had proposed a provision that would have prohibited the involuntary transfer of union representatives, but the parties were unable to reach agreement on how many officers would be covered by that provision. The proposal followed several years of litigation over what the union alleged was the city\u2019s practice of antiunion transfers. In 1985, the city settled a Federal case involving allegations that the police commissioner used transfers to retaliate against certain superior officers for their union activities. That settlement agreement, as well as a 1987 agreement in a related case, stipulated that the city would not transfer current or former union representatives without their consent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following adoption of that settlement agreement, several disputes arose concerning whether the city had violated the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>In a written opinion and award in which this history was discussed, the interest arbitrator ordered that the transfer provision at issue here, art. XVI, \u00a7 6A, be inserted in the collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That provision, covering a specified number of union officers and area representatives, has remained unchanged in several successor contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The grievance that gave rise to this appeal was filed in 2008. Pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 2 <em>(b),</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the city sought to stay arbitration of the grievance, on the ground that the transfer provision was invalid and thus could not be arbitrated. A Superior Court judge declined to issue a stay. In 2009, an arbitrator heard the grievance and determined that the issue was arbitrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We summarize the facts relevant to the grievance, based on the arbitrator\u2019s findings. See <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>435 Mass. 54, 61 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1131 (2002). Sergeant Ralph Caulfield is a Boston police officer who served as an area representative of the union at the D-14 police station in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Brighton section of Boston. In January, 2007, Caulfield and another sergeant were involved in a physical fight in the duty supervisor room, during which Caulfield punched the other officer in the face. The station captain suspended the other officer, but did not suspend or otherwise discipline Caulfield. Although the two men did not work on the same shift, as supervisors they were required to interact and to exchange information during shift changes. The other officer said that an underlying tension remained between the two. The station captain and the chief of field services for the department agreed that Caulfied\u2019s effectiveness as a supervisor had been compromised, and discussed transferring him. A transfer order was issued in June, 2007, but was quickly rescinded, and Caulfield was placed on medical leave until September 14, 2007, when he returned to the D-14 station. In February, 2008, he was transferred due to what the city said were ongoing concerns about his supervisory authority. The union then filed a grievance on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The arbitrator issued an award invalidating the transfer and granting Caulfield damages and the opportunity to return to his original station assignment. The city filed a motion in the Superior Court to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award, and the union filed a cross motion to confirm the award. A second Superior Court judge denied the city\u2019s motion to vacate the award, and granted the union\u2019s motion confirming the award. The judge concluded that the so-called \u201cpolice commissioner\u2019s statute,\u201d St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, as appearing in St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1, was silent on the issue of transfer, and thus that the Legislature did not intend to create a nondelegable authority in the police commissioner to transfer personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>When an arbitrator makes a binding award pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, a Superior Court judge may vacate or alter the award if, inter alia, it was procured by \u201ccorruption, fraud or other undue means,\u201d the arbitrator was evidently corrupt or partial, or \u201cthe arbitrator[] exceeded [his or her] powers.\u201d G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. The city argues that the transfer provision at issue impermissibly delegates the commissioner\u2019s statutory power to assign and organize officers, and thus that the award was outside the arbitrator\u2019s authority. The union contends that the transfer provision is valid, and arbitrable, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>because the city consented to its inclusion in the collective bargaining agreement. We conclude that the city is correct and that the award must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">a. <em>Nondelegable powers of commissioner. </em>The commissioner\u2019s powers are statutorily defined. The commissioner has \u201cauthority to appoint, establish and organize the [Boston] police\u201d department, St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7 10, as appearing in St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1, and has \u201ccognizance and control of the government, administration, disposition and discipline of the department, and of the police force of the department and shall make all needful rules and regulations for the efficiency of said police.\u201d St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7 11, as appearing in St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">As an initial matter, we must determine whether these statutory provisions confer on the commissioner an exclusive, nondelegable authority to assign and transfer police officers. See generally <em>Department of State Police </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Eng\u2019rs &amp; Scientists, </em>456 Mass. 450, 455 (2010).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Analysis of whether a legislative grant of \u201cgeneral management powers\u201d to a public official or body creates a nondelegable authority \u201chas been directed towards defining the boundary between subjects that by statute, by tradition, or by common sense must be reserved to the sole discretion of the public employer so as to preserve the intended role of the governmental agency and its accountability in the political process.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 178 (1997). See <em>Chief Justice for Admin. &amp; Mgt. of the Trial Court </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Employment Relations Bd., </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 374, 381 (2011), citing <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Teachers Union, Local </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>66, Am. Fed\u2019n of Teachers (AFL-CIO), </em>378 Mass. 65, 71 &amp; n.13 (1979) (\u201cOne purpose of the principle is the retention of public policy making in the hands of governmental employers accountable directly or indirectly through \u2018the normal political process,\u2019 and the prevention of the devolution of policy making to the narrower perspective and accountability of interest group bargaining\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Although the statutory language does not contain the word \u201ctransfer,\u201d the statutory provision defining the commissioner\u2019s authority, by its plain language, confers nondelegable authority over the assignment and organization of the officers within the department. Pursuant to St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11, as appearing in St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1, \u201c[t]he commissioner\u2019s authority .. . has been recognized to be broad.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. 680, 684 (1989). See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (1990), and cases cited (St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, and 14, as appearing in St. 1962, c. 322, \u00a7 1, confers \u201cbroad administrative control and discretion of the police commissioner of Boston\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">\u201c[Considerations of public safety and a disciplined police force require managerial control over matters such as staffing levels, assignments, uniforms, weapons, definition of duties, and deployment of personnel. . . . [T]he deployment of officer personnel to meet the tasks and responsibilities of the department is a fundamental and customary prerogative of municipal management which falls squarely within [St. 1906, c. 291, \u00a7 11] . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\"><em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 272 (1996). See, e.g., <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>403 Mass. at 684 (assignment of one patrol officer to marked patrol vehicle instead of two officers per vehicle was made pursuant to nondelegable authority); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Superior Officers Fed\u2019n, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 299 (2001) (assignment of officer to temporary duties is nondelegable authority).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">There is therefore no basis to conclude that a \u201ctransfer\u201d of an officer falls outside the scope of the commissioner\u2019s power to \u201cappoint, establish and organize.\u201d An assignment or deploy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>ment cannot be irrevocable, or managers would have no ability to react to changing conditions in arranging the police force into the necessary bureaus, units, and divisions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">b. <em>City\u2019s consent to provision. </em>The union argues that, even if art. XVI, \u00a7 6A, purports to delegate the commissioner\u2019s nondelegable managerial authority, it should nevertheless be binding on the city because the city consented to the provision. Furthermore, the union maintains, the city has not sought to excise the provision from several successor contracts. Regardless of whether the city\u2019s consent to art. XVI, \u00a7 6A, may be gleaned from the fraught history between the parties, a nondelegable authority may not be delegated to an arbitrator, even with the parties\u2019 consent. See, e.g., <em>Department of State Police </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Org. of State Eng\u2019rs &amp; Scientists, supra </em>at 457 (holding dispute under collective bargaining agreement not arbitrable as delegation of nondelegable authority, without reference to whether provision was consented to by parties). Cf. <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>41 Mass. App. Ct. at 270 n.3 (\u201cThe fact that the city agreed to arbitrate the grievance is of no legal consequence if the issue is beyond the authority of the arbitrator\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because the grievance arbitrator exceeded his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>authority in invalidating the officer\u2019s transfer, the arbitration award cannot stand. The judgment affirming the grant of the arbitration award is vacated and set aside. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court, where judgment shall enter for the city on its motion to vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\" \u2018Interest\u2019 arbitration characterizes the arbitration of labor disputes that \u2018involve the question of what shall be the basic terms and conditions of employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>School Comm. of Hanover </em>v. <em>Hanover Teachers Ass\u2019n, </em>435 Mass. 736, 738 n.2 (2002), quoting F.
