Simkin, a New Hampshire resident, held a temporary nonresident Class A unrestricted license to carry firearms in Massachusetts (license). Following an incident that occurred on November 6, 2009, the firearms records bureau<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>(bureau) revoked Simkin\u2019s license, deeming him no longer a \u201csuitable person\u201d to possess it. A judge in the District Court ordered that Simkin\u2019s license be reinstated. The bureau appealed the decision to the Superior Court, where a judge ruled in favor of the bureau and vacated the order of the District Court. We granted Simkin\u2019s application for direct appellate review to consider whether the \u201csuitable person\u201d requirement set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, applies to temporary nonresident licenses issued pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 13 IF. Although we conclude that it does, we also conclude that in the absence of regulations further defining unsuitability, no reasonable ground existed to revoke Simkin\u2019s license. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>We summarize the relevant facts as found by the District Court judge, supplemented where necessary by undisputed facts in the record. Simkin is a New Hampshire resident and a federally licensed firearms dealer who is engaged in the \u201cbuying and selling [of] firearms in the region, from private parties, at gun shows, and at auctions.\u201d Since 2002, he has held a temporary nonresident Class A unrestricted license to carry firearms in Massachusetts. In February, 2009, Simkin applied to the bureau for a renewal of his license, stating as his purpose for requesting the renewal that he traveled in and through Massachusetts for business purposes, carrying firearms, ammunition, and cash, and carried concealed firearms for personal protection. The bureau renewed his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">On November 6, 2009, Simkin traveled to Stoneham for a medical appointment. At the medical office, and in order to protect his privacy, Simkin used a pseudonym (\u201cHorace Jones\u201d) and registered under a Maryland address. He also declined to provide a telephone number, and, at the conclusion of the medical examination, paid the $1,500 bill in cash. Prior to disrobing in the examination room, Simkin informed the medical assistant that he was armed and proceeded to secure his weapons (two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>firearms, ammunition, and four knives) in a locked briefcase for the duration of the examination. Employees of the medical office were \u201calarmed\u201d and \u201cconcerned for their safety\u201d based on Simkin\u2019s conduct, and one of the employees contacted Stoneham police much later that day to report their concerns.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Stoneham police Detective Robert McKinnon contacted law enforcement officials in Maryland, who gave him the name of an individual who lived at the address in Maryland that Simkin had provided to the medical office. McKinnon made a telephone call to the individual at the address and explained that he wanted to speak to \u201cHorace Jones.\u201d The individual asked why Mc-Kinnon was looking for \u201cJones,\u201d and after McKinnon told him, the individual explained that \u201cHorace Jones\u201d was a pseudonym used by a friend to protect his identity, that \u201cJones\u201d lived in Nashua, New Hampshire, and that he would have \u201cJones\u201d contact McKinnon. McKinnon then received a telephone call from an attorney, Marvin Greenberg, from Woburn. McKinnon informed Greenberg that he needed the true name of \u201cHorace Jones\u201d and documentation of his license to carry firearms in Massachusetts. In response, Simkin sent an electronic mail message to McKinnon in which he gave his real name, explained that he used a pseudonym at the medical office in order to protect his privacy, and indicated that he was licensed to carry concealed firearms. He attached to the message copies of his Massachusetts license and his Federal firearms license, as well as copies of receipts for payment for the medical services. Mc-Kinnon confirmed receipt and thanked Simkin for his cooperation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">McKinnon reported the incident to the bureau. By letter dated November 13, 2009, bureau director Jason A. Guida informed Simkin that his license was thereby revoked because, on the basis of the information provided to him by McKinnon and the manager of the medical office regarding the incident on November 6, Guida determined that Simkin was no longer a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201csuitable person\u201d to possess a firearm in Massachusetts.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Specifically, Guida made this determination on the basis that (1) Simkin\u2019s visit to the medical office while \u201cheavily armed\u201d fell outside the \u201cbusiness activity\u201d of buying and selling firearms that Simkin indicated on his license application as the reason he sought the license; (2) Simkin caused \u201cfear and alarm\u201d at the medical office; and (3) Simkin used a false name in order to conceal his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Simkin filed a petition for judicial review in the District Court seeking various forms of relief, including an order vacating the revocation of his license. The parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment. A judge found in favor of Simkin and ordered that his license be reinstated. She concluded that \u201csuitability\u201d was not an appropriate ground for license revocation because it is not one of the five disqualifying factors set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 13 IF,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which governs temporary nonresident licenses to carry firearms. Further, the judge reasoned that even if suitability were an appropriate ground for revocation, there was no reasonable ground for the bureau to have found Simkin unsuitable arising from his visit to the medical office. First, because Simkin\u2019s license was unrestricted, he was entitled to carry firearms \u201cfor all lawful purposes,\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(a), </em>including personal protection. Second, there was no support for the bureau\u2019s contention that Simkin did anything to cause fear and alarm at the medical office apart from the fact that he was carrying concealed weapons, something that he was lawfully entitled to do. Third, although Simkin used a pseudonym while receiving medical treatment in order to protect his privacy, there was no suggestion that Simkin was committing a crime or perpetrating a fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The bureau filed an action in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4, in the Superior Court, seeking review of the District Court judge\u2019s decision. The parties filed cross motions for judgment on the pleadings. A judge in the Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Court allowed the bureau\u2019s motion, denied Simkin\u2019s motion, and vacated the order of the District Court reinstating Simkin\u2019s license. The judge concluded that the \u201csuitable person\u201d requirement set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, <em>is </em>applicable to temporary nonresident licenses issued pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131F. Further, she concluded that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d existed for the bureau to determine that Simkin was not a \u201csuitable person\u201d based on his \u201cunusual\u201d behavior at the medical office, which caused the staff to be \u201cconcem[ed] for their safety,\u201d as well as \u201cthe disconnect between [Simkin\u2019s] business-related licensure and his possible need to protect himself with two guns, four knives, and several magazines of spare ammunition inside a physician\u2019s office.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 8We now address both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Applicability of \u201csuitability\u201d requirement to temporary nonresident licenses. </em>General Laws c. 140, \u00a7 131 (\u00a7 131), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-6\"><em>\u201cAll licenses to carry firearms </em>shall be designated Class A or Class B, and the issuance and possession of any such license <em>shall be subject to the following conditions and restrictions:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\"><em>\u201c(f) </em>A license issued under this section shall be revoked or suspended by the licensing authority, or his designee, upon the occurrence of any event that would have disqualified the holder from being issued such license or from having such license renewed.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] A <em>license may be revoked or suspended by the licensing authority if it appears that the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>holder is no longer a suitable person to possess such a license.,, </em>(Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">In turn, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131F (\u00a7 131F), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">\u201cA Class A or Class B temporary license to carry firearms . . . may be issued by the colonel of the state police, or persons authorized by him, to a nonresident . . . subject to such terms and conditions as said colonel may deem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>proper; provided, however, that no license shall be issued to a person [falling into any one of five enumerated disqualifying categories not applicable here].<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">\u201cSuch license shall be valid for a period of one year but the colonel may renew such license, if in his discretion, such renewal is necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cThe fee for an application for the license shall be [one hundred dollars], which shall be payable to the licensing authority and shall not be prorated or refunded in case of revocation or denial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Simkin contends that his license is governed solely by \u00a7 131F, which, in his view, is a wholly self-contained statute governing temporary nonresident licenses to carry firearms. If this were true, Simkin\u2019s license could not be revoked on the basis of suitability, because although \u00a7 131F sets forth five specific disqualifies, see G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131F (i)-(v), nowhere does it feature the \u201csuitable person\u201d requirement found in \u00a7 131 (f). The bureau counters that \u00a7 131 establishes a comprehensive licensing scheme applicable to <em>all </em>licenses to carry firearms in Massachusetts, with \u00a7 131F providing supplementary rules for temporary nonresident licenses. The suitability requirement set forth in \u00a7 131 <em>(f) </em>would therefore apply to temporary nonresident licenses such as Simkin\u2019s. We agree with the bureau\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We interpret a statute \u201caccording to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 482, 487 488 (1984), quoting <em>Industrial Fin. Corp. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm\u2019n, 367 </em>Mass. 360, 364 (1975). \u201c[T]he statutory language itself is the principal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). \u201cA fundamental tenet of statutory interpretation is that statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The first paragraph of \u00a7 131 reads: <em>\u201cAll licenses </em>to carry firearms shall be designated Class A or Class B, and the issuance and possession of <em>any such license </em>shall be subject to the following conditions and restrictions: ...\u201d (emphasis added). The plain language of the first paragraph thus strongly suggests that \u00a7 131 applies to all licenses to carry firearms, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>those issued to nonresidents. The first paragraph also makes clear that <em>all </em>licenses are designated either Class A or B, and that \u201cany such license\u201d \u2014 in other words, <em>any </em>license to carry firearms in Massachusetts \u2014 is subject to the conditions imposed by \u00a7 131. Meanwhile, although \u00a7 131F provides that \u201c[a] Class A or Class B temporary license to carry firearms . . . may be issued ... to a nonresident,\u201d \u00a7 131F does not define what is meant by either \u201cClass A\u201d or \u201cClass B.\u201d Rather, those terms are defined only in \u00a7 131. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (a) &amp; <em>(b). </em>The clear implication is that a license like Simkin\u2019s \u2014 a Class A temporary nonresident license to carry firearms \u2014 is \u201csubject to the . . . conditions and restrictions\u201d imposed by \u00a7 131, in addition to being subject to the provisions unique to temporary nonresident licenses imposed by \u00a7 131F.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">An interpretation that subjects all licenses, including temporary nonresident licenses, to the suitable person requirement set forth in \u00a7 131 <em>(f) </em>is consistent with \u201c[t]he goal of firearms control legislation in Massachusetts^ which] is to limit access to deadly weapons by irresponsible persons.\u201d <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 258 (1984). Standing alone, \u00a7 13 IF would create an inherently deficient nonresident licensing scheme. Section 131 is a comprehensive, wide-ranging statute governing all aspects of licensure. See <em>Hightower </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>693 F.3d 61, 65-68 (1st Cir. 2012) (detailing Massachusetts firearms licensing scheme as established by \u00a7 131). It, among other things, defines in detail the two classes of licenses (Class A and Class B) in \u00a7 131 <em>(a) </em>and <em>(b); </em>establishes eligibility requirements in \u00a7 131 <em>(d); </em>sets out the procedures by which the licensing authority must process and evaluate applications in \u00a7 131 (e); addresses revocation and suspension of licenses and the procedures by which aggrieved parties may file appeals in \u00a7 131 (f); specifies the shape, size, and other attributes of the license itself in \u00a7 131 (g); and imposes civil and criminal penalties for various transgressions, such as providing false information in a license application, in \u00a7 131 <em>(h).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">If \u00a7 131 were inapplicable to nonresidents, as Simkin argues, it would undermine the basic public safety objectives of the firearms licensing scheme. Most notably, although \u00a7 131F states that the license application fee \u201cshall not be prorated or refunded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>in the event of revocation,\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131F, tenth par., it sets forth no standards or procedures for revocation and in fact contains no other reference to revocation. Where the Legislature contemplated revocation of a temporary nonresident license, yet made no provision for such revocation in \u00a7 131F, it follows that the revocation provisions set forth in \u00a7 131 (f), including the suitability requirement, are intended to apply to all licenses to carry firearms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If \u00a7 131F were viewed in isolation, then the absence of language authorizing revocation could be construed to mean that a nonresident license to carry firearms could never be revoked, irrespective of a license holder\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In support of his argument that the provisions of \u00a7 131, including the suitable person requirement, have no application to temporary nonresident licenses issued pursuant to \u00a7 131F, Simkin identifies four variations between \u00a7 131 and \u00a7 131F that he contends demonstrate that they create two separate and distinct licensing regimes, one for residents and one for nonresidents. Simkin places the most emphasis on the fact, which we have already acknowledged, that \u00a7 131F contains five enumerated dis-qualifiers but does not mention suitability.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by Simkin\u2019s argument. The suitable person requirement in \u00a7 131 is not set forth as a specific, enumerated disqualifies but instead as a general prerequisite to the issuance of a license in \u00a7 131 <em>(d), </em>and as a ground for revocation or suspension of a license in \u00a7 131 (f). Therefore, it is not surprising that \u00a7 131F, which lists only the specific, enumerated disqualifiers but does not discuss eligibility or revocation in more general terms, does not speak in terms of suitability. Moreover, although the Legislature certainly could have chosen to incorporate by reference in \u00a7 131F the dis-qualifiers set forth in \u00a7 131, excepting the disqualifiers for age and alienage, its decision to simply restate the applicable dis-qualifiers is hardly conclusive evidence that \u00a7 131F was intended to create a free-standing nonresident licensing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Simkin also relies on the following variations: First, resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>licenses to carry expire on a license holder\u2019s birthday pursuant to \u00a7 131 (i), whereas Simkin\u2019s temporary nonresident license expired one year from its effective date. Second, although \u00a7 131 (i) has a ninety-day postexpiration grace period for license renewals, \u00a7 131F has no such provision. In our view, these two variations derive from the fact that resident licenses are valid for a period \u201cnot less than 5 years but not more than 6 years from the date of issue\u201d and, therefore, designate the license holder\u2019s birthday as a convenient expiration date. G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (i). In contrast, nonresident licenses are valid for a much shorter period of one year, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131F, eighth par., and therefore setting the expiration date as the license holder\u2019s birthday would create too much variance in the period of validity from one nonresident license holder to another. The applicability of a ninety-day grace period to resident licenses but not to nonresident licenses can also be explained by the relatively short, one-year period of validity applicable to nonresident licenses. Moreover, as a general matter, it is undisputed that \u00a7 131F does differ in certain respects from \u00a7 131; these differences, however, are consistent with the role of \u00a7 131F as a supplement, applicable to nonresidents, to the general licensing scheme established by \u00a7 131.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">b. <em>Whether the bureau had reasonable grounds to conclude </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number><em>Simkin was not a \u201csuitable </em>person.\u201d The licensing authority, in this case the bureau, is vested with \u201c \u2018considerable latitude\u2019 or broad discretion in making a licensing decision.\u201d <em>Chardin </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>465 Mass. 314, 316 (2013) <em>(Chardin), </em>quoting <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 256, 259 (1984). If a license is revoked, the aggrieved party may file, within ninety days after receiving notice of revocation, \u201ca petition to obtain judicial review in the district court.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (f). Revocation of a license to carry firearms based on lack of suitability will be upheld unless the license holder demonstrates that revocation was \u201carbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Chief of Police of Shelburne </em>v. <em>Moyer, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 543, 546 (1983). See <em>Chardin, supra </em>at 317. A District Court judge may overturn a firearms licensing decision as arbitrary or capricious where \u201cno reasonable ground\u201d exists to support the decision. G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (f). See <em>Chardin, </em>supra; <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wellesley, </em>35 Mass App. Ct. 42, 44-45 (1993). Further judicial review is available by way of an action in the nature of certiorari, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. See <em>Chardin, supra, </em>and cases cited. On certiorari review, the Superior Court\u2019s role is to examine the record of the District Court and to \u201ccorrect substantial errors of law apparent on the record adversely affecting material rights.\u201d <em>Cambridge Hous. Auth. </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 586, 587 (1979), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The term \u201csuitable person\u201d is not defined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131. Nor is it defined by any regulation promulgated by the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security or its designee pursuant to its statutory authority. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (r). Further, the limits of unsuitability have not been clearly established by our case law. However, as an initial matter, it is apparent that the licensing authority may deem a license holder unsuitable for reasons falling outside the enumerated disqualifies set forth in \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(for residents)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or \u00a7 131F (for nonresidents),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as \u00a7 131 <em>(f) states </em>that a license \u201cshall be revoked or suspended . . . upon the occurrence of any event that would have disqualified the holder from being issued such license,\u201d and separately states that \u201c[a] license may be revoked or suspended . . . if it appears that the holder is no longer a suitable person to possess such license.\u201d Accordingly, a person may be found unsuitable for a variety of reasons, including conduct that falls outside of the enumerated disqualifiers and conduct that falls short of criminal behavior. See <em>DeLuca </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Newton, </em>415 Mass. 155, 158-160 (1993) (finding of unsuitability based on criminal convictions that were subject of governor\u2019s pardon); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wakefield, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902 (2003) (finding of unsuitability based on prior issuance of then-expired abuse prevention orders); <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Chief of Police of Wellesley, supra </em>at 47-48 (finding of unsuitability based on license holder\u2019s refusal to cooperate with prior police investigation); <em>MacNutt </em>v. <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 632, 635 (1991) (proper for licensing authority to condition suitability determination on passing test of firearm handling and firing proficiency); <em>Superintendent, Mass. State Police </em>v. <em>Grover, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 1117 (2010) (unpublished) (finding of unsuitability based on license holder\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>violent acts not resulting in criminal prosecution). See also <em>Hightower </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>693 F.3d 61, 74-76 (1st Cir. 2012) (rejecting Second Amendment challenge to revocation of plaintiff\u2019s license on suitability grounds after she provided false information in license renewal application).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Simkin contends that the bureau\u2019s decision to revoke his license on suitability grounds based on his conduct at the medical office was \u201cfrivolous, arbitrary, capricious, in bad faith, an abuse of discretion, and unjust,\u201d for the simple reason that Simkin did nothing wrong. The bureau counters that it was properly within its \u201cbroad discretion,\u201d <em>Chardin, supra </em>at 316, to deem Simkin unsuitable because his \u201cdecision to enter a professional medical office heavily armed while lying about his identity demonstrated poor judgment and unnecessarily alarmed the employees of the medical office.\u201d We agree with Simkin\u2019s position and disagree with the bureau\u2019s, essentially for the reasons set forth in the District Court judge\u2019s memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The bureau contends that when taken together, Simkin\u2019s conduct of showing up to a medical appointment \u201cheavily armed\u201d; \u201c[taking] elaborate measures to conceal his identity, including giving a false name and address, paying for the services in cash, and withholding most other identifying information\u201d; and causing the employees of the medical office to be \u201cunderstandably alarmed\u201d and \u201cconcerned for their safety\u201d is sufficient to support a determination that Simkin was no longer a suitable person to possess a license to carry firearms. In making its argument, the bureau places particular emphasis on Simkin\u2019s \u201cconcealment of his true identity and address in the context of his exercise of the authority granted by the license to carry,\u201d as well as the fact that his carrying of concealed firearms to a medical appointment fell \u201coutside the ostensible business-related reasons he originally gave as his reason for applying for the license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Although the bureau is correct that a license holder\u2019s conduct need not constitute a violation of the law or statutorily disqualify the license holder in order to form the basis for a revocation on unsuitability grounds, the bureau\u2019s discretion to make a suitability determination is not without limits. A revocation will be overturned as arbitrary or capricious where \u201cno reasonable ground\u201d exists to support it. G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (f). See <em>Chardin, supra </em>at 317. Even when viewed in their totality, Simkin\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>arguably unusual but otherwise innocuous actions did not provide a \u201creasonable ground\u201d to deem him no longer a \u201csuitable person\u201d to carry firearms. This is particularly the case where the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security or its designee has not promulgated any regulations governing suitability, and therefore has provided applicants and license holders with little guidance on what it means to be a \u201csuitable person.\u201d In the absence of any such regulations, individual suitability determinations become more susceptible to attack on the ground that they are arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Simkin held an unrestricted Class A license to carry firearms. Although Simkin indicated on his license application that he sought the license for reasons of personal protection related to his business activities, the license itself carried no restrictions; it entitled Simkin to carry firearms \u201cfor all lawful purposes.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (a). The argument that Simkin\u2019s carrying of firearms to his medical appointment demonstrated unsuitability because the appointment was not related to his business activities is therefore meritless. The contention that Simkin\u2019s being \u201cheavily armed\u201d contributed to his unsuitability is similarly meritless, where that characterization originated with the manager of the medical office (of unknown expertise with firearms), and where Simkin\u2019s license permitted him to carry more than one firearm.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(a).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Next, we suspect that the average Massachusetts resident may become \u201calarmed\u201d on learning that someone other than a law enforcement officer is carrying concealed weapons in his or her presence. However, Simkin is not responsible for alarm caused to others by his mere carrying of concealed weapons pursuant to a license permitting him to do exactly that. Although the bureau claims that Simkin \u201cwent out of his way to show and inform certain staff members that he was . . . armed,\u201d the record indicates otherwise. Simkin concealed his weapons until he was in the examination room and was about to disrobe, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>which time he notified the medical assistant that he was carrying concealed weapons and was going to secure them, presumably so that she would <em>not </em>be alarmed. Further, he had disclosed the fact that he was armed immediately prior to disrobing during a previous visit to the same medical office, albeit to a different practitioner, and had received no objection to his behavior either during or after the visit.</p>\n<p id=\"AAA\">Finally, there is the matter of Simkin\u2019s concealment of his true identity at the medical office. The record shows that Simkin used a pseudonym and provided indirect contact information for the purpose of protecting his medical privacy. There is no suggesti\u00f3n that Simkin was attempting to commit a crime or perpetrate a fraud. Once he learned that the authorities (specifically, Detective McKinnon) wished to speak to him regarding his license, he was compliant and forthright. This is therefore not a case where an applicant or license holder has attempted to mislead the licensing authority. Contrast <em>Hightower </em>v. <em>Boston, supra </em>at 68-69. A different case might have been presented if the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security or its designee had promulgated regulations pertaining to the use of a pseudonym while carrying concealed firearms pursuant to a license issued in a license holder\u2019s legal name, but as already mentioned, no such regulations exist. Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider whether any such regulations could permissibly prohibit using a pseudonym in the manner that Simkin did here.</p>\n<p id=\"AAf\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed. Simkin\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, is denied. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a judgment reinstating Simkin\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa0\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-17\">The firearms records bureau (bureau) has been designated by the colonel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>of the State police as the licensing authority for temporary nonresident licenses to carry firearms, pursuant to G.

See notes 8 and 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Simkin cites three additional pieces of evidence in support of his argument that \u00a7 131 and \u00a7 131F are separate and distinct legal provisions. First, unlike \u00a7 131 (e), which provides that an application for a license to carry shall be approved or denied within forty days of the application date, \u00a7 131F has no processing time limit. Simkin\u2019s only basis for arguing that the forty-day limit from \u00a7 131 <em>(e) </em>does not apply is that on reinstating his license pursuant to the District Court order, the bureau informed him that he would need to apply for renewal of his license \u201cat least 90 days prior to expiration\u201d in order to avoid a licensing gap. It is therefore unclear that the forty-day processing time limit set forth in \u00a7 131 (e) does not apply to nonresident license applications, and we need not decide the matter. Even if the forty-day limit does not apply to nonresident applications, this is hardly evidence that \u00a7 131 and \u00a7 131F were intended as completely independent provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Second, the record demonstrates that from 2004 until 2009, the physical license that the bureau issued to Simkin did not comply with the physical license requirements set forth in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 (g), as amended by St. 2004, c. 150, \u00a7 10. Simkin argues this discrepancy suggests that the bureau believed \u00a7 131 (g) was inapplicable to nonresident licenses. There is nothing in the record regarding whether licenses issued to residents during the same time period complied with these requirements. Even assuming they did, while the bureau\u2019s failure to comply with the physical license requirements of \u00a7 131 (g) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>for nonresident licenses is questionable, it is not indicative of legislative intent regarding the licensing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"As\">Finally, Simkin relies on two opinions of the Attorney General that suggest that \u00a7 131 and \u00a7 131F are separate and distinct legal provisions. In a 1964 opinion, Attorney General Edward W. Brooke opined in response to a question from the Acting Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety, that a license issued to a resident pursuant to G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131, would become invalid if the license holder took up residence in another state. See Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 233-234 (1964). In reaching this conclusion, the Attomey General stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaQ\">\u201cThis position is further buttressed by the fact that the Legislature provided different qualifications for the issuance of permits to nonresidents in [G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131F].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAE\">\u201cA clear implication of this section is that a non-resident is within a wholly different status and as such must comply with the requirements of \u00a7 131F. Consequently, a license holder who becomes a non-resident of Massachusetts would no longer fall within the jurisdiction of local licensing authorities and \u00a7 131 would no longer apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARW\"><em>Id. </em>at 234. The other opinion, issued by Attorney General Francis X. Bellotti in 1986, only nominally supports Simkin\u2019s position and does not merit discussion here. See Rep. A.G., Pub. Doc. No. 12, at 62-63 (1986). For reasons discussed <em>supra, </em>we disagree with both opinions insofar as they suggest that \u00a7 131F is wholly distinct from \u00a7 131.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b202-6\">See note 8, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"AvC\">See note 9, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Simkin vehemently objects to the bureau\u2019s contention that he was \u201cheavily armed.\u201d He insists that he was \u201cadequately armed,\u201d taking into account the risk that one or more of his firearms might malfunction.
