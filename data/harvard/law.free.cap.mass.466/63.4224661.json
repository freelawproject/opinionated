Hinton State Laboratory Institute in Jamaica Plain (Hinton drug lab) surfaced regarding work performed by Annie Dookhan, a chemist who had been employed in the forensic drug laboratory since November, 2003. Following an internal review, the Department of Public Health launched a formal investigation of the matter in December, 2011. The investigation concluded that \u201cDookhan failed to follow [Hinton drug l]ab protocols for the transfer and documentation of samples for testing, and subsequently created a false record of said transfers.\u201d After being placed on paid administrative leave, Dookhan resigned from her position, effective March 9, 2012. A more extensive investigation of the Hinton drug lab was initiated in August, 2012, by the State police. As a result of this investigation, it has been alleged that, among other things, Dookhan deliberately and repeatedly falsified drug testing results, tampered with evidence, and forged signatures on documents. Although the full scope of Dookhan\u2019s purported misconduct is not yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>known, it has been estimated conservatively that, during her tenure, Dookhan worked on at least 34,000 cases. The investigation of misconduct at the Hinton drug lab remains ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The three cases now before us concern the validity of certain procedures that have been adopted by the Superior Court Department of the Trial Court (Superior Court) to handle postconviction matters in criminal cases where a defendant has been convicted of a drug offense and the drugs at issue were analyzed at the Hinton drug lab. In October, 2012, the Chief Justice of the Superior Court assigned specific judges in seven counties to preside over special \u201cdrug lab sessions\u201d that would deal with these postconviction matters. The first round of hearings focused on incarcerated defendants who had filed motions to stay the execution of their sentences in cases where the lead offense was a violation of the Controlled Substances Act, G. L. c. 94C, and Dookhan was the primary or confirmatory chemist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From October 15 to November 28, the judges presiding over the drug lab sessions held 589 hearings, placing an enormous burden on the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">On November 9, 2012, this court issued an order to facilitate the expeditious handling of matters relating to the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>misconduct at the Hinton drug lab. The order provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">\u201c[A] Chief Justice of a Trial Court Department may assign for all purposes, including disposition, any post conviction motion in which a party seeks relief based on alleged misconduct at the Hinton [drug lab] to any judge of that Trial Court Department. The assigned judge may reassign the motion to the original trial judge where the interests of justice require.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On November 26, 2012, in accordance with the provisions of Mass. R. Crim. P. 47, 378 Mass. 923 (1979),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Chief Justice of the Superior Court appointed five retired Superior Court judges as \u201cSpecial Judicial Magistrate[s] of the Superior Court, to preside over criminal proceedings in connection with cases relating to the [Hinton drug lab].\u201d These special magistrates were assigned to six counties, and the Chief Justice of the Superior Court issued to each one an \u201cOrder of Assignment\u201d delineating his or her authority and responsibilities. It provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">\u201c[T]he Special Judicial Magistrate shall have the powers, duties, and authority to preside at arraignments, to set bail, to assign counsel, to supervise pretrial conferences, and to mark up motions for hearing. The Special Judicial Magistrate shall also have the power and authority to conduct hearings on post conviction motions, to issue orders regarding discovery, and other matters, and to make proposed findings and rulings to the Regional Administrative Justice. . . . Further, the Special Judicial Magistrate shall perform such other duties as may be authorized by order of the Superior Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>As of March 6, 2013, the special magistrates had conducted more than 900 hearings, a substantial number of which pertained to defendants\u2019 motions to stay the execution of their sentences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">The three present cases originated in Essex County. Each arose as a consequence of the implementation of the procedures established by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court for handling postconviction matters in the special drug lab sessions. Following proceedings in the Superior Court with regard to each case, which will be discussed in greater depth in subsequent portions of this opinion, the Commonwealth filed petitions in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, challenging those procedures. On March 13, 2013, a single justice held a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s petitions. She then reserved and reported three questions to the full bench:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">\u201c 1. Does a special magistrate appointed by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 47, or a judge of the Superior Court, have the authority to allow a defendant\u2019s motion to stay execution of his sentence, then being served, pending disposition of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">\u201c2. Does a special magistrate have the authority to reconsider and allow a motion to stay execution of a criminal defendant\u2019s sentence where a judge of the Superior Court has previously denied a motion to stay execution filed by the same defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">\u201c3. (a) Is it appropriate for this court to answer the question set forth in 3(b) below, regarding the validity of plea colloquies conducted by special magistrates, where, under the terms of the protocol established by the Superior Court, neither side can be required to submit over its objection to a plea colloquy conducted by a special magistrate, and where, to date, because of the Commonwealth\u2019s objections, all colloquies in Essex County have been conducted by judges and not by special magistrates?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">\u201c(b) If the court answers the question in 3(a) in the af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>firmative, does such a special magistrate have the authority under Mass. R. Crim. P. 47 to conduct a guilty plea colloquy and to report findings concerning such issues as the voluntariness of the proposed plea and the factual basis for the plea to a presiding justice of the Superior Court?\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">We shall proceed to analyze and answer each question in the context of the individual case in which it arose.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Commonwealth <em>vs. </em>Shubar Charles</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The essential facts are not disputed. On the evening of April 2, 2009, a former girl friend of Shubar Charles contacted the New Bedford police department to report that, while at her home for a birthday celebration, Charles had held a firearm to her face and threatened to kill her. The ensuing police investigation suggested that Charles could be located in Lynn. When officers from the Lynn police department converged on an apartment on North Common Street, tenants informed them that Charles had gone into a back bedroom and had been \u201cwaving around\u201d a small handgun. Officers discovered Charles alone in the back bedroom. They searched him and found in his pants pocket twenty individual baggies of a white powdery substance that they believed to be cocaine. A further search of the bedroom uncovered, among other things, a loaded firearm. Charles was arrested and taken to the Lynn police station. During booking, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>he was searched again, and officers found a single bullet in the pocket of the jacket that he was wearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">On June 5, 2009, Charles was indicted on charges of possession of a class B controlled substance (cocaine) with intent to distribute, as a subsequent offense, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(b); </em>possession of a firearm without a firearm identification card, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (h); unlawful possession of ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h); </em>and possession of a firearm after having been convicted previously of three violent crimes or three serious drug offenses, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G (c) (two counts). Dookhan was the primary chemist who analyzed the substance in the baggies; she was not involved in the examination of firearm evidence. On a certificate dated December 28, 2009, Dookhan certified that the substance was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">On October 18, 2010, Charles pleaded guilty to reduced charges of possession of a class B controlled substance with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (a); unlawful possession of ammunition, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h); </em>and unlawful possession of ammunition after having been convicted previously of one serious drug offense, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G (a). As part of the plea bargain, the Commonwealth agreed to enter a nolle prosequi on the remaining offenses. Charles was sentenced to concurrent terms of from four to seven years in the State prison for his convictions of possession of a Class B substance with intent to distribute and being a felon in possession of ammunition; he was sentenced to a concurrent term of two years in the house of correction for his conviction of unlawful possession of ammunition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">On December 13, 2012, Charles filed a motion to stay the execution of his sentences pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 31,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as appearing in 454 Mass. 1501 (2009), which the Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>opposed. He then filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), raising claims pertaining to the alleged misconduct at the Hinton drug lab. In his motion for a stay, Charles asserted that his motion for a new trial likely would be successful because (1) his pleas were not knowing and voluntary where he had relied on the work of Dookhan; (2) his due process rights were violated where the Commonwealth failed \u201cto provide true and accurate discovery prior to his guilty plea[s];\u201d and (3) the evidence relating to Dookhan\u2019s misconduct at the Hinton drug lab constituted \u201cnewly discovered exculpatory evidence.\u201d He further asserted that, if released, he would not present a security risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On January 31, 2013, a special magistrate held a hearing on Charles\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentences. Defense counsel claimed that but for the drug indictment, Charles would not have agreed to the guilty pleas because the evidence with respect to the drug charge was the strongest. Given that Dookhan was the primary chemist on the case, defense counsel argued that there was a \u201cgreat likelihood\u201d that Charles\u2019s motion for a new trial would be successful. Further, while acknowledging that Charles had a criminal history, defense counsel asserted that Charles was \u201ca much different person [now],\u201d and he outlined the positive steps that Charles planned to take if released. The special magistrate allowed Charles\u2019s motion to stay execution of his sentences, subject to enumerated conditions.* ***<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support of his ruling, the special magistrate found that Dookhan was the primary chemist on the certificates of drug analysis, and that Charles already had served three years and nine months of his concurrent sentences, could live with family members in Lynn, and likely pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of ammunition (one bullet) as the result of a plea deal on the drug charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>On February 4, 2013, the Commonwealth filed an objection to the special magistrate\u2019s ruling, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Order of Assignment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Regional Administrative Justice of the Superior Court stayed the order of the special magistrate. Then, on February 8, he held a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s objection. The Commonwealth argued that a trial judge has no authority to stay the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence in the absence of a pending appeal except in extraordinary circumstances, and no such circumstances were present in this case. Further, the Order of Assignment did not confer on a special magistrate the power to stay the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence. Finally, the Commonwealth asserted that Charles\u2019s motion for a new trial was not likely to be successful, and that he would be a security risk if released. After considering Charles\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentences de novo,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the judge allowed the motion, making all of the same findings as were made by the special magistrate and imposing additional conditions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On February 13, the Commonwealth filed with the judge a motion to stay his order, which was allowed, but only for two days. On February 14, the Commonwealth filed a petition in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking to extend the stay of the judge\u2019s order. In its petition, the Commonwealth challenged the authority of both the judge and the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>magistrate to stay the execution of Charles\u2019s sentences prior to the disposition of his motion for a new trial, and asserted that the allowance of the motion to stay constituted an abuse of discretion. On February 15, a single justice allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to extend the stay of the judge\u2019s order pending further order of the county court. On March 13, the single justice held a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, after which she reserved and reported the three questions set forth at the beginning of this opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">We turn our attention to the first of these questions, which arose from the circumstances presented in Charles\u2019s case, and consider whether a judge of the Superior Court, or a special magistrate appointed by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 47, has the authority to allow a defendant\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentence, then being served, pending disposition of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. At the outset, the Commonwealth argues that a Superior Court judge does not have such authority because, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 31 (a), a stay of the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence is permissible only at the judge\u2019s discretion where an appeal is pending, and no appeal is pending in this case. See note 7, <em>supra. </em>Although we agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s reading of rule 31, we conclude that, in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>431 Mass. 506, 520 (2000) (McLaughlin), quoting <em>Mariano </em>v. <em>Judge of Dist. Court of Cent. Berkshire, </em>243 Mass. 90, 92 (1922), a judge has the inherent power to stay sentences for \u201cexceptional reasons permitted by law.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">It has long been recognized that the inherent powers of courts are those that are \u201cessential to the performance of their functions, to the maintenance of their authority, and to their capacity to determine the rights of parties according to law.\u201d <em>Blanken</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>burg </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>260 Mass. 369, 373 (1927). See <em>Sheriff of Middlesex County </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>383 Mass. 631, 636 (1981). See also <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Justices of the Superior Court, </em>208 Mass. 162, 179 (1911) (courts have inherent power \u201cto do whatever may be done under the general principles of jurisprudence to insure to the citizen a fair trial, whenever his life, liberty, property or character is at stake\u201d). Significantly, \u201c[ajlthough inherent powers may be recognized by statute, they exist independently, because they \u2018directly affect[] the capacity of the judicial department to function\u2019 and cannot be nullified by the Legislature without violating art. 30 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights].\u201d <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>438 Mass. 387, 397 (2003), quoting <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>279 Mass. 607, 613 (1932). \u201cThe very concept of inherent power \u2018carries with it the implication that its use is for occasions not provided for by established methods.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boe, </em>456 Mass. 337, 345 n.13 (2010), quoting <em>Brach </em>v. <em>Chief Justice of the Dist. Court Dep\u2019t, </em>386 Mass. 528, 536 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Judges must exercise their inherent authority \u201cas necessary to secure the full and effective administration of justice.\u201d <em>O\u2019Coin\u2019s, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer of the County of Worcester, </em>362 Mass. 507, 514 (1972). See <em>State Realty Co. of Boston </em>v. <em>MacNeil Bros. Co., </em>358 Mass. 374, 379 (1970), quoting <em>Link </em>v. <em>Wabash R.R., </em>370 U.S. 626, 630-631 (1962) (inherent power enables courts \u201cto manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases\u201d). The boundaries of inherent judicial authority have been established on a case-by-case basis as challenges to the exercise of a particular power have arisen. See, e.g., <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, supra </em>at 397-398, and cases cited. In <em>McLaughlin, supra </em>at 514-520, this court considered the inherent authority of a trial judge in the specific context of a stay of the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The defendant in <em>McLaughlin </em>was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and arson of a dwelling house, and not guilty by reason of insanity of two charges of murder in the first degree; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>the judge committed him to Bridgewater State Hospital and stayed the execution of sentence on his convictions until the date of his release from civil commitment. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 514. On appeal, this court concluded that the judge erred in staying the execution of sentence because no exceptional reasons justified the stay, and its effect was to extend the duration of the defendant\u2019s confinement for punitive purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 518-520. We recognized that the plain language of Mass. R. Crim. P. 31 (a) \u201cdoes not authorize a judge to stay execution of a penal sentence when an appeal is not pending,\u201d and we acknowledged that our jurisprudence is \u201clargely silent on the question of the inherent power of trial judges to stay execution of sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518. Although we declined to \u201cdelineate in detail the contours of trial judges\u2019 inherent power to stay execution of sentence,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 519-520, we said that \u201c[t]he basic rule is clear. \u2018Sentences are to be executed forthwith <em>unless suspended or stayed for the exceptional reasons permitted by </em>law\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 520, quoting <em>Mariano </em>v. <em>Judge of Dist. Court of Cent. Berkshire, supra. </em>See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pagan, </em>445 Mass. 315, 322 (2005) (inherent judicial powers are invoked sparingly, but their exercise is justified by exceptional circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Here, unlike in <em>McLaughlin, </em>exceptional circumstances warranted the judge\u2019s exercise of his inherent power to stay the execution of Charles\u2019s sentences pending the disposition of his motion for a new trial. The magnitude of the allegations of serious and far-reaching misconduct by Dookhan at the Hinton drug lab cannot be overstated. The alleged misconduct may have compromised thousands of cases. Dookhan\u2019s role as the primary chemist in Charles\u2019s case raises significant questions regarding the veracity of the drug analysis, which purportedly served as the basis for his guilty pleas, and may be dispositive of his motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Given the ongoing investigation of misconduct at the Hinton drug lab and the uncertainty about when such investigation will be completed, the interest of justice is not served by the continued imprisonment of a defendant who may be entitled to a new trial. Cf. <em>Lavallee </em>v. <em>Justices in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number><em>the Hampden Superior Court, </em>442 Mass. 228, 246 (2004) (burden of \u201csystemic lapse\u201d in administration of justice \u201cis not to be borne by defendants\u201d). To the extent that Charles satisfies the necessary criteria for a stay of the execution of his sentences, a matter that will be discussed shortly, the allowance of a stay is properly within the judge\u2019s inherent authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">With regard to special magistrates, the Commonwealth argues that they have no authority to allow a defendant\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentence, then being served, pending disposition of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. We agree that special magistrates have no such authority, but we conclude that they are empowered to make proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on a motion to stay the execution of sentence. Those findings and conclusions, in turn, shall be reviewed by a judge, who will make the ultimate decision whether to allow or deny the motion to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Rule 47 of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure permits the appointment of special magistrates to preside over certain criminal proceedings in the Superior Court. These special magistrates occupy a separate and distinct position from clerks of courts who are designated as magistrates pursuant to G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 62B. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 47, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1759 (LexisNexis 2012-2013). The powers of special magistrates are delineated in rule 47. They have the authority \u201cto preside at arraignments, to set bail, to assign counsel, to supervise pretrial conferences, to mark up pretrial motions for hearing, to make findings and report those findings and other issues to the presiding justice or Administrative Justice, and to perform such other duties as may be authorized by order of the Superior Court.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. P. 47. The responsibilities of a special magistrate are \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d in nature. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 47, <em>supra. </em>Given their position and limited powers, special magistrates do not have inherent judicial authority akin to that which can be exercised by Superior Court judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">Pursuant to each Order of Assignment issued by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court in accordance with rule 47, the five special magistrates were appointed \u201cto preside over criminal proceedings in connection with cases relating to the [Hinton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>drug lab].\u201d In addition to the powers conferred on them by rule 47, the special magistrates also were authorized \u201cto conduct hearings on post conviction motions, to issue orders regarding discovery, and other matters, and to make proposed findings and rulings to the Regional Administrative Justice.\u201d The special magistrates, in the first instance, serve a critically important role in addressing the extraordinary demands placed on the Superior Court by the Hinton drug lab cases. However, the Order of Assignment, when read in conjunction with rule 47, does not permit a special magistrate to stay the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Although somewhat more circumscribed, the role of a special magistrate appointed pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 47 is similar in many respects to that of a master appointed pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 53, as amended, 423 Mass. 1408 (1996). A master is \u201cappointed by the court to hear evidence in connection with any action and report facts.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 53 (a) (i), as amended, 386 Mass. 1237 (1982). With regard to a matter not tried before a jury, \u201cthe court shall accept the master\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, mutually inconsistent, unwarranted by the evidence before the master as a matter of law or are otherwise tainted by error of law.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 53 (h) (1), as amended, 386 Mass. 1237 (1982). See <em>Berish </em>v. <em>Bornstein, </em>437 Mass. 252, 268 (2002). See also <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>391 Mass. 543, 554 &amp; n.9 (1984). A court is to review the ultimate findings of fact by a master in light of the independent inferences that the court can draw from the subsidiary findings. See <em>id. </em>at 555.

P. 53 (h) (1) (\u201cThe court may draw its own inferences from the master\u2019s subsidiary findings\u201d). \u201cTo the extent that the master\u2019s ultimate findings are conclusions of law, they are subject to independent judicial review.\u201d <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Marshall, supra, </em>citing <em>Lucey </em>v. <em>Hero Int\u2019l Corp., </em>361 Mass. 569, 571 (1972). In our view, this scope of review is the appropriate one to be applied to the proposed findings and conclusions of a special magistrate who has heard a defendant\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentence. The judge then shall enter an order allowing or denying the stay.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Whether considered by a special magistrate or a Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Court judge, the factors that shall be evaluated in deciding whether to allow a defendant\u2019s motion for a stay of the execution of his sentence pending the disposition of a new trial motion are the same as those relating to a stay of execution of sentence pending appeal. The first factor is whether the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial presents an issue that \u201coffers some reasonable possibility of a successful decision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>378 Mass. 489, 498 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levin, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 501, 504 (1979). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge (No. </em>1), 380 Mass. 851, 855 (1980). The second factor is whether the defendant\u2019s release poses a security risk. See <em>id. </em>Significant considerations include the defendant\u2019s \u201cfamilial status, roots in the community, employment, prior criminal record, and general attitude and demeanor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levin, supra </em>at 505. These considerations, in turn, will inform the calculus regarding the possibility of the defendant\u2019s flight to avoid punishment, the potential danger posed by the defendant to any person or to the community, and the likelihood that the defendant will commit additional criminal acts while awaiting a decision on his new trial motion. See <em>Polk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>461 Mass. 251, 253 (2012), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge (No. 1), supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">In the context of a pending appeal, the practice of granting a stay of execution of sentence \u201cis grounded in rudimentary notions of justice\u201d because a \u201cconviction may be reversible, but the time spent in prison is not.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levin, supra </em>at 512-513. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hodge (No. 1), supra </em>at 855-856. This rationale is no less important here, notwithstanding the fact that there is no pending appeal. The allegations of misconduct at the Hinton drug lab have given rise to serious concerns about defendants who may be incarcerated as a consequence of tainted convictions. Thus, a defendant\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentence should be decided in an expeditious manner.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In this case, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>discretion in allowing Charles\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen (No. 2), </em>456 Mass. 128, 132-133 (2010) (describing standard of review). First, it is not disputed that Dookhan was the primary chemist who analyzed the drugs that served as the basis for Charles\u2019s conviction of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The ongoing investigation of the Hinton drug lab purportedly has revealed that, among other alleged misconduct, Dookhan prepared false drug reports without doing any testing and intentionally contaminated drug samples to achieve desired results. To the extent that Charles\u2019s guilty pleas were based, in whole or in part, on drug analyses performed by Dookhan, his motion for a new trial has presented an issue that \u201coffers some reasonable possibility of a successful decision.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Levin, supra </em>at 504. We caution that we are engaged in an interlocutory review focused only on a stay of execution of sentence. We offer no opinion on the ultimate merits of Charles\u2019s motion for a new trial, but simply determine that he has presented a colorable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Second, defense counsel described to the judge how, notwithstanding Charles\u2019s criminal history, he had matured while, incarcerated, having participated in various programs that were offered at the State prison, and he did not pose a security risk. Defense counsel informed the judge that, if released, Charles would live with his brother, and he would pursue two available employment opportunities as well as further education. The judge evaluated the possible security risk posed by Charles and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>addressed any uncertainties by imposing conditions that effectively would confine Charles to his home for the duration of his release. It is contrary to the interests of justice that Charles remain incarcerated while the nature and scope of the alleged misconduct at the Hinton drug lab are investigated and fully ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">We answer the first reported question as follows: In exceptional circumstances, a judge of the Superior Court does have the authority to allow a defendant\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentence, then being served, pending disposition of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, but a special magistrate appointed by the Chief Justice of the Superior Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 47 does not have such authority.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Commonwealth vs. Hector Milette</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The essential facts are not disputed. On December 16, 2009, Hector Milette was indicted on charges of trafficking in one hundred grams or more of cocaine, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(3) (three counts); and trafficking in fourteen grams or more of cocaine, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E <em>(b) </em>(1). The charges arose from Milette\u2019s role as a middleman in the sale of purported drugs to a confidential informant on three separate dates in August, 2009, and from the seizure of a plastic bag containing a white substance found during a search of Milette\u2019s residence in Haverhill on October 20, 2009. Dookhan was the primary chemist who analyzed the substances from the three August sales. On two certificates dated November 12, 2009, and on a third certificate dated December 7, 2009, she certified that the substances were cocaine. Dookhan was not involved in the analysis of the substance discovered during the execution of a search warrant at Milette\u2019s home. That sample was examined separately by another chemist at the Hinton drug lab, who certified that it was cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>On May 9, 2011, Milette pleaded guilty to trafficking in twenty-eight grams or more of cocaine, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (c) (2) (three counts); and possession of a class B controlled substance with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (a). Milette was sentenced to concurrent terms of from five years to five years and one day in the State prison for each of his three drug trafficking convictions; he was sentenced to a consecutive probationary term of three years for his conviction of possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">On October 22, 2012, Milette filed a motion to stay the execution of his sentences pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 31, which the Commonwealth opposed. He also filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30, raising claims pertaining to the alleged misconduct at the Hinton drug lab. In his motion for a stay, Milette asserted that his new trial motion likely would be successful because (1) Dookhan had signed three of the four certificates of drug analysis that served as the bases for his indictments; and (2) it was reasonably possible that the charges against him would be dismissed because Dookhan\u2019s misconduct had tainted the evidence in numerous cases that she had handled. Milette further asserted that he already had served nearly thirty-seven months of a sixty-month sentence, and that, if released, he would not present a security risk. In its opposition, the Commonwealth challenged, among other things, the authority of a trial judge to stay the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence prior to the disposition of his motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">On November 13, a judge of the Superior Court held a hearing on Milette\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentences. Defense counsel argued that Milette had pleaded guilty to the drug charges \u201cprimarily because of the drug certifications,\u201d that he had put \u201cgreat faith\u201d in the analyses, and that now there were numerous questions concerning Dookhan\u2019s veracity and her actions during the testing procedures.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The judge denied Milette\u2019s motion to stay on the ground that the cocaine in Milette\u2019s possession had originated from a supplier whose drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>had been analyzed by a chemist unrelated to Dookhan and the Hinton drug lab.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">On February 6, 2013, Milette filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 13 (a) (5), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1516 (2004), which was heard by a special magistrate on February 12.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Defense counsel asserted that, since the judge\u2019s ruling on November 13, the ongoing investigation of misconduct at the Hinton drug lab had revealed \u201ccriminal involvement\u201d so \u201cwidespread\u201d that Dookhan had been indicted in six counties on a variety of charges. Because of such misconduct, defense counsel continued, the interests of justice required a stay of the execution of Milette\u2019s sentences. Over the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the special magistrate allowed Milette\u2019s motion for reconsideration and then stayed the execution of his sentences. The special magistrate found that Milette already had served two-thirds of his sentences, he had presented no disciplinary problems while incarcerated, he had secured a place to live if released, Dookhan had been the primary chemist on three of the four certificates of drug analysis, and Milette\u2019s role in the drug transactions had been that of a middleman. The special magistrate set bail at $2,000 cash, which Milette posted that day, and he imposed numerous conditions on Milette\u2019s release.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The special magistrate also declined to stay his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On February 13, the Commonwealth filed an objection to the special magistrate\u2019s ruling, in accordance with the procedure set forth in the Order of Assignment. That same day, the Regional Administrative Justice of the Superior Court modified Milette\u2019s conditions of release to include home confinement, except for emergency medical care and court appearances.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">On February 27, the Regional Administrative Justice held a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s objection. The Commonwealth argued that the special magistrate had erred in allowing Milette\u2019s motion for reconsideration because no significant change in circumstances had occurred since a judge denied Milette\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentences on November 13. Further, the special magistrate, who no longer was an active Associate Justice of the Superior Court, did not have the authority to reconsider a judge\u2019s ruling and order a stay, and, in any event, a stay of the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence could not be entered where there was no pending appeal. Finally, the Commonwealth asserted that, even if the special magistrate did possess the requisite authority, Milette had failed to show that his motion for a new trial likely would be successful, and that he would not be a security risk if released.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">In a written memorandum of decision, the second judge vacated the stay of execution of sentences entered by the special magistrate on February 12, and he ordered Milette back into custody to resume serving the remainder of his State prison sentences. The judge concluded that both he and the special magistrate had the authority to issue a stay of execution and to set conditions of release. Moreover, recognizing the extensive evidence that had come to light regarding Dookhan\u2019s malfeasance at the Hinton drug lab, the judge stated that such a change in circumstances since November 13 warranted reconsideration of a judge\u2019s initial denial of Milette\u2019s motion for a stay of the execution of his sentences. However, in light of the proceedings in Commonwealth vs. Charles, No. SJ-2013-0066, and the perceived absence of any meaningful difference between that case and this one, the judge declined to uphold the order of the special magistrate allowing Milette\u2019s motion for reconsideration and granting the stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Meanwhile, on February 21, the Commonwealth had filed a petition in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, seeking to stay the order of the special magistrate.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In its petition, the Commonwealth requested clarification of the authority of both a judge and a special magistrate to stay the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence pending the disposition of his motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>new trial, and challenged the authority of a special magistrate to reconsider a judge\u2019s ruling on such a motion to stay. On March 13, the single justice held a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, after which she reserved and reported the three questions set forth at the beginning of this opinion.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AS\">We turn our attention to the second of these questions, which arose from the circumstances presented in Milette\u2019s case, and examine whether a special magistrate has the authority to reconsider and allow a motion to stay the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence where a judge of the Superior Court previously had denied the same motion.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Commonwealth contends that a special magistrate has no such authority. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"AhD\">As a general matter, Massachusetts courts have recognized that \u201cit is within the inherent authority of a trial judge to \u2018reconsider decisions made on the road to final judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 401 (2003), quoting <em>Franchi </em>v. <em>Stella, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 251, 258 (1997).

Although a judge is not obligated \u201cto reconsider a case, an issue, or a question of fact or law, once decided, the power to do so remains in the court until final judgment or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>decree.\u201d <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>306 Mass. 597, 601-602 (1940), and cases cited.

The Order of Assignment, when read in conjunction with Mass. R. Crim. P. 47, does not permit a special magistrate to reconsider a judge\u2019s decision on a defendant\u2019s motion to stay the execution of his sentence. We recognize that, once a judge has ruled on such a motion, a change in circumstances may arise that would warrant a reevaluation of the original decision. Where modification of the original decision is in order, the judge shall determine the procedure to be followed and make the necessary ruling. In those instances when the judge\u2019s decision would benefit from an evidentiary hearing on the changed circumstances, a special magistrate is empowered to make proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law on the motion for reconsideration. Those findings and conclusions, in turn, shall be reviewed by a judge, who will make the ultimate determinations whether to allow or deny the motion for reconsideration and, then, whether to modify the original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Here, we need not consider further the underlying merits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the judge\u2019s decision on Milette\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Shortly after oral argument before this court, Milette\u2019s motion for a new trial was allowed, he pleaded guilty to various drug offenses, and he was sentenced on those convictions. See note 23, <em>supra. </em>The issue of Milette\u2019s motion for reconsideration now is moot because he no longer has a personal stake in its outcome. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>462 Mass. 96, 98-99 (2012) (describing mootness doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">We answer the second reported question, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">District Attorney for the Eastern District vs. Superior Court Department of the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The essential facts are not disputed. Following the commencement of the special drug lab sessions, procedures were put in place in the Superior Court for the taking of guilty pleas after the allowance of a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 47 and the Order of Assignment, special magistrates were authorized, in appropriate circumstances, to conduct guilty plea colloquies with defendants. Standardized written forms were prepared for use by the special magistrates in the taking of a defendant\u2019s guilty plea.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">In accordance with the Superior Court procedures, a defendant would appear before a special magistrate asking to change his plea to guilty of the charges against him. The special magistrate would inform the defendant that he had a right to appear before a Superior Court judge, who would conduct a plea colloquy by asking questions about the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s decision and his understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea. The special magistrate also would inform the defendant that, as a special magistrate, he could conduct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>plea colloquy, make findings regarding the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty, and report those findings to a judge, who then would conduct further proceedings in the case, including accepting or rejecting the proffered plea, and, if accepted, would impose sentence. At this juncture, the special magistrate would continue with a plea colloquy only with the defendant\u2019s written consent.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In giving his consent, the defendant also would acknowledge that he was satisfied that his attorney had provided representation in an effective and competent manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">If the defendant consented to proceeding before a special magistrate, the special magistrate would conduct an oral colloquy to determine whether the defendant was entering his guilty plea voluntarily and with a full understanding of its consequences.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The special magistrate then would make specific findings, including whether (1) the defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol; (2) the defendant had reported that he was suffering from any mental impairment that would affect his ability to understand and participate in the proceedings; (3) the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was the result of any threat, force, coercion, or promise, or was solely because he was guilty; (4) the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty was made after consultation with competent counsel; (5) the defendant was aware of the potential consequences of pleading guilty, including the obligation to provide a deoxyribonucleic acid sample to the State; (6) the defendant had been informed of the maximum penalties for each of the indictments to which he was pleading guilty; (7) there was a factual basis for the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>plea in the evidence presented by the Commonwealth; (8) the defendant fully understood that, if he was not a citizen of the United States, his conviction would have immigration consequences; (9) the defendant had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived all of his statutory and constitutional rights, as explained during the colloquy, and understood the consequences of his guilty plea; and (10) the defendant understood that there was an ongoing investigation at the Hinton drug lab, and that he was waiving all claims relating to alleged irregularities there. Finally, the special magistrate would report these findings to a Superior Court judge for further proceedings, and would recommend that the judge accept the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and the proposed sentence agreed to by the prosecutor and defense counsel during the colloquy. The defendant then would appear before the judge, who would review the findings and recommendation of the special magistrate, ask any relevant additional questions, accept the plea, and impose sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The district attorney for the Eastern District (district attorney) has refused to participate in guilty plea proceedings before a special magistrate, insisting that such proceedings take place before a judge in order to assure the validity of the plea. Consequently, all of the plea proceedings in the special drug lab sessions held in Essex County have been conducted in this manner. However, special magistrates have conducted guilty plea colloquies in other counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">On March 1, 2013, the district attorney filed a petition in the county court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, which the Superior Court opposed. The district attorney sought clarification of the validity of guilty plea proceedings conducted by special magistrates pursuant to the Order of Assignment. On March 13, the single justice held a hearing on the petition, after which she reserved and reported the three questions set forth at the beginning of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We turn our attention to the third of these questions and consider (1) whether it is appropriate for this court to answer the question set forth in part (b) regarding the validity of plea colloquies conducted by special magistrates, where, under the terms of the protocol established by the Superior Court, neither side can be required to submit over its objection to a plea col<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>loquy conducted by a special magistrate, and where, to date, all of the colloquies in Essex County have been conducted by judges and not by special magistrates; and (2) whether a special magistrate has the authority under Mass. R. Crim. P. 47 to conduct a guilty plea colloquy and report findings concerning such issues as the voluntariness of the proposed plea and the factual basis for the plea to a Superior Court judge. As to the first part of this question, the Superior Court asserts that where there have been no plea colloquies conducted by special magistrates in Essex County, there is no \u201cactual controversy\u201d for this court to resolve. Therefore, it follows that the issue presented in the second part of the question is not justiciable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">General Laws c. 211, \u00a7 3, provides that \u201c[t]he supreme judicial court shall have general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if no other remedy is expressly provided . . . .\u201d This court\u2019s superintendence powers are discretionary and will be exercised only in \u201cthe most exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Costarelli </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>374 Mass. 677, 679 (1978). See <em>Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc. </em>v. <em>Operation Rescue, </em>406 Mass. 701, 706 (1990). Generally speaking, a party seeking review under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, must demonstrate both a violation of the party\u2019s substantive rights and the unavailability of adequate relief through the ordinary appellate process. See <em>id., </em>quoting <em>Dunbrack </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 502, 504 (1986). However, we have said that where \u201ca systemic issue affecting the proper administration of the judiciary has been presented, resolution of the issue by this court is appropriate.\u201d <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Boston Div. of the Hous.

See also <em>A Juvenile </em>v. <em>Commonwealth (No. 1), </em>380 Mass. 552, 555-556 (1980) (resolving question of proper transfer practice between Boston Juvenile Court and Superior Court). In the past, we have exercised our general superintendence powers to resolve, among other <em>things, </em>\u201cimportant issues with implications for the effective administration of justice\u201d and \u201cmatter[s] of public interest that may cause further uncertainty within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>courts.\u201d <em>First Justice of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t </em>v. <em>Clerk-Magistrate of the Bristol Div. of the Juvenile Court Dep\u2019t, </em>438 Mass. 387, 391 (2003) (resolving internal dispute between members of judicial department). See <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Knights, </em>427 Mass. 748, 750-751 (1998) (determining that judges of Boston Municipal Court Department have inherent authority to rehear denials of applications for criminal complaints by clerks of that court).</p>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">It is undisputed that the allegations of serious and far-reaching misconduct by Dookhan at the Hinton drug lab have raised significant concerns about the administration of justice in criminal cases where a defendant has been convicted of a drug offense and the drugs at issue were analyzed at that facility. Although the full scope of the misconduct is not yet known, thousands of cases may have been compromised. In response to this burgeoning crisis, the Superior Court took action by developing and implementing procedures, across several counties, to review and resolve affected cases, including allowing special magistrates to conduct guilty plea colloquies. The allegations of misconduct at the Hinton drug lab, and the implications of such misconduct on defendants who have been convicted of drug offenses, present exceptional circumstances warranting this court\u2019s exercise of its superintendence powers. It is incumbent on us, at the early stages of this unfolding situation, to address uncertainties regarding the propriety of the procedures that have been implemented by the Superior Court. Notwithstanding the fact that special magistrates have not conducted guilty plea colloquies in Essex County, they have conducted such colloquies in other counties. We conclude that the legality of these proceedings presents a systemic concern that this court should resolve now through the exercise of its general superintendence powers under G. L. c.211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">With regard to the second part of the third reported question, the district attorney contends that the procedure enabling special magistrates to conduct guilty plea colloquies in special drug lab sessions calls on special magistrates to act beyond the scope of their authority. Thus, in the district attorney\u2019s view, the validity of these guilty pleas has been rendered uncertain. We disagree and conclude that the procedure passes legal muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>As we have discussed at some length, the Order of Assignment, in conjunction with Mass. R. Crim. P. 47, authorizes a special magistrate \u201cto make proposed findings and rulings to the Regional Administrative Justice.\u201d Significantly, the special magistrate is neither accepting a defendant\u2019s guilty plea nor imposing a sentence. That is the ultimate function of the judge. See <em>Whitney </em>v. Commonwealth, 337 Mass. 722, 723 (1958) (sentence is judgment in criminal case). In the extraordinary circumstances presented here, the role of the special magistrate is to expedite the processing of an anticipated avalanche of cases through the special drug lab sessions by, preliminarily, making findings whether, among other things, a defendant has decided to plead guilty to the charges against him voluntarily and with a full understanding of the consequences of such action. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>447 Mass. 625, 628 (2006), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, </em>390 Mass. 714, 715-718 (1984) (\u201cTo be effective, a guilty plea must be knowingly and voluntarily tendered directly from the defendant\u201d). After doing so, the special magistrate simply reports his or her findings to a judge. The standardized written forms used in the Superior Court have been designed to assist the special magistrate in fulfilling his fact-finding responsibilities, to protect the defendant\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights, and to guarantee the proper administration of justice. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the individuals appointed to serve as special magistrates are retired Superior Court judges who are well acquainted with the content, scope, and importance of guilty plea colloquies, and are able to engage in \u201ca real probe of the defendant\u2019s mind.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>368 Mass. 100, 107 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>451 Mass. 332, 338 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fernandes, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u201c[Wjhat is wanted from [a guilty plea] colloquy is the basic assurances that the defendant, represented by counsel, with whom he has consulted, is free of coercion or the like, understands the nature of the crime charged, knows the extent of his guilt, recognizes the basic penal consequences involved, and is aware that he can have a trial if he wants one\u201d (footnotes omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nolan, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 491, 498-499 (1985). The protocol implemented by the Superior Court provides these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>necessary assurances. Once a judge receives the special magistrate\u2019s findings, the judge shall hold a hearing with the defendant and his counsel, adopt or revise the findings, accept or reject the plea, and, if the judge accepts the plea, impose sentence. In so doing, the judge shall engage the defendant and verify that the responses the defendant gave during the plea colloquy with the special magistrate remain accurate and true. The judge must be satisfied that the defendant\u2019s guilty plea was made intelligently and voluntarily, thereby confirming that the plea is a proper reflection of the defendant\u2019s guilt and a fair termination of the criminal proceedings against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We answer both parts of the third reported question, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">These matters are remanded to the single justice for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, as appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The Department of Public Health\u2019s executive summary of the Hinton drug lab internal inquiry, dated November 13, 2012, includes descriptions of the forensic laboratory testing protocols and workflow.

As such, we are sailing into uncharted waters with regard to the appellate process. Notwithstanding the fact that each case relates to a stay of execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial, rather than pending an appeal, we believe that Mass. R. A. P. 6, as appearing in 454 Mass. 1601 (2009), sets forth the proper procedure that is available after a judge acts on a motion for a stay. See Reporters\u2019 Notes to Rule 31, Mass. Ann. Laws Court Rules, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 1685 (LexisNexis 2012-2013). Typically, in all cases except those involving murder in the first degree, a single justice of the Appeals Court will hear the appeal. See <em>id. </em>We point out that a single justice may shorten or extend the time frame for responding to a motion to stay the execution of a defendant\u2019s sentence. See Mass. R. A. P. 6 (b) (2). Here, given the route by which this case came before the full bench, we are in the same position as the single justice to review the judge\u2019s order, and we do so in the interest of judicial economy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\">We anticipate that the Superior Court either has in place, or will put in place, a system for keeping track of the Hinton drug lab cases so that none falls through the proverbial cracks pending the disposition of defendants\u2019 motions for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Milette received 561 days of jail time credit pursuant to G.

Milette then pleaded guilty to trafficking in fourteen grams or more of cocaine (three counts), and possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute. Milette was sentenced to concurrent terms of from three years to three years and one day for each of his three drug trafficking convictions, and these sentences were deemed served.
