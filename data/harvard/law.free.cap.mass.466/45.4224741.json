When the police executed the warrant, they found and airested the defendant inside the residence, but in doing so, they also observed in plain view what they believed to be cocaine, marijuana, and other items consistent with drug distribution. Based on this evidence, which was seized during a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>search of the residence pursuant to a second search warrant, the defendant was indicted and tried in the Superior Court on charges of trafficking in cocaine in an amount of 200 grams or more, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (b), and possession with intent to distribute marijuana, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A jury found him guilty of both offenses, and the defendant appealed to the Appeals Court, which affirmed his convictions in a decision issued pursuant to its rule 1:28. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (2011). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">The principal issue the defendant raises concerns the validity of the first search warrant obtained by the State police to search for him at the third party\u2019s residence. The defendant argues that the affidavit submitted in support of that search warrant application was based on information obtained by the police trespassing into the curtilage of the residence, in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We conclude that a person who is the subject of a valid arrest warrant and is arrested by police while in the residence of a third party has a right under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 to insist that the police have a reasonable belief at the time they enter the residence that the person would be present. However, at least where, as in this case, the person has disclaimed any connection to the third party\u2019s residence, he does not have a constitutional right to insist that the police obtain a search warrant to search for him in the third party\u2019s residence or, where a search warrant is obtained, to challenge the basis on which the warrant issued.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>Background. </em>On December 18, 2006, State police Trooper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>CMstopher Boyle applied for and obtained a \u201cno-knock\u201d search warrant to search a certain residence located in Kingston (third party\u2019s residence) for the defendant, who was the subject of active arrest warrants for, among other things, firearm and drug trafficking offenses.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The special tactical operations (STOP) unit of the State police executed the search warrant in the early morning hours of December 19. On the first floor, Michael Goler-Branch (at one point a codefendant) was found sleeping on a recliner. When he stood up, officers observed a gun located in a sock underneath his right leg. Other officers located the defendant in bed in a room on the basement level, in close proximity to two large rolls of cash, an electronic scale, a size-able bag of what appeared to be marijuana, and a cardboard box containing what appeared to be several clear plastic bags of cocaine. Both Goler-Branch and the defendant were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Based on the officers\u2019 observations made during the initial entry on December 19, 2006, Boyle applied for a second search warrant to search the third party\u2019s residence for narcotics, firearms, and evidence of drug distribution. The warrant was obtained, and a second search later the same day yielded, among other items, cash and large quantities of marijuana and cocaine packaged in a manner consistent with distribution. Both the defendant and Goler-Branch thereafter were indicted for trafficking in 200 or more grams of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute a class D substance, marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant moved to dismiss the indictments on the ground that the evidence before the grand jury did not establish probable cause to indict him on the charged offenses because the Commonwealth did not, and could not, prove that the defendant lived at the third party\u2019s residence. The defendant\u2019s first trial counsel withdrew the motion shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The defendant and Goler-Branch were first tried together in the Superior Court in May, 2008. The trial judge declared a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>mistrial after the jury were unable to reach a verdict. Thereafter the defendant successfully moved to sever, and a second trial commenced on July 27, 2009, before the same judge. On the first day of this second trial, the defendant\u2019s new counsel filed three motions to suppress. The first was a motion to suppress the recordings of telephone calls made by the defendant while he was detained awaiting trial;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the second sought to suppress all evidence seized from the third party\u2019s residence based on the \u201cno-knock\u201d provision in the first search warrant; and the third was a motion to suppress that evidence based on intentional omissions in the affidavit submitted in support of the first search warrant or, alternatively, for a <em>Franks </em>hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-156 (1978). After a brief argument on the motions, the judge took the second motion (challenging the \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant) under advisement, and denied the first and the third motions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Jury empanelment began almost immediately thereafter. At the conclusion of the second trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Third motion to suppress. </em>The defendant does not challenge separately the validity of the second warrant, but contends that the search conducted pursuant to it was tainted by the illegality of the first search warrant and related search. As mentioned, the defendant argues that the affidavit submitted by Boyle in support of the first search warrant featured an intentional and material omission that, had it been included, would have demonstrated that to establish probable cause the police were relying on information that had been obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14. Accordingly, he claims, the search warrant was invalid, and all evidence seized pursuant to both searches must be suppressed. We set out in more detail the background facts of the two search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>warrants and related searches before considering the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">a. <em>Background facts. </em>Boyle\u2019s affidavit in support of his application for a warrant to search for the defendant at the third party\u2019s residence states, inter alia, that in each of the three months preceding the searches a confidential informant<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provided information to the police that the defendant was living on a certain street in Kingston in a dwelling that police confirmed matched the description of the third party\u2019s residence; periodic surveillance of the third party\u2019s residence by the police revealed the defendant\u2019s half-brother being present there \u201con several occasions\u201d; and during another \u201ccheck\u201d of the third party\u2019s residence, Sergeant J. Gilmore of the State police saw a black male fitting the defendant\u2019s description, but \u201ccould not make a positive identification.\u201d The affidavit also states that on December 18, 2006 \u2014 the same day the search warrant application was submitted \u2014 \u201c[a]t approximately 1510 hours [3:10 p.m.] Sergeant J. Gilmore made an identification\u201d of the defendant \u201cinside of [the third party\u2019s residence].\u201d Based on this information, the affidavit states there is probable cause to believe the defendant, the subject of three active arrest warrants described in the affidavit, \u201cis currently located and residing at [the third party\u2019s residence]\u201d and may be found there.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Not stated by Boyle in the affidavit but testified to at the second trial are the following facts. On December 18, 2006, Gilmore and Boyle conducted undercover surveillance of the third party\u2019s residence in an effort to confirm the defendant\u2019s presence there. The third party\u2019s residence is on the left side of a duplex with a shared front staircase and walkway facing the street. To maintain his cover, Gilmore wore a Verizon telephone utility helmet and blue jeans, and carried a clipboard. That evening, he walked down the driveway on the left side of the building and approached the rear entrance, entering onto a back porch that provided access to the first floor of the third party\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> From his vantage point on the back porch, Gilmore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>observed the defendant<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> one to two feet away in a first-floor bathroom; Gilmore made the observation through a bathroom window that opened onto the porch. Gilmore engaged the defendant in a brief conversation and handed the defendant a window screen that apparently had fallen off the window. Gilmore then departed and informed Boyle of his observations. Boyle, in turn, promptly applied for a search warrant to search the third party\u2019s residence for the defendant\u2019s person, supported by the affidavit previously described. An assistant clerk-magistrate of the Plymouth Division of the District Court Department issued the warrant that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The next day, December 19, at approximately 5:30 a.m., the STOP unit forcibly entered the third party\u2019s residence through the front and rear doors to execute the search warrant. As mentioned, officers found and arrested Goler-Branch on the first floor, and found and arrested the defendant in a basement room. The police then sought and obtained the second search warrant for the third party\u2019s residence based on the drugs and related items they had just observed in plain view. During the execution of the second warrant, the police seized from the basement room where the defendant had been found a coat containing $285 in currency and a small bag of cocaine, two large rolls of cash totaling $2,026, an electronic scale, a large bag of marijuana, a \u201ccuff sheet\u201d consisting of a short-hand list of names and telephone numbers, two cellular telephones, and a cardboard box that held fifteen bags totaling 53.15 grams of cocaine. They also seized from the first floor a suitcase containing three approximately one-pound bags of marijuana<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and four bags of cocaine totaling 437.3 grams, and 12.16 grams of an unidentified, white powdery substance that tested negative for narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">b. <em>Discussion. </em>Two decisions of the United States Supreme Court, <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573 (1980) <em>(Payton), </em>and <em>Steagald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 204 (1981) <em>(Steagald), </em>frame our consideration of the defendant\u2019s claim. In <em>Payton, </em>the Court concluded that under the Fourth Amendment, police with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>a valid arrest warrant for a suspect are permitted to enter the suspect\u2019s home to arrest him absent a search warrant, so long as the police have a reasonable belief that he will be there. <em>Payton, supra </em>at 603 (\u201cfor Fourth Amendment purposes, an arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>440 Mass. 772, 776, 778 (2004) (same under art. 14). In <em>Steagald, supra </em>at 205-206, the Court considered the question whether police officers who have a reasonable belief that the subject of a valid arrest warrant is present in a third party\u2019s home may enter that home without a search warrant to search for that person.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s answer was no: a search warrant based on probable cause that the subject of the arrest warrant will be present in the third party\u2019s home is necessary before the police are entitled to enter the home, at least absent exigent circumstances. See <em>Steagald, supra </em>at 211-212, 213-214. But the critical point about <em>Steagald </em>in relation to this case is that the defendant there was not the subject of an arrest warrant but the resident of the home. See note 11, <em>supra. Steagald </em>does not answer whether the subject of the arrest warrant himself is entitled to insist on a search warrant when he is reasonably believed to be present in a third party\u2019s home. See <em>id. </em>at 219 (\u201cThe issue here ... is not whether the subject of an arrest warrant can object to the absence of a search warrant when he is apprehended in another person\u2019s home, but rather whether the residents of that home can complain of the search\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">No subsequent decision of the Supreme Court addresses the question whether the subject of an arrest warrant whom the police arrest in a third party\u2019s home may challenge evidence seized from that home on the ground that the police did not obtain a valid search warrant before entering. Federal and State courts that have considered the question have reached somewhat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>different answers,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> although the majority view appears to be that the arrestee does not have a right to insist that a search warrant be obtained before entry can be made. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>576 F.3d 465, 467-468 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 1062 (2009), and cases cited. See also W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 6.1(a) (5th ed. 2012), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra </em>at 468 (\u201cunder the commonly held view that the <em>Steagald </em>search warrant requirement is for the protection of the third party only, upon objection of the arrestee it will suffice that, absent exigent circumstances, the police had only an <em>arrest </em>warrant, although in such a case the police once again must show they had a \u2018basis for believing that the suspect is actually present in the home\u2019 \u201d [emphasis in original]).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We follow the majority view, and reject the defendant\u2019s contrary position. To repeat, <em>Payton, </em>445 U.S. at 603, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>440 Mass. at 778, make plain that the subject of a valid arrest warrant whom the police arrest in his own home has no right to insist on a search warrant as a condition of the police entry; the arrest warrant is sufficient to satisfy the arrestee\u2019s Fourth Amendment and art. 14 rights, so long as the police have a reasonable belief that he will be present in his home. It follows that when an arrestee is present in a third party\u2019s home rather than his own, the arrestee has the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>right under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14 to require that the police have a reasonable basis to believe he will be present when they enter the home in search of him, but no more. As the Appeals Court has noted, \u201cIt would produce an unacceptable paradox to afford the subject of an arrest warrant greater protection in the home of another than in his or her own home.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 593 (1990). The proper focus of constitutional inquiry in this case, therefore, is not whether the police obtained a valid search warrant to search the third party\u2019s residence for the defendant, but whether the police had a reasonable belief<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that the defendant would be present there on December 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">The police clearly met the requisite standard. As reflected in Trooper Boyle\u2019s affidavit filed in support of the first search warrant application, the police had received a tip from a confidential informant that during October, November, and December of 2006, the defendant was living at a residence that the police independently confirmed met the description of the third party\u2019s residence; the police had seen the defendant\u2019s half-brother at this location on several occasions when conducting surveillance during these same months; and on the afternoon of December 18, Sergeant Gilmore observed the defendant inside the third party\u2019s residence and had a conversation with him there. Considered as a whole, the information possessed by the police provided probable cause to believe that the defendant would be found at the third party\u2019s residence on December 18, the day the search warrant was applied for and obtained, and also at 5:30 a.m. on December 19, when the police entered the premises to search for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The defendant argues that Gilmore unlawfully entered the curtilage of the third party\u2019s residence on December 18, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>insofar as that unlawful entry \u2014 a trespass \u2014 was necessary to establish probable cause for the search warrant, the warrant itself violates the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, requiring suppression of all items seized pursuant to the ensuing searches. A person who resided at the third party\u2019s residence and who was not the subject of the arrest warrants held by the police might well succeed in raising such a challenge to the searches on the facts presented here. See <em>Steagald, </em>451 U.S. at 213-214, 216.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>132 S. Ct. 945, 949 (2012) (intrusion on private property to obtain information is \u201csearch\u201d within meaning of Fourth Amendment; search warrant is generally required); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Knotts, </em>460 U.S. 276, 285-286 (1983) (Brennan, J., concurring) (same); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>366 Mass. 790, 794-795 (1975) (police eavesdropping from location in hallway of building owned and exclusively controlled by defendant violated defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy under Fourth Amendment; search warrant based on information so obtained by police was invalid).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But the defendant here, who <em>was </em>the subject of the arrest warrants; who, according to the record, did not reside at the third party\u2019s residence;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and who consistently has sought to challenge any suggestion that he did, see note 18, <em>infra, </em>is not in a position to advance such a claim.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">2. <em>The defendant\u2019s other claims. </em>As indicated at the outset, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>the defendant has raised additional claims in challenging his convictions. See note 2, <em>supra. </em>Essentially for the reasons stated by the Appeals Court, we conclude that these claims lack merit. We have concluded that the defendant is not in a position to challenge the validity of the first search warrant, but even assuming he were, there clearly was a sufficient basis presented in Boyle\u2019s affidavit supporting the warrant application to justify issuance of a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant and also sufficient evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of trafficking in cocaine under both a theory of the defendant\u2019s constructive possession of all the cocaine found and a theory of joint venture between the defendant and Goler-Branch.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\">The record contains no information concerning the disposition of the charges that were the subject of the arrest warrants that the police originally were seeking to serve on the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\">The defendant argues that reversal of his convictions is required on several additional grounds: the police failed to establish probable cause to justify issuance of a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant; the Commonwealth violated the defendant\u2019s right to due process in the manner it obtained recordings of the defendant\u2019s telephone conversations while he was held in custody awaiting trial; the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove that the defendant constructively possessed the cocaine and marijuana at issue or that he was guilty of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>crimes as a joint venturer; and defense counsel was ineffective in failing to pursue the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictments. We discuss these additional claims very briefly <em>infra, </em>and agree with the Appeals Court that they lack merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\">There is no dispute that the unit in Kingston (third party\u2019s residence) was not the defendant\u2019s residence.

We need not decide whether to reconsider our earlier conclusion here, because, as explained <em>infra, </em>the police satisfied the probable cause standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In applying for a search warrant to search for the defendant at the third party\u2019s residence, the police \u2014 presumably aware that it was not the defendant\u2019s residence \u2014 appropriately applied for a search warrant to search the premises for the defendant in accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s directive in <em>Steagald, </em>451 U.S. at 216.

See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">In support of his third motion to suppress and again on appeal, the defendant argues in the alternative that \u201cat a minimum\u201d he was entitled to an evidentiary <em>Franks </em>hearing to test the validity of the first search warrant, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>ground that Boyle\u2019s affidavit featured a material omission \u2014 namely, the fact of Gilmore\u2019s trespass into the curtilage of the property \u2014 that was intentional or made with a reckless disregard for the truth. See <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-156 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>454 Mass. 542, 552 (2009). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 773, 777-778 (2008). The defendant\u2019s claim of entitlement to a <em>Franks </em>hearing presumes he is in the position to challenge the validity of the search warrant. As we have just discussed, he is not. The denial of the request for a <em>Franks </em>hearing was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"Akv\">The defendant also argues on appeal that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the grand jury. The Appeals Court did not discuss this claim specifically in its decision. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 1101 (2011). The claim fails. Insofar as the defendant challenges the decision of his first trial counsel not to pursue the motion that counsel had filed to dismiss the trafficking indictment, there could be no ineffectiveness because the motion was meritless. The motion argued that the evidence before the grand jury did not provide probable cause that the defendant committed the offense charged because the Commonwealth failed to present evidence that the defendant resided at the third party\u2019s residence at the time the police seized the drugs. However, being a resident of the address is not a condition precedent to being charged with possession of drugs found therein. Pursuit of the motion would have been futile. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bona, </em>460 Mass. 249, 253 (2011). Insofar as the defendant appears to claim that his second trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the sufficiency of the grand jury evidence connecting him with the drugs found at the third party\u2019s residence, the defendant\u2019s claim, in substance, is the same as his argument that the trial evidence was insufficient, because the evidence presented to the grand jury on the point was essentially the same evidence that the Commonwealth presented at trial. We have concluded that the trial evidence was sufficient, and certainly the grand jury evidence was as well. Again, pursuit of a motion to dismiss on these grounds would have been futile.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>Lenk, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af\">(dissenting, with whom Ireland, C.J., and Duffly, J. join). This case is before us on a somewhat curious and incomplete set of facts. The police, who had several active arrest warrants for the defendant, thought he was likely to be found in a third party\u2019s home. The record is silent both as to the identity of that third-party householder and as to how the defendant came to be in the house.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event, in order to ascertain whether the defendant was in fact present in the unknown third party\u2019s home before executing the arrest warrants, a police officer disguised as a Verizon worker entered upon the curtilage of the house without a search warrant and, as a result, confirmed the defendant\u2019s presence inside the home. Using the information gained from this search, the police obtained a \u201cno-knock\u201d search warrant for the third party\u2019s home, which they executed at about 5:30 a.m. the following morning. A number of State and local police officers, including two special tactical operation (STOP) unit entry teams, with the use of battering rams, broke down the front and back doors and entered the third party\u2019s home with a show of force. They arrested the defendant and another man, apparently also not the homeowner. Police observed what were thought to be drugs in plain view and returned later with another search warrant to seize the contraband, all of which the defendant seeks to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Given that the sanctity of the home is of central concern in jurisprudence concerning the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, any warrantless police entry into a home is presumptively illegal. \u201c[Pjrivate residences are places in which the individual normally expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by a warrant .... Our cases have not deviated from this basic Fourth Amendment principle.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Karo, </em>468 U.S. 705, 714 (1984). See <em>Commonwealth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>v. <em>Lopez, </em>458 Mass. 383, 389-390 (2010). Having been charged with illegally possessing drugs that were seized during the search of the third party\u2019s home, the defendant has automatic standing to bring a motion to suppress the seized contraband. See <em>Commonwealth, </em>v. <em>Mubdi, </em>456 Mass. 385, 392-393 (2010).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">While not quarreling with the proposition that the warrantless \u201cVerizon worker\u201d search for information may well have been unconstitutional,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court today holds that the defendant may not challenge it or the ensuing search warrant permitting police to enter the third party\u2019s home for the purpose of arresting him. It is the court\u2019s position that, irrespective of the defendant\u2019s connection to the house, only the householder \u2014 and only if he, too, is arrested and charged with a crime<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 may insist upon a valid search warrant in such circumstances. The only challenge that one in the defendant\u2019s position may now bring is as to whether police had a reasonable belief that the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>present in the third party\u2019s home before entering it to execute the arrest warrant. In rebuffing such a challenge, however, the court also holds that the police are free to use information they may have gleaned from a prior unconstitutional search of the third party\u2019s home in order to show their reasonable belief that the defendant was present in the third party\u2019s house when they entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The upshot of today\u2019s decision is that, unless the third-party householder is himself arrested when the police execute an arrest warrant for someone else in his house, there will be no consequence if police have not secured the requisite valid search warrant before entering that house. Improperly obtained evidence will not be excluded, and improper police conduct will not be deterred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where police are not interested in pursuing a case against the third-party householder, and the arrestee whom they reasonably believe to be present cannot challenge the absence or validity of a search warrant, police will have little if any incentive to obtain a search warrant before entering the third party\u2019s house. And, in forming that reasonable belief as to the suspect\u2019s presence in the third party\u2019s house, police may now \u2014 also without consequence in such circumstances \u2014 physically intrude upon the third party\u2019s property to obtain confirmatory information. Chiefly because the court\u2019s decision undermines the security of third-party householders, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The facts here, as the court notes, fall outside the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in both <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 574-575 (1980) <em>(Payton), </em>and <em>Steagald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 205-206 (1981) <em>(Steagald), </em>and neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>requires the result the court reaches. <em>Payton, supra </em>at 574, was the Court\u2019s response to a State\u2019s statutes permitting police to make warrantless entry into a suspect\u2019s own home in order to arrest him. The Court determined that the Fourth Amendment required more: a magistrate\u2019s determination that probable cause existed, something that an arrest warrant provides. <em>Id. </em>at 602-603. \u201cIf there is sufficient evidence of a citizen\u2019s participation in a felony to persuade a judicial officer that his arrest is justified, it is constitutionally reasonable to require him to open his doors to the officers of the law. Thus, for Fourth Amendment purposes, an arrest warrant founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to enter a dwelling in which the suspect lives when there is reason to believe the suspect is within.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Steagald, supra </em>at 214 n.7, decided a year later, the Court explained that \u201c[bjecause an arrest warrant authorizes the police to deprive a person of his liberty, it necessarily also authorizes a limited invasion of that person\u2019s privacy interest when it is necessary to arrest him in his home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 214 n.7. There is no need, in other words, for a search warrant as well as an arrest warrant when entering the suspect\u2019s own home for the limited purpose of executing an arrest warrant for him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The situation is quite otherwise in a third party\u2019s home, and the Court in <em>Steagald </em>clarified that, under the Fourth Amendment, police may not, absent consent or exigent circumstances, legally search for the subject of an arrest warrant in the home of a third party without first obtaining a search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 205-206. In <em>Steagald, </em>however, the householder was himself arrested, along with the subject of the arrest warrant, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>thus able to challenge the absence of a search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 206-207.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Because neither <em>Steagald </em>nor <em>Payton </em>involved a challenge by the subject of the arrest warrant executed in a third party\u2019s home absent a valid search warrant, neither answers the question now before us. The court answers it by adopting the view, one shared by a number of courts,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the subject of an arrest warrant present in a third party\u2019s home does not have a right to insist that a valid search warrant be obtained before entry can be made. In doing so, the court in essence adopts the pithy observation of Justice Kass, writing for the Appeals Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 589, 593 (1990), that \u201c[i]t would produce an unacceptable paradox to afford the subject of an arrest warrant greater protection in the home of another than in his or her own home.\u201d While this reasoning is not without some force, it ultimately does not yield a satisfactory answer to the question before us. It does not take into account further Fourth Amendment jurisprudence that should also frame the analysis, and it fails to give due weight to the third-party householder\u2019s right to protection from unreasonable searches of his home, an interest at the core of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Ten years after the <em>Payton </em>decision, the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Court held in <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 99-100 (1990), that the warrantless arrest of an overnight guest in a third party\u2019s home violated the Fourth Amendment. The defendant\u2019s status as an overnight guest provided him a legitimate expectation of privacy in the third party\u2019s home like that enjoyed by the householder, enabling both to be free in that place from unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>Id. </em>at 98-99. The defendant accordingly had the right to insist upon a search warrant before the police could enter to arrest him. <em>Id. </em>at 100. In <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Carter, 525 </em>U.S. 83, 90-91 (1998), the Court continued to acknowledge that overnight guests in a home, and certain other social guests, may claim the protection of the Fourth Amendment. A majority of the Court concluded, on the facts presented, that the respondents, who were briefly in a third party\u2019s home during the day to bag cocaine together, did not share the householder\u2019s legitimate expectation of privacy and thus could not claim Fourth Amendment protection. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">As mentioned earlier, the facts here are consistent with the defendant\u2019s status as an overnight guest, even assuming that any legitimate expectation of privacy in the third party\u2019s home need be shown. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mubdi, </em>456 Mass. 385, 393 (2010). Rather than extend the reach of <em>Payton, </em>which should be confined to situations involving the execution of arrest warrants within the arrestee\u2019s own home, I would give full effect to the protections afforded third party householders in <em>Steagald. </em>I would allow a defendant who is a guest in a third party\u2019s home, and arrested while there pursuant to an arrest warrant, to challenge whether police had a valid warrant to search the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">I reach this conclusion persuaded in good part by the reasoning of Justice Ginsburg, writing for the dissent in <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Carter, 525 </em>U.S. 83, 106 (1998). Justice Ginsburg observed that, by undermining the security of the respondents, the Court was also thereby undermining the security of the home resident herself. <em>Id. </em>Concluding that the \u201cguest should share his host\u2019s shelter against unreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d the dissent \u201cresponds to the unique importance of the home \u2014 the most essential bastion of privacy recognized by the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Concerned that the Court\u2019s approach causes a homedweller to \u201cplace[] her</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>own privacy at risk. . . when she opens her home to others, uncertain whether the duration of their stay, their purpose, and their \u2018acceptance into the household\u2019 will earn protection\u201d from unreasonable searches and seizures, <em>id. </em>at 107, the dissent would avoid this risk by \u201cretaining] judicial surveillance over the warrantless searches today\u2019s decision allows.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112. I would do the same here, agreeing with Justice Ginsburg that, \u201c[a]s I see it, people are not genuinely \u2018secure in their. . . houses . . . against unreasonable searches and seizures,\u2019 [Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution], if their invitations to others increase the risk of unwarranted governmental peering and prying into their dwelling places.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The record reflects that the house was not the defendant\u2019s residence. On at least one occasion, however, the defendant slept overnight in a basement room at the house, and had previously made use of the first floor bathroom, facts consistent with his being a social guest. Further, the Commonwealth does not contend that the defendant was unlawfully in the house or had no right to be there. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mubdi, </em>456 Mass. 385, 393 n.8 (2010) (exception to automatic standing where defendant had no right to be in house where evidence was found).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, automatic standing permits a defendant charged with illegally possessing drugs or firearms seized during a search to \u201csucceed in suppressing such evidence where the search was unconstitutional, regardless of whether he has a subjective or objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the place where the drugs or firearms were found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Mubdi, <em>supra </em>at 393. Nonetheless, the defendant \u201cstill must show that there was a search in the constitutional sense, that is, that <em>someone </em>had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the place searched\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>Here, the unknown third-party householder certainly had such an expectation of privacy, as did the defendant for that matter, insofar as he was an overnight guest. See <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>495 U.S. 91, 99-100 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>132 S. Ct. 945, 949 (2012) (physical intrusion by government onto occupied private property for purpose of obtaining information is search within meaning of Fourth Amendment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The apparently unarrested third-party householder here, whose doors were battered down after police trespassed on his property to gather information, has as his only recourse the somewhat toothless civil action for damages. See Meltzer, Deterring Constitutional Violations by Law Enforcement Officials: Plaintiffs and Defendants as Private Attorneys General, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 247, 284 (1988) (\u201c[T]he conditions of constitutional tort litigation for harm caused by law enforcement officials are ones in which the deterrent effect is likely to be on the low side. The potential plaintiffs .... are unlikely to bring suit for harm suffered, whether because of ignorance of their rights, poverty, fear of police reprisals, or the burdens of incarceration. Moreover, in many cases the harm suffered by individuals from the constitutional violation itself may be small, widely dispersed, and intangible, providing little incentive for potential plaintiffs to sue . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\">As noted earlier, we know little about how the defendant came to be at the third party\u2019s house, which is perhaps neither atypical nor surprising when the third party is not also arrested. Because today\u2019s decision will have widespread consequences for householders in that situation, it is helpful to consider an example that may better illustrate the problem. Consider grandparents whose twenty year old grandson has dropped by for a visit and spends the night. Unbeknownst to them, the police have a warrant for his arrest. The police have no interest in arresting the grandparents or in gathering evidence against them. To confirm that the grandson is present, as a tipster has suggested, the police enter upon the back porch and look inside a window. Seeing the grandson, they enter his grandparents\u2019 home without knocking and they arrest him. Under today\u2019s decision, the warrantless entry and the trespass to gather information will go unchallenged and undeterred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">I have no doubt, however, that had the police first made a warrantless entry onto the suspect\u2019s private property\u2014 say, his back porch\u2014 to search for information as to whether he was at home, that search would fall outside the \u201climited authority\u201d police have under <em>Payton </em>v. <em>New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 602-603 (1980) <em>(Payton), </em>to enter his home to effect his arrest under the auspices of an arrest warrant. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 330, 334-336 (1990) (arrest warrant provides police justification to search only areas \u201cin the house that [the defendant] might have been found\u201d); <em>Steagald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 212-213 (1981) <em>(Steagald) </em>(arrest warrant primarily serves to protect individual from unreasonable seizure while search warrant safeguards individual\u2019s interest in privacy of his home against unjustified police intrusions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">This view, however, is not without its critics. As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit observed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Weems, </em>322 F.3d 18, 23 n.3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 892 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\"><em>\u201cSteagald </em>itself says that \u2018most modem commentators agree that a search warrant is necessary to fully protect the privacy interests of third parties when their home is searched for the subject of an arrest warrant.\u2019 <em>[Steagald, supra </em>at 208 n.3] (citing commentators).
