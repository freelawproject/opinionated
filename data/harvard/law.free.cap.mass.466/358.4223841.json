Physical Therapy Plus, Inc. (NEPT), for certain medically necessary chiropractic services provided to the passenger of its insured, the defendant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual), maintained that the cost of those services was unreasonably high and thus refused to pay the full amount invoiced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the ensuing trial on the dispute, Liberty Mutual sought to introduce statistical evidence from a commercial database to show that NEPT\u2019s charges exceeded the eightieth percentile of reported charges for the same procedures and were thus unreasonable. Liberty Mutual claimed that the statistical evidence was admissible pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B (\u00a7 79B), which creates a limited exception to the hearsay rule for factual statements contained in commercial publications. Citing a decision of the Appellate Division of the District Court that concluded the same database was unreliable, a District Court judge denied Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion to admit the database evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We are asked to determine whether a trial judge has discretion to consider the reliability of evidence offered under \u00a7 79B where the evidence otherwise satisfies the requirements of \u00a7 79B, and, if so, whether the judge here abused such discretion in excluding the database. Based on the explicit language of \u00a7 79B, and the gatekeeper role of a trial judge, we conclude that it is within a judge\u2019s discretion to consider the reliability of evidence offered pursuant to \u00a7 79B. Because the judge\u2019s conclusion that the evidence was not sufficiently rehable finds support in the record, we conclude also that the judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>Facts. </em>Prior to trial, the parties stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>to the following facts. On August 2, 2003, Gitane Dalencourt was injured in a motor vehicle accident while a passenger in a vehicle insured by Liberty Mutual. The policy provided $8,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) coverage, as required by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A. On October 10, 2003, Liberty Mutual received a PIP claim application from Dalencourt.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Liberty Mutual received bills totaling $4,465 from NEPT, for chiropractic treatment provided to Dalencourt from September 16, 2003 to December 17, 2003. It is undisputed that all treatment given by NEPT to Dalencourt was medically necessary to treat the injuries he sustained in the motor vehicle accident. Liberty Mutual paid a total of $3,730,68, leaving an unpaid balance of $734.32. In a letter to NEPT dated July 21, 2004, Liberty Mutual denied NEPT\u2019s request that it pay the remaining balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">On June 17, 2008, NEPT filed an action against Liberty Mutual in the District Court, seeking payment of the outstanding balance pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, and damages pursuant to G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 12. The only disputed issue at the jury-waived trial was whether the amount charged for the treatment by NEPT was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">b. <em>Prior proceedings. </em>Prior to trial, Liberty Mutual filed a motion in limine to admit in evidence, pursuant to the hearsay exception contained in \u00a7 79B, statistical summaries prepared by Ingenix, Inc. (Ingenix) of billing patterns in NEPT\u2019s geographical area for similar medical procedures. Liberty Mutual intended to introduce the Ingenix data at trial to rebut the reasonableness of NEPT\u2019s medical service charges by showing that NEPT\u2019s charges exceeded the average amount billed by providers in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">In support of its motion, Liberty Mutual submitted both an affidavit from Susan Seare, a senior director of legal and government liaisons at Ingenix, and the trial transcript from a trial in the District Court, Davekos <em>vs. </em>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., Docket No. 0518CV0156, a case involving a nearly identical dispute. At that trial, Carla Gee, a statistician employed by Ingenix, testified to what the Ingenix database is and how Ingenix produces its data.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In sum, she testified that Ingenix is a wholly-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>owned subsidiary of United Health Group, the owner of United Health Care, one of the largest health insurers in the United States. Ingenix collects data from insurance companies throughout the country on the costs of various medical procedures for which they have been billed. This contribution of data by insurance companies is entirely voluntary and Ingenix relies on its clients to submit complete and accurate data. Ingenix then groups this compiled data according to geographical regions and uses a proprietary \u201crelative value\u201d and \u201cconversion factor\u201d approach to produce the resulting data concerning billing patterns in a given region. The database is thus \u201cbased on [Ingenix] methodologies and the data that [it] collect[s].\u201d Gee acknowledged that Ingenix has never verified that the data produced as a result of its methodologies accurately correspond to what providers are actually charging. The judge in that case permitted the introduction of the Ingenix evidence, and Liberty Mutual prevailed at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Here, in opposition to Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion, NEPT brought to the judge\u2019s attention the subsequent decision of the Appellate Division of the District Court, reversing the judgment in the Davekos trial on the ground that the trial judge erred in admitting the Ingenix evidence. See <em>Michael Davekos, P.C. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2008 Mass. App. Div. 32, 36 <em>(Davekos). </em>Although its focus was on the requirements for admissibility under the business records exception, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, rather than \u00a7 79B, reliability of the information contained in the documents is one of those requirements. <em>Id. </em>at 34. Concluding that the \u201cIngenix statistical analyses are derivative only, and . . . that the Ingenix raw data itself. . . lacks the requisite indicia of reliability<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to be admissible,\u201d the Appellate Division deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>mined that the Ingenix documents \u201cdo not fall within the broadened business records exception for scientific studies containing primarily factual data.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35. NEPT also submitted, in opposition to Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion, news articles documenting legal settlements between Ingenix and both the State of New York and the American Medical Association regarding allegations that Ingenix databases reported artificially low charges to justify low insurance payments.* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">After a hearing on June 18, 2009, a District Court judge denied Liberty Mutual\u2019s motion, citing <em>Davekos, supra. </em>The jury-waived trial took place before the same judge on June 24, 2010. Liberty Mutual renewed its motion to introduce Ingenix data,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the judge affirmed his earlier decision to exclude the data.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Liberty Mutual presented no other evidence to refute the reasonableness of NEPT\u2019s charges. Accordingly, the judge found for NEPT on its G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, claim for the outstanding balance of the medical charges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Liberty Mutual appealed to the Appellate Division, contending that the judge erred in excluding the Ingenix data. The Appellate Division affirmed the judgment, and Liberty Mutual appealed to the Appeals Court. The Appeals Court affirmed the judgment, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 1135 (2012), and we granted Liberty Mutual\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We review a trial judge\u2019s evidentiary decisions under an abuse of discretion standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Polk, </em>462 Mass. 23, 32 (2012). In applying that standard, \u201cwe look for decisions based on \u2018whimsy, caprice, or arbitrary or idiosyncratic notions,\u2019 \u201d and \u201cdo not disturb the judge\u2019s ruling \u2018simply because [we] might have reached a different result; the standard of review is not substituted judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>461 Mass. 664, 670 (2012), quoting <em>Bucchiere </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>396 Mass. 639, 641, 642 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 79B, provides:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-6\">\u201cStatements of facts of general interest to persons engaged in an occupation contained in a list, register, periodical, book or other compilation, issued to the public, shall, in the discretion of the court, if the court finds that the compilation is published for the use of persons engaged in that occupation and commonly is used and relied upon by them, be admissible in civil cases as evidence of the truth of any fact so stated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">A party seeking to admit evidence pursuant to \u00a7 79B has the burden of \u201cat the minimum, persuading the trial judge to make the preliminary findings that the proposed exhibit is (1) issued to the public, (2) published for persons engaged in the applicable occupation, and (3) commonly used and relied on by such persons.\u201d <em>Mazzaro </em>v. <em>Pauli, </em>372 Mass. 645, 652 (1977) <em>(Mazzaro).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Two primary rationales give rise to this exception to the hearsay rule. The first is that, as a practical matter, it would be inconvenient, if not impossible, to issue summonses for all of the authors and compilers of any given publication to testify at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>trial. See <em>id. </em>at 650, citing 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1702 (Chadboum rev. ed. 1976). The second is that \u201cthe trustworthiness of such lists is assured through general reliance on them by those in a particular profession, and the consequent motivation of the compiler to foster this reliance by his accuracy.\u201d <em>Mazzaro, supra </em>at 650, citing 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1702 (Chadboum rev. ed. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Liberty Mutual claims that the judge erred in considering the reliability of the Ingenix data as a factor in his admissibility analysis. According to Liberty Mutual, if a publication satisfies the three statutory elements enumerated above it is thereby admissible, since the reliability of the publication is already sufficiently assured by the fact that it is commonly used and relied on by persons in a particular occupation. See <em>Mazzaro, supra </em>at 650. Such a reading of the statute, however, disregards both the discretion explicitly afforded the judge in the language of \u00a7 79B, and the judge\u2019s traditional role as gatekeeper of admissible evidence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>463 Mass. 581, 603-604 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Previous decisions construing \u00a7 79B have recognized and emphasized that the statute affords a trial judge discretion to determine the admissibility of an offered publication. See <em>Mazzaro, supra </em>at 653 (\u201cThe matter [of admissibility] is entrusted by statute to the discretion of the trial judge\u201d); <em>Torre </em>v. <em>Harris-Seybold Co., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 660, 673 (1980) (\u201cboth the express terms of the statute and case law in the area reserve a large measure of discretion to the trial judge in passing on admissibility\u201d). See also Leach &amp; McNaughton, Developments in Massachusetts Evidence 1940-55, 40 Mass. L.Q. 14, 15 (1955) (\u201c\u00a7 79B gives the court discretion to admit certain commercial lists\u201d). If the Legislature had intended evidence to be admissible, without more, upon satisfaction of the elements enumerated in the statute, it would not have included the language providing judges with discretion to determine admissibility. Where the Legislature has included such language, we are not free simply to ignore it. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>417 Mass. 661, 664 (1994) (\u201cWe are not free to ignore or to tamper with [a] clear expression of legislative intent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Moreover, reading \u00a7 79B to preclude a judge\u2019s consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>of the reliability of evidence offered under that statute produces an absurd result insofar as, on that view, a judge would be without authority to exclude obviously flawed and unreliable data simply because it is relied upon in a given industry. Such a reading, in addition to ignoring the clear statutory language, lends itself to obvious abuse by a given industry where the use of manipulated and flawed data is in its interest. See <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>862 F.Supp. 505, 508 n.13 (D. D.C. 1994), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 62 F.3d 1469 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (evidence of reasonable rate for attorneys fees contained in published compilation inadmissible under analogous Federal rule because \u201c[t]he court is not yet convinced that published fee surveys reliably reflect rates actually billed and not rates that surveyed lawyers have artificially inflated for the [compilation\u2019s] audience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">A more straight-forward reading of \u00a7 79B recognizes that the judge has discretion as to the admissibility of the evidence, even where the evidence satisfies the preliminary statutory requirements. Such discretion necessarily encompasses consideration of the reliability or trustworthiness of the proffered evidence, the \u201cgeneral rationale underlying exceptions to the hearsay rule.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>438 Mass. 142, 155 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 966 (2003). Although \u00a7 79B\u2019s requirement that the offered publication be commonly used and relied upon is intended to ensure a certain level of reliability, a judge is not foreclosed by this statutory language from addressing reliability concerns where they are evident notwithstanding such use. See <em>Shepherd </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Cos., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Consideration of the reliability of evidence offered pursuant to \u00a7 79B is especially warranted where, as here, the proffered evidence contains complex, extrapolated data rather than simple objective facts. See <em>Mazzaro, supra </em>at 652 (\u201cWe think \u2018compilation,\u2019 as used in the statute, connotes simple objective facts, and not conclusions or opinions\u201d). See also <em>White Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>611 F.Supp. 1049, 1069 (W.D. Mo. 1985) (\u201cthe kinds of publications contemplated by the [analogous Federal] rule are those which deal with compilations of relatively straightforward <em>objective facts not requiring, for their statement, a subjective analysis of other facts\u201d </em>[emphasis in original]); 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>C.B. Mueller &amp; L.C. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a7 8:101 (3d ed. 2007) (noting that \u201c[t]he commercial list exception is actually narrow\u201d but \u201csometimes it reaches even more elaborate empirical data of specialized sorts\u201d). To be sure, we do not suggest that all publications that contain data derived from the application of complex methodologies to raw data are categorically excluded from \u00a7 79B. Rather, we recognize that judges may consider whether particular compilations are sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible in the circumstances as an exception to the hearsay rule. See 5 J.B. Weinstein &amp; M.A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence, \u00a7 803.19 (J.M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2013) (\u201cthere are publications relied on by the public or individuals in particular occupations that are not concerned with simple objective facts. Whether such a publication meets the requisite standard of trustworthiness entitling it to hearsay exemption must be determined on a case by case basis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Turning to the present case, the judge had before him the transcripts from the Davekos trial and the Seare affidavit, the latter largely duplicative of the Davekos trial testimony. This evidence demonstrated that Ingenix is a sister company to one of the largest insurance providers in the country; it relies on the voluntary submission of data on medical costs from the limited universe of insurance companies who choose to participate in the program; it applies a proprietary relative value and conversion factor to the raw data; and it has never verified that the data produced as a result of this formula accurately correspond with actual charges for medical procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">In other words, the data contained in the Ingenix database derives from raw data that is voluntarily submitted by participating insurance companies, not fully verified, and to which Ingenix applies its proprietary methodologies. On a largely identical record, the Appellate Division of the District Court held \u201cthere is nothing in the record to establish the accuracy or reliability of Ingenix\u2019s raw data and, thus, its statistical extrapolations.\u201d <em>Davekos, supra </em>at 34. In addition to this evidence, the judge had before him evidence that the New York Attorney General conducted an investigation of Ingenix and found that the \u201crates produced by Ingenix were remarkably lower than the actual cost of typical medical expenses.\u201d On such a record, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>cannot say that the judge abused his discretion in excluding the evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Cruz </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>461 Mass. 664, 670 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of the American Insurance Association, Massachusetts Insurance Federation, National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, and Property Casualty Insurers Associations of America, and of Mitchell International, Inc., on behalf of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty Mutual); and the amicus briefs of the Automobile Insurers Bureau and Fair Health, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Susan Seare\u2019s affidavit largely echoed the testimony of Carla Gee at the Davekos trial, with the addition of an extensive list of customers who use Ingenix, Inc.

To the extent that this creates any question as to whether the judge mistakenly believed that he was without discretion and bound to deny the admission of the evidence because of the decision in <em>Davekos, </em>we note that the evidence offered by Liberty Mutual consisted primarily of the trial transcript from <em>Davekos. </em>The affidavit by Susan Seare, the only additional piece of evidence submitted by Liberty, was largely duplicative of testimony in Davekos and offered little to augment the reliability of the Ingenix data. Although Davekos, <em>supra, </em>concerned admissibility under the business records exception, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 78, the court broadly concluded that the Ingenix date was inadmissible because the record failed to establish that the methodologies employed by Ingenix produced reliable data. <em>Id. </em>at 34. Because reliability is also, as previously discussed, a significant criterion for admissibility of evidence under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79B, the trial judge here appropriately could and did rely on the <em>Davekos </em>decision in declining to admit any Ingenix database evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
