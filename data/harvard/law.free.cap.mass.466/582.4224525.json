L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. We affirm the single justice\u2019s ruling that G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, applies to such appeals. However, because the plaintiff was afforded a renewed opportunity to pursue an appropriate and timely appeal under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, and has chosen to do so, we dismiss this case as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">1. <em>Background, </em>a. <em>The plaintiff\u2019s initial claims. </em>This case arises from a consumer dispute regarding billing practices and quality of telephone, cable television, and Internet service provided by Verizon New England, Inc., to the plaintiff, a residential customer. In December, 2009, the plaintiff filed an appeal and a claim for an adjudicatory hearing with the department, alleging that Verizon New England had violated the department\u2019s mies and practices relating to telephone service to residential customers,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and had otherwise engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices. The matter was assigned to a hearing officer, and after a tortuous procedural history, the claim was dismissed as moot because, in the course of the proceedings, the plaintiff\u2019s customer relationship with Verizon New England had been terminated due to continuous nonpayment. The plaintiff appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the commissioner of the department, pursuant to 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.06(6)(d)(3) (2008). On August 15, 2011, the commissioner affirmed the mling, on the ground that no relief remained available to the plaintiff once he ceased being a Verizon New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>England customer, and issued a final order denying the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">b. <em>Appellate proceedings. </em>Following the commissioner\u2019s final order, the plaintiff filed a complaint for judicial review of final agency action and for other relief with a single justice of the county court, articulating as the basis for jurisdiction our certiorari statute, G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The department argued that the county court lacked jurisdiction and that the complaint should be dismissed because the plaintiff\u2019s appeal was governed by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, and the plaintiff had failed to comply with its terms. The single justice concluded that the appeal was governed by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and ordered the case transferred to Superior Court. However, on the department\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the single justice held that the appeal is properly governed by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, and within the jurisdiction of the county court, and vacated the order of transfer to the Superior Court. The single justice then dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, concluding that his failure to file the appeal within twenty days of service of the department\u2019s final order, in violation of the requirements of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, constituted a jurisdictional defect. The plaintiff appealed to the full court, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The department\u2019s regulations require that it provide notice that an appeal from a final order or decision is governed by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13 (2008). During oral argument before this court, it became clear that the department had not included such notice in the final order it issued to the plaintiff. The department reissued the August 15, 2011, final order, dating it September 18, 2013, and including the previously omitted notice of a right to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Two days later, the department filed in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>court a motion to stay appellate proceedings, on the ground that it had given the plaintiff a renewed opportunity to pursue an appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. We granted the motion to stay to enable the plaintiff to file a timely appeal of the September 18, 2013, order pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, without waiving his arguments in this case, and subsequently denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the order staying the proceedings. We now lift the stay and proceed to decide the central procedural issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the single justice\u2019s decision to dismiss his complaint on the ground that he failed to comply with the timely filing requirements of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, was error because his appeal is governed by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, and therefore requires a transfer to the Superior Court for proceedings on the merits, or alternatively, due process requires that he be afforded the opportunity to pursue a proper appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, because the department initially failed to notify him of his right to appeal under this statute. The department argues that the single justice did not err in concluding that G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, governs, and asks that we affirm the single justice\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. We agree with the department that G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, is the applicable judicial review provision, and conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint here is rendered moot by his subsequent timely filing of a proper appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">a. <em>Applicable statute. </em>We first address whether G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, or G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, applies. This question is significant because appeals pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, are entered with the single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court,* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> whereas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>appeals pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, are filed in Superior Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We begin by analyzing the impact on the statutory scheme governing the department of a reorganization statute (act) enacted in 2007. See St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 21-50. The act divided the responsibilities of the former Department of Telecommunications and Energy into the reformed Department of Public Utilities and a new Department of Telecommunications and Cable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>It accomplished this by revising the definition of \u201cdepartment\u201d in numerous chapters, including chapters 160, 161, and 166, to refer to either the Department of Public Utilities or the Department of Telecommunications and Cable. See St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 33, 43. Further, the act inserted chapter 25C to create the Department of Telecommunications and Cable and to task it with \u201cthe general supervision of telephone and telegraph companies subject to chapter 166 and community antenna television systems as defined in section 1 of chapter 166A.\u201d G. L. c. 25C, \u00a7 1, inserted by St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7 29. The act also brought two divisions under the Department of Telecommunications and Cable: a new division of telecommunications, provided for in G. L. c. 25C, \u00a7 6,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the existing division of community antenna television, provided for in G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 50. Therefore, the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>of Public Utilities and the Department of Telecommunications and Cable, including its two divisions, now fulfil the responsibilities previously held by the Department of Telecommunications and Energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">General Laws c. 25C, the enabling statute for the Department of Telecommunications and Cable, does not contain a provision for judicial review of final department orders. As a result, we turn to the other chapters in the statutory scheme. The department argues that G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, expressly states that appeals from all department orders are governed by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. The plaintiff contends that G. L. c. 166 (relating to the regulation of telephone companies) does not contain a similar provision and, further, that because the department\u2019s enabling statute (G. L. c. 25C) does not contain a provision for judicial review, the Administrative Procedures Act, G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, applies as the default. In support of his argument, he argues, in essence, that G. L. c. 25C should be read to mean that the provisions of G. L. c. 166A apply only to community antenna television systems. Were we to follow his line of reasoning, appeals from final orders relating to telephone and telegraph services would be governed by G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, as G. L. c. 166 contains no judicial review provision, whereas appeals from final orders relating to cable services would be governed by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, as dictated by G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We are not persuaded, however, that in drafting G. L. c. 25C, \u00a7 1, the Legislature intended such parsing of appellate routes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>based on the type of service. Rather, the plain meaning of the revised statutes, the historical statutory scheme, and the department\u2019s own interpretation of the statutes suggest that appeals from all final department orders are governed by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, at the direction of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">i. <em>Plain meaning. </em>\u201cA fundamental tenet of statutory interpretation is that statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result.\u201d <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001). Thus, we give effect to a statute\u2019s \u201cplain and ordinary meaning\u201d where the statute\u2019s words are clear. <em>Massachusetts Broken Stone Co. </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>430 Mass. 637, 640 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The 2007 Act altered the definition of \u201cdepartment\u201d in G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 1, from \u201cdepartment of telecommunications and energy established pursuant to chapter 25\u201d to \u201cdepartment of telecommunications and cable established by chapter 25C.\u201d G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7 49. By redefining \u201cdepartment\u201d in this way for the purposes of G. L. c. 166A, the Legislature created a clear link between the new G. L. c. 25C and the existing G. L. c. 166A.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Since 1997, G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, has employed the term \u201cdepartment\u201d in defining a process for judicial review. See G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 273. The section currently provides: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, appeals taken from the orders of the <em>department </em>shall be taken in the same manner and according to the same procedure for the department of public utilities established in section 5 of chapter 25\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">It is only logical to employ the definition of \u201cdepartment\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>provided in G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 1, to the term where it is used elsewhere in the chapter. See <em>Boothroyd </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Amherst, </em>449 Mass. 333, 339 (2007) (\u201cWe construe the provisions of the Act in connection with the purpose of its enactment and as a harmonious whole\u201d); <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>313 Mass. 779, 782 (1943), quoting G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third (\u201ctechnical words and phrases ... as may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Accordingly, the word \u201cdepartment\u201d in the judicial review provision of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, must refer to the entire Department of Telecommunications and Cable. Although the placement of this judicial review provision may be confusing, its meaning is nonetheless clear:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the provisions of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, pertaining to judicial review extend to all final department orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">This interpretation is further supported by what the Legislature did <em>not </em>change in its recent amendments to G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. We find it significant that the Legislature modified G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, in 2007 and again in 2008 without replacing the word \u201cdepartment\u201d with a more narrow term. See St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7 50 (replacing first paragraph of G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, but preserving word \u201cdepartment\u201d); St. 2008, c. 522, \u00a7 22 (same). See also St. 2008, c. 522, \u00a7 21 (removing definition of \u201ccommission\u201d from G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 1, but preserving 2007 defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>tions of \u201cdivision\u201d and \u201cdepartment\u201d). Had the Legislature meant to limit the reach of this provision, it could have employed the word \u201cdivision\u201d or another more restrictive term.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">ii. <em>Historical statutory scheme. </em>Our interpretation is consistent with the previous versions of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401 (1931), cert. denied, 284 U.S. 684 (1932) (\u201cStatutes are to be interpreted ... in connection with their development . . .\u201d). Prior to the 2007 revisions, G. L. c. 25 applied to the Department of Telecommunications and Energy as a whole. See St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7 21 (changing \u201ctelecommunications and energy\u201d in c. 25, \u00a7 1, to \u201cpublic utilities\u201d). General Laws c. 25, \u00a7 5, which sets forth a detailed procedure for appealing a final department decision or order, remained unchanged by the 2007 revisions. Thus, prior to 2007, all appeals from the former Department of Telecommunications and Energy were governed by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Although the 2007 revisions divided the responsibilities of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy into two departments, the indication in G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, that appeals should \u201cbe taken in the same manner ... as set forth with respect to the department of public utilities\u201d suggests a legislative intent to retain some uniformity across the two new departments. See <em>Hallett </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 66, 69 (2000). Parsing appeals by division within the Department of Telecommunications and Cable would frustrate such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">We therefore discern no clear indication in the 2007 or 2008 revisions that the Legislature intended to exclude only those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>appeals relating to telecommunications from the appeals procedures employed by the former Department of Telecommunications and Energy. Cf. <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Cable, </em>457 Mass. 562, 563 &amp; n.3 (2010) (recognizing that G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, governs \u201cappeals seeking judicial review of decisions of the Department of Telecommunications and Cable\u201d in context of appeal by cable television service provider from cable rate decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">iii. <em>The department\u2019s interpretation. </em>In addition, the department\u2019s regulations are consistent with this reading of the statutory scheme. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13 (\u201cDepartment shall notify all parties of their right to appeal a final decision of the Department pursuant to [G. L.] c. 25, \u00a7 5, and of the time limits on their rights to appeal\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Thus, the department has properly given effect to the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent. See <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-843 &amp; n.9 (1984) <em>(Chevron). </em>Even if the intent of the Legislature were not so clear, we give deference to a reasonable interpretation by the agency implementing the statute, and would find the agency\u2019s reading of the statutory scheme to be reasonable here. See <em>id. </em>at 843-844 &amp; n.11; <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>462 Mass. 227, 228-229 (2012); <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 633-634 (2005). Cf. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>429 Mass. 241, 252-253 (1999), citing <em>Chevron, supra </em>at 842 (deferring to reasonable interpretation by agency interpreting ambiguous statutory scheme).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the single justice did not err in concluding that G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, governs appeals of final orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>issued by the Department of Telecommunications and Cable to consumers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">b. <em>The single justice\u2019s dismissal of complaint. </em>We next address whether the plaintiff is entitled to reinstatement of his complaint and relief on the merits. When this case initially came before us, the department had failed to include in its final order clear notice to the plaintiff of his right to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. Such notice is required by the department\u2019s regulations. See 220 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.13. However, by reissuing its final order with notice of the proper procedure for appeal, the department provided the plaintiff with precisely the relief he sought before the full court: an opportunity to pursue his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">In response, the plaintiff has filed a new petition for judicial review within the time period required by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As a result, there is no longer a controversy before us. See <em>Caputo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Somerville, </em>330 Mass. 107, 111 (1953), quoting <em>Tennessee </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>189 U.S. 64, 71 (1903). See also <em>Lockhart </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 782-783 (1984). His complaint here is properly dismissed as moot, and he now may proceed with his new petition through the proper channels. Cf. <em>Moe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>444 Mass. 1009, 1009-1010 (2005) (appeal from dismissal of untimely request for judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>review was dismissed as moot because plaintiff was offered new opportunity to file timely and proper appeal); <em>Matter of </em>Sturtz, 410 Mass. 58, 58-59 (1991) (appeal of guardianship appointment was dismissed as moot because guardianship had been discharged by lower court after appeal was filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>We affirm the ruling of the single justice that G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, governs appeals from final orders issued by the Department of Telecommunications and Cable. Because the plaintiff has filed a new appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, which the department concedes is timely following the reissuance of its final order, the remainder of the matter before us has become moot. The case is remanded to the county court for an entry of judgment dismissing the complaint as moot. The plaintiff is free to proceed with his new petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Except as otherwise indicated, we shall refer to the Department of Telecommunications and Cable as \u201cthe department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The rules and practices relating to telephone service to residential customers (rules) are template rules regarding billing practices and account termination promulgated by the department that Verizon New England has acknowledged are binding on its provision of telephone services.

When the Legislature inserted G. L. c. 166A in 1971, with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>purpose of providing for the regulation of television, it established a community antenna television commission within the Executive Office of Consumer Affairs. See G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, inserted by St. 1971, c. 1103, \u00a7 1. This commission was authorized \u201cto call on the staff of the department of public utilities or any other state or federal agency for administrative and investigatory services and technical advice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 1979, the Legislature removed the authorization for the commission to work with other agencies. See G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1979, c. 670, \u00a7 2. In 1997, the commission became a division of community antenna television in the Department of Public Utilities. See G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1997, c. 43, \u00a7 111. Later that year, a subsequent amendment placed the division under the Department of Telecommunications and Energy, presumably as part of the renaming of the Department of Public Utilities. See G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 273. The 2007 amendment placed the division under the purview of the new Department of Telecommunications and Cable. See G.

L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 1997, c. 164, \u00a7 273. This wording was preserved in a 2002 amendment to the section. See G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 2002, c. 45, \u00a7 4. The 2007 Act retained this directive, but modified the last phrase to indicate explicitly that the Department of Telecommunications and Cable (as defined in G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 1, by the 2007 Act) and the Department of Public Utilities should share a judicial review process. See G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, as amended by St. 2007, c. 19, \u00a7 50. The modified language provided that appeals \u201cshall be taken in the same manner and according to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>procedure as set forth with respect to the department of public utilities in section 5 of chapter 25.\u201d See <em>id. </em>A 2008 amendment further modified this language by removing \u201cas set forth with respect to\u201d so that the end of the sentence now states: \u201caccording to the same procedure for the department of public utilities established in section 5 of chapter 25.\u201d See G.

General Laws c. 166A is titled \u201ccommunity antenna television systems\u201d; G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 2, is titled \u201cdivision of community antenna television\u201d; and even G. L. c. 25C, \u00a7 1, makes reference to G. L. c. 166A in the context of community antenna television systems. Although we have recognized that the title of an act or statutory provision may be helpful in clarifying ambiguity, see <em>Baldiga </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Uxbridge, </em>395 Mass. 829, 835 (1985), or identifying the act\u2019s \u201cproper limitations,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>388 Mass. 115, 120 (1983), the title may not replace or limit otherwise clear language in the act itself. <em>American Family Life Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 474, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983), and cases cited (\u201cthe title of an act cannot control the plain provisions of the act\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">An exception to this overarching application of G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, was to appeals from orders regarding cable rates. Prior to 2008, such appeals were required to be filed in the Superior Court for Suffolk County. G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 15, inserted by St. 1971, c. 1103, \u00a7 1 (\u201cAny person or company aggrieved by any action, order, finding or decision of the commission under this section may, within ninety days from the filing of such memorandum thereof with the commission, file a petition in the superior court for the county of Suffolk for a review of such action, order, finding or decision\u201d). In 2008, however, the Legislature amended the statute to remove this exception. G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 15, as amended by St. 2008, c. 522, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 34 (removing fourth paragraph of \u00a7 15 and replacing \u201cdivision\u201d with \u201cdepartment\u201d). As a result, appeals from final cable rate orders are now governed by G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. See <em>Springfield </em>v. <em>Department of Telecomm. &amp; Cable, </em>457 Mass. 562, 563 n.3 (2010). See also G. L. c. 166A, \u00a7 15 (providing Superior Court only with equity jurisdiction to enforce department\u2019s orders).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The plaintiff asserts that the department has failed to provide notice to any consumers regarding the right to appeal pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, since the 2007 amendment. In support of this claim, he offers numerous examples of final orders and decisions from the department. Some of these contain a general notice of the right to appeal that states: \u201cAppeals of any final decision, order or ruling of the Department of Telecommunications and Cable may be brought pursuant to applicable state and federal laws.\u201d At least one, however, contains the specific language of and reference to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5. We agree with the plaintiff that it is imperative that the department provide explicit and accurate notice of the right to appeal and the governing provisions; however, we do not agree that these inconsistencies demonstrate that the department has never provided appropriate notice to consumers in the plaintiff\u2019s situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We are aware that this reading of the statutory scheme may result in an influx of consumer complaints appealed from the department to the single justice, and then appealable to the full court. We urge the Legislature to assess whether this was its true intention with respect to residential consumer complaints. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Florence F., </em>429 Mass. 523, 523, 527 (1999) (encouraging Legislature to revisit statute that limited Juvenile Court\u2019s enforcement powers by prohibiting court from charging minor with criminal contempt). We note also that G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A, permits this court to \u201ctransfer for partial or final disposition in any appropriate lower court any cause or matter which might otherwise be disposed of by a single justice.\u201d We read this provision to mean that a single justice may, in his or her discretion, transfer a complaint filed pursuant to G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, for resolution by the lower courts. See <em>Callahan </em>v. <em>Board of Bar Overseers, </em>417 Mass. 516, 519-520 (1994); <em>Empire Apartments, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>353 Mass. 333, 334-335 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Under G. L. c. 25, \u00a7 5, an aggrieved party must file a petition for appeal within twenty days of the date of service of the final decision, order, or ruling. Within ten days after so filing, the appealing party must \u201center the appeal in the supreme judicial court sitting in Suffolk county.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The plaintiff filed his petition for appeal with the department on October 22, 2013, and entered his appeal with the single justice on October 29, 2013.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
