L. c. 265, \u00a7 1, for the killing of Maryse Antoine (victim), the mother of his young daughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant raises four issues on appeal. First, he claims that the trial judge erred in allowing the prosecutor to exercise a peremptory challenge of the only African-American male who remained in the venire without determining that the prosecutor had a bona fide group-neutral reason for the challenge, and thereby denied him his State and Federal constitutional rights to equal protection and a fair and impartial jury. Second, he contends that the judge\u2019s sanctions and jury instructions, which were crafted in response to defense counsel\u2019s violation of an order of reciprocal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>discovery, denied him his State and Federal constitutional rights to a fair trial. Third, he maintains that the judge erred in failing to provide the jury with the instruction required in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 447-448 (2004), regarding his unrecorded interview with the police that followed his voluntary arrival at the police station a few hours after the victim\u2019s body had been discovered. Fourth, the defendant claims that the prosecutor made various improper and prejudicial statements in her closing argument. For the reasons detailed below, we affirm the conviction and, after a complete review of the record, decline to exercise our plenary authority under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to order a new trial or reduce the murder conviction to a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the evidence supporting the conviction, reserving certain details of the trial for our discussion of the alleged errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The defendant and the victim had dated, lived together, and patented a daughter, who was bom in 2005. During the course of their relationship, the victim\u2019s family members and friends had observed the defendant \u201cscream\u201d at her, slap and punch her, threaten to strike her with a chair, threaten her life and that of her family, and tell her that he would find a way to kill her without using a gun. The defendant demanded to know with whom the victim had been and what she had been doing, and used her cellular telephone to identify unknown callers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">In March, 2009, they no longer lived together, but the defendant often visited and stayed overnight at the victim\u2019s home in Waltham, where she lived with her eighteen year old son and three and one-half year old daughter. In the months leading up to her death, the victim and the defendant had been planning to initiate a cleaning business. The defendant lived in Taunton and, unbeknownst to the victim\u2019s family, had married and was living with his wife, Susan Dubuc.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">On the evening of March 20, 2009, the defendant visited the victim for three hours at her home, where they tested cleaning products. On March 21, a sister of the victim (Guile Sautier) and her family visited the victim at her home, and remained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>there from approximately 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. At approximately 10:15 p.m., the victim telephoned her teenage son and asked him to come home to take care of his sister because she had to \u201cmeet him at a site\u201d; her son understood her to mean that she was going to meet the defendant at a cleaning site. Her son returned home around 10:30 p.m., and the victim soon left. At approximately 10:50 p.m., the victim telephoned her son and asked if he wanted her to bring him something to eat. The victim did not return home the next morning and did not answer her son\u2019s telephone calls, so the son contacted the victim\u2019s two sisters and the defendant. The defendant told the son that he had not spoken with the victim since 6:30 p.m. on March 21, and that he had not met with her that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">The victim often visited another sister, Yves Nelson, who lived nearby in Waltham. The victim had keys to Nelson\u2019s apartment. Nelson had stayed overnight with relatives on March 21 and returned home to her apartment at approximately 4 p.m. on March 22. After unlocking the apartment door, she found the victim lying on the living room floor, apparently lifeless, and telephoned 911.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The victim\u2019s pants had been pulled down, there were bleach stains on her jacket and on the rug near her body, a capped needle from a syringe was on the floor a few feet from her body, and a small piece of dark blue string was next to her shoulder. The victim showed signs of rigor mortis, and was later declared dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">At the crime scene, apart from the piece of dark blue string on the floor next to the victim\u2019s shoulder, investigators observed a brown mark around the victim\u2019s neck, a tiny piece of string embedded in her neck, and a piece of dark blue string around the right side of her neck. A medical examiner opined that the victim\u2019s death was caused by strangulation by ligature. A swab taken from the broken string found near the victim\u2019s right shoulder was submitted for Y-chromosome short tandem repeat (Y-STR) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing, which looks only at DNA from the Y-chromosome, found only in males, and compares the questioned DNA profile, not with a particular individual\u2019s DNA profile, but with the DNA profile of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>paternal lineage of a family.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Y-STR DNA testing revealed that the defendant\u2019s paternal lineage was a potential contributor of the DNA profile taken from the string; the probability of inclusion was one in 1,156 in the African-American population, which meant that the DNA on the Y-chromosome of 99.91 per cent of African-American men would not match the DNA profile from the string.* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The police also removed a gummy substance that covered the peephole on the door leading into Nelson\u2019s apartment. Short tandem repeat (STR) DNA testing was conducted of a swab taken from that substance, and the defendant\u2019s DNA was found to be a potential contributor to the DNA from that swab. The probability that a randomly selected individual would have that DNA profile was one in 66.23 quadrillion for the African-American population.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">The defendant stipulated at trial that the white residue on a capped needle from a syringe found near the body was acetaminophen and codeine. Toxicological testing performed by the Commonwealth revealed that neither drug was present in the victim\u2019s body. The defendant worked in a quality control laboratory where he had access to an area that required a special pass for admittance where capped needles of the same size and type were stored in an unlocked drawer.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Waltham police Detective Lieutenant Brian Navin and Detective Patrick Hart arrived at Nelson\u2019s apartment at 5:40 p.m., but were soon summoned back to the police station after being told that the victim\u2019s former boy friend (the defendant) had arrived at the station. Navin and Hart spoke with the defendant in an upstairs room at the station for approximately thirty minutes; the interview was not recorded. The interview began with the defendant answering the detectives\u2019 questions about the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>physical and mental health, which they asked because they did not yet know what caused the victim\u2019s death. The defendant described his whereabouts on the previous day. He said that he had gone to Nelson\u2019s apartment at 6:30 p.m. on March 21 to pick up his daughter (who was not there), and met with the victim for approximately one-half hour. He said that the victim had invited him inside the apartment, but he remained in the entryway. He said that he then went to the victim\u2019s apartment in search of his daughter, but nobody was home, so he left. He said he then drove to pick up Dubuc, who was waiting for him at a pharmacy in Waltham, and went with her first to a restaurant in Waltham and then to a department store in Waltham. He said he then left Dubuc at a tavern in Waltham at approximately 9 p.m., drove back to the victim\u2019s apartment (and found no one home), drove to a brother\u2019s residence in Waltham to pick up mail, returned to the tavern, and drove home with Dubuc to Taunton.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Other evidence contradicted the time line given by the defendant concerning his whereabouts on March 21. He told the police that he spent time with the victim at Nelson\u2019s apartment at 6:30 p.m., but the victim was at her home with Sautier and her family from approximately 4:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., and had stepped out for only a few minutes to retrieve a pair of pliers from her vehicle. Independent evidence corroborated that the defendant had left Dubuc at a tavern in Waltham at approximately 9 p.m., but, although Dubuc had stepped out of the tavern and returned, she did not finally depart until approximately 11:40 p.m., which is substantially later than the time necessary for the defendant to have left the tavern, gone to the victim\u2019s apartment to find no one home, pick up mail at his brother\u2019s home in Waltham, and return to the tavern to pick up Dubuc. Cellular telephone records revealed that Dubuc repeatedly telephoned the defendant between 9:46 p.m. and 11:40 p.m., but there is no record of his receipt of these calls or the location of his telephone during this time period, which suggests that the defendant\u2019s telephone was turned off or without battery power during this time period. The next call involving the defendant\u2019s telephone occurred at 12:39 a.m. on March 22, at which point the telephone was located in the Taun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>ton area.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The discrepancy in this time line is critical because, according to cellular telephone records, the victim was alive at 10:54 p.m. on March 21, when she made her last telephone call, which was to Nelson.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The defendant was indicted by a grand jury in May, 2009, on a charge of murder in the first degree and a charge of stalking, in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 43 <em>(a). </em>On November 12, 2010, a jury convicted the defendant of stalking but could not reach a verdict on the murder indictment. He was retried on the murder indictment in August, 2011, and convicted. The jury at the second trial did not learn that the defendant had been convicted of stalking the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Jury selection. </em>The defendant claims that the judge denied him his right to a jury selected free from discrimination by allowing the prosecutor to exercise a peremptory challenge of a prospective African-American male juror (juror no. 15).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">During his voir dire on the second of four days of jury selection, juror no. 15 informed the judge that he had been arrested and charged with criminal trespass in Kansas thirteen years earlier and that, as a result of that charge, he \u201cwent to jail for forty-eight hours.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In answer to the judge\u2019s questions, he said that his experience with the legal system would not affect him if he were to serve as a juror in the case and had left him with no feelings about the criminal justice system, police, district attorneys, defense attorneys, or judges. After juror no. 15 left the voir dire, the prosecutor told the judge that \u201che looks very familiar to me and I\u2019m just trying to place him.\u201d The prosecutor did not challenge the juror for cause but did use a peremptory challenge to excuse him. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the prosecutor\u2019s challenge, noting that this prospective juror is \u201cprobably the only African-American or African man\u201d remaining in the venire.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge recognized that the peremptory challenge of one juror may constitute a pattern, but did not find \u201cthat there [was] a pattern at this point in time,\u201d and allowed the exercise of the prosecutor\u2019s challenge without asking the prosecutor to explain why she challenged this prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The defendant argues that a new trial is required because the judge did not require the prosecutor to explain her reason for the peremptory challenge, and made no determination whether her real reason was that juror no. 15 was an African-American male. \u201cThe use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors solely because of bias presumed to derive from their membership in discrete community groups is prohibited both by art. 12 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights], see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 486-488, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979), and the equal protection clause, see <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 84-88 (1986).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>409 Mass. 461, 464 (1991) <em>(Harris). </em>\u201cWe presume that peremptory challenges are properly made, but this presumption can be rebutted by a prima facie showing of either a pattern of challenges of members of the same discrete group, <em>[Commonwealth </em>v.] <em>Soares, supra </em>at 473-474 n.8, or, in certain circumstances, challenge of a single prospective juror within a protected class, <em>[Harris, supra </em>at 465], where \u2018there is a likelihood that [a prospective juror is] being excluded from the jury solely on the basis of . . . group membership.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Prunty, </em>462 Mass. 295, 306 (2012) <em>(Prunty), </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>418 Mass. 769, 770 (1994). The test, therefore, is twofold: first, a pattern, which in some circumstances may be a pattern of one; and second, a likelihood of group exclusion, which in some circumstances can be discerned solely from the strength of the pattern. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>422, 428 (2002) <em>(Garrey), </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtiss, </em>424 Mass. 78, 80 (1997) (Curtiss) (\u201cpresumption may be rebutted on a showing that \u2018[1] there is a pattern of excluding members of a discrete group and [2] it is likely that individuals are being excluded solely on the basis of their membership within this group\u2019 \u201d). See also <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra </em>at 96 (prima facie showing requires that [1] peremptory challenge was exercised against member of protected group and [2] \u201cother relevant circumstances raise an inference\u201d that peremptory challenge was used to exclude potential juror because of membership in that group). Accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhone, </em>168 Wash. 2d 645, 654-655, cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 522 (2010), and cases cited (prima facie showing requires \u201csomething more\u201d than peremptory challenge against member of racially cognizable group). Among the factors that may be considered are the \u201cnumbers and percentage of group members excluded,\u201d and whether the challenged jurors are members of the same constitutionally protected group as the defendant or the victim. <em>Garrey, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>382 Mass. 189, 195 (1981). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhone, supra </em>at 656 (listing eight nonexclusive factors relevant to determine whether prima facie case has been shown); <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>221 Ill. 2d 481, 501 (2006), appeal after remand, 277 Ill. 2d 1 (2007), aff\u2019d, 556 U.S. 148 (2009) (listing seven relevant factors). \u201cThere is no per se rule.\u201d <em>Garrey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">We have often declared that a single peremptory challenge may be sufficient to rebut the presumption, especially where \u201cthe challenged juror is the only member of his or her protected class in the entire venire.\u201d <em>Prunty, supra </em>at 306 n.15. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>457 Mass. 461, 470 (2010), overruled on another ground, <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>463 Mass. 529 (2012), quoting <em>Harris, supra </em>at 466; <em>Garrey, supra. </em>See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>439 Mass. 460, 463 n.4 (2003) <em>(Maldonado) </em>(\u201cIn order to ensure that the important protections set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 491, are fully adhered to, the burden of making this showing ought not be a terribly weighty one\u201d). Therefore, the judge in his discretion may have found a prima facie case here, where the prosecutor used a peremptory challenge to exclude the only African-American male remaining in the venire. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>439 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>47, 58-62 (2003) (art. 12 not only prohibits bias in jury selection based on race <em>or </em>gender, but also based on combination of race <em>and </em>gender; peremptory challenge may not be exercised to exclude juror because juror is African-American male or Caucasian female).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The issue on appeal, however, is not whether the judge was permitted to find that the presumption had been rebutted, but whether he was required to have so found. Recognizing it to be a close question, we conclude, looking at the totality of the circumstances, that the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that the defendant had failed to rebut the presumption. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>463 Mass. 561, 571 (2012) (finding of no pattern of discriminatory challenges within judge\u2019s discretion); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 189, 192, cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 408 (2011) (same). Cf. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>552 U.S. 472, 477 (2008) (where prima facie case has been shown, \u201ctrial court\u2019s ruling on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous\u201d). The defendant satisfied the first part of the test by showing that the prosecutor had challenged the only African-American male remaining in the venire. But in evaluating the second part of the test, the judge was entitled also to consider \u201cother relevant circumstances\u201d available to him in deciding whether the defendant adequately rebutted the presumption that the prosecutor made a proper challenge. See <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra </em>at 96-97 (\u201cIn deciding whether the defendant has made the requisite showing, the trial court should consider all relevant circumstances\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 564, 569-570, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Rakiey, </em>504 U.S. 922 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">The judge noted that a female juror who had been born in Africa had been seated as a juror.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although this did not dispel the possibility that the prosecutor retained a bias against African-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>American males sitting on the jury, it did suggest that she did not hold a bias against African-Americans who were born in Africa. The judge also recognized that both the defendant and the victim were African-American,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> so any inference of bias in jury selection arising from an interracial killing was not warranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roche, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 372, 377-378 &amp; n.3 (1998) (where both defendant and victim were white, judge erred by denying defendant\u2019s peremptory challenge of only black prospective juror because there was no additional evidence of racial motive for challenge). Perhaps most important, the prosecutor had informed the judge that the prospective juror \u201clook[ed] very familiar\u201d and that she was \u201ctrying to place him.\u201d The judge was entitled to infer that the reason the prosecutor told the judge that the prospective juror \u201clookfed] very familiar\u201d was because she recognized that there was a risk that, if the prosecutor had later been able to \u201cplace\u201d the prospective juror after he became a sitting juror, the juror may have needed to be excused from the jury panel. In view of these circumstances, which diminished the likelihood that the reason for the prosecutor\u2019s challenge to the only African-American male in the venire was solely the prospective juror\u2019s race and gender, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that the defendant had fallen short of making a prima facie case of bias.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">2. <em>Sanctions for defense counsel\u2019s discovery violation. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>defendant claims that the judge\u2019s sanctions and jury instructions, crafted in response to defense counsel\u2019s violation of a reciprocal discovery order, denied him his State and Federal constitutional rights to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">At a hearing on July 26, 2011, one week before the commencement of trial, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for reciprocal discovery, which required the defendant, among other obligations, to provide the Commonwealth with all \u201ctangible objects\u201d that the defendant \u201cintends to use as evidence at trial.\u201d The judge orally directed the defendant to turn over the required reciprocal discovery \u201cas soon as possible\u201d to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>any issue about \u201cunfair surprise.\u201d Before trial, defense counsel furnished the prosecutor with reciprocal discovery pursuant to that order, but did not produce any jacket or athletic pants.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In the first sentence of the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, she told the jury that the defendant murdered the victim by using \u201ca drawstring\u201d as a ligature around her neck and strangling her. At trial, the Commonwealth offered in evidence a surveillance videotape made by a department store in Waltham that showed the defendant and Dubuc inside the store during the early evening of March 21, 2009. From the videotape and photographs made from the videotape, the defendant can be seen wearing a dark-colored jacket and athletic pants. The Commonwealth offered in evidence an exemplar of a jacket that was similar to the jacket that the defendant wore at the department store, and called several law enforcement officers to show that police investigators searched various locations where the defendant\u2019s clothing was kept but did not find the jacket or athletic pants that the defendant wore on the evening of March 21. The inference invited by this evidence was that the defendant had caused the jacket and athletic pants he wore that evening to be discarded or concealed, suggesting his consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">On the sixth day of testimony, after eliciting testimony on cross-examination that the defendant had been observed by police wearing the jacket on March 22 and 23, defense counsel reached into his briefcase and pulled out a jacket that appeared identical to the exemplar the Commonwealth had offered in evidence. The prosecutor immediately objected. Defense counsel proffered that he possessed both the jacket and the athletic pants, with a fully intact drawstring, that the defendant wore on the evening of March 21, and intended to offer them in evidence through Dubuc\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor moved to exclude the jacket and pants as a sanction for the defendant\u2019s failure timely to produce the jacket and pants in accordance with the judge\u2019s order of reciprocal discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">At a subsequent hearing, defense counsel admitted that he should not have pulled the jacket out in front of the jury, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>acknowledged that it was not fair to the Commonwealth \u201cfor [him] to do it that way.\u201d He claimed not to be certain that he was going to offer the jacket and pants in evidence until the fifth day of testimony, and denied that he committed any discovery violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">The judge found that the defendant had violated the order of reciprocal discovery, and that \u201cthere clearly was surprise here\u201d regarding \u201cclearly material evidence.\u201d The judge found that defense counsel acted in \u201cbad faith ... in the manner and timing of [the] disclosure,\u201d and that defense counsel\u2019s conduct was \u201cnot only unfair,\u201d but \u201cegregious.\u201d The judge also found that the Commonwealth was prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s conduct in that \u201cit was very clear what the prosecution was aiming to argue about the particular evidence which . . . nobody on the prosecution side knew was in existence,\u201d and that the prosecution took a strategic path \u201cthat potentially might not have been taken had that information been disclosed earlier.\u201d However, the judge also recognized that the jacket and athletic pants purportedly worn by the defendant on March 21 were \u201cimportant evidence . . . that the jury ought to be able to . . . evaluate,\u201d and that exclusion of the evidence \u201cis a sanction of last resort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The judge admittedly \u201cwrestle[d] with\u201d the issue of an appropriate sanction. In an effort to craft an appropriate sanction, the judge heard voir dire testimony from various witnesses, including Dubuc and Elizabeth Lunt, the defendant\u2019s counsel at his first trial, regarding the circumstances of Dubuc\u2019s disclosure of the existence of the jacket and athletic pants to Lunt.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Over the defendant\u2019s objections, the judge ultimately crafted a set of sanctions and jury instructions that allowed the jacket and athletic pants to be admitted in evidence, but also allowed the Commonwealth to challenge Dubuc\u2019s credibility regarding the authenticity of the jacket and pants she furnished. Because Dubuc claimed to have recognized the significance of the jacket and pants at the first trial, the judge informed the jury that there was a prior trial in the case, but that they may consider the prior trial only for a limited purpose: to assess the credibility of Dubuc, through whose testimony the jacket and pants were to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>be admitted, and the credibility of the evidence regarding the jacket and pants. The judge also instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">\u201cYou may not speculate, in any way, about that prior trial or why this case is being tried again. There are many reasons why a case may be re-tried and the reasons for this retrial are irrelevant to your determination of this defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the charge before you in this trial.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Before Dubuc was called as a witness by the defendant, the judge gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">\u201cOrdinarily, a person does not have an obligation to provide . . . potentially exculpatory evidence or potentially inculpatory evidence to the police or to the prosecutor. There are many situations, however, where the natural response of a person in possession [of] exculpatory evidence or information would be to come forward and to provide the authorities with that evidence or that information. If you find that a witness had such potentially exculpatory evidence or information, and if you find that the witness failed to come forward with it, you may consider that failure and any explanation for it, along with all of the other circumstances surrounding it, in evaluating the credibility of that evidence and of the witness providing it.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The judge allowed Dubuc to testify that she told attorney Lunt about the pants before the first trial and about the jacket at the first trial, and discussed them with her, but did not hand them over to her. The judge allowed Lunt to testify that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>learned from Dubuc about the clothing that the defendant wore on the evening of the tilling before and during the first trial, but never asked to see the jacket and pants and never saw them. Lunt also testified that she made the decision not to offer the jacket or pants in evidence at the first trial. The judge did not allow Dubuc and Lunt to testify as to what Lunt said to Dubuc regarding the clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The defendant contends that his counsel\u2019s late disclosure of the jacket and the athletic pants \u201ccaused no prejudice whatsoever,\u201d and that the judge abused his discretion by informing the jury of the prior trial, by instructing them that they may consider the failure to produce exculpatory evidence, and by declining to allow Dubuc to testify as to what Lunt told her after she informed Lunt about the jacket and pants.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The defendant on appeal does not challenge the judge\u2019s finding of a discovery violation. Nor reasonably could he, because there is abundant evidence that, before trial, defense counsel had decided to offer the jacket and athletic pants in evidence but nonetheless failed to comply with the order of reciprocal discovery that obliged him to furnish this clothing in discovery. Defense counsel took advantage of this discovery violation by standing silent as the prosecutor elicited testimony designed to show that this jacket and pants were not found among the clothing searched by the police, inviting the inference that the defendant had caused the clothing he wore when he tilled the victim to be discarded or hidden. The judge was entitled to credit the prosecutor\u2019s representation that, had she known of the existence of this evidence, she would not have highlighted its absence, offered an exemplar of the jacket in evidence, or suggested that the drawstring of the pants was the ligature used to strangle the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>385 Mass. 165, 177 (1982) (\u201ctrial judge\u2019s discretion to find prejudice is much broader than ours\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">When a party fails to comply with a discovery order, Mass. R. Crim. P. 14 (c) (1), as amended, 442 Mass. 1518 (2004), allows a judge to order sanctions he or she deems just under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>circumstances, so long as the sanctions are \u201cremedial in nature\u201d and \u201ctailored appropriately to cure any prejudice resulting from a party\u2019s noncompliance and to ensure a fair trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carney, </em>458 Mass. 418, 419 n.3, 427 (2010). A judge\u2019s sanctions order will be reversed only for abuse of discretion or other error of law. <em>Id. </em>at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The judge here recognized that exclusion of the jacket and pants, the remedy sought by the prosecutor, was the \u201csanction of last resort,\u201d and properly rejected it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although the judge decided not to exclude the clothing, he recognized that the prosecutor was entitled to challenge the authenticity of the clothing by questioning the credibility of Dubuc\u2019s testimony that the jacket and pants she produced were the jacket and pants the defendant wore on the night in question. Because Dubuc claimed that she first realized the significance of the jacket and pants at or just prior to the first trial, and then notified the defendant\u2019s first counsel of their existence, the judge reasonably concluded that the jury would need to learn that there was a first trial in order adequately to evaluate Dubuc\u2019s credibility and, consequently, the clothing\u2019s authenticity. The judge adequately addressed the risk of prejudice with the limiting instruction he gave regarding the first trial. He did not abuse his discretion by allowing the jury to learn of the first trial for this limited purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Nor did the judge abuse his discretion in instructing the jury that they could consider the failure of the defendant\u2019s wife and brother to disclose the exculpatory evidence to the authorities, if the \u201cnatural response\u201d would be to make such a disclosure, in evaluating their credibility and the authenticity of the jacket and pants. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>455 Mass. 230, 238 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 288, 296-297 (1981), we held that such an instruction is appropriate where the necessary foundation has been established: \u201c(1) that the witness knew of the pending charges in sufficient detail to realize that he possessed exculpatory information, (2) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>witness had reason to make the information available, [and] (3) that he was familiar with the means of reporting it to the proper authorities.\u201d The judge did not err in concluding that an adequate foundation had been established to justify this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Nor did the judge abuse his discretion in limiting the testimony regarding what Lunt said to Dubuc after Dubuc told Lunt that she had the jacket and pants. We know from their voir dire testimony what such questioning would have elicited: Dubuc would have testified that Lunt told her she did not want them because the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was circumstantial and she did not intend to offer evidence as part of a defense case, and Lunt would have testified that she told Dubuc to confer with her own attorney.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The jury learned from Lunt that she did not intend to put the jacket and pants in evidence, and the judge reasonably could have concluded that learning that Lunt told Dubuc to confer with her own attorney would not have added much to assist the jury in evaluating the credibility of Dubuc and the authenticity of the clothing, and potentially would have invited the jury to speculate why Lunt thought it wise for Dubuc to confer with her own counsel concerning evidence Dubuc was willing to provide her.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Finally, the defendant contends that the judge erred in allowing the prosecutor to elicit evidence that a State police chemist \u201cprocessed\u201d a Toyota Corolla automobile and did not see any dark-colored jacket, pants, or string, where the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the search of this automobile had been previously allowed. The judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing this testimony. Before trial, the prosecutor agreed to the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to preclude any testimony about the search of this vehicle, provided the defendant did not open the door to the admission of such testimony. The defendant, however, did open the door. The prosecutor had elicited evidence attempting to show that the police had searched all the locations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>where the defendant\u2019s jacket and pants may have been stored in order to support her argument that the defendant had discarded the jacket and pants. During cross-examination, however, defense counsel elicited that the police saw the defendant approach a Toyota vehicle and retrieve three plastic bags \u201ctied at the top\u201d from the trunk of the vehicle. By eliciting this testimony, defense counsel invited the inference that the search for the defendant\u2019s clothing was less than comprehensive because the police had not testified to any search of a Toyota vehicle, where clothes may have been stored in large plastic bags. The limited inquiry that the judge permitted, which allowed testimony only to what was <em>not </em>found in the vehicle rather than what was found, was an appropriate remedy to the problem that defense counsel had created by his questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">In conclusion, in the face of what the judge appropriately characterized as an \u201cegregious\u201d discovery violation by the defendant, the judge carefully and thoughtfully crafted a balanced remedy that allowed the defendant to offer the evidence he had failed timely to disclose in accordance with the reciprocal discovery order and preserved the Commonwealth\u2019s ability effectively to challenge the credibility of Dubuc and the authenticity of the clothing. The judge did not abuse his discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">3. DiGiambattista <em>instruction. </em>In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 447-448 (2004) (DiGiambattista), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">\u201c[Wjhen the prosecution introduces evidence of a defendant\u2019s confession or statement that is the product of a custodial interrogation or an interrogation conducted at a place of detention (e.g., a police station), and there is not at least an audiotape recording of the complete interrogation, the defendant is entitled (on request) to a jury instruction advising that the State\u2019s highest court has expressed a preference that such interrogations be recorded whenever practicable, and cautioning the jury that, because of the absence of any recording of the interrogation in the case before them, they should weigh evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged statement with great caution and care. Where voluntariness is a live issue and the humane practice in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>struction is given, the jury should also be advised that the absence of a recording permits (but does not compel) them to conclude that the Commonwealth has failed to prove voluntariness beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">The defendant claims that, because he was interviewed at a police station and the interview was not recorded, the judge erred in denying his request for this instruction regarding statements the defendant made during that interview. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">In <em>DiGiambattista, </em>the defendant voluntarily accompanied a State trooper and a police officer to a fire station to be questioned about a fire that occurred one month earlier, and was told early in the interview that he was their \u201cprime suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 425-427. In contrast, here, the defendant voluntarily and without advance notice showed up at the station to speak to the police about the victim\u2019s death within two hours of the discovery of her body. The police had not asked the defendant to come in or be interviewed, did not know who the defendant was until he told them, had yet to ascertain that the cause of death was a homicide, and did not identify the defendant as a suspect until after the completion of the interview. In view of these circumstances, we conclude that the judge did not err in refusing to give a <em>DiGiambattista </em>instruction.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>Nothing in the <em>DiGiambattista </em>opinion suggests that we anticipated its guidance to apply to an interview that took place before the police had determined that a crime had occurred and before the police had identified a suspect. Nor in <em>DiGiambattista </em>did we consider the practical consequences of a rule that encouraged officers to record all interviews conducted at a police station, including interviews of family members or close friends of a person found dead who are not suspected of causing her death.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> For these reasons, we conclude that the defendant in these circumstances was not entitled to a <em>DiGiambattista </em>instruction regarding the statements made during his interview, and the judge did not err in so finding.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">4. <em>Prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. </em>The defendant contends that the prosecutor denied him a fair trial by misstating evidence and the law, and suggesting unwarranted inferences during her closing argument. We evaluate these claims in light of the prosecutor\u2019s \u201centire argument,\u201d \u201cthe judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, and the evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>463 Mass. 402, 415 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Raposa, </em>440 Mass. 684, 694 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The defendant preserved three claims of improper argument that he raises on appeal: that the prosecutor gave an inaccurate definition of reasonable doubt, that she improperly speculated that the defendant may have gone to the police on March 22 to establish an \u201calibi,\u201d and that she improperly suggested that Dubuc hid the clothes until testing or verification could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>done. Where objections were made at trial, we review for prejudicial error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>463 Mass. 95, 112 (2012). We find none here.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">As to the first claim, the judge\u2019s detailed instructions on reasonable doubt cured any confusion resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s abbreviated description of the standard. As to the second, the prosecutor was permitted to suggest that the defendant\u2019s motive for going to the police station to describe his whereabouts on March 21 was to persuade the police that he was not at the victim\u2019s sister\u2019s apartment at the time of the killing because such a suggestion was based on a reasonable inference drawn from the evidence presented at trial. As to the third, the prosecutor erred in asking the jury the rhetorical question, \u201cIf they are the pants, why hide them for so long, too long for any tests or verifications to be done?\u201d without having elicited evidence that tests or verifications were no longer feasible, but the error was too inconsequential to be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">Additionally, the defendant challenges on appeal multiple statements made by the prosecutor during closing argument that were not preserved by objection. We review these claims of impropriety to determine whether they created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kater, </em>432 Mass. 404, 423 (2000), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>429 Mass. 745, 748 (1999). After reviewing the entire record, we conclude that these challenged statements represented an accurate summary of the evidence presented, were based on reasonable inferences of the evidence, or were cured by the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Siny Van Tran, </em>460 Mass. 535, 556 (2011). They did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">5. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>Although the defendant does not advance an argument pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, we have examined the record and discern no basis to exercise our authority to set aside or reduce the verdict of murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b24-12\">The jury did not convict the defendant of murder in the first degree on a theory of extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b25-9\">The defendant once had broken the victim\u2019s cellular telephone in two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b26-7\">There were no signs of forced entry into the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\">In other words, the defendant\u2019s profile resulting from Y-chromosome short tandem repeat (Y-STR) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing is identical to the profile of his brothers, their father, and their forefathers. One of the defendant\u2019s brothers, Issoufou Yacouba-Issa, resided in Massachusetts at the time of the killing and had visited the apartment where the victim\u2019s body was found in March of 2009, but denied any connection to the tested string.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b27-13\">DNA testing was also conducted of a swab taken from the fingernails of the victim, which revealed a DNA mixture from at least two individuals. One of the DNA profiles matched the defendant\u2019s paternal lineage. The probability of inclusion was one in fourteen for the African-American population.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\">Susan Dubuc testified that the defendant, using a charger, telephoned her when they returned home to enable her to locate her cellular telephone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b29-9\">The medical examiner was unable to ascertain from the condition of the body the time of death beyond concluding that it occurred more than twenty-four hours before the autopsy, which was conducted at 1 p.m. on March 23. The defendant argued that the victim died after 4:30 a.m. on March 22, because rigor mortis was observed when her body was discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b29-10\">In the juror questionnaire, the prospective juror (juror no. 15) checked the boxes for \u201cbeen arrested,\u201d \u201cbeen charged with a crime,\u201d and \u201cbeen served with a court order,\" but not the box for \u201cbeen convicted of a crime.\u201d We infer that the time in jail was not served pursuant to a conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Juror no. 15 had been bom in Uganda. The defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that another prospective African-American male juror had been excused earlier. Although the record does not identify any prospective juror by race other than the one at issue, the record reflects that another prospective male juror, with a presumably African surname, had earlier been excused for cause by the judge because he had scheduled a vacation to visit his sister, who had come from Ethiopia for medical care, that he would have had to cancel if he sat as a juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The record reflects that, on the first day of jury selection, a woman who indicated that she was born in Kenya was seated as a juror. Although we recognize that one can be Caucasian and still be born in Kenya, we think it likely from her African surname that she is a black African-American. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carelton, </em>418 Mass. 773, 774-775 (1994) (finding discrimination on basis of ethnicity when considering prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenges of jurors with \u201cIrish-sounding surnames\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\">The victim was an African-American female who was bom in Haiti. The defendant is an African-American male who was bom in Niger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b33-7\">We do not consider in our analysis the prospective juror\u2019s arrest thirteen years earlier in Kansas for criminal trespass, which resulted in his spending forty-eight hours in jail. Where there is nothing in the record to suggest that this experience would have affected the prospective juror in his evaluation of the case, we would not find it reasonable for a prosecutor to rely on this arrest as a basis for challenging a prospective juror, especially where, as here, the prosecutor did not challenge other jurors with similar criminal experiences. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>439 Mass. 460, 467 (2003) (Maldonado) (genuineness of explanation \u201csignificantly impaired by the absence of consistency in its application to other jurors\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Futch, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 174, 177 (1995) (\u201cFor die purposes of peremptory challenges, the term \u2018neutral\u2019 is defined as a reason which is not present in those nonminority panel members not struck\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Although we find no abuse of discretion, we note that the judge created a significant and needless risk of reversal by failing to require the prosecutor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>explain her reasons for challenging juror no. 15. Where a venire contains few African-Americans, a judge \u201chas broad discretion\u201d to require a prosecutor to explain a challenge of a prospective African-American juror \u201cwithout having to make the determination that a pattern of improper exclusion exists.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>463 Mass. 561, 571 (2012), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Van Winkle, </em>443 Mass. 230, 236 (2005). If the judge had required an explanation, the prosecutor would have needed to show that the explanation for the challenge was \u201cbona fide\u201d group-neutral. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 463-464. The defendant should then have been given an opportunity to reply before the judge made his findings as to discriminatory intent. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calderon, </em>431 Mass. 21, 26 (2000). In finding whether an explanation is \u201cbona fide,\u201d a judge must determine both whether it is \u201cadequate,\u201d that is, clear, reasonably specific, and personal to the juror rather than based on the juror\u2019s group affiliation, and \u201cgenuine,\u201d that is, the true reason for the challenge. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 464-465, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, </em>418 Mass. 769, 771 (1994). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garrey, </em>436 Mass. 422, 428 (2002), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burnett, supra. </em>The judge\u2019s findings should separately address both the adequacy and genuineness of the explanation. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 466. Where, as here, a judge fails to find a prima facie case or otherwise require the prosecutor to provide an explanation, the record on appeal includes no explanation of the prosecutor\u2019s reasons for the challenge, the defendant is not given an opportunity to reply to the explanation, and the judge does not make the required findings as to the adequacy and genuineness of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. Therefore, where a judge abuses his or her discretion by failing to find a prima facie case, the error is unlikely to be harmless. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Long, </em>419 Mass. 798, 807 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Futch, supra </em>at 177-178. Consequently, when a defendant claims that a prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge of a prospective juror is motivated by discriminatory intent, we urge judges to think long and hard before they decide to require no explanation from the prosecutor for the challenge and make no findings of fact. Cf. <em>Maldonado, supra </em>at 463 n.4, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 486-488, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979) (noting that some State courts require inquiry into prosecutor\u2019s explanation for challenge \u201cwhenever a Soares-type objection is made to the use of a peremptory challenge\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b35-8\">From this evidence, the jury could have inferred that the defendant feared that the clothing might contain forensic evidence or, with respect to the pants, reveal a missing drawstring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Attorney Elizabeth Lunt did not represent the defendant in the second trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\">After the judge informed counsel of his intent to provide this instruction, the defendant sought interlocutory relief from a single justice of this court pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The single justice denied the petition, noting that \u201c[t]he judge\u2019s order appears to be balanced in scope and includes limiting instructions to the jury to safeguard the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b37-10\">The judge gave the jury this instruction both when they first learned of the prior trial and in his final instructions to the jury. The judge did not tell the jury the outcome of the earlier trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b37-11\">The judge told the jury that the instruction \u201crelates to\u201d the testimony of Dubuc and of Issoufou Yacouba-Issa, the defendant\u2019s brother, who testified that Dubuc showed him the defendant\u2019s jacket and athletic pants toward the end of 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b38-8\">The defendant does not challenge the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury that the jacket and pants were not provided to the prosecutor until the sixth day of testimony at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The judge also denied the prosecutor\u2019s request to offer evidence that the defendant had previously attempted to strangle the victim with a different string. The prosecutor argued that this prior bad act, which the judge had earlier ruled inadmissible, should have become admissible after the defendant\u2019s discovery violation, because it would allow her to argue that the defendant\u2019s use of a ligature was not confined to the drawstring on his pants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Dubuc was represented by separate counsel at the first and second trials. At the first trial, she invoked her marital privilege and her right against self-incrimination, and did not testify. She waived those rights and testified at the second trial. The judge refused to allow the prosecutor to inquire into Dubuc\u2019s assertion of her marital privilege and right against self-incrimination at the first trial, but did allow the prosecutor to elicit that Dubuc \u201csat through\u201d the first trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The judge understood that the determination whether the defendant was entitled to the instruction required in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 447-448 (2004), rested on whether the police interview constituted an \u201cinterrogation.\u201d Based on the totality of the circumstances, he concluded that it did not. We understand this finding to be the practical equivalent of a finding that the defendant was not a suspect at the time of the interview, and conclude that the finding was amply supported by the evidence at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b42-8\">We note that the judge in his final instructions gave a humane practice instruction telling the jury that, in assessing whether the defendant\u2019s statements to the Waltham police were made voluntarily, they may consider all the circumstances surrounding the making of the statements, including \u201cthe policies, practices, or procedures of the police department or agency with regard to such statements.\u201d The defendant elicited at trial that Dubuc was told during her interview with Waltham police Officer Patrick Hart on March 23, 2009, that the policy of the department is to record all interviews, but Officer Hart testified that he recorded her interview only because, by the time she was questioned, the investigation had proceeded to the point where her husband had been identified as a suspect. Therefore, the jury were allowed to consider the police department\u2019s policy regarding the recording of statements in evaluating the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">When asked at trial why he did not record the interview with the defendant, Detective Lieutenant Brian Navin replied that it would have shown a lack of courtesy, compassion, and judgment to ask to record an interview of \u201csomebody . . . who [had] just been informed of the death of a loved one.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The defendant also claims that the judge erred by declining to instruct the jury that the failure of police to conduct certain tests and follow certain procedures could raise a reasonable doubt as to the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980). We have \u201coften stated\u201d that, so long as the judge does not \u201cremove issues of inadequacy of a police investigation or lack of evidence from the jury\u2019s consideration ... \u2018a judge is not required to instruct on the claimed inadequacy of a police investigation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>460 Mass. 683, 692 (2011), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>439 Mass. 678, 687 (2003).
