Walsh had been a professional electrician for many years when, in 1980, he was certified by the Department of Education to teach in his occupational field. In October, 1987, he began full-time employment at a vocational school and became a member of MTRS. In December, 2005, before the effective date of his retirement the following June, Walsh applied to MTRS to increase his anticipated retirement allowance by adding to his \u201ccreditable service\u201d (his years of service as a member of MTRS) through the \u201cbuyback\u201d of three years of creditable service, based on his work experience as an electrician. Walsh sought credit for service performed from February 1, 1977, through January 31, 1980. This buyback required Walsh to pay certain \u201cmakeup payments\u201d into the annuity savings fund of MTRS, in accordance with a formula set forth in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2) (trade service credit statute). That statutory formula calls for \u201cbuyback interest\u201d to be paid on such makeup payments. Pursuant to 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05 (2005),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a regulation promulgated by MTRS, MTRS assessed buyback interest to commence as of February 1, 1977, the beginning of the three-year period for which Walsh sought trade service credit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Walsh appealed the action of MTRS to CRAB. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16 (4). He claimed that buyback interest should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>have begun to accrue until October, 1987, when he became a member of the MTRS. After a hearing before the division of administrative law appeals (DALA), an administrative magistrate affirmed the action of MTRS. Walsh appealed that decision to CRAB, which reversed DALA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">MTRS sought review of CRAB\u2019s decision in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14. Deferring to CRAB\u2019s interpretation of the trade service credit statute, a Superior Court judge allowed CRAB\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings. MTRS appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2), is silent on the issue of when buyback interest accmes, and that 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05 is a reasonable interpretation of statutory silence. The regulation promulgated by MTRS is therefore a valid exercise of MTRS\u2019s statutory authority, and CRAB\u2019s failure to assess interest in accordance with 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05 was an error of law. Thus, CRAB\u2019s decision must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\"><em>Statutory and regulatory framework. </em>Pursuant to G. L. c. 32, a public employee in the Commonwealth earns a retirement allowance as a member of a public retirement system, such as MTRS. See <em>Rosing </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Sys., </em>458 Mass. 283, 285 (2010). A member\u2019s retirement allowance is based, in part, on the number of years and full months of \u201ccreditable service\u201d earned by the member at the time of retirement. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 5 (2) <em>(a). </em>See <em>Pelonzi </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Beverly, </em>451 Mass. 475, 477 &amp; n.3 (2008). Creditable service ordinarily is based on the duration of a member\u2019s employment in public service in the Commonwealth while a member of a public retirement system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (a). During that time, the member contributes a certain percentage of her salary to the retirement system by means of a payroll deduction. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (1) (b). See <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>421 Mass. 557, 558 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1221 (1996), citing G.L. c. 32, \u00a7 22. In certain situations, a member of a retirement system may purchase additional creditable service, or credit, for work or other service performed before becoming a member of a retirement system. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>See <em>Rotondi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>463 Mass. 644, 646 n.4 (2012). The purchase of credit can substantially increase the member\u2019s annual retirement allowance.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">In September, 2005, the Legislature passed an enactment permitting vocational education teachers to purchase up to three years of credit for certain prior work experience in the trade in which the member became a teacher. See St. 2005, c. 90, codified at G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) <em>(h1/2) </em>(\u201cAn Act relative to creditable service for vocational education teachers\u201d). Under that provision, a member in service of the MTRS for at least ten years may purchase up to three years of \u201ccreditable service for any period or periods of prior work experience in the occupational field in which the member became a vocational-technical teacher and which was required as a condition of the member\u2019s employment and licensure under regulations of the department of education.\u201d G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2). To receive the additional trade service credit, the member must pay into the retirement system\u2019s annuity savings fund certain \u201cmakeup payments,\u201d defined as an amount which is equal to ten per cent of the member\u2019s regular annual compensation as of the member\u2019s most recent date of entry into MTRS membership, plus \u201cbuyback interest\u201d on that amount.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Soon after the enactment of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) <em>(h1/2), </em>at a meeting in November, 2005, the MTRS board (board), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>governing body of MTRS, see G. L. c. 15, \u00a7 16, discussed what it perceived to be an ambiguity in the trade service credit statute as to the date from which buyback interest should be charged. The board specifically considered whether buyback interest should begin to accrue on the period of trade service being purchased, or, instead, on the date the member joined the MTRS; as reflected in the minutes of that meeting, \u201cthe Board voted to adopt on an emergency basis the version with interest going back to the date of service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">After soliciting comments on the proposed regulation, holding a public hearing, and reviewing material prepared by its staff, the board voted to adopt a regulation, codified at 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05, providing that interest \u201cbe charged back to the years of service being purchased.\u201d Thereafter, the board submitted the regulation for approval to the public employee retirement administration commission (PERAC), as required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 20 (5) (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> PERAC approved the regulation in February, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>CRAB claims that the language of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) <em>(1/2), </em>provides unambiguously that the date on which buyback interest begins to accrue is the date the member joined the retirement system, which in Walsh\u2019s case was October, 1987. CRAB argues that, even if the statute is ambiguous or silent on the issue, its own interpretation, and not the regulation promulgated by MTRS, is entitled to deference. CRAB further contends that, even assuming MTRS\u2019s interpretation as set forth in its regulation is entitled to deference, the regulation is not a reasonable interpretation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2), and is therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">As a preliminary matter, we address GRAB\u2019S claim that, notwithstanding the promulgation of 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05, we should defer to CRAB\u2019s contrary interpretation of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) <em>(h1/2). </em>CRAB does not dispute MTRS\u2019s authority to promulgate certain regulations concerning the calculation of \u201cmakeup payments\u201d under the trade service credit statute. Where a regulation has been duly promulgated, we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>not give deference to a different administrative agency\u2019s contrary conclusion. See 1 R.J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise \u00a7 3.5, at 197-198 (5th ed. 2010) (where rulemaking and adjudicatory authority are vested in separate Federal agencies, deference under <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense </em>Council, 467 U.S. 837 [1984] <em>[Chevron], </em>is not extended to agency with only adjudicatory responsibilities). \u201c[A] properly promulgated regulation has the force of law . . . and must be accorded all the deference due to a statute\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Borden, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health, </em>388 Mass. 707, 723, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Formaldehyde Inst., Inc. </em>v. <em>Frechette, </em>464 U.S. 936 (1983). See <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>456 Mass. 801, 809 (2010), quoting <em>Massachusetts Fed\u2019n of Teachers </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>436 Mass. 763, 771 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Because it is undisputed that MTRS has the authority to promulgate regulations interpreting G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) <em>(h1/2), </em>subject to PERAC approval, and there is no claim that the regulation was not properly promulgated, our focus is on whether 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05 reflects a reasonable interpretation of the statute. See <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>454 Mass. 174, 186-187 (2009); <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-634 (2005) <em>(Goldberg). </em>If the regulation provides a reasonable resolution, an adjudicating agency such as CRAB has an obligation to follow it. Cf. <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 441 </em>Mass. 78, 82 (2004), citing <em>Flemings </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>431 Mass. 374, 375 (2000) (\u201cWhere an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reasonable, the court should not supplant it with its own judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We employ a two-part test to assess the validity of an administrative agency\u2019s properly promulgated regulation. <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 632. \u201cFirst, we determine, using conventional tools of statutory interpretation, whether the Legislature has spoken with certainty on the topic in question, and if we conclude that the statute is unambiguous, we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 632-633. \u201cSecond, if the Legislature has not addressed directly the pertinent issue, we determine whether the agency\u2019s resolution of that issue may \u2018be reconciled with the governing legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, quoting <em>Nuclear Metals, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1992). See <em>Chevron, supra </em>at 842-843 (describing two-part test used to ascertain validity of Federal agency regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Thus, we consider first \u201cwhether the Legislature has spoken with certainty on\u201d the accrual of buyback interest in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2). <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 632-633. Our focus at this stage is on the text of the statute because its plain meaning will serve as our primary interpretive guide. See, e.g., <em>Reading Coop. Bank </em>v. <em>Suffolk Constr. Co., </em>464 Mass. 543, 547 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The cost to a vocational education teacher of the purchase of credit for prior work experience is defined by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2), as \u201cmakeup payments of an amount equal to [ten] per cent of the regular annual compensation of the member as of the member\u2019s most recent date of entry into membership in the teachers\u2019 retirement system . . . , for each year of service purchased plus buyback interest thereon.\u201d CRAB discerns in this language a clear legislative mandate that the date buyback interest begins to accrue is the member\u2019s most recent date of entry into membership in the teachers\u2019 retirement system, by undertaking a two-step interpretation of the statute. First, CRAB notes (and we agree) that the word \u201cthereon\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2), means that the buyback interest is charged on \u201cmakeup payments.\u201d Building on this observation, CRAB contends that, because the amount of a makeup payment is calculated with reference to \u201cthe member\u2019s most recent date of entry into membership in the teachers\u2019 retirement system,\u201d the Legislature must have intended also that interest begin to accrue on that same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">MTRS responds that the word \u201cmakeup\u201d implies that buyback interest is designed to compensate MTRS for the return on investment that it could have earned had the member actually contributed to the retirement system during the years of creditable service being purchased. MTRS contends that, consistent with this view, interest should begin to accrue during the period of trade service credit being purchased. We discern no clarity of intent in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) <em>(h1/2), </em>on the question of buyback interest accrual, particularly when the trade service credit provision is read in connection with related statutes. Cf. <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting 2A N.J. Singer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.05, at 154 (6th ed. rev. 2000) (\u201cstatute must be viewed \u2018as a whole\u2019; it is \u2018not proper to confine interpretation to the one section to be construed\u2019 \u201d). For instance, the provision governing the purchase of credit for volunteer service in the Peace Corps provides that buyback interest must be paid \u201cfor the period of volunteer service\u201d purchased, even though, like the trade service credit statute, it uses the member\u2019s salary on the date the member joined the MTRS to calculate the makeup payments to which interest applies. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (r).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This provision suggests that the date of interest accrual is not necessarily tied to the date used to calculate the amount of the member\u2019s makeup payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Nor does it follow inescapably from the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cmakeup\u201d that interest must accrue over the period of the trade service being purchased, as MTRS suggests, rather than at the later date suggested by CRAB. Another service credit provision, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) <em>(h), </em>authorizing veterans of the armed services to purchase creditable service, employs the concept of \u201cmakeup payments\u201d without requiring any interest payment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>We accept as reasonable MTRS\u2019s view that the makeup payment is designed to compensate MTRS for the return on investment that it could have earned had the member actually contributed to the retirement system during the years of creditable service being purchased. However, in light of the provisions for purchasing creditable service for veterans, we cannot say that the Legislature has, through its employment of the term \u201cmakeup payment\u201d in the trade service credit statute, spoken with certainty regarding the date interest begins to accrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Based on the language of the majority of creditable service purchase provisions set forth in G. L. c. 32, the Legislature simply chose to be silent on the issue, thereby leaving a policy gap to be filled by agency action. When the Legislature has intended to assess interest on makeup payments that will most closely approximate the value of a member\u2019s contributions had the contributions been made at the time of the service being purchased, it has said so explicitly. See, e.g., G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 3 (4), 3 (4A), 4 (1) (g1/2), 4 (1) <em>(p), 4 </em>(1) (r).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In light of the statutory and regulatory context in which the question arises, \u201cthe contrast between [the Legislature\u2019s] mandate in one context with its silence in another suggests not a prohibition but simply a decision <em>not to mandate </em>any solution in the second context, i.e., to leave the question to agency discretion\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Cheney R.R. Co. </em>v. <em>Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>902 F.2d 66, 69 (D.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 985 (1990). See <em>Chevron, supra </em>at 843, quoting <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974) (administrative agency\u2019s power to administer congressionally created program \u201cnecessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left, implicitly or explicitly, by Congress\u201d). See also <em>Exelon Generation Co. </em>v. <em>Local 15, Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, AFL-CIO, </em>676 F.3d 566, 571 (7th Cir. 2012). We therefore view the Legislature\u2019s silence here as an invitation to MTRS to fill the gap with appropriate regulation. In any event, whether the language of the trade service credit statute is ambiguous or silent, the result would be the same. See <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 634 (\u201cStatutory silence, like statutory ambiguity, often requires that an agency give clarity to an issue necessarily implicated by the statute but either not addressed by the Legislature or delegated to the superior expertise of agency administrators\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>\u201cpay into the annuity savings fund of the system in one sum, or in instalments, upon such terms and conditions as the board may prescribe, an amount equal to that which would have been withheld as regular deductions from his regular compensation for such previous period, or most recent portion thereof, as he may elect, had such s\u00e9rvice been rendered in a public school of the commonwealth and had he been a member of the teachers\u2019 retirement system during the period the service was rendered . ... <em>In addition to the payment of such sum or instalments thereof, such member shall also pay into the annuity savings fund an amount of interest such that at the completion of such payments the value of his accumulated payments, together with buyback interest thereon, actually made on account of such previous out-of-state service, shall equal the value of his accumulated buyback deductions which would have resulted if regular deductions had been made when regular compensation for such service was actually received\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Because the trade service credit statute \u201cneither explicitly forbids nor expressly allows the regulation in question,\u201d <em>Goldberg, supra </em>at 635, we proceed to consider whether the regulation promulgated by MTRS and approved by PER AC, the agency responsible for overseeing all retirement systems, is a \u201creasonable resolution of the statute\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our review is deferential, and it is therefore \u201cunimportant whether we would have come to the same interpretation of the statute as the agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633. \u201cOnly an \u2018agency regulation that is contrary to the plain language of the statute and its underlying purpose may be rejected by the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Duarte </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>451 Mass. 399, 408 (2008), quoting <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000). Deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of statutory silence, or ambiguity, is particularly appropriate where, as here, the regulation in question was promulgated immediately after the enactment of the governing legislation. See <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>454 Mass. 174, 187 (2009), quoting <em>Connery </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>414 Mass. 1009, 1010 (1993) (interpretation made close to time Legislature enacted statute is entitled to \u201cheightened\u201d deference because it \u201cmay represent \u2018understanding of the public regarding the enactment\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Applying this deferential standard of review, we conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>that 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05 is a reasonable resolution of the Legislature\u2019s silence or ambiguity on the issue of interest accrual in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 4 (1) (h1/2). The regulation reflects a determination that buyback interest should approximate as closely as possible the return on investment that MTRS could have earned had the member actually contributed to the retirement system during the years of creditable service being purchased.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>342 Mass. 58, 60 (1961) (retirement board has obligation to protect financial integrity of retirement system). This policy determination by MTRS is consistent with other statutes concerning creditable service purchases for teachers, which charge buyback interest as of the date of service purchased. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 3 (4), 3 (4A), 4 (1) (g1/2), 4 (1) <em>(p), </em>4(1) (r).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In addition, the record indicates that 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05 was the product of \u201cthoughtful, reasoned deliberation,\u201d and not \u201crash, uninformed rule making.\u201d See <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., supra </em>at 189. On this basis, as well, we conclude that the regulation is reasonable. Before promulgating 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05, the board considered the costs of charging interest back to the date of service purchased with charging interest back to the most recent date of entry into MTRS membership. The board also examined the cost of creditable service under the proposed regulation compared to similar creditable service purchases in the Commonwealth and in other States.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>Because 807 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 14.05 is a valid regulation, CRAB\u2019s failure to apply the regulation was an error of law. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court where the judgment affirming CRAB\u2019s decision shall be vacated and set aside, and judgment shall enter for MTRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b315-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Boston Retirement Board in support of the Massachusetts Teachers\u2019 Retirement System.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The regulation provides: \u201c \u2018Buyback interest\u2019 will be charged back to the years of service being purchased.\u201d 807 Code Mass.
