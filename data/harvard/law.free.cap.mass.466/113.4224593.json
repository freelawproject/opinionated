Lezynski, was tried before a jury in the Superior Court on indictments charging him with manslaughter and possession with intent to distribute a class B controlled substance (fentanyl)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in connection with the death of Richard Beaulier; the jury found the defendant guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>only of the drug charge. At trial, evidence concerning the results of laboratory testing and toxicological analysis of Beaulier\u2019s blood, showing the presence of a high level of fentanyl, was admitted during the direct examination of a toxicologist testifying as an expert witness for the Commonwealth, although the witness himself had not conducted any of the testing. The defendant appealed his conviction to the Appeals Court. In a decision pursuant to its rule 1:28, that court reasoned that the admission of the quantitative results of toxicology testing conducted by a nontestifying analyst constituted constitutional error that should be analyzed to determine whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, despite the defendant\u2019s failure to preserve the issue at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lezynski, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 1112 (2012). Concluding that the error was indeed harmless, the Appeals Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. We affirm the conviction, but our analysis of the toxicology evidence differs from that of the Appeals Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Background. </em>The jury could have found as follows from the evidence presented at trial. In December, 2004, the defendant was employed as a truck driver for Hiltz Waste Disposal (Hiltz), a company located in Gloucester that performed waste disposal and recycling services. Beaulier also was employed by Hiltz as both a truck driver and a \u201clumper,\u201d a laborer responsible for picking up curbside waste and recycling and loading it onto the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">On December 17, 2004, the defendant and Beaulier, along with other employees, attended the Hiltz annual Christmas party held at the company\u2019s maintenance facility. The party began sometime after 5 p.m. About a week before the party, the defendant reported to his coworker Lee Hopkinson that he had discovered several \u201cmorphine patches\u201d* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in a dumpster along his route and offered to sell one of these to Hopkinson. On the day of the party, the defendant offered to sell or give what he called \u201cfentanyl patches\u201d to coworker Michael Gauthier, and at the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>to coworkers Bart Groves and Brian Macdonald. Groves and Gauthier declined the offer, but the defendant gave Macdonald a patch. The defendant also offered to sell a fentanyl patch to Beaulier for fifty dollars, but eventually gave the patch to Beaulier after explaining that Beaulier could \u201cjust pay [the defendant] later.\u201d At some point during the party, Beaulier tore open the plastic wrapping of the fentanyl package and ingested its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">By the party\u2019s end, Beaulier \u2014 who had smoked marijuana before the party and who also had been drinking beer both before and throughout the party \u2014 was extremely intoxicated. The defendant drove Beaulier and Beaulier\u2019s girl friend, Gina Genest, to Beaulier\u2019s home. When they arrived, Beaulier was lying in the back seat of the car, unresponsive and perceived by Genest to be \u201cpassed out.\u201d The defendant and Genest left him there and went into Beaulier\u2019s house for some time, where the defendant produced a fentanyl patch and asked Genest if she wanted to \u201cdo one.\u201d Genest returned to the car and, noting that Beaulier remained unresponsive in the back seat, telephoned 911 for emergency assistance. Beaulier was transported to the hospital and died shortly thereafter. The cause of death was acute fentanyl and alcohol intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, Dr. George Behonick, the director of forensic toxicology for the department of hospital laboratories at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health Care System (UMass Memorial), appeared as an expert witness for the Commonwealth. In his direct examination, he testified that a \u201cfront line\u201d analyst at the UMass Memorial laboratory performed an immunoassay analysis as well as a \u201cwhole blood comprehensive drug screen\u201d; the drug screen had yielded a \u201cmatch\u201d for fentanyl; and the sample was then referred to National Medical Services (NMS) laboratory, a private laboratory in Pennsylvania, for quantitative analysis. Dr. Behonick further testified to the results of the toxicology report prepared by the Pennsylvania laboratory \u2014 6.5 and 5 nanograms per milliliter of fentanyl and the metabolite norfentanyl respectively \u2014 and opined that these results were consistent with a \u201clethal\u201d outcome. The defendant did not object to Dr. Behonick\u2019s recitation of the results of the laboratory analyses performed by the analysts at the UMass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>Memorial and NMS laboratories. Nor did he object to the admission of the autopsy report, to which the toxicology report from UMass Memorial referencing these results was attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The jury found the defendant not guilty of manslaughter but guilty of the drug charge. The Appeals Court concluded that Dr. Behonick\u2019s verbatim reading of the toxicology report from the NMS laboratory into the record \u201cwas error akin to that identified in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. Massachusetts,\" 557 U.S. 305 (2009) (Melendez-Diaz), and violated the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Appeals Court concluded that, although the defendant did not object to the admission of the evidence at trial, where the defendant\u2019s trial took place after the decision of this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Verde, </em>444 Mass. 279 (2005) <em>(Verde), </em>but before the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the correct standard of review was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and further that the Commonwealth met that standard. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review limited to whether admission of the toxicology evidence, in the manner described above, required reversal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We agree with the Appeals Court that the admission of Dr. Behonick\u2019s testimony on direct examination reciting the results of the toxicology analysis performed by the Pennsylvania laboratory as to the concentration of fentanyl in the tested sample of Beaulier\u2019s blood was error of constitutional dimension, a point on which the defendant and the Commonwealth also agree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greineder, </em>458 Mass. 207, 237 (2010), <em>S.C., </em>464 Mass. 580, 582-584 (2013) (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] testing results); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 584-585 (2010), and cases cited (autopsy report).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">It does not necessarily follow, however, that even though this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>case was tried after <em>Verde </em>and before <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>it is necessary or appropriate to apply the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard of review in considering the effect of the error. At the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, a drug certificate \u2014 the focus of the <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>case \u2014 was deemed admissible by statute as prima facie evidence of the nature and quantity of the substance analyzed, see G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 13, and its admission by itself, without the benefit of testimony by the certifying chemist who performed the analysis, had been blessed by this court in <em>Verde, supra </em>at 282-284, as not violating a defendant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. Because this was the state of our law, we concluded that in a trial conducted after <em>Verde </em>but before <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>any objection to the admission of a drug certificate as violative of the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights would have been futile, and therefore the error resulting from admission of a drug certificate should be reviewed under the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard despite the absence of an objection at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. 350, 356, 358-359 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The toxicology evidence at issue here is different. At the time of the defendant\u2019s trial, Massachusetts evidence law had long precluded an expert witness, on hearsay grounds, from testifying on direct examination to underlying test results or other facts on which his or her opinion was based unless the witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>had performed those tests or unless the other facts, although hearsay, were independently admitted in evidence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nardi, </em>452 Mass. 379, 391 &amp; n.13, 392-393 (2008); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Markvart, </em>437 Mass. 331, 338 (2002); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jaime, </em>433 Mass. 575, 577-578 (2001); <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 530-532 (1986). Compare Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 703 (2013), with Fed. R. Evid. 703 (2012). Accordingly, the defendant here had readily available to him grounds on which to object to the now-challenged testimony given by Dr. Behonick concerning the results of toxicological analyses that he had not performed. In other words, an objection to the admission of this evidence by the defendant would not have been futile. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. at 358-359. In these circumstances, there is much force to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant should not be relieved of the obligation to raise a timely objection at trial, and because he did not do so, the error at issue should be reviewed under the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard. In the end, however, the issue concerning the correct standard of review to apply to the trial error makes no difference to the outcome here, because the standard of harmless beyond a reasonable doubt itself was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">To prove the defendant guilty of unlawful possession of a class B substance (fentanyl) with intent to distribute, the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (1) knowingly and intentionally (2) possessed a class B controlled substance (fentanyl), (3) with the specific intent to distribute it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acosta, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 836, 839-840 (2012), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gollman, </em>436 Mass. 111, 116 (2002). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LaPerle, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 426-429 (1985). The results contained in the Pennsylvania laboratory\u2019s toxicology report were highly material to the manslaughter charge, because the presence of fentanyl in Beaulier\u2019s blood, and more particularly its relatively high concentration, bore directly on the cause of his death.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the cause of death had little bearing on the elements required to prove the possession with intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>charge. The independent \u2014 that is, unrelated to the toxicological analyses \u2014 evidence at trial that the defendant knowingly possessed and intended to distribute fentanyl (in the form of fentanyl patches) to others on December 17, 2004, was overwhelming. Three witnesses (Groves, Gauthier, and Macdonald) testified independently that the defendant offered to sell or give a fentanyl patch to that witness at or before the December 17 Hiltz Christmas party; a fourth witness (Hopkinson) observed the defendant giving a fentanyl patch to Beaulier at the party; and a fifth (Genest) saw the defendant produce a fentanyl patch and cut it open with a pair of scissors in the kitchen of Beaulier\u2019s house immediately after the party.* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to the nature of fentanyl, the judge properly instructed the jury that fentanyl is a class B controlled substance as a matter of law, and neither party disputed this instruction or otherwise contested the identity of the substance in the transdermal patches as fentanyl.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">When considered in light of all this evidence,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we think it is hardly conceivable that the jury were influenced by the erroneously admitted toxicology evidence in finding that the defendant had possessed fentanyl with intent to distribute it. In sum, this is a case where the independent evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt is so powerful that we are satisfied the improperly admitted evidence would have had little or no effect on the fact finder, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vasquez, </em>456 Mass. at 362, and therefore the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-15\">Fentanyl is a prescription drug that depresses the central nervous system and is used to treat moderate to severe pain. Fentanyl can be administered externally in the form of a transdermal patch; the patch consists of a gel-like substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>within plastic packaging. Patches are not intended for oral ingestion. According to the testimony at trial, the ingestion of the gel contents of a fentanyl patch results in a euphoric \u201chigh\u201d feeling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In his testimony Hopkinson described the patches as \u201cmorphine patches,\u201d not \u201cfentanyl patches.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In his appeal to the Appeals Court, the defendant had included a challenge to the sufficiency of the indictment charging him with possession of a class B controlled substance with intent to distribute. The Appeals Court rejected that challenge, and we do not consider it in connection with our limited further appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The Appeals Court concluded that Dr. George Behonick permissibly could recite in his direct testimony the results of the comprehensive drug screen performed in the laboratory that he supervised. That is incorrect, given that Dr. Behonick did not perform the drug screen. The fact that Dr. Behonick was, in his words, \u201cresponsible for the technical oversight of the laboratory, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>which includes the quality control and appropriateness of procedures that are rendered in doing the testing,\u201d is not a substitute for having performed the testing himself. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 782-784 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011). Cf. <em>Bullcoming </em>v. <em>New Mexico, </em>131 S. Ct. 2705, 2714-2715 (2011). We have no need to consider whether under the Supreme Court\u2019s five-to-four decision in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>132 S. Ct. 2221 (2012), Dr. Behonick\u2019s recitation of the laboratory analyses might have satisfied the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, because even if it may have, this component of his testimony was inadmissible under Massachusetts evidence law, as discussed in the text, <em>infra. </em>Dr. Behonick permissibly could (and did) testify on direct examination to an <em>opinion </em>formed by examining the results reported on the toxicology report, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrail, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 343 (2011), namely, his opinion that the amount of fentanyl measured in Beaulier\u2019s blood was consistent with a lethal outcome. However, he could not read into evidence, as he did here, the factual data contained in the report. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Greineder, </em>464 Mass. 580, 584 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, supra </em>at 783-784; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGrail, supra </em>at 344-345. See generally <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531-532 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\">To a lesser extent, the same is true of Dr. Behonick\u2019s testimony indicating that the \u201cwhole blood\u201d drug screen performed at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health Care System laboratory had identified fentanyl in Beaulier\u2019s blood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Corroborating Genest\u2019s testimony, a State police trooper testified that the police seized a transdermal fentanyl patch wrapper and a pair of scissors from Beaulier\u2019s kitchen counter during their investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\">It is true \u2014 as the defendant\u2019s trial counsel argued in her closing statement \u2014 that the jury could disbelieve all the witnesses who testified to the defendant\u2019s offering fentanyl patches at the Christmas party, but the number of such witnesses and the consistent testimony they offered concerning the defendant\u2019s efforts to distribute the fentanyl patches make that possibility highly unlikely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
