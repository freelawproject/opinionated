L. c. 252 and is subject to oversight by the defendant State Reclamation and Mosquito Control Board (board), to establish unilaterally the compensation rates for the individuals who are employed by the Bristol project to carry out its mosquito control programs and functions. At the heart of this dispute is the meaning of G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 14D (\u00a7 14D), which was enacted in 2008. The plaintiffs initiated this action in 2009, seeking a declaration that under \u00a7 14D, they have the authority to hire and set the compensation rates for the project\u2019s employees and to retain legal counsel; they also sought an order of mandamus requiring the defendant Treasurer and Receiver General (Treasurer) to pay those employees the salary increases due to them. On cross-motions for summary judgment, a Superior Court judge allowed the board\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaint. We conclude that the summary judgment record is insufficient to determine whether the plaintiffs are entitled as matter of law to the relief they seek. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><em>Statutory scheme. </em>General Laws c. 252 governs the structure and function of the board as well as local mosquito control districts and projects such as the Bristol project. We summarize its relevant provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">The board is established by G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 2, and, pursuant to that section, exists within the State agency formerly known, and referred to in \u00a7 2, as the Department of Food and Agriculture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board is authorized to make \u201cimprovements,\u201d including the eradication of mosquitos, to lowland areas. G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 1. To carry out its functions, the board may establish local mosquito control districts and projects (collectively, projects) and appoint commissioners to supervise the mosquito <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>eradication programs in the particular locale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> G. L. c. 252, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 5A. Projects are separately funded by the cities and towns that choose to be members. G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 5A. These municipalities are assessed annually by the Treasurer up to the full amount of a project\u2019s annual budget. <em>Id. </em>Project funds are held by the Treasurer, and are disbursed to the projects with the board\u2019s approval. G. L. c. 252, \u00a7\u00a7 5A, 14. The Bristol project, formed in 1956 by special act of the Legislature, was created as a mosquito control project \u201cto the same extent as if constituted by the [board] acting under [G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 5A].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> St. 1956, c. 506, \u00a7 1. Thus, like all mosquito control projects, its commissioners are appointed by the board, are authorized to make improvements on behalf of the Bristol project subject to the board\u2019s approval, and \u201cmay employ suitable persons to perform the work under their direction.\u201d G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Under G. L. c. 252, the board exercises control over the several projects\u2019 budgets. Specifically, pursuant to G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 5A, the board determines the initial funding available to each project and its annual budget as well. The board also is responsible for monitoring every project\u2019s expenditure of its budgeted funds. See G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 14. Moreover, the board remains accountable to the State comptroller for project budgets. G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 5A (to address \u201ctiming discrepancies\u201d between revenues and expenses, board may \u201cincur expenses and the comptroller may certify for payments amounts in anticipation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>receipts,\u201d but board must \u201cannually certify to the comptroller that expenditures for the fiscal year do not exceed related assessments\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Section 14D of G. L. c. 252, which is at issue here, was enacted by the Legislature in 2008.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See St. 2008, c. 182, \u00a7 73. The section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201cMosquito control projects and mosquito control districts shall have sole authority in all personnel decisions including, but not limited to, the following: the hiring and firing of personnel; the establishment of rates of compensation for personnel representative of the regional economy; and the hiring of appropriate outside professionals deemed necessary to carry out and fulfill statutory obligations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\"><em>Facts. </em>The record reflects the following facts. On June 29, 2007, the board issued a memorandum announcing a temporary moratorium on salary increases and salary-connected cost of living adjustments (COLAs) for all personnel employed by any project, effective July 1, 2007. Citing \u201csignificant discrepancies\u201d in salaries across projects, the memorandum stated that the board and the Department of Agricultural Resources were working on \u201cconsistent\u201d and \u201cfair\u201d salary guidelines that were \u201cexpected to be completed within the next few months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">On December 27, 2007, the plaintiff commissioners of the Bristol project voted to raise the salaries of four professional and administrative employees, and the project\u2019s chair notified the board in writing on the same day that the Bristol project was doing so.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The chair\u2019s letter stated that establishing the new salary structure was \u201cnecessary to maintain the integrity of the [Bristol project] in line with [the board\u2019s] approved salaries for . . . other [m]osquito [c]ontrol [projects].\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The board rejected the raises, noting that the board\u2019s moratorium on salary increases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>was still in effect. It also stated that it had not been \u201cprovided any justification [for the increases,] such as changes in job duties and responsibilities or consideration of matters, such as length of service (i.e., seniority).\u201d Finally, the board referenced an ongoing review and reclassification process that it stated was being performed by the State Human Resources Division (HRD): \u201cOnce the [b]oard receives recommendations on reclassification of all mosquito control personnel from the [HRD], this will help the [b]oard in its deliberations to consider lifting the temporary moratorium if necessary. . . . [T]he HRD process is an \u2018objective mechanism for determining salaries\u2019 and should result in an equitable structure within and between all mosquito control projects in the [S]tate.\u201d Subsequently, on April 14, 2008, the board notified all projects that the salary increase moratorium was still in effect but, in recognition of their \u201cexcellent service,\u201d it planned to authorize a three per cent \u201cacross the board\u201d COLA for all the project\u2019s employees in the fiscal year 2009 budget.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Section 14D of G. L. c. 252 became effective on July 1, 2008, and vested \u201csole authority in all personnel decisions,\u201d including compensation rates, in the local projects. Thereafter, the board, acknowledging \u201cconcern that conflicts of law may now exist,\u201d indicated that requests for salary increases in excess of the recently approved three per cent COLA must be reviewed by legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">On October 24, 2008, the board revoked the salary and COLA moratorium it had instituted in 2007. In its memorandum to all the mosquito control projects announcing this step, the board stated that the action was \u201cnecessary since the anticipated process of reclassification through the [HRD] to standardize and normalize pay rates and salary increases for mosquito control personnel has not yet been resolved.\u201d The board stated that it would now consider, on a \u201ccase-by-case basis,\u201d requests that were accompanied by \u201cappropriate justification\u201d and a demonstration that project budgets would cover the cost of any proposed increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>On December 4, 2008, the Bristol project resubmitted the same proposed reclassification and revised salary stmcture for the four professional and administrative employees that it had submitted in December, 2007; the board again rejected the proposal. In an electronic mail message to the chair of the Bristol project, the board\u2019s chair explained, \u201cUnfortunately, we are unable to entertain these requests pending reclassification of all your personnel by HRD. HRD\u2019s task is nearing completion. As soon as this occurs, we will take up the matter of your request.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The plaintiffs filed an action in the Superior Court on October 8, 2009. On June 6, 2010, the board approved a five per cent COLA for Bristol project employees, which applied retroactively to January 1, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>\u201cThe standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Augat, Inc. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>410 Mass. 117, 120 (1991), citing Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">2. <em>Authority to set rates of compensation for Bristol project employees. </em>The plaintiffs contend that the plain language of \u00a7 14D is dispositive and therefore entitles them unilaterally to raise the salaries of the Bristol project\u2019s employees without the board\u2019s approval. Statutory language \u201cis to be construed as written, in keeping with its plain meaning.\u201d <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co. </em>v. <em>Urstadt Biddle Props., Inc., </em>433 Mass. 285, 289 (2001). The pertinent language of \u00a7 14D states: \u201cMosquito control projects and mosquito control districts shall have sole authority in all personnel decisions including, but not limited to, ... the establishment of rates of compensation for personnel representative of the regional economy.\u201d As the plaintiffs argue, the plain meaning of these words is that the plaintiffs have exclusive authority to set the salaries of the Bristol project\u2019s staff, and those salary decisions are not themselves subject to board approval.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">However, we disagree with the plaintiffs that the analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>ends there. Although statutory language \u201cis to be construed as written, in keeping with its plain meaning,\u201d <em>Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Co. </em>v. <em>Urstadt Biddle Props., Inc., </em>433 Mass. at 289, the language is not to be read in \u201cisolation,\u201d but \u201c[w]hen the meaning of a statute is brought into question, a court properly should read other sections and should construe them together.\u201d <em>LeClair </em>v. <em>Norwell, </em>430 Mass. 328, 333 (1999), quoting <em>Pentucket Manor Chronic Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Comm\u2019n, </em>394 Mass. 233, 240 (1985). See <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 490, 497 (1984) (\u201cwords of a statute must be construed in association with other statutory language and the general statutory plan\u201d). See also <em>Cote-Whiteacre </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>446 Mass. 350, 358-359 (2006) (Spina, J., concurring) (provisions of particular chapter in General Laws are to be construed, where possible, as harmonious whole consistent with legislative purpose, and therefore particular sections in chapter must be read together). Accordingly, we must consider \u00a7 14D in relation to the over-all framework governing mosquito control projects under G. L. c. 252. In doing so, we conclude that the exclusive authority of a project, including the Bristol project, to set rates of compensation for its employees is still subject to the board\u2019s general statutory authority over mosquito control projects, and in particular the board\u2019s specific responsibility for approving their annual budgets.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Under G. L. c. 252, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 5A, the board appoints the commissioners for every project and retains the authority to remove them for cause, and under \u00a7 12, the board remains responsible for approving every mosquito control \u201cimprovement\u201d undertaken in a particular project and the manner in which it is accomplished. See <em>id. </em>(if all statutory requirements in G. L. c. 252, \u00a7\u00a7 1 through 7, are met and financing arranged pursuant to G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 9 or \u00a7 10, \u201c[t]he commissioners shall carry out said improvements in such manner as the board may approve\u201d). But of greater relevance are the provisions in \u00a7\u00a7 5A and 14, relating to budgets and expenditures. The board sets each project\u2019s initial budget<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and thereafter is responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>for approving the project\u2019s annual budget.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 5A. Under \u00a7 14, the commissioners of every project are to submit monthly accounts and vouchers of the project\u2019s expenses, and these expenses are only paid if approved by the board.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Further, the statutory command that the board \u201cannually certify to the comptroller that expenditures for the fiscal year do not exceed related assessments,\u201d G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 5A, second par., is a very clear signal that the ultimate responsibility for each project\u2019s over-all expenses lies with the board, not with the projects.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The Legislature enacted \u00a7 14D as an outside section to the fiscal year 2009 budget, see St. 2008, c. 182, \u00a7 73, and did so without amending G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 5A or \u00a7 14, or any other provision in that chapter. We find nothing in the language of \u00a7 14D that contradicts any of these statutory provisions, and our review of \u00a7 14D\u2019s legislative history has not suggested otherwise. Accordingly, we will construe \u00a7 14D in a manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>that harmonizes its provisions with \u00a7\u00a7 5A and 14. The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 14D as giving projects the authority to increase salaries wholly independently of the board\u2019s over-all control over annual project budgets would lead to illogical results. See <em>Canton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Mass. Highway Dep\u2019t, </em>455 Mass. 783, 791-792 (2010) (\u201cWe construe statutes that relate to the same subject matter as a harmonious whole and avoid absurd results\u201d). See also <em>Rotondi </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>463 Mass. 644, 648 (2012), quoting <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001) (\u201cA fundamental tenet of statutory interpretation is that statutory language should be given effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aim of the Legislature unless to do so would achieve an illogical result\u201d). Theoretically, a project unilaterally could raise its employees\u2019 salaries at any point to levels that exceeded the annual budget approved by the board. Or, even if the salary increases were within the over-all annual budget, they still might be set at levels that could leave insufficient funds for approved project improvements. We decline to assume that in enacting \u00a7 14D and choosing to leave the provisions of G. L. c. 252, \u00a7\u00a7 5A, 12, and 14, unchanged, the Legislature intended to undermine the board\u2019s authority in such a manner. See <em>DiFiore </em>v. <em>American Airlines, Inc., </em>454 Mass. 486, 491 (2009), quoting <em>Locator Servs. Group, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>443 Mass. 837, 859 (2005) (court will \u201c \u2018construe the various provisions of [the] statute in harmony with one another,\u2019 recognizing that the Legislature did not intend internal contradiction\u201d). Accordingly, we interpret \u00a7 14D to grant mosquito control projects, including the Bristol project, the exclusive authority to set the compensation rates for their employees, but that authority nonetheless is subject to the board\u2019s responsibility for approving their annual project budgets. Put another way, projects may set salary levels for their employees at whatever levels they choose, provided that the over-all budget for the project does not exceed the board-approved amount, and does not prevent the project from accomplishing its board-approved improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Given this interpretation of \u00a7 14D, the record here contains too many unanswered factual questions to permit the entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>summary judgment. Although the plaintiffs purport to seek a declaratory judgment regarding the Bristol project\u2019s general authority to set the salaries of its employees, specifically at issue are the four salary increases that they sought to put into effect in December, 2007, and again in December, 2008, but that the board rejected. At the time of the Bristol project\u2019s 2008 attempt to institute the increases, \u00a7 14D was in effect, but the record does not contain any facts about whether implementation of the salary increases would have caused the Bristol project to exceed its annual budget or in any event would have interfered with the Bristol project\u2019s ability to complete board-approved mosquito control improvements.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Without information about the relationship between the requested salary increases and the Bristol project\u2019s over-all budget for that fiscal year, it is not possible to provide a \u201cbinding declaration\u201d that will resolve the parties\u2019 rights and duties in connection with the \u201cactual controversy\u201d between them. See G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1. Accordingly, both parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment on count 1 of the complaint, seeking a declaratory judgment, must be denied.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">3. <em>Authority to retain legal counsel. </em>We briefly address the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 request for a declaration that they have \u201cthe authority to . . . select and retain [their] own legal counsel without being subject to [S]tate statutes and regulations which apply to hiring legal counsel representing the Commonwealth and its agencies and departments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The board takes the position that the plaintiffs unlawfully retained private counsel to represent the Bristol project in this action, in violation of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 65.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This statute sets forth the procedures that State agencies must follow before retaining counsel not already employed by the Commonwealth, and any attorney hired through this process who provides litigation services may \u201cappear in court on behalf of the Commonwealth only after his appointment as a special assistant attorney general.\u201d G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 65 (a) (3). The plaintiffs maintain, however, that \u00a7 14D authorizes them to obtain private counsel without first complying with \u00a7 65 and related regulations, pointing to the following language: \u201cprojects . . . shall have sole authority in all personnel decisions including ... the hiring of appropriate outside professionals deemed necessary to carry out and fulfill statutory obligations.\u201d G. L. c. 252, \u00a7 14D. The plaintiffs contend that their private lawyers in this case qualify as \u201coutside profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>sionals\u201d under the statute, thus granting the plaintiffs \u201csole discretion\u201d in the outside lawyers\u2019 hiring; the board disagrees. In ruling on the parties\u2019 cross-motions for summary judgment and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration, the motion judge declined to reach this issue. We do as well, but for a different reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">On February 22, 2011, the parties entered into a joint stipulation stating that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have received appointments as special assistant attorneys general, \u201cretroactively effective to the commencement of this litigation,\u201d rendering the parties\u2019 dispute over the applicability of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 65, \u201cmoot\u201d (emphasis in original). We agree. \u201c[D]eclaratory relief is reserved for real controversies and is not a vehicle for resolving abstract, hypothetical, or otherwise moot questions.\u201d <em>Libertarian Ass\u2019n of Mass. </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>462 Mass. 538, 547 (2012), citing <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 292-293 (1977). See G. L. c. 231 A, \u00a7 1. We decline to address the issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">4. <em>Request for mandamus relief. </em>Count 2 of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeks mandamus relief against the Treasurer and, in particular, an order requiring him to pay the salary increases to the Bristol project\u2019s employees that the plaintiffs claim they are authorized to institute. Because the record does not permit resolution of count 1 of the complaint at this juncture, any consideration of count 2 is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment of the Superior Court is vacated, and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The State Reclamation and Mosquito Control Board (board) has three members, all of whom serve ex officio: an employee of the Department of Environmental Protection designated by its commissioner; an employee of the Department of Food and Agriculture (currently named the Department of Agricultural Resources, see St. 2003, c. 41, \u00a7 1 [a] [1]) designated by its commissioner; and a similarly commissioner-designated employee of the agency formerly known as the Department of Environmental Management (currently named the Department of Conservation and Recreation, see St. 2003, c. 41, \u00a7 1 <em>[a] </em>[3]).

L. c. 252, \u00a7 5A, was amended effective July 1, 2013, see St. 2013, c. 38, \u00a7 135, to add to the second paragraph of \u00a7 5A a new sentence that follows immediately the sentence quoted in the text (relating to annual certification by the board to the State controller). It provides: \u201cThe certification shall not give the board the authority to modify the budget approved by a mosquito control project without the mosquito control project\u2019s approval.\u201d The 2013 amendment came after all the events at issue in this case had occurred, and clearly was not before the Superior Court judge who decided the cross-motions for summary judgment. The assistant attorney general representing the board forwarded to this court a copy of the amendment immediately before the oral argument, but neither party has sought to address its meaning or its particular bearing on the issues raised here. In the circumstances, we decline to consider the 2013 amendment further, except to observe that at least as a definitional matter, there is a distinction between the authority to modify a budget and the authority to approve (or disapprove) it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\">It is also the case that the Bristol project\u2019s proposed salary increases did not appear to coincide with the regular annual budget cycle. The parties do not explain or otherwise reconcile this timing issue with their respective interpretations of G. L. c. 252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Although there is necessary factual information missing, the record does make apparent that this lawsuit has grown out of a longstanding dispute between the Bristol project and the board. Central to this disagreement, and reflected throughout the record, are repeated references by the board and others to efforts to establish a standard, Statewide salary structure for employees of the mosquito control projects, efforts that are described as having been ongoing since 2007, but there is no indication in the record (or in the parties\u2019 briefs) that they have been completed. What the record also reveals is that hovering over this dispute, and perhaps closely linked to the topic of a Statewide salary structure, is an unresolved question whether the mosquito control projects are State agencies and, if so, whether this status defines or at least affects the rights of the parties in relation to the authority to set rates of compensation. Materials in the record suggest the board has taken the position that all mosquito control projects are State agencies and therefore must \u201cwork within the [Sjtate process of establishing . . . salaries,\u201d including meeting the requirements of the human resources division, but this issue apparently was not raised by either party before the Superior Court and has not been raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b555-6\">General Laws c. 30, \u00a7 65, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201c(a) A lawyer who is not a regular state employee or person who is compensated through the automated payroll system of the commonwealth shall not provide legal services for the commonwealth, or for any department, agency, board or commission thereof, unless and until:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201c(1) the governor\u2019s chief legal counsel certifies in writing that no state employee can provide the legal services that the lawyer is to provide; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201c(3) the office of the attorney general has been consulted during the procurement process ....
