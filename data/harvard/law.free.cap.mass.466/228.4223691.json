McGuire, an attorney employed by the Committee for Public Counsel Services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Alicea\u2019s complaint asserted claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> These claims were based on Alicea\u2019s assertions that he should have received a one-year sentence in connection with his plea of guilty to a firearm offense, and that McGuire\u2019s conduct, allegedly having conspired with the prosecutor, had resulted in Alicea\u2019s serving an illegal sentence of three and one-half years. A judge granted summary judgment in favor of McGuire; the judgment was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">While his Federal court case was pending, Alicea commenced the underlying action in the Superior Court against the Commonwealth as McGuire\u2019s employer; McGuire was not named as a defendant. The Superior Court action asserted claims of malpractice and negligent infliction of emotional distress, premised on the allegation that McGuire had caused Alicea to serve an illegal sentence. Concluding that the judgment entered in the Federal action precluded Alicea from litigating the issue of his purported entitlement to a one-year sentence, a Superior Court judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Alicea appealed, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Because the issue central to Alicea\u2019s claims in the Superior Court was decided in the Federal action, application of the doctrine of issue preclusion under Federal common law prevents Alicea from relitigating the issue. We therefore conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for summary judgment was properly allowed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\"><em>Background facts and proceedings.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In 2003, a grand jury returned indictments charging Alicea with three firearm of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>fenses: discharge of a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 12E; unlicensed possession of a firearm outside his residence or place of business, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(carrying statute or \u00a7 10 [a]), after having been convicted previously of two qualifying violent or drug-related offenses, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G <em>(b) </em>(repeat offender statute or \u00a7 10G); and possession of a firearm without an FID card, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h) </em>(\u00a7 10 <em>[h]). </em>The most serious potential penal consequence was the enhanced penalty sought under the repeat offender statute, \u00a7 10G, for violation of \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>the carrying statute. Under the sentencing enhancement provisions of \u00a7 10G, Alicea faced a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in State prison, due to his prior convictions of drug-related offenses. At that time, the indictment for unlawful discharge of a firearm carried a maximum sentence of three months in a jail or house of correction, and the indictment for unlawful possession of a firearm carried a maximum sentence of one year in a jail or house of correction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ***5</p>\n<p id=\"b252-20\">McGuire, who had been appointed to represent Alicea, entered into plea negotiations with the prosecutor, and an agreement was reached whereby Alicea would plead guilty to unlawful carrying of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 10 (a), the underlying charge in the indictment that sought a sentencing enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 10G, and the Commonwealth would enter a nolle prosequi on so much of the indictment as provided for sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 10G.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *8Without the repeat offender enhancement provided under \u00a7 10G, the maximum sentence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>the \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>carrying charge was five years in State prison. In exchange for Alicea\u2019s guilty plea, the parties agreed that the prosecutor would recommend a sentence of from three to five years in State prison and file a nolle prosequi on the remaining indictments. Concerned by the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence he faced under \u00a7 10G, Alicea \u201ctook [the plea agreement] right away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">A plea hearing was conducted on March 18, 2004. During the hearing, the prosecutor erroneously informed the judge that Alicea had agreed to plead guilty to unlawful <em>possession </em>of a firearm. As stated, at that time the maximum penalty for unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 10 <em>(h) </em>was a one-year sentence. The prosecutor correctly explained to the judge that, pursuant to the terms of the negotiated plea, the defendant had agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a sentencing recommendation of from three to five years in State prison and entry of a nolle prosequi on the indictment charging unlawful discharge in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 12E.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s statement that the agreement included the filing of a nolle prosequi on the entire indictment charging a violation of \u00a7 10 (a) and a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 10G, however, was only partially correct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> McGuire did not correct the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and did not inform the judge that Alicea had agreed to plead guilty to unlawful <em>carrying </em>of a firearm under \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>rather than to unlawful <em>possession </em>of a firearm under \u00a7 10 <em>(h). </em>Consistent with the prosecutor\u2019s representation regarding the agreed-upon sentence, the judge imposed a sentence of from three to five years in State prison. The prosecutor thereafter filed a nolle prosequi on the indictment that included both the underlying offense of unlawful carrying, \u00a7 10 (a), and the repeat offender provision of \u00a7 10G. The plea agreement, however, called for entry of a nolle prosequi to only that portion of the indictment seeking sentencing enhancement as a repeat offender. Pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, the prosecutor also filed a nolle prosequi on the indictment charging unlawful discharge of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">These errors came to light several days later, when the Department of Correction informed the prosecutor that the three-to five-year sentence imposed did not conform to the statutory requirements of \u00a7 10 <em>(h), </em>the indictment for which the docket sheet and supporting documentation indicated that the defendant had been sentenced. The prosecutor contacted McGuire and informed him that an error had occurred, and that he intended to file a motion to amend the indictment so that it included the correct citation to \u00a7 10 (a), thereby \u201ccorresponding] to the plea deal that. . . Alicea had accepted.\u201d McGuire misinterpreted the prosecutor\u2019s message; he understood the prosecutor to mean that the indictment still referred, erroneously, to enhanced sentencing under \u00a7 10G. Without reviewing the motion or consulting Alicea, he agreed to assent to the prosecutor\u2019s motion to amend the indictment. McGuire did so \u201cto preserve for [his] client... the sentence that he had agreed to in the plea deal.\u201d The judge who had conducted the plea colloquy allowed the motion to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Alicea did not learn of the errors until shortly before September 4, 2007. On that date, he filed a motion for release from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>unlawful confinement, alleging that he had pleaded guilty to the unlawful possession charge, which supported a maximum sentence of only one year\u2019s incarceration. The same judge allowed Alicea\u2019s motion on October 19, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"AK0G\">1. <em>United States District Court action. </em>Alicea filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against McGuire, asserting claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress; violations of his civil rights, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988; malpractice; and violations of G. L. c. 93A. McGuire\u2019s motion to dismiss Alicea\u2019s claims was allowed in part, resulting in dismissal of all but the claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of Alicea\u2019s civil rights. In those claims, Alicea alleged that McGuire, in conspiracy with the prosecutor, had engaged in conduct that resulted in the imposition of an illegal sentence on Alicea.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">McGuire\u2019s motion for summary judgment was allowed; the judge concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auj\">\u201cthere was no \u2018benefit\u2019 to which Alicea was entitled after the plea hearing. Without such a possible benefit there is no reasonable inference of a conspiratorial agreement. Simply put, McGuire may have participated in actions that resulted in an illegal sentence, but on this record, there is neither evidence nor inferences to support the conclusion that McGuire agreed to inflict a wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIV\">As to the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the judge concluded that Alicea had agreed to accept a plea to a sentence of from three to five years in exchange for dismissal of other charges; that plea was not illegal; and, \u201cat the time of the motion to amend Alicea did not face, legally, only one year in custody.\u201d In an unpublished decision, the First Circuit affirmed the judgment, concluding that \u201cAlicea was not entitled to a sentence of only one year.\u201d Alicea <em>vs. </em>McGuire, U.S. Ct. App., No. 10-1329 (1st Cir. Dec. 7, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"AaE\">2. <em>Superior Court action. </em>Alicea filed the underlying action in the Superior Court on December 9, 2008, before the First Circuit decision issued. The complaint asserts claims of malpractice and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the Commonwealth, in its capacity as McGuire\u2019s employer; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>McGuire was not named as a defendant. The complaint alleges that McGuire acted negligently by failing to consult Alicea about the error made at the plea colloquy, and by assenting to the prosecutor\u2019s motion to amend the indictment absent such consultation. Both causes of action require a plaintiff to prove that he suffered harm caused by the negligent conduct of the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The harm Alicea alleges he suffered is the additional prison time he served beyond one year, premised on his asserted entitlement to a one-year sentence on his plea of guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">After entry of the decision by the First Circuit, the Commonwealth filed a motion for summary judgment in the Superior Court. A Superior Court judge concluded that Alicea was precluded from litigating the issue of his alleged entitlement to a one-year sentence, and allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. See, e.g., <em>Juliano </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>461 Mass. 527, 529 530 (2012). \u201c[A] party moving for summary judgment in a case in which the opposing party will have the burden of proof at trial is entitled to summary judgment if he demonstrates, by reference to material described in Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), [365 Mass. 824 (1974),] unmet by countervailing materials, that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Kourouvacilis </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>410 Mass. 706, 716 (1991). Whether a previous decision is to be given preclusive effect presents a question of law appropriate for resolution on summary judgment. See, e.g., <em>Premier Capital, LLC </em>v. <em>KMZ, Inc., </em>464 Mass. 467, 469 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The preclusive effect of a Federal court judgment is governed by Federal common law. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Sturgell, </em>553 U.S. 880, 891 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>(2008). See, e.g., <em>Whitehall Co. </em>v. <em>Barletta, </em>404 Mass. 497, 501 (1989). Under Federal common law, the doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion (collectively, res judicata) define the preclusive effect of a prior judgment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Sturgell, supra </em>at 891-892. Because Alicea\u2019s Federal action asserted claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988, and subject matter jurisdiction was thus premised on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (Federal question),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we apply the rules of res judicata developed by the Federal courts. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Sturgell, supra </em>at 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">\u201cUnder the doctrine of claim preclusion, a final judgment forecloses \u2018successive litigation of the very same claim, whether or not relitigation of the claim raises the same issues as the earlier suit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.., </em>quoting <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 748 (2001). \u201cIssue preclusion, in contrast, bars \u2018successive litigation of an issue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a valid court determination essential to the prior judgment,\u2019 even if the issue recurs in the context of a different claim.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Sturgell, supra, </em>quoting <em>New Hampshire </em>v. <em>Maine, supra </em>at 748-749. Together, claim preclusion and issue preclusion \u201crelieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and, by preventing inconsistent decisions, encourage reliance on adjudication.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 94 (1980). In addition, a State court\u2019s practice of giving preclusive effect to a Federal court\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>sion, and vice versa, promote \u201cthe comity between [Sjtate and [Fjederal courts that has been recognized as a bulwark of the [Fjederal system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Here we are confronted with the application of issue preclusion, not claim preclusion. Issue preclusion applies when \u201c(1) the issue sought to be precluded in the later action is the same as that involved in the earlier action; (2) the issue was actually litigated; (3) the issue was determined by a valid and binding final judgment; and (4) the determination of the issue was essential to the judgment.\u201d <em>Latin Am. Music Co. </em>v. <em>Media Power Group, Inc., </em>705 F.3d 34, 42 (1st Cir. 2013), quoting <em>Mercado-Salinas </em>v. <em>Bart Enters. Int'l, Ltd., </em>671 F.3d 12, 21-22 (1st Cir. 2011). As the party arguing for issue preclusion, the Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing these four elements.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Lundborg </em>v. <em>Phoenix Leasing, Inc., </em>91 F.3d 265, 272 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Alicea properly does not contest that the first three elements have been satisfied. As to the first element, both of the causes of action in the current case depend on Alicea\u2019s assertion that he suffered harm by spending more than one year in prison, which in turn is premised on his claim that he was entitled to a maximum sentence of one year\u2019s incarceration. This issue is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>same as that decided by the First Circuit when it concluded that \u201cAlicea was not entitled to a sentence of only one year.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Alicea vs. McGuire, U.S. Ct. App., No. 10-1329 (1st Cir. Dec. 7, 2010). Second, Alicea actually litigated his claim of entitlement to a one-year sentence in his Federal action. See <em>id. </em>In that case, Alicea argued that, having pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm, he was guaranteed a maximum sentence of one year\u2019s incarceration because principles of double jeopardy barred the Commonwealth from refiling the indictment charging unlawful carrying of a firearm, as to which a nolle prosequi had entered.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Third, the decision in that case constituted a valid and binding final judgment. See <em>Lummus Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth Oil Ref. Co., </em>297 F.2d 80, 89 (2d Cir. 1961), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Dawson </em>v. <em>Lummus Co., </em>368 U.S. 986 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Alicea contests only the fourth factor, arguing that the issue of his entitlement to a one-year sentence was not essential to the decision by the First Circuit because its decision rested on two independent findings: (1) Alicea was not deprived of any \u201cright\u201d to a one-year sentence, and (2) McGuire could not have intended any harm toward Alicea. Alicea contends that neither finding can be viewed as essential to the decision because either one alone would have been sufficient to affirm the conclusion of the United States District Court. See 18 C.A. Wright, A.R. Miller, &amp; E.H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4421, at 564-567 (2d ed. 2002) (where two findings would be sufficient to sustain judgment independently of each other, some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Federal courts have concluded, for purposes of issue preclusion, that neither finding was necessary to judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">We do not agree. The central premise of Alicea\u2019s argument before the First Circuit was that, because Alicea had pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm, the Commonwealth was precluded from refiling the indictment charging Alicea with unlawful carrying of a firearm. As stated, see note 14, <em>supra, </em>the Federal court rejected this argument and determined that \u201cAlicea was not entitled to a sentence of only one year.\u201d Alicea v\u00ed. McGuire, <em>supra. </em>This finding was inextricably intertwined with that court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c(n]o reasonable jury could have inferred. . . that McGuire intended any harm toward his client.\u201d Instead, McGuire had merely \u201ccorrected the oversights\u201d made at the plea colloquy in order to ensure that the Commonwealth would not revive the portion of the indictment seeking a sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 10G. See <em>id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the Commonwealth has met its burden of establishing that the issue is precluded under Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Lastly, we note that the doctrine of issue preclusion applies to this case notwithstanding that the defendant in the current action (the Commonwealth) was not the defendant in the prior Federal action (McGuire). Federal issue preclusion does not require complete mutuality of parties. See <em>Allen </em>v. <em>McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 92, 94-95 (1980); <em>Montana </em>v. <em>United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 154-155 (1979). See <em>Parklane Hosiery Co. </em>v. <em>Shore, </em>439 U.S. 322, 326-333 (1979); <em>Blonder-Tongue Lab., Inc. </em>v. <em>University of Illinois Found., </em>402 U.S. 313, 349-350 (1971).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Because Alicea had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his purported right to a one-year sentence, he cannot litigate the same issue for a second time in the present action. Since another court has determined already that Alicea was not entitled to a maximum of one year\u2019s incarceration, he cannot establish that, as a result of McGuire\u2019s conduct, he suffered harm by being incarcerated for more than one year.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The Committee for Public Counsel Services is an agency of the Commonwealth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Alicea also filed claims for malpractice and violations of G.

Section 10G, however, does not define a stand-alone, separate offense. Rather, the repeat offender statute establishes sentencing enhancements for offenders who, \u201chaving been previously convicted of two violent crimes, or two serious drug offenses or one violent crime and one serious drug offense,\u201d commit certain firearms offenses, including those prohibited by \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>and <em>(h). </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>Fernandes, </em>430 Mass. 517, 520-521 (1999), cert, denied sub nom. <em>Martinez </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>530 U.S. 1281 (2000) (repeat offender sentencing enhancement does not constitute \u201cfreestanding crime\u201d; \u201cthe counts for the current offense and for the repeat offense are viewed as parts of one indictment and charge only one crime with a sentencing enhancement provision\u201d). The relevant indictment against Alicea sets forth \u00a7 10 <em>(a) </em>(possessing firearm \u201cnot then being present in or on his residence or place of business\u201d) as the underlying charge on which sentencing enhancement was being sought pursuant to \u00a7 10G (\u201chaving been previously convicted of two violent crimes or two serious drug offenses\u201d). \u201cIn the normal course of trying a repeat offender indictment, if a guilty verdict is reached on the current offense, a separate trial subsequently is held on the repeat offense.

Where the prior judgment was rendered by a Federal court exercising subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 (diversity of citizenship), the United States Supreme Court has adopted, \u201cas the federally prescribed rule of decision, the law that would be applied by [S]tate courts in the State in which the [Fjederal diversity court sits.\u201d <em>Semtek Int\u2019l Inc. </em>v. <em>Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>531 U.S. 497, 508 (2001).

Ordinarily, \u201ca failure to plead an affirmative defense results in a waiver and exclusion of the defense from the case.\u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas, </em>428 Mass. 555, 575 n.16 (1998). See Mass. R. Civ. P. 8 (c), 365 Mass. 749 (1974). Here, however, the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit entered more than one year after the Commonwealth had filed its answer. In similar circumstances, Federal courts applying the Federal analog to Mass. R. Civ. P. 8 (c) have concluded that issue preclusion is raised properly when a party provides \u201cas much notice of the claim... as could reasonably be required.\u201d See <em>Metromedia Co. </em>v. <em>Fugazy, </em>983 F.2d 350, 367 (2d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 508 U.S. 952 (1993) (where decision to be given preclusive effect \u201cwas filed on the day the present case went to trial,\u201d defendant did not waive issue preclusion defense by arguing issue preclusion in opening statement).

Wright, A.R. Miller, &amp; E.H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4405, at 99-100 (2d ed. 2002) (court may treat late-arising preelusion defense as if it had been pleaded without requiring formal supplemental pleading).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Further support for our conclusion that the issues are the same is demonstrated by Alicea\u2019s brief, which devotes several pages to argument that the First Circuit erred in its decision, because Alicea was entitled to a maximum sentence of one year\u2019s incarceration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>354 Mass. 630, 632 (1968) (doctrine of double jeopardy does not prevent revival of indictment on which nolle prosequi entered before jury impanelment), the First Circuit determined that the prohibitions against double jeopardy did not preclude revival of the indictment charging Alicea with unlawful carrying of a firearm. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>356 Mass. 447, 448-449 (1969) (Commonwealth agreed to entry of nolle prosequi on complaints charging unlawful sale of drugs in exchange for guilty pleas to drug possession; after defendants pleaded guilty to possession charges, Commonwealth obtained indictments for same offenses as to which nolle prosequi had entered; in circumstances, agreement to enter nolle prosequi upheld and subsequent prosecution of those offenses barred).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b260-12\">We note that even if the decision could be viewed as resting on two independent findings, the majority of Federal courts would give preclusive effeet to each finding that has actually been litigated and decided. See <em>Jean Alexander Cosmetics, Inc. </em>v. <em>L\u2019Oreal USA, Inc., </em>458 F.3d 244, 251-255 (3d Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1305 (2007), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-16\">\u201cDenying preclusive effect to a finding that would support a court\u2019s judgment merely because the case was disposed of on other grounds as well would result in the inefficient use of private and public litigation resources. Courts routinely decide cases on multiple grounds, each of which has been fully litigated and given careful consideration due to their potentially dispositive role in the case. Because the interests that the necessity principle protects are not compromised under these circumstances, it would be curious to conclude that none of these findings were necessary to the judgment for purposes of collateral estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b260-25\">See 18A C.A.
