L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (10), allows an insurer to withhold up to twenty-two per cent of an employee\u2019s compensation award for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>specific injuries under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36, to offset the insurer\u2019s payment of the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by the employee. We conclude that it does not. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the reviewing board (board) of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department), which reached a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">1. <em>Statutory and regulatory framework. </em>General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 13A (10), provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">\u201cThe attorneys\u2019 fees specified in this section shall be the only fees payable for any services provided to employees under this chapter unless otherwise provided by an arbitration agreement pursuant to section ten B. In any instance in which an attorney\u2019s fee under subsection (1) to (6), inclusive, is due as a result of a <em>cash award </em>being made to the employee either voluntarily, or pursuant to an order or decision, the insurer may reduce the <em>amount payable to the employee within the first month from the date of the voluntary payment[,] order or decision, </em>by the amount owed the claimant\u2019s attorney; provided, however, that the amount paid to the employee shall not be reduced to a sum less than seventy-eight percent of what the employee would have received within that month if no attorney\u2019s fee were payable\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 5, vests the Commissioner of Industrial Accidents (commissioner) with the authority to \u201cpromulgate rules and regulations consistent with this chapter for carrying out the functions of the department.\u201d See <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Boston, </em>395 Mass. 12, 16 (1985) (agency charged with enforcing statute authorized to define terms when Legislature silent, and properly promulgated regulations have force of law). In accordance with this authority, the commissioner promulgated 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 (2008), which defines the term \u201cCash Award,\u201d as used in \u00a7 13A (10), to mean \u201cany specific compensation benefits payable under [G. L.] c. 152, \u00a7 36 or \u00a7 36A and any weekly benefits payable under [G. L.] c. 152 of an amount that exceeds the weekly amount being paid the employee for the week immediately prior to the date of the voluntary payment, order or decision.\u201d Further, the phrase \u201cAmount Payable to the Employee Within the First Month from the Date of the Voluntary Payment, Order or Decision,\u201d as used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>in \u00a7 13A (10), has been defined in 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 (2008) to mean \u201cany compensation due the employee under the terms of the voluntary payment, order or decision pursuant to []G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 or \u00a7 36A and any future weekly benefits pursuant to []G. L. c. 152 due the employee for the first 30 days subsequent to the date of the execution of a voluntary payment or the issuance of an order or decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">2. <em>Background. </em>On December 24, 2003, Bruce Spaniol (employee) sustained injuries to his right knee, shoulder, and head when he slipped and fell during the course of his employment at Fairview Commons Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation Center, a member of Berkshire Healthcare Systems, Inc. (employer). He began to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34, for total incapacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">On April 22, 2005, the employee filed a claim against his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer, A.I.M. Mutual Insurance Company (insurer), for medical benefits pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 30.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On September 11, 2006, he filed an additional claim seeking compensation for specific injuries under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36. An administrative judge of the department held a conference with the parties pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, and subsequently issued a conference order denying the employee\u2019s claim for specific compensation. The employee filed a timely appeal, and a hearing was scheduled before the administrative judge for November 19, 2007. That day, instead of proceeding with the hearing, the parties signed an \u201cAgreement to Pay Compensation,\u201d which provided for the payment of $7,602.77 to the employee for specific permanent injuries under \u00a7 36, plus attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $2,500, and reasonable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The insurer issued the employee a check for $5,930.16. This amount represented the specific compensation award of $7,602.77, minus a twenty-two per cent reduction ($1,672.61), taken pursuant to \u00a7 13A (10), to partially offset the insurer\u2019s payment of the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. In response to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>offset, the employee filed a claim under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 14, for reimbursement of the $1,672.61 deducted from his compensation award, and for the imposition of penalties on the insurer. The administrative judge held a conference with the parties pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10A, and subsequently issued a conference order dated July 8, 2008, denying the employee\u2019s claim. The employee filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">A de novo hearing was held on February 19, 2009, at which the employee argued that \u00a7 13A (10) does not apply to compensation awarded for specific injuries under \u00a7 36, that he was entitled to reimbursement of the deducted attorney\u2019s fees, and that penalties should be imposed on the insurer. The administrative judge issued a decision on April 7, 2009, in which he concluded that the employee\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 13A (10) was correct. The administrative judge stated that, in light of the humanitarian nature of the Act and its beneficent design, it would be contrary to the intent of \u00a7 36 to reduce \u201can already paltry benefit\u201d for permanent injuries by twenty-two per cent. Further, the language of \u00a7 13A (10), providing for attorney\u2019s fees \u201cas a result of a cash award <em>being made </em>to the employee,\u201d suggests an ongoing payment of benefits, not a single retroactive payment such as would be made for a specific injury under \u00a7 36. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (10). In the administrative judge\u2019s view, a different construction of this statutory language could result in an employee bearing full responsibility for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees, notwithstanding the fact that the provisions of \u00a7 13A express the Legislature\u2019s intent to have an insurer bear the costs of an injured employee\u2019s representation. Accordingly, the administrative judge ordered the insurer to reimburse the employee $1,672.61 for the deduction taken from his specific compensation award. The administrative judge denied the employee\u2019s request for the imposition of penalties on the insurer on the grounds that the legal issue presented was one of first impression, and the insurer had proceeded in good faith. Both parties appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">By decision dated January 4, 2011, the board reversed the decision of the administrative judge, concluding that \u00a7 13A (10) and 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 allowed the insurer to withhold up to twenty-two per cent of the employee\u2019s specific com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>pensation award to offset his attorney\u2019s fees. The employee appealed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appeals Court reversed the board\u2019s decision. See <em>Spaniol\u2019s Case, </em>81 Mass. App. Ct. 437 (2012). We granted the insurer\u2019s application for further appellate review to consider the interplay between \u00a7 13A (10) and \u00a7 36.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">3. <em>Standard of review. </em>We review the board\u2019s decision in accordance with the standards set forth in G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7), governing appeals from final administrative agency decisions, but we do not consider whether the board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12 (2); <em>Wadsworth\u2019s Case, </em>461 Mass. 675, 679 (2012); <em>Sikorski\u2019s Case, </em>455 Mass. 477, 479-480 (2009). We may reverse or modify the board\u2019s decision where, among other reasons, it is based on an error of law, or is arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (c), (g). \u201cThe board, as the agency charged with administering the workers\u2019 compensation law, is entitled to substantial deference in its reasonable interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Sikorski\u2019s Case, supra </em>at 480. See <em>Gateley\u2019s Case, </em>415 Mass. 397, 399 (1993). However, the duty of statutory interpretation ultimately is for the courts. See <em>Higgins\u2019s Case, </em>460 Mass. 50, 53 (2011); <em>Moss\u2019s Case, </em>451 Mass. 704, 709 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">4. <em>Discussion. </em>The employee contends that although \u00a7 13A (10) permits, in certain circumstances, an insurer to partially offset the amount of workers\u2019 compensation benefits payable to an injured employee by the amount the insurer statutorily owes to the employee\u2019s attorney, this cost-saving provision was intended to apply only to prospective periodic payments of benefits, not to an award of compensation for specific injuries under \u00a7 36. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">It has long been recognized that the Act \u201cwas enacted as a \u2018humanitarian measure\u2019 in response to strong public sentiment that the remedies afforded by actions of tort at common law did not provide adequate protection to workers.\u201d <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., </em>421 Mass. 70, 73 (1995), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>quoting <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>218 Mass. 346, 349 (1914). It is designed to provide financial compensation for the impairment of an injured worker\u2019s earning capacity. See <em>Sellers\u2019s Case, </em>452 Mass. 804, 810 (2008), and cases cited. See also <em>McCarty\u2019s Case, </em>445 Mass. 361, 362-363 (2005) (permanently or partially incapacitated employee entitled to receive compensation based on certain formulas in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35, that include calculation of employee\u2019s average weekly wage). The Act is \u201ca remedial statute and should be given a broad interpretation, viewed in light of its purpose and to \u2018promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neff </em>v. <em>Commissioner of the Dep\u2019t of Indus. Accs., supra, </em>quoting <em>Young </em>v. <em>Duncan, supra. </em>See <em>Higgins\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Further, it must be analyzed \u201cas a whole ... so that the various portions taken together shall constitute a harmonious and consistent legislative enactment.\u201d <em>Price </em>v. <em>Railway Express Agency, Inc., </em>322 Mass. 476, 480 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 36, provides for the payment of a designated sum of compensation to an employee who has suffered specific work-related injuries. More particularly, \u201ccompensation is paid to an employee who sustains permanent loss of sight, hearing, arms, legs, or other bodily functions, or who has a permanent disfigurement.\u201d <em>Walker\u2019s Case, </em>443 Mass. 157, 161 (2004), <em>S.C., </em>453 Mass. 358 (2009). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (1) (a)-(k). An award of compensation under \u00a7 36 is \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from benefits an employee is entitled to receive under other sections of the Act, including those for total incapacity. <em>Maloof\u2019s Case, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 853, 854 (1980) (\u201cThe employee\u2019s \u00a7 36 claim was not a continuation of his original \u00a7 34 claim, but was, rather, a separate and distinct claim of a different nature\u201d). See <em>Walker\u2019s Case, supra. </em>Payment for a specific injury under \u00a7 36 is \u201c[i]n addition to all other compensation to the employee.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (1). See <em>Kaczmarczyk\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 9, 12 (1951); <em>Vouniseas\u2019s Case, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 133, 134 n.3 (1975). By so categorizing \u00a7 36 compensation, the Legislature has expressed a clear intent that it be viewed and treated differently from all other types of workers\u2019 compensation. See, e.g., G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26 (compensation for personal injury); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 30 (medical expenses); <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u00a731 (death benefits for dependents); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 33 (burial expenses); <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 34 (compensation for total incapacity); <em>id. </em>at \u00a735 (compensation for partial incapacity). For this reason, an award of compensation under \u00a7 36 is not subject to reduction by an insurer for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 13A (10); the insurer is obligated to pay the entire attorney\u2019s fees due the employee\u2019s counsel under \u00a7 13A (10) with no offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Section \u00a7 13A (10) states that where \u201can attorney\u2019s fee under subsection (1) to (6), inclusive, is due as a result of a cash award being made to the employee . . ., the insurer may reduce the amount payable to the employee within the first month . . . by the amount owed the claimant\u2019s attorney.\u201d We read this language as pertaining only to an employee\u2019s recovery of weekly indemnity benefits, not the recovery of a compensation award for specific injuries under \u00a7 36. Although the cash award made to the injured employee, which gives rise to the insurer\u2019s obligation to pay attorney\u2019s fees, may be partially reduced by the amount owed to the employee\u2019s lawyer, the offset comes <em>solely </em>from the employee\u2019s first month\u2019s payment. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A (10). This statutory caveat strongly suggests that workers\u2019 compensation benefits continue to be paid in subsequent months and, therefore, are weekly indemnity benefits, not \u00a7 36 compensation. Our interpretation is consistent with additional language in \u00a7 13A (10), stating that \u201cthe amount paid to the employee shall not be reduced to a sum less than seventy-eight percent of what the employee would have received <em>within that month </em>if no attorney\u2019s fee were payable\u201d (emphasis added). This limitation on the scope of an insurer\u2019s offset reflects a general legislative intent to have an insurer bear the cost of an injured employee\u2019s attorney so as to discourage unnecessary litigation, see <em>Green\u2019s Case, 52 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144 (2001), while at the same time recognizing that it is reasonable for an employee to pay a token amount of the cost of the legal representation that has enabled the employee to prevail on his workers\u2019 compensation claim in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Our determination that an insurer, pursuant to \u00a7 13A (10), may not offset the amount owed an employee\u2019s attorney in circumstances where the employee has received a specific com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>pensation award under \u00a7 36 comports with the humanitarian nature of the Act. General Laws c. 152 is designed to protect injured workers, not to allow for the reimbursement of insurers. Weekly indemnity benefits for one month typically will be far less than a specific compensation award under \u00a7 36. In this case, for example, the employee\u2019s weekly indemnity benefits for total incapacity were $483.06. The amount payable to the employee within the first month of his receiving such benefits would be approximately $1,932.24. The maximum amount of attorney\u2019s fees that could be deducted pursuant to the twenty-two per cent offset permitted under \u00a7 13A (10) would be $425.09, notwithstanding the insurer\u2019s ongoing obligation to pay benefits. As weekly indemnity benefits continue to be paid after the first month, nothing further is deducted pursuant to \u00a7 13A (10), the effect of which is that a deduction for an attorney\u2019s fee represents an ever diminishing portion of the total weekly benefits paid and payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">By comparison, the employee\u2019s compensation for specific permanent injuries under \u00a7 36 was $7,602.77. The maximum amount of attorney\u2019s fees that could be deducted from this finite sum if \u00a7 13A (10) were applicable was $1,672.61. It therefore follows that an injured employee would receive less total workers\u2019 compensation if attorney\u2019s fees were deducted from a \u00a7 36 award than if attorney\u2019s fees were deducted from only one month\u2019s payment of weekly indemnity benefits. Such an outcome would be contrary to the purpose of the Act, would result in the employee paying more than a token amount of the cost of his legal representation, and would confer a windfall on insurers at the expense of injured employees. In our view, this is not what the Legislature intended when it permitted a limited recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by an insurer under \u00a7 13A (10).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">Further, our interpretation of \u00a7 13A (10) is consistent with both the language of \u00a7 36 and our related jurisprudence that an award of compensation for specific injuries is separate and distinct from other types of workers\u2019 compensation benefits that an injured employee might receive. Lumping these diverse benefits together for purposes of \u00a7 13A (10) would be contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent that they be treated differently, and we are aware of no precedent that requires such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>We now consider the validity of 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02, wherein the commissioner defined the terms \u201cCash Award\u201d and \u201cAmount Payable to the Employee Within the First Month from the Date of the Voluntary Payment, Order or Decision,\u201d as used in \u00a7 13A (10), to include compensation payable under \u00a7 36. A two-part analysis is employed to determine the validity of a duly promulgated regulation. See <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005). First, using conventional tools of statutory interpretation, we consider \u201cwhether the Legislature has spoken with certainty on the topic in question, and if we conclude that the statute is unambiguous, we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn agency regulation that is contrary to the plain language of the statute and its underlying purpose may be rejected by the courts.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>431 Mass. 638, 646 (2000). See <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Department of Med. Sec., </em>412 Mass. 340, 346 (1992). Second, if the Legislature has not directly addressed the pertinent issue and the statute is capable of more than one rational interpretation, we proceed to determine whether the agency\u2019s interpretation may \u201cbe reconciled with the governing legislation.\u201d <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, supra </em>at 633, quoting <em>Nuclear Metals, Inc. </em>v. <em>Low-Level Radioactive Waste Mgt. Bd., </em>421 Mass. 196, 211 (1995). See <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>454 Mass. 174, 187 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">It is a well-established principle that \u201c[a] state administrative agency in Massachusetts has considerable leeway in interpreting a statute it is charged with enforcing.\u201d <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>411 Mass. 587, 595 (1992), quoting A.J. Celia, Administrative Law and Practice \u00a7 747 (1986). Regulations properly promulgated by an administrative agency are \u201cnot to be declared void unless their provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Dowell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Transitional Assistance, </em>424 Mass. 610, 613 (1997), quoting <em>Berrios </em>v. <em>Department of Pub.

The generality of these terms renders them susceptible of various rational interpretations regarding whether and how an insurer can take an offset for the payment of an attorney\u2019s fee from an amount due an injured employee. Therefore, these terms are the proper subject of rulemaking by the commissioner. See <em>Biogen IDEC MA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., supra </em>at 188. That said, in light of our conclusion that an award of compensation under \u00a7 36 for specific injuries is not subject to an offset for an attorney\u2019s fee pursuant to \u00a7 13A (10), the definitions of \u201ccash award\u201d and \u201camount payable to the employee within the first month from the date of the voluntary payment, order or decision,\u201d as promulgated by the commissioner, are not in harmony with the legislative mandate. Consequently, these definitions must be deemed void insofar as they encompass compensation for specific injuries pursuant to \u00a7 36.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>The decision of the board, allowing the insurer to withhold up to twenty-two per cent of the employee\u2019s specific compensation award under \u00a7 36 to offset the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fee, is reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The employee\u2019s request for reasonable appellate attorney\u2019s fees and costs is allowed.

Mutual Insurance Company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We note that the definitions of the terms \u201ccash award\u201d and \u201camount payable to the employee within the first month from the date of the voluntary payment, order or decision\u201d include compensation payable to an employee under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A. See 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02 (2008). Section 36A provides, in part, that where \u201can injured employee who has become entitled to compensation under [\u00a7 36] dies before fully collecting the said compensation, the balance remaining shall become due and payable in a lump sum to his dependents.\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36A. The facts of the present case do not involve the death of an injured employee. Therefore, we leave for another day the determination whether the definitions of \u201ccash award\u201d and \u201camount payable to the employee within the first month from the date of the voluntary payment, order or decision,\u201d as set forth in 452 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 1.02, are valid vis-\u00e1-vis \u00a7 36A, or with regard to any other type of nonperiodic payment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">This case need not be remanded for entry of an award in favor of the employee\u2019s estate where, as a consequence of the administrative judge\u2019s decision, the insurer paid the employee the deducted amount of $1,672.61 prior to the employee\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Such attorney\u2019s fees and costs are those associated with the appeals before the Appeals Court and this court. In its decision dated January 4, 2011, the board noted that, in light of its conclusion that the administrative judge erred in ordering the insurer to reimburse the employee, it need not address the only issue that had been raised by the employee in its cross appeal, namely, that the administrative judge erred in failing to award the employee an attorney\u2019s fee under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13 A (5), for prevailing on his claim for reimbursement. This matter has not been raised in the present appeal. Accordingly, it has been waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
