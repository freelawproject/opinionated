Denehy, was convicted of disorderly conduct in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, and assault by means of a dangerous weapon in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B, on May 10, 2011, nearly three years after his initial arraignment on August 21, 2008. On appeal, he makes two primary arguments. First, he contends that he was not afforded a speedy trial under Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (b), as amended, 422 Mass. 1503 (1996), and therefore he is entitled to dismissal of the charges against him with prejudice. Second, he avers that the trial judge\u2019s order of restitution to compensate a police officer whose glasses were damaged during his interaction with the defendant was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000), and its progeny, which require certain factual findings relevant to sentencing to be made by a jury. Further, he contends that, where he was acquitted of assault and battery on a police officer, the restitution award did not have a sufficient nexus to the crimes of which he was convicted. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review to clarify ambiguities regarding the Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 calculus and restitution orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">We conclude that the defendant was denied a speedy trial, and any failures by his trial counsel to perfect that claim constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Although we resolve this matter on those grounds, we further conclude that the trial judge\u2019s determination of a restitution award did not violate <em>Apprendi </em>principles nor ran astray of our \u201ccausal connection\u201d requirement for such awards under <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. 829, 834 (2002). Because the requirements of rule 36 were not met, however, the defendant is entitled to have his convictions vacated and the complaints dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\"><em>Background. </em>On August, 20, 2008, the defendant engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>a confrontation with police officers at his home in Springfield. Officer Timothy Morrow of the Springfield police department entered the defendant\u2019s property on foot through an open gate after pursuing an unregistered, speeding dirt bike, which he then observed to be parked in a shed on the defendant\u2019s property. The officer briefly returned to his vehicle, and when he went back to the property, he found the defendant standing behind a closed gate, accompanied by a Great Dane dog and blocking the officer\u2019s reentry. During the conversation that followed, the defendant refused to permit Officer Morrow to enter his property and allegedly threatened to have his dog attack the officer if he entered. When several other officers arrived at the scene, they informed the defendant that they would enter the property to obtain the dirt bike and instructed him to remove the dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">After opening the gate and entering the property, Officer Morrow was reportedly struck on the head and his glasses were damaged. In response to the confusion that ensued, a second officer sprayed the dog and then the defendant with pepper spray, while a third officer attempted to separate the dog from the defendant. The defendant was then handcuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The next day, on August 21, 2008, the defendant was arraigned and charged with one count each of assault and battery on a police officer (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D), disorderly conduct (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53), and assault by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B). Due to court congestion and requested continuances, the case was continued for more than twenty months. On May 5, 2010, the parties appeared in court for trial, but for the third time the Commonwealth did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>an essential witness present. The defendant moved to dismiss, and the trial judge granted the motion without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">On July 28, 2010, the Commonwealth sought a new complaint with identical charges, and on August 12, 2010, the defendant was arraigned on that complaint. On November 17, 2010, one day prior to the scheduled trial date, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial under Mass. R. Crim. P. 36. The docket sheet indicates that, on the next day, the rule 36 motion was withdrawn, and the case was continued at the defendant\u2019s request. Due to further requested and court-imposed continuances, trial was not held until May 9, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">At trial, a jury found the defendant guilty of disorderly conduct and assault by means of a dangerous weapon, and not guilty of assault and battery on a police officer. The trial judge assessed a one hundred dollar fine on the disorderly conduct conviction and ordered unsupervised probation. In addition, she ordered restitution to be paid to Officer Morrow in the amount of $264, for the replacement of his damaged glasses.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Speedy trial. </em>We turn first to whether the defendant\u2019s rule 36 motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial is properly before us. The defendant argues first that this court should correct or modify the record, in accordance with a motion he filed pursuant to Mass. R. A. P. 8 (e), as amended, 378 Mass. 932 (1979), to deem his motion to dismiss denied rather than withdrawn, and second that his rule 36 motion should be granted because he was denied a speedy trial. The Commonwealth asserts that the defendant\u2019s rule 36 motion was clearly withdrawn and therefore the issue is not preserved on appeal, and that applicable exclusions under rule 36 render the proceedings within the twelve-month period required by the rule. We agree with the Commonwealth that the defendant\u2019s motion must be considered withdrawn, but we conclude that the withdrawal of the motion in the circumstances of this case constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and therefore consider its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">a. <em>Rule 8 (e) motion. </em>Under Mass. R. A. P. 8 (e), if the record does not \u201ctruly disclose[] what occurred in the lower court,\u201d a party may move to correct the record \u201cto conform to the truth.\u201d The day after counsel filed the rule 36 motion, the motion judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>discussed the motion with the parties but did not rule on it. The docket entry from that day indicates that the motion was \u201cwithdrawn.\u201d The defendant argues that the docket entry is an erroneous interpretation of a confusing exchange with the judge at the motion hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Docket entries \u201cimport incontrovertible verity\u201d and \u201cstand as final\u201d unless corrected by the court. <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>246 Mass. 170, 176 (1923). See <em>Barry </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>390 Mass. 285, 285, 289 (1983) (\u201cWhen a claim is raised under rule 36, the docket and minutes of the clerk are prima facie evidence of the facts recorded therein\u201d). In assessing whether a record correction is needed, docket entries may be \u201csupplemented, or even rebutted, by other evidence,\u201d including affidavits. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mattos, </em>404 Mass. 672, 676-677 (1989). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fling, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 232, 237 (2006). However, \u201c[a] party\u2019s self-serving and uncorroborated assertions of what transpired at trial cannot serve as grounds to contend that the official record of the proceedings, prepared by a neutral court official, was falsified.\u201d <em>Zabin </em>v. <em>Picciotto, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 173 (2008). Thus, \u201cabsent a showing that the court has intentionally falsified the record,\u201d the court\u2019s \u201cdetermination is conclusive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172, quoting <em>Burda </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 685, 689 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The only evidence the defendant proffers in support of his argument is an affidavit from trial counsel expressing her intentions and an ambiguous statement in the transcript.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This is insufficient to rebut the prima facie verity of the docket. Trial counsel had ample opportunity during the course of the lower court proceedings to indicate on the record her desire to continue to pursue the motion or to seek correction of the docket entry. Cf. <em>Parks </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 905, 905 (1998) (court declined to consider issue of jury instructions where record did not reflect that appellant had objected and appellant had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>attempted to correct record to reflect sidebar colloquy in which appellant purportedly objected). We therefore deny the defendant\u2019s motion to correct or modify the record and consider the rule 36 motion withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Although the rule 36 issue is technically waived, we assess whether trial counsel\u2019s error in failing to preserve this issue amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel, a claim alluded to in the parties\u2019 briefs. Counsel\u2019s performance is ineffective if \u201cthere has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer,\u201d and counsel\u2019s conduct \u201clikely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Typically, we turn to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim to determine whether the <em>Saferian </em>test is implicated. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>464 Mass. 706, 709 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cardenuto, </em>406 Mass. 450, 454, 456 (1990). Here, as we discuss <em>infra, </em>trial counsel brought a meritorious rale 36 motion claiming that the speedy trial clock had ran. However, trial counsel unreasonably relinquished this claim first by apparently withdrawing the motion, second by failing to attempt to correct the record to the extent it was not her intention to withdraw the motion, and third by failing to raise the claim again at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bourdon, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 420, 429 (2008) (\u201cWhere the solution to the problem is within the control of defense counsel . . . it is reasonable to expect him to proceed diligently to correct it and to impose upon him the primary obligation to inquire into the status of <em>his </em>motions . . .\u201d). Whether these were tactical decisions or simply oversights, they were manifestly unreasonable given the soundness of the speedy trial claim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>455 Mass. 246, 256 (2009) (\u201cA strategic or tactical decision by counsel will not be considered ineffective assistance unless the decision was \u2018manifestly unreasonable\u2019 when made\u201d [citation omitted]). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavoie, </em>464 Mass. 83, 89-90, c<em>ert. </em>denied, 133 S. Ct. 2356 (2013). Contrast <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Borla, </em>460 Mass. 249, 253 (2011) (appellate counsel\u2019s failure to pursue trial counsel\u2019s objection to admissibility of certificate of drug analysis did not constitute ineffective assistance where claim would have been futile).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Further, insofar as the motion was a meritorious one that properly should have resulted in the dismissal of the case, trial counsel\u2019s errors prejudiced the defendant by requiring him to proceed to trial in the first instance. See <em>Saferian, 366 </em>Mass. at 96. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to continue to pursue the rule 36 motion thus constituted ineffective assistance. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Acevedo, </em>446 Mass. 435, 445-447 (2006) (counsel\u2019s failure to request reasonable provocation instruction constituted ineffective assistance because defendant was entitled to instruction, counsel\u2019s decision not to request it was manifestly unreasonable, and it so deprived defendant of \u201csubstantial available defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">b. <em>Speedy trial calculations. </em>Under rule 36, if a defendant is not \u201ctried within twelve months after the return day,\u201d he or she is \u201centitled upon motion to a dismissal of the charges.\u201d Mass. R. Crim. P. 36 (b) (1) (C), (D). A defendant may establish a prima facie violation by demonstrating that more than one year elapsed between the return date, here the date of arraignment, and trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>411 Mass. 503, 504 &amp; n.3 (1992), citing Mass. R. Crim. P. 2 (b) (15), 378 Mass. 844 (1979). The burden then shifts to the Commonwealth to justify the delay. See <em>Spaulding, supra </em>at 504. \u201cThe delay may be excused by a showing that it falls within one of the \u2018[Excluded [pjeriods\u2019 provided in rule 36 (b) (2), or by a showing that the defendant acquiesced in, was responsible for, or benefited from the delay\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (citations omitted). <em>Id. \u201cA </em>failure to object to a continuance or other delay constitutes acquiescence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em>417 Mass. 1, 3 (1994). Further, \u201c[t]he filing of the [rule 36] motion . . . tolls the running of the time in which a defendant must be tried.\u201d <em>Barry, </em>390 Mass. at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>\u201c[W]e are in as good a position as the judge below to decide whether the time limits imposed by the rule have run.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289. Although the record is not entirely clear, we rely on the docket and the clerk\u2019s minutes to establish the relevant dates. <em>Id. </em>Where applicable, these materials may be supplemented by additional evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 89Mattos, 404 Mass. at 676-677; <em>Fling, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">The number of days that elapsed between the date of the defendant\u2019s arraignment, August 21, 2008, and the date on which he filed his rule 36 motion to dismiss, November 17, 2010, is 818 days.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Subtracting twelve months (365 days) from this total leaves 453 days for which the Commonwealth must justify a delay. Of these, 308 days account for continuances attributable to the defendant, by acquiescence or otherwise, and are therefore excludable because of the benefit they afforded him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lauria, </em>411 Mass. 63, 68 (1991) (delays for which \u201cdefendant is at least partially responsible\u201d or through which \u201cdefendant has acquired some benefit\u201d are excluded). The remaining 145 days are disputed and account for three categories of time. We consider each category separately and conclude that the Commonwealth cannot justify fourteen days in excess of the twelve-month limit imposed by rule 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>i. <em>Court-ordered continuances. </em>Two of the continuances contributing to the delay of the defendant\u2019s trial, accounting for 110 days, are attributable to court congestion or lack of available trial judges or jurors.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant argues that these continuances imposed by the court should not be attributable to him and therefore should be counted against the Commonwealth. He asserts that his failure to object to these continuances should not be considered an \u201cacquiescence\u201d because any such objection would have been futile. The Commonwealth argues that these delays should be excluded because the prosecution did not request them and, therefore, the Commonwealth should not be penalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Our precedent firmly establishes that a defendant must object to a continuance to include the resulting delay in a rule 36 calculation. See <em>Spaulding, </em>411 Mass. at 507-508; <em>Lauria, </em>411 Mass. at 68; <em>Barry, </em>390 Mass. at 298; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>369 Mass. 790, 793 (1976). We decline to differentiate for rule 36 purposes between continuances ordered by the court and those requested by the parties.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>410 Mass. 1, 5 (1991), <em>S.C., </em>420 Mass. 508 (1995) (noting that defendant is \u201cat least partially responsible for . . . delay\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>caused by \u201ccourt congestion\u201d if he agrees to continuance). Nor do we wish to penalize unnecessarily the Commonwealth for delays to which it may object as well. See <em>Lauria, </em>411 Mass. at 69; Reporter\u2019s Notes to Rule 36 (b) (2), Mass. Rules of Court, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 237 (West 2013) (\u201c[T]he Commonwealth should not be penalized . . . when the causes for delay are beyond its control\u201d). The defendant must therefore object to the delay to include the delay in the speedy trial calculus. <em>Spaulding, </em>411 Mass. at 505. <em>Barry, </em>390 Mass. at 296-297. Otherwise, he will be deemed to have acquiesced to the delay. See <em>Lauria, </em>411 Mass. at 68. Here, there is no indication that the defendant raised an objection to the court-imposed continuances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, he is deemed to have acquiesced to them, and the 110 resulting days are excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">ii. <em>Period during which defendant was without counsel. </em>The Commonwealth asserts that the brief time period, from October 10, 2008, to October 30, 2008, during which the defendant was unrepresented and sought replacement counsel, should be excluded because the defendant benefited from this delay. We agree with the Commonwealth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marable, </em>427 Mass. 504, 506 (1998) (excluding period during which defendant lacked \u201cpermanent counsel\u201d because his \u201clegal representation was in flux\u201d and he therefore benefited from time \u201cto retain counsel for trial\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judd, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 921, 923-924 (1987) (excluding seven-month period during which \u201cdefendant\u2019s representation was in a state of flux\u201d due to \u201cchanges in counsel\u201d because defendant benefited from delay). Therefore, although this time period is not dispositive, we exclude the twenty-one days during which the defendant was without counsel.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">iii. <em>Period between dismissal and second arraignment. </em>Whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the defendant here was afforded a speedy trial therefore turns on the time period between the dismissal of the first complaint, on May 5, 2010, and the second arraignment on identical charges, on August 12, 2010. The Commonwealth argues that rule 36 (b) (2) (D) requires the period\u2019s exclusion because no charges were pending during this time. The defendant asserts that rule 36 (b) (2) (D) applies only to entry of a nolle prosequi and does not exclude time periods resulting from judicial dismissals. \u201c[W]e are the final arbiter of what the rule means and permits.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durham, </em>446 Mass. 212, 221, cert. denied, 549 U.S. 855 (2006). We agree with the defendant that rule 36 (b) (2) (D) excludes only those time periods following prosecutorial dismissals as defined by Mass. R. Crim. P. 16, 378 Mass. 885 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In interpreting a rule of criminal procedure, we turn first to the rule\u2019s plain language. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanright, </em>465 Mass. 639, 641 (2013). We consider no words to be superfluous. <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85 (1946). \u201c[Wjhere possible, we construe the various provisions of a [rule] in harmony with one another.\u201d <em>Locator Servs. Group, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Treasurer &amp; Receiver Gen., </em>443 Mass. 837, 859 (2005), citing <em>Kargman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>389 Mass. 784, 788 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Rule 36 (b) (2) (D) provides that, \u201c[i]f the complaint or indictment is dismissed by the prosecution and thereafter a charge is filed against the defendant for the same or a related offense, any period of delay from the date the charge was dismissed to the date the time limitation would commence to run as to the subsequent charge\u201d is excluded from the speedy trial calculus. Importantly, that rule employs the phrase, <em>\u201cdismissed by the </em>prosecution\u201d (emphasis added). This explicit reference to Mass. R. Crim. P. 16, \u201cdismissal by the prosecution,\u201d makes clear that the rule excludes only those dismissals defined by mle 16. The reporter\u2019s notes to rule 36 (b) (2) (D) further support this narrow reading. \u201cThis subdivision provides for an excluded period when the prosecution nol presses the charges pending against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>defendant pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 16 and subsequently brings new charges for the same offense.\u201d Reporter\u2019s Notes to Rule 36 (b) (2) (D), Mass. Rules of Court, Rules of Criminal Procedure, at 238 (West 2013). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mottola, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 775, 777 (1980) (relying on reporter\u2019s notes to rule of criminal procedure to facilitate rule\u2019s interpretation). If the rule intended a broader application, it would simply omit the prepositional phrase. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perella, </em>464 Mass. 274, 279-280 (2013) (concluding that use of \u201cindictment or complaint\u201d in some subsections of statute and only \u201cindictment\u201d in others constituted meaningful distinction, in part because words \u201cor complaint\u201d could not be read as superfluous).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Further, we recognize a relevant distinction between a judicial dismissal and an entry of a nolle prosequi. A nolle prosequi is a strategic decision by the Commonwealth to cease pursuing charges. Its entry is thus an affirmative exercise of a prosecutorial tool to discontinue prosecution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pellegrini, </em>414 Mass. 402, 405 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>410 Mass. 498, 500 (1991). In contrast, a judicial dismissal, even one without prejudice, signals that the Commonwealth has not met its prosecutorial burden. \u201c[Wjhere a prosecutor is unprepared to present her case due to the unexpected absence of a witness, a judge has discretion to dismiss the case without prejudice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lucero, </em>450 Mass. 1032, 1033 (2008), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>418 Mass. 37, 38 (1994). The delay that results from the dismissal and subsequent rearraignment is attributable to the Commonwealth. The defendant\u2019s relief from criminal charges is only temporary, and the prolonging of the process is in part due to the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to fulfil its own rule 36 obligations to move the matter along diligently. We cannot permit the Commonwealth to earn itself more time simply by being unprepared.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Here, during the course of the proceedings prior to the judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>dismissal of the case on May 5, 2010, the defendant was prepared for trial on two occasions on which the trial was scheduled,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> but the Commonwealth requested continuances because its witnesses were not present. When the parties appeared for trial on May 5 and a Commonwealth witness again failed to appear, the trial judge dismissed the charges on the defendant\u2019s motion. Unlike an entry of a nolle prosequi in which the Commonwealth actively directs the proceeding, the judge determined that the Commonwealth was unprepared to prosecute the matter and dismissed it.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We conclude that the time period running from the court\u2019s dismissal of the charges against the defendant and his arraignment on the second complaint of identical charges, comprising the ninety-eight days between May 5 and August 12, 2010, is not excludable under rule 36 (b) (2) (D) or any other provision of rule 36. Consequently, these days must count in the speedy trial calculus.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In sum, the Commonwealth has not justified fourteen days of delay,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial under rule 36 was violated. We therefore reverse the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>2. <em>Restitution, </em>a. Apprendi <em>application. </em>Although we decide this case on rule 36 grounds, we address the question of restitution to clarify our case law following decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Southern Union Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>132 S. Ct. 2344 (2012), and <em>Alleyne </em>v. <em>United States, </em>133 S. Ct. 2151 (2013). The defendant asserts that, pursuant to these cases, factual determinations relevant to a restitution order must be made by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence. We agree with the Commonwealth that these cases are not at odds with our approach to restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Under <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, and its progeny, certain factual determinations relevant to sentencing must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court has interpreted this to include any fact that aggravates the punishment, either by raising the floor or the ceiling, such that \u201cthe fact necessarily forms a constituent part of a new offense\u201d or \u201calters the prescribed range of sentences to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S. Ct. at 2160, 2162-2163. Accord <em>Southern Union, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2352; <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490. Once the jury has found the facts needed to establish the statutory sentencing limits, the judge may exercise discretion within this range. See <em>Southern Union, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2353, 2355 (\u201ccourt [may] select a fine from within the maximum authorized by jury-found facts\u201d). In this context, we read the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases to mean that where relevant facts would either identify or shift the legislatively prescribed sentencing parameters that the judge will employ, those facts must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in order to satisfy a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Massachusetts lacks any statutory prescription for imposing restitution as part of sentencing other than a general legislative encouragement to make victims whole. See G. L. c. 258B, \u00a7 3 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>(indicating that restitution should be afforded to victims of crime \u201cto the greatest extent possible\u201d). The power to order restitution in criminal cases \u201cderives from the judge\u2019s power to order conditions of probation under G. L. c. 276, \u00a7\u00a7 87, 87A, and G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 1.\u201d <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. at 833. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rotonda, </em>434 Mass. 211, 221 (2001). The judicial power to order restitution has been described as \u201cunquestionable,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Casanova, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 750, 754 (2006); free of \u201cany [statutory] limitation on a judge\u2019s authority,\u201d <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. at 834; and affording judges \u201csignificant latitude,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rousseau, </em>465 Mass. 372, 389 (2013), in imposing such conditions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">We distinguish restitution from punishments such as imprisonment and criminal fines that are accompanied by statutory prescriptions. Where, as in <em>Southern Union, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2349, a legislature has explicitly tied the calculation of the amount of the criminal fine or penalty to particular facts, a jury determination may be necessary.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, \u201csentencing discretion, informed by judicial factfinding, does not violate the [Sixth] Amendment.\u201d <em>Alleyne, </em>133 S. Ct. at 2163.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Because we treat restitution as an entirely judicially determined penalty, lacking any legislative parameters, the mandate of <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. at 833 (acknowledging <em>Apprendi </em>and classifying restitution as sentenc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>ing determination to be made by judge); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nawn, </em>394 Mass. 1, 8 (1985) (concluding that defendant is not entitled to jury trial regarding restitution). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 236 (2005) (articulating role that <em>Apprendi </em>protections serve in preserving power balance between judge and jury in implementing legislative directions). Where there is no applicable minimum or maximum sentence or penalty, ! there is no <em>Apprendi </em>issue. See <em>Southern Union, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2353 (\u201cNor, a fortiori, could there be an <em>Apprendi </em>violation where no maximum is prescribed\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pfaff, </em>619 F.3d 172, 175 (2d Cir. 2010) (\u201ccriminal restitution [is an] indeterminate scheme[] without [a] statutory maximum[]\u201d). Thus, restitution proceedings as they are currently conducted neither usurp the jury\u2019s fact-finding function nor deteriorate the constitutional protections afforded to criminal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">We now affirm what we stated in <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. at 833; <em>Nawn, </em>394 Mass. at 8, and elsewhere that a judge has the authority to conduct restitution hearings and, in so doing, make factual determinations relevant to the restitution award. As long as the proper procedural mechanisms are employed in the restitution hearing, we see no violation of the Sixth Amendment or art. 12 in this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">b. <em>Nexus requirement. </em>We also take this opportunity to clarify the substantive and procedural requirements for a restitution order.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The defendant argues that there was an insufficient nexus between the restitution order to compensate the police officer for his broken glasses and the underlying crimes with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>which the defendant was charged: assault by means of a dangerous weapon and disorderly conduct. He claims that because he was acquitted of the charge of assault and battery on a police officer, there is no basis for imposing a restitution award for loss to the police officer. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">In <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. at 835, we held that there must be a causal connection between an order of restitution and the defendant\u2019s conduct. We adopted Florida\u2019s approach, laid out in <em>Glaubius </em>v. <em>State, </em>688 So. 2d 913, 915 (Fla. 1997), and concluded that \u201cthe scope of restitution is limited to \u2018loss or damage [that] is causally connected to the offense and bears a significant relationship to the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>McIntyre, supra, </em>quoting <em>Glaubius, supra. </em>This is a broad test that requires a holistic assessment of the facts surrounding the crime, not merely those facts establishing the elements of the crime. See <em>McIntyre, supra, </em>quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Landrum, </em>66 Wash. App. 791, 799 (1992) (\u201c[W]e look to the underlying facts of the charged offense, not the name of the crime [of which the defendant was convicted, or] to which the defendant entered a plea\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\"><em>McIntyre </em>aptly illustrates the analysis we employ when, as here, a defendant asserts that a restitution award does not bear a sufficient relationship to the crime for which he is convicted. During an altercation, the defendant in <em>McIntyre </em>stabbed the victim, ordered his dog to attack the victim, and kicked the door and fender of the victim\u2019s vehicle. <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. at 830. The defendant was convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 831. As a condition of the probation to which the defendant was sentenced, the judge ordered restitution of $168 for damage to the victim\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>The defendant argued that this restitution order was improper because he had not been charged with malicious destruction of property. <em>Id. </em>We concluded, however, that \u201c[t]he causal relationship between the criminal episode and the damage to the vehicle\u201d met the nexus requirement because \u201cthe damage to the victim\u2019s car occurred during the course of an ongoing assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The Appeals Court similarly employed this analysis to uphold a restitution order in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmer P., </em>61 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>App. Ct. 230, 232 (2004). There, a juvenile was convicted of breaking and entering during the daytime with intent to commit a felony, but was acquitted on a larceny charge. <em>Id. </em>at 230. At sentencing, the judge ordered $1,000 in restitution to compensate the victim, from whose apartment several items totaling $1,000 in,value were taken. <em>Id. </em>at 231. The Appeals Court noted that, under <em>McIntyre, </em>a restitution order is proper \u201cwhere the judge limit[s] restitution to the documented property damage bearing a significant causal relationship to the crime charged.\u201d <em>Palmer P., supra </em>at 232, citing <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. at 835-836. It thus determined that the restitution order was appropriate because \u201cthe judge could . . . conclude that the personalty was taken from the home during the course of [the] endeavor\u201d of breaking and entering the victim\u2019s apartment. <em>Palmer P., supra </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">We would reach a similar conclusion here. The record reflects that during the commotion of the events on August 20, 2008, Officer Morrow\u2019s glasses were damaged. The criminal charges of which the defendant was convicted, disorderly conduct and assault by means of a dangerous weapon, arose out of that commotion. We deem this a sufficient nexus to order restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">c. <em>Evidentiary requirements. </em>Our case law has established an evidentiary standard that we expect trial judges to employ in determining restitution awards. Although a restitution hearing need not be overly formal, it must afford certain guarantees, including an opportunity for the defendant to cross-examine witnesses and present rebuttal evidence. <em>Nawn, </em>394 Mass. at 7-8. The Commonwealth bears the burden of proving both a causal connection and the amount of the loss by a preponderance of the evidence. See <em>id.; Casanova, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. at 755. A \u201cunilateral statement\u201d from the victim or, as here, from the assistant district attorney about the amount owed may be insufficient to meet this burden. <em>Nawn, supra </em>at 7, citing <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Wofford, </em>472 F.2d 822, 827 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">Although we need not assess the adequacy of the restitution hearing proceedings here, we note that the evidentiary support for the award is questionable. The judge ordered a payment of $264 in restitution to Officer Morrow for replacement glasses. The Commonwealth presented no evidence at sentencing regarding the replacement cost, nor was this amount established at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>trial. We emphasize now that \u201c[i]f the record reveals an arbitrary method of determining the amount of restitution, the order cannot stand.\u201d <em>Nawn, </em>394 Mass. at 7. Restitution may be ordered only for those economic losses adequately documented by the victim and established by the Commonwealth. <em>McIntyre, </em>436 Mass. at 834. <em>Rotonda, </em>434 Mass. at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>For the reasons stated above, the judgments of conviction are reversed and the verdicts are set aside. An order is to enter allowing the motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Attorney General.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Because we dispose of the case on this ground, we do not address the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>assault by means of a dangerous weapon, including his claim that he was prejudiced by the erroneous admission of \u201cexpert\u201d testimony and a past recollection recorded from the responding police officer. We also need not address the defendant\u2019s contention that he was entitled to a jury instruction regarding his right under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights to exclude others from his property. However, we emphasize that self-help is not available to a citizen who feels that a police officer\u2019s entry onto his property is unwarranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moreira, </em>388 Mass. 596, 601 (1983) (\u201c|I]n the absence of excessive or unnecessary force by an arresting officer, a person may not use force to resist an arrest by one who he knows or has good reason to believe is an authorized police officer, engaged in the performance of his duties, regardless of whether the arrest was unlawful in the circumstances\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\">At the November 18, 2010, hearing, after the judge had conducted a brief colloquy on the motion filed pursuant to Mass.

Even if the objection is futile, where short staffing in the court renders a continuance essentially nondiscretionary, the defendant nonetheless carries the duty of reminding the court of the rule 36 implications of continuing the proceedings. See <em>Barry, </em>390 Mass. at 296-297.
