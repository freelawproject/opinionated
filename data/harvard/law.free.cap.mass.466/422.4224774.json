After the defendant\u2019s conviction was final, we decided <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>460 Mass. 30, 34, 37, 45 (2011) <em>(Clarke), </em>which held that the rule announced in <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 366, 373-374 (2010) <em>(Padilla), </em>regarding a criminal defendant\u2019s right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to accurate advice as to the deportation consequences of a guilty plea, was not a \u201cnew\u201d rule under <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 301, 310 (1989) <em>(Teague), </em>and therefore applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial seeking to vacate his guilty plea on the ground that his attorney was constitutionally deficient in erroneously advising him that there would be no deportation consequences stemming from his guilty plea. The defendant\u2019s motion was denied, and he timely appealed. While the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Chaidez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>133 S. Ct. 1103, 1105, 1111 (2013) <em>(Chaidez), </em>which held that <em>Padilla </em>did announce a \u201cnew\u201d rule under <em>Teague </em>and, thus, does not apply retroactively to collateral challenges under Federal law. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review to consider whether we should continue to give <em>Padilla </em>retroactive effect in light of <em>Chaidez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">We conclude, as a matter of Massachusetts law and consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>with our authority as provided in <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>552 U.S. 264, 282 (2008) <em>(Danforth), </em>that the Sixth Amendment right enunciated in <em>Padilla </em>was not a \u201cnew\u201d rule and, consequently, defendants whose State law convictions were final after April 1, 1997, may attack their convictions collaterally on <em>Padilla </em>grounds. We thus affirm our decision in <em>Clarke. </em>We further conclude that under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, defense counsel has a duty to provide noncitizen defendants with accurate advice regarding the deportation consequences of pleading guilty or being convicted at trial and that this right also applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Having decided that the defendant may seek relief under the Sixth Amendment and art. 12, we conclude that although the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s erroneous advice may have been constitutionally inadequate, without additional findings we are unable to determine whether the defendant was sufficiently prejudiced to warrant vacating his guilty plea and ordering a new trial. Consequently, we remand the case to the Boston Municipal Court judge for further findings and proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\"><em>Background. </em>The material facts are not in dispute. On the morning of April 15, 2007, a Boston police officer patrolling along Blue Hill Avenue in the Dorchester section of Boston witnessed the defendant engaging in a sexual act with a prostitute. As the officer approached, the defendant removed several small plastic baggies from his coat pocket and placed them in his mouth. Believing that the baggies contained \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine and fearing that the defendant might overdose, the officer attempted to intercede. Although the defendant ingested the drugs, a subsequent search of his jacket revealed an additional baggie of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. The incident took place within 1,000 feet of a child care center.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Following his arrest, the defendant was charged with one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>count of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (a); and one count of a drug violation in a school zone, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 321. The latter charge carried a minimum mandatory sentence of two years\u2019 imprisonment. In exchange for the dismissal of the school zone and distribution related charges, the defendant pleaded guilty to simple possession of cocaine, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34, and was sentenced to eleven months in a house of correction suspended for two years. The defendant\u2019s conviction became final on October 2, 2007.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In January, 2012, the defendant filed a motion to vacate his guilty plea pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). Citing <em>Padilla, supra, </em>and <em>Clarke, supra, </em>the defendant contended that, as a noncitizen, \u201che was denied effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to advise him of the immigration consequences that could result from his guilty plea\u201d and, therefore, the \u201cplea was obtained in violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">In support of his motion, the defendant submitted an affidavit of his counsel averring that, \u201cAt the time I represented [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>defendant], I was aware that he was not a citizen of the United States [and] I advised [the defendant] . . . that this disposition was not likely to result in his deportation because it was a conviction for straight [possession with a sentence of under a year.\u201d The defendant also filed his own affidavit stating that, but for his counsel\u2019s erroneous advice, \u201cI would not have agreed to plead guilty to something that would surely result in my deportation.\u201d The motion judge denied, without written findings, both the defendant\u2019s motion to vacate and his subsequent motion for reconsideration. The defendant appealed, and during the pendency of the appeal, the Supreme Court decided <em>Chaidez. </em>The defendant then filed an application for direct appellate review, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendant urges us to continue to apply <em>Padilla </em>retroactively, despite the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chaidez. </em>In particular, he contends that <em>Danforth, supra </em>at 282, allows us to continue to apply the retroactivity framework from <em>Teague, supra, </em>but nevertheless reach a divergent conclusion from <em>Chaidez. </em>Specifically, he asserts that despite the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Chaidez </em>that <em>Padilla </em>announced a \u201cnew\u201d rule, we are free to arrive at the opposite conclusion as a matter of State law and, by doing so, provide greater protection for defendants challenging their convictions on collateral review. Alternatively, the defendant urges us to recognize a remedy under art. 12 that parallels the Sixth Amendment right enunciated in Padilla,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The Commonwealth responds by construing the defendant\u2019s argument about the retroactivity of the Sixth Amendment right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>in <em>Padilla </em>as attempting to discard our State law version of the <em>Teague </em>framework and replace it with an undefined alternative. Although the Commonwealth acknowledges our authority to depart from the Supreme Court on this issue based on its decision in <em>Danforth, </em>the Commonwealth maintains that doing so ignores that prior to <em>Padilla, </em>criminal defense attorneys had no obligation to advise their clients of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. The Commonwealth further contends that there is no basis for interpreting art. 12 as providing a right to accurate advice from counsel regarding the deportation consequences of a guilty plea that would apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">1. <em>Retroactivity, </em>a. <em>Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel following </em>Padilla. In <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 374, the United States Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment requires a criminal defense attorney to provide accurate advice regarding the deportation consequences arising from a guilty plea. According to the Court, failure to provide such advice is a \u201cconstitutional deficiency\u201d that satisfies the first prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, 466 </em>U.S. 668 (1984) <em>(Strickland).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> Padilla, supra </em>at 369. The Court did not explicitly state whether <em>Padilla </em>would apply retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Thereafter, in <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 45, we were required to confront whether the Federal constitutional right recognized in <em>Padilla </em>applied retroactively to criminal convictions that were final at the time <em>Padilla </em>was decided. In our decision, we relied on the analytical framework set forth in <em>Teague, supra </em>at 310, which we adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>407 Mass. 296, 300-301 (1990) <em>(Bray). </em>Under <em>Teague </em>and its progeny, although \u201cnew constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u201cold rule[s] appl[y] both on direct and collateral review.\u201d <em>Whorton </em>v. <em>Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007).* *<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As this framework suggests, the determination whether a case announces a \u201cnew\u201d rule is at the heart of the retroactivity analysis. According to the Supreme Court in <em>Teague, supra </em>at 301, \u201ca case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government [or] if the result was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final\u201d (emphasis in original). Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court have opined that a rule is \u201cdictated by precedent\u201d if the result was \u201capparent to <em>all </em>reasonable jurists\u201d at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final (emphasis added). <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1107, quoting <em>Lambrix </em>v. <em>Singletary, </em>520 U.S. 518, 527-528 (1997). Thus, a case announces a \u201cnew\u201d rule if the result was <em>not </em>apparent to all reasonable jurists at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final. See, e.g., <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>506 U.S. 461, <em>477 </em>(1993) (\u201cdeterminative question is whether reasonable jurists reading the case law that existed in 1984 could have concluded that [defendant\u2019s] sentencing was <em>not </em>constitutionally infirm\u201d [emphasis in original]); <em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 304 (1992) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (\u201cnew rule inquiry [asks] whether \u2018reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>jurists\u2019 could disagree as to whether a result is dictated by precedent\u201d); <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>497 U.S. 227, 234 (1990) <em>(\u201cTeague </em>serves to ensure that gradual developments in law over which reasonable jurists may disagree are not later used to upset finality of [Sjtate convictions valid when entered\u201d); <em>Butler </em>v. <em>McKellar, </em>494 U.S. 407, 415 (1990) (constitutional rule that is \u201csusceptible to debate among reasonable minds\u201d qualifies as new rale).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In <em>Clarke, </em>we concluded that \u201c[tjhere is no question that the holding in <em>Padilla </em>is an extension of the rule in <em>Strickland, </em>\u201d <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 37, and that <em>Padilla </em>is the \u201cdefinitive application of an established constitutional standard on a case-by-case basis, incorporating evolving professional norms[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] (on which the standard relies) to new facts.\u201d <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 43. This determination reflected our recognition that the standard for measuring ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland </em>is one of general applicability, designed to evaluate the reasonableness of an attorney\u2019s acts or omissions in a multitude of factual contexts. <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 36, 38-39, 43. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 390-391 (2000). Because application of such a general standard to a particular factual scenario rarely produces a new rule, <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 36, quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 308-309 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring), we concluded that <em>Padilla </em>did <em>not </em>announce a new rule and, thus, that the Sixth Amendment right enunciated in <em>Padilla </em>applied retroactively to cases on collateral review under the <em>Teague </em>framework.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Our decision in <em>Clarke </em>was soon cast into doubt by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chaidez.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em>,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The Supreme Court\u2019s decision began by acknowledging, as we did in <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 36, 38-39, 43, that \u201c \u2018where the beginning point\u2019 of our analysis is a rule of \u2018general application, a rule designed for the specific purpose of evaluating a myriad of factual contexts, it will be the infrequent case that yields a result so novel that it forges a new rule, one not dictated by precedent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1107, quoting <em>Wright </em>v. <em>West, supra </em>at 309 (Kennedy, J., concurring). For this reason, the Court conceded that \u201cgarden-variety applications of the test in <em>[Strickland] </em>for assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel do not produce new rules.\u201d <em>Chaidez, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">However, according to the Court, <em>Padilla </em>\u201cdid something more\u201d than \u201cmerely [make] clear that a lawyer who neglects to inform a client about the risk of deportation is professionally incompetent.\u201d <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1108. Specifically, <em>Padilla </em>considered the unsettled preliminary question whether \u201cadvice about deportation [was] \u2018categorically removed\u2019 from the scope of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel because it involved only a \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of a conviction, rather than a component of the criminal sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Chaidez, supra, </em>quoting <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1482. According to the Court, prior to <em>Padilla, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>the State and lower Federal courts had \u201calmost unanimously concluded that the Sixth Amendment does not require attorneys to inform their clients of a conviction\u2019s collateral consequences, including deportation.\u201d <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1109. See <em>id. </em>at 1109 nn.7-8 (collecting cases).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, the Court reasoned that insofar as <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 366, concluded that \u201cadvice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel,\u201d the decision altered the law of most jurisdictions and, therefore, represented a \u201cnew\u201d rule under <em>Teague. Chaidez, supra </em>at 1110-1111. Accordingly, <em>Padilla </em>did not apply retroactively, a conclusion that is plainly at odds with our decision in <em>Clarice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The decision in <em>Chaidez </em>was not unanimous. Justice Soto-mayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joined, penned a dissenting opinion that took an entirely different view of the interrelationship between the <em>Strickland </em>standard and the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla, </em>one more akin to our reasoning in <em>Clarke. </em>The dissent began by pointing out that \u201cthe proper measure of attorney performance remains simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1114 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 688. Moreover, the reasonableness prong \u201ctakes its content from the standards by which lawyers judge their professional obligations . . . and those standards are subject to change.\u201d <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1114 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting), citing <em>Strickland, supra. </em>For this reason, in <em>Padilla, </em>the Court\u2019s application of <em>Strickland </em>\u201cfollowed naturally\u201d from the \u201cchanges in immigration law and the accompanying evolution of professional norms\u201d over the previous fifteen years. <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1116 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>According to the dissent, <em>Padilla </em>reached the result that it did \u201cbecause those norms reflected changes in immigration law . . . , not because the Sixth Amendment right had changed at all.\u201d <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1117 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). Thus, in the same way that we concluded in <em>Clarke, supra, </em>that application of a general standard designed to apply to varying factual scenarios does not engender a new legal rule, the dissent in <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1115, agreed that \u201cwhere we merely apply <em>Strickland </em>in a way that corresponds to an evolution in professional norms, we make no new law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AMC\">b. <em>Application of </em>Padilla <em>in Massachusetts following </em>Chaidez. In <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 45, our analysis was concerned solely with the question whether, in the absence of Supreme Court guidance, the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel, as explicated in <em>Padilla, </em>applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. We did not consider whether the right to the effective assistance of counsel under art. 12 also included the right to accurate advice from counsel concerning the deportation consequences of pleading guilty, or whether such a right might apply retroactively. Because the defendant raises claims under both the Sixth Amendment and art. 12, we address both avenues of potential relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">i. <em>Retroactivity of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel under Massachusetts law. </em>Given that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Chaidez </em>is plainly at odds with our decision in <em>Clarke, </em>the question is whether we may give broader retroactive effect to <em>Padilla </em>as a matter of State law than it would otherwise enjoy under Federal law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude that we may.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">As discussed above, the Supreme Court\u2019s test for retroactivity is set forth in <em>Teague, supra </em>at 307, and its progeny.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Teague </em>analysis is based on two primary policy considerations: comity and finality.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Danforth, supra </em>at 279-280; <em>Teague, supra </em>at 306. The benefit of <em>Teague </em>is that it provides a \u201cbright line rule on the issue of when relief is to be retroactive.\u201d <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>State, </em>761 N.W.2d 493, 499 (Minn. 2009). In view of our concern that the finality of convictions not be unduly disturbed and our desire to have a clearly defined retroactivity standard, we adopted the <em>Teague </em>framework in <em>Bray, supra </em>at 300-301. Under the <em>Teague-Bray </em>framework, we first determine whether a rule is \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cold.\u201d See <em>Teague, supra </em>at 301; <em>Bray, supra. </em>If a rule is \u201cnew,\u201d it applies only to defendants whose cases are not final unless two narrow exceptions apply;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> if a rule is \u201cold,\u201d it also applies retroactively to defendants whose cases were final at the time the rule was announced. <em>Whorton </em>v. <em>Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 416 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Although we consider the retroactivity framework established in <em>Teague </em>to be sound in principle, the Supreme Court\u2019s post<em>Teague </em>expansion of what qualifies as a \u201cnew\u201d rule has become so broad that \u201cdecisions defining a constitutional safeguard rarely merit application on collateral review.\u201d <em>Colwell </em>v. <em>State, </em>118 Nev. 807, 818, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 981 (2003). As discussed above, according to the original formulation discussed in <em>Teague, supra </em>at 301, \u201ca case announcefd] a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent\u201d at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final. In its subsequent jurisprudence, however, the Supreme Court has greatly expanded the meaning of what is \u201cnew\u201d to include results not \u201capparent to all reasonable jurists\u201d at the time. <em>Lambrix </em>v. <em>Singletary, </em>520 U.S. 518, 527-528 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Although we adopted the <em>Teague </em>retroactivity framework in <em>Bray, supra, </em>including the Court\u2019s original construction of what constitutes a \u201cnew\u201d rule, we have not specifically considered whether we ought to incorporate the Supreme Court\u2019s broadened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>formulation of that test into our own definition of what constitutes a \u201cnew\u201d rule under <em>Bray. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>460 Mass. 238, 247-248 (2011) (declining to consider whether, as matter of State law, broader retroactive effect may be given to Federal constitutional rule and instead deciding that <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 311 [2009], announced new rule based on Federal retroactivity standard set forth in <em>Teague </em>and its progeny). We conclude that we should not adopt this expansion. Rather, we continue to adhere to the Supreme Court\u2019s original construction that a case announces a \u201cnew\u201d rule only when the result is \u201cnot dictated by precedent.\u201d Our ability to adopt this narrower interpretation, and thereby expand the availability of remedies for violations of Federal constitutional rights, is specifically permitted by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Danforth.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In <em>Danforth, supra </em>at 266, the Supreme Court considered whether the retroactivity analysis of <em>Teague </em>\u201cconstrains the authority of [S]tate courts to give broader effect to new rules of criminal procedure than is required by that opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Drawing on the \u201cgeneral principle that States are independent sovereigns with plenary authority to make and enforce their own laws as long as they do not infringe on the [F]ederal constitutional guarantees,\u201d <em>Danforth, supra </em>at 280, the Court concluded that \u201cconsiderations of comity militate in favor of allowing [S]tate courts to grant [collateral] relief to a broader class of individuals than is required by <em>Teague.\u201d Id. </em>at 279-280. According to the Court, the \u201cfinality of [S]tate convictions ... is a matter that States should be free to evaluate, and weigh the importance of, when prisoners held in [S]tate custody are seeking a remedy for a violation of [F]ederal rights by their lower courts.\u201d <em>Danforth, supra </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">In this manner, the Court drew an important distinction between the existence of a Federal substantive right or remedy, the contours of which are fixed by Federal law, and the procedural availability of such a right, the scope of which may be set by State law. See <em>Danforth, supra </em>(\u201cAny State could surely have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>adopted the rule of evidence defined in <em>Crawford </em>[v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36 (2004),] under [SJtate law even if that case had never been decided. It should be equally free to give its citizens the benefit of our rule in any fashion that does not offend [Fjederal law\u201d); <em>id </em>at 289 (\u201cStates that give broader retroactive effect to this Court\u2019s new rules of criminal procedure do not do so by misconstruing the [Fjederal <em>Teague </em>standard. Rather they have developed <em>[SJtate </em>law to govern retroactivity in [SJtate postconviction proceedings\u201d). The Supreme Court concluded that <em>Teague </em>does not \u201climit the authority of a [SJtate court, when reviewing its own [SJtate criminal convictions, to provide a remedy for a violation that is deemed \u2018nonretroactive\u2019 under <em>Teague.\u201d Danforth, supra </em>at 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">As it pertains here, <em>Chaidez </em>concluded that <em>Padilla </em>announced a \u201cnew\u201d rule under <em>Teague. </em>However, based on our authority to conduct an independent review, \u201c[we] are not required to blindly follow that court\u2019s view of what constitutes a new rule.\u201d <em>Rhoades </em>v. <em>State, </em>149 Idaho 130, 139 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 1571 (2011). Instead, we reserve our prerogative to define and determine within the <em>Bray </em>framework whether a rule is \u201cnew.\u201d The Supreme Courts of other States have come to the same conclusion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smart, </em>202 R3d 1130, 1138-1140 (Alaska 2009); <em>Rhoades </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra; <em>Danforth </em>v. <em>State, supra </em>at 500; <em>Colwell </em>v. <em>State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">We conclude that <em>Padilla </em>did not announce a \u201cnew\u201d rule for the purposes of our retroactivity test under <em>Bray. </em>Our opinion is informed in part by our continued adherence to our analysis in <em>Clarke </em>and Justice Sotomayor\u2019s dissent in <em>Chaidez. </em>In brief, <em>Padilla </em>did not announce a \u201cnew\u201d rule for the simple reason that it applied a general standard \u2014 designed to change according to the evolution of existing professional norms \u2014 to a specific factual situation. See <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 36, 38-39, 43; <em>Chaidez, supra </em>at 1114-1116 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). We also are not persuaded that Massachusetts precedent at the time <em>Padilla </em>was decided would have dictated an outcome contrary to that in <em>Padilla. </em>Indeed, long before <em>Padilla </em>was decided, it was customary for practitioners in Massachusetts to warn their clients of the possible deportation consequences of pleading guilty. See <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 43 n.15. See also <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Because we conclude that under our State retroactivity analysis <em>Padilla </em>did not announce a \u201cnew\u201d rule, the defendant, whose conviction was final at the time <em>Padilla </em>was decided, is entitled to seek relief under the Sixth Amendment right recognized in <em>Padilla.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">ii. <em>Article 12. </em>The defendant also contends that his attorney\u2019s erroneous advice constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under art. 12. We have not <em>expressly </em>stated that art. 12 demands that defense counsel provide defendants with accurate advice concerning the deportation consequences of a guilty plea or conviction at trial. That such a right exists, however, is implicit in our recent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marinho, </em>464 Mass. 115 (2013) <em>(Marinho).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In <em>Marinho, supra </em>at 122, we considered whether defense counsel\u2019s failure accurately to advise the defendant of the potential immigration consequences of a <em>conviction at trial </em>constituted ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and art. 12. In light of <em>Padilla\u2019s </em>broad language and the prevailing \u201cexpectation[s] in the Massachusetts legal community,\u201d we concluded that \u201cdefense counsel [has] a duty to inform a noncitizen client that conviction, whether by plea or by trial, may carry adverse immigration consequences.\u201d <em>Marinho, supra </em>at 125. We further determined that failure to provide such advice constitutes behavior that falls \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Marinho, supra </em>at 126, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974) <em>(Saferian).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Although the defendant in <em>Marinho </em>framed his argument in terms of the guarantees of the Sixth Amendment and art. 12, our decision did not make clear whether the holding was based solely on a defendant\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment, or also based on our interpretation of the defendant\u2019s rights under art. 12. We take the opportunity today to clarify that under art. 12 defense counsel must accurately advise a noncitizen client of the deportation consequences of a guilty plea or a conviction at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">For the same reasons that we determined that the Sixth Amendment right enunciated in <em>Padilla </em>was not a \u201cnew\u201d rule, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s coextensive right under art. 12 does not constitute a \u201cnew\u201d rule. Like <em>Strickland, supra </em>at 688, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>our standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Saferian, supra </em>at 96, is a dynamic standard that evolves according to the advancement of professional norms. As we stated in <em>Marinho, supra </em>at 125, according to these norms, \u201cthe expectation in the Massachusetts legal community is that defense counsel should inform a client about immigration consequences associated with criminal conviction, however imposed.\u201d See Committee for Public Counsel Services, Assigned Counsel Manual Part IV, at 15 (rev. June 2011) (\u201cCounsel must also advise the client ... of the consequences of a conviction, including . . . deportation\u201d); <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 43 n.15 (\u201csince 1988, ... all staff attorneys and bar advocates in Massachusetts [have been required] to advise a defendant client of the immigration consequences of his or her criminal case\u201d). See also <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 1485 (for \u201cat least the past 15 years, professional norms have generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the deportation consequences of a client\u2019s plea\u201d). Finally, given the magnitude of the consequence to noncitizen defendants who plead guilty or are convicted at trial, tenets of fundamental fairness require that this right apply retroactively. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Amirault, </em>424 Mass. 618, 639 (1997). Significantly, had we been presented with this issue at the time <em>Padilla </em>was decided, our conclusion that art. 12 provides such protection would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">For these reasons, the defendant is entitled to assert his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel under art. 12 on collateral review.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>We now proceed to the merits of the defendant\u2019s appeal. In order prevail on his claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant bears the burden of showing that (1) there has been \u201cbehavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer\u201d and (2) that \u201cit has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Saferian, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">According to the defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s affidavit, \u201cI advised [the defendant] . . . that this disposition was not likely to result in his deportation because it was a conviction for straight [p] ossession with a sentence of under a year.\u201d That advice was plainly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>incorrect. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2006), \u201c[a]ny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of . . . any law or regulation of a State, . . . relating to a controlled substance . . . other than a single offense involving possession for one\u2019s own use of [thirty] grams or less of marijuana, is deportable.\u201d The defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine (a class B substance) and, thus, was subject to deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). On its face, then, defense counsel\u2019s affidavit is sufficient to establish that he failed to provide the defendant with accurate advice concerning the deportation consequences of pleading guilty in violation of <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 369, thus satisfying the first prong of <em>Saferian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">We are left to consider whether this deficient representation sufficiently prejudiced the defendant so as to justify vacating the defendant\u2019s guilty plea and ordering a new trial. \u201cIn the context of a guilty plea, in order to satisfy the \u2018prejudice\u2019 requirement, the defendant has the burden of establishing that (1) \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial,\u2019 \u201d <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 47, quoting <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985); and (2) that \u201ca decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Clarke, supra, </em>quoting <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 372. In this regard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">\u201cthe defendant bears the substantial burden of showing that (1) he had an \u2018available, substantial ground of defence,\u2019 . . . that would have been pursued if he had been correctly advised of the dire immigration consequences attendant to accepting the plea bargain; (2) there is a reasonable probability that a different plea bargain (absent such consequences) could have been negotiated at the time; or (3) the presence of \u2018special circumstances\u2019 that support the conclusion that he placed, or would have placed, particular emphasis on immigration consequences in deciding whether to plead guilty.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-8\"><em>Clarke, supra </em>at 47-48. With this requirement in mind, we turn to the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">According to the defendant\u2019s affidavit submitted in support of his motion for new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u201cWhen it came time to decide to go to trial or plead guilty, I remember being particularly wary of pleading guilty because I had previously been placed in removal proceedings for a drug offense. ... I expressed my desire not to plead guilty to anything else that could make me deportable to my lawyer at the time .... [My attorney] told me that by keeping my sentence to under one year, I would avoid immigration consequences and would not be deportable. . . . Had I known then . . . that a conviction for possession of a class B substance is a deportable offense, regardless of the length of the sentence imposed, I would not have agreed to plead guilty to something that would surely result in my deportation . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Although the defendant\u2019s affidavit is highly suggestive that he would have elected to go to trial but for his attorney\u2019s erroneous advice, we do not have the benefit of any findings or credibility assessments made by the motion judge. Without the benefit of such findings, it is not possible for us to say with any certainty whether the defendant\u2019s affidavit is merely self-serving or whether he was sufficiently prejudiced to justify vacating his guilty plea and ordering a new trial. See <em>Saferian, supra </em>at 96 (\u201cwhatever the attempted formulation of a standard in general terms, what is required in the actual process of decision of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel ... is a discerning examination and appraisal of the specific circumstances of the given case\u201d). For this reason, we remand the case to the Boston Municipal Court with instructions to provide findings relating to the issue of prejudice and, if necessary, to hold an additional evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for new trial for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">We acknowledge the amicus briefs of Massachusetts Legal Academics; National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, Boston College Post-Deportation Human Rights Project, Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, and Political Asylum/Immigration Representation Project; and David M.

R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), such claims for relief should be treated as direct review, making retroactivity analysis inapplicable. We reject this argument. Finally, the defendant contends that the case of <em>Chaidez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>133 S. Ct. 1103 (2013) <em>(Chaidez) </em>\u201cdid not erode the retroactive application of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right not to be affirmatively misadvised regarding the immigration consequences of his conviction.\u201d Because the Supreme Court in <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 370, declined to distinguish \u201cbetween an act of commission and an act of omission,\u201d we also decline to draw a distinction between affirmative misadvice and a failure to advise for the purposes of the ineffective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and art. 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>sarily satisfies the <em>Strickland </em>standard. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>394 Mass. 251, 256 n.3 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\">To prove ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984) (Strickland), the defendant must make a two-part showing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">\u201cFirst, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient [which] requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.
