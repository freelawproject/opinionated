L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12. A judge in the Superior Court allowed a motion for the defendant\u2019s counsel to be present during interviews conducted by qualified examin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ers pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13 (a) (\u00a7 13 [a]).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of the two qualified examiners refused to conduct the interview with counsel in the room and submitted to the court her qualified examiner report based on her review of the defendant\u2019s records only. The questions we consider in this case are whether the \u201cexamination\u201d that a qualified examiner must undertake under \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>as the first step of a sexually dangerous person commitment process must include a personal interview of the defendant in accordance with the terms of a court order permitting his counsel to be present; and, if so, what consequences flow from the failure of the qualified examiner to conduct such an interview. We conclude that a personal interview is generally a required component of a \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>examination, regardless of whether counsel is present. Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition was not warranted as a remedy for the refusal of one of the qualified examiners to conduct the interview with counsel in attendance, where the other qualified examiner personally interviewed the defendant as part of his \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>examination and filed with the court a report expressing the opinion that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person. On remand, however, the Commonwealth may not use at trial the report or testimony of the qualified examiner who refused to interview the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In 1988, a jury found the defendant guilty of indecent assault and battery of a victim under the age of fourteen in violation of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, after a six year old boy reported that the defendant had assaulted him in a locker room in Melrose. The Appeals Court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28. While serving a sentence on the 1988 conviction, the defendant escaped from prison and fled to Maine, where he subsequently was convicted of several sexual offenses. In 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>after serving his Maine sentences, the defendant was transferred back to Massachusetts to complete his sentence on the 1988 conviction and to serve a sentence for escape, G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">In July, 2011, before the defendant completed his sentences in Massachusetts, the Commonwealth filed a petition to commit him as a sexually dangerous person under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>On October 6, 2011, a judge of the Superior Court found probable cause to believe the defendant was a sexually dangerous person, and the defendant was committed to the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center) for sixty days for examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners pursuant to \u00a7 13 <em>(a). </em>Before any personal interviews with the qualified examiners occurred, the defendant filed a motion for an order authorizing the defendant\u2019s counsel to be present for the interviews, as well as for audio and audio-visual recording of them. The judge allowed the order by agreement \u201cas to the presence of counsel at the evaluation,\u201d and the defendant withdrew the request for audio or audio-visual recording.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Thereafter, one of the qualified examiners interviewed the defendant with counsel present for the entire interview. However, when the second qualified examiner met with the defendant to conduct a personal interview, she refused to proceed with the interview while counsel was in the room, and the interview did not take place. On November 14, 2011, both qualified examiners filed with the court their reports opining that the defendant was a sexually dangerous person. The report of the second qualified examiner stated that it was based solely on information from records that were made available to her at the treatment center, as well as a record package prepared by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On November 18, the Commonwealth petitioned for trial pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 (a), a date within sixty days of the defendant\u2019s commitment to the treatment center.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">On December 14,2011, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Commonwealth\u2019s petition on the ground that because one of the qualified examiners did not interview the defendant, the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of filing within forty-five days of the judge\u2019s probable cause finding two qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>examiner reports meeting the requirement of \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>that they be based on an \u201cexamination.\u201d A different Superior Court judge (motion judge) allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>requires a personal interview where the person named in the petition does not refuse to be interviewed and, because the Commonwealth had not filed two qualified examiner reports that were compliant with \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>within the strict deadlines set forth in that section, dismissal was required. The Commonwealth appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. The defendant\u2019s release was stayed pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>In reviewing a motion to dismiss a G. L. c. 123A petition, we examine whether the motion judge abused his discretion or committed other legal error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Gagnon, 439 Mass. 826, 830 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The commitment and release of sexually dangerous persons is governed by G. L. c. 123A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This court has recognized that a personal interview need not occur under \u00a7 13 (a) where a defendant refuses to speak to a qualified examiner in connection with the commitment proceeding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>447 Mass. 313, 315, 319-320 &amp; n.10 (2006) (defendant has right not to speak with qualified examiners in connection with \u00a7 13 [a] examination based on patient-psychotherapist privilege, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, and constitutional privilege against self-incrimination). This case, however, presents a different issue, because here the defendant appeared at the interview prepared to speak to the qualified examiner with his attorney in attendance, in accordance with the court order authorizing counsel\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was the qualified examiner who refused to conduct the interview, because she objected to the presence of the defendant\u2019s attorney. Therefore, the question before us is whether an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>interview is required when the interviewer, and not the defendant, refuses to conduct an interview.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We begin with the language of the statute, as \u201cthe principal source of insight into legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poissant, </em>443 Mass. 558, 562 (2005) (quotation and citation omitted). Section 13 <em>(a) </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201cIf the court is satisfied that probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually dangerous person, the prisoner or youth shall be committed to the treatment center for a period not exceeding [sixty] days for the purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners who shall, no later than [fifteen] days prior to the expiration of said period, file with the court a written report of the examination and diagnosis and their recommendation of the disposition of the person named in the petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The word \u201cexamination\u201d is not defined, although in prior cases we have suggested that the terms \u201cexamination\u201d and \u201cinterview\u201d in the context of \u00a7 13 (a) are essentially interchangeable. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>447 Mass. at 317 n.7, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Poissant, supra </em>at 559 n.1 (\u201cthere is, in fact, \u2018no meaningful distinction between the terms\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, and more significantly, \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>specifically requires a sixty-day commitment of the person claimed to be a sexually dangerous person <em>\u201cfor the purpose of examination and </em>diagnosis\u201d by the qualified medical examiners. We understand this choice of language \u2014 the mandatory, time-limited period of commitment and the specific statement of the commitment\u2019s purpose \u2014 to mean that the Legislature intended the \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>examination to include personal interviews. We do so because there would be no other reason to commit a defendant at this point in the process,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> given that the qualified examiners could examine the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>records on their own, regardless of whether he were present. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bradway, 62 Mass. App. Ct. 280, 288 (2004) (reading \u00a7 13 [a] to require \u201ca clinical component to the qualified examiners\u2019 review\u201d because of statute\u2019s provision that person must be committed for \u201cthe purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners\u201d).* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Moreover, the requirement that qualified examiners conduct personal interviews advances the compelling purpose of commitment proceedings to investigate \u201ca person\u2019s current mental condition,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 503 (2000), in order to decide \u201c[wjhether [the] person suffers from a mental abnormality or personality defect, as well as the predictive behavioral question of the likelihood that a person suffering from such a condition will commit a sexual offense,\u201d <em>Johnstone, petitioner, </em>453 Mass. 544, 549 (2009), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dube, </em>59 Mass. App. Ct. 476, 483 n.12 (2003).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> A review of existing criminal and patient records, without an in-person assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ment of the defendant, is likely to present an incomplete and perhaps incorrect picture of the defendant\u2019s current state of mind. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyer, </em>61 Mass. App. Ct. 582, 584, 586 (2004) (Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness, who had conducted review of defendant\u2019s record for purposes of probable cause determination under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 [c], and had concluded defendant was sexually dangerous person, recanted opinion at time of trial based principally on personal interviews with defendant and his wife). We therefore conclude that \u00a7 13 (a) requires qualified examiners to conduct personal interviews in accordance with the terms mandated by the court where a defendant does not refuse to be interviewed.* **<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In advancing a contrary reading of \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>the Commonwealth points to the statutory provision governing petitions for examination and discharge by those committed as sexually dangerous persons, G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 9 (\u00a7 9). Section 9 both contains an express directive that the examinations of a petitioning sexually dangerous person by two qualified examiners \u201cinclude[] personal interviews\u201d and penalizes a petitioner\u2019s refusal to be interviewed by directing that his petition for discharge be dismissed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Commonwealth argues that the presence of these explicit provisions in \u00a7 9 forecloses the possibility that the word \u201cexamination\u201d by itself as used in \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>requires a personal interview. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The Legislature amended \u00a7 9 in 1987 to add the clause \u201cincluding personal interviews\u201d as well as the penalty for a petitioner\u2019s refusal to be interviewed \u2014 twelve years before the Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>added \u00a7 13 (a) to G. L. c. 123A as part of a comprehensive statutory overhaul designed to improve the sex offender registration system and to reestablish civil commitment and community parole supervision for life for certain sex offenders. See, respectively, St. 1987, c. 116, and St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 58. Given the temporal gap between these enactments, we do not place much weight on the differences in language between \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 13 (a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, we understand these differences simply to reflect what appears to be imprecise use of language in separate statutory amendments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Santos, petitioner, </em>461 Mass. 565, 571 (2012) (interpreting language in \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 14 [c], listing slightly different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>types of records deemed admissible at trial of petitions for discharge and for commitment, respectively, to permit admission of same types of records in both because \u201c[w]e construe the two related statutes in a manner that makes them consistent with one another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Finally, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s contention, it was not the obligation of the defendant to bring to the attention of the judge the qualified examiner\u2019s refusal to conduct the interview in accordance with conditions set by the court order before expiration of the sixty-day period. \u201cAlthough qualified examiners are independent experts appointed by the court, . . . [i]t is the Commonwealth\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the treatment center performs the examinations in a timely manner.\u201d <em>Gangi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>462 Mass. 158, 162 (2012) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">The question then becomes what happens where, as here, one qualified examiner has violated \u00a7 13 (a) by declining to interview the defendant. The defendant argues, and the motion judge agreed, that the proper remedy is dismissal of the Commonwealth\u2019s petition. We decide otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Dismissal is warranted when a misstep in the commitment process under G. L. c. 123A results in the defendant\u2019s commitment to the treatment center for more than the sixty-day period specified in \u00a7 13 (a). See, e.g., <em>Gangi </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>462 Mass. at 159, 160-161 (dismissal required where Commonwealth filed petition for trial sixteen days beyond sixty-day statutory deadline); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>435 Mass. 527, 530 (2001) (dismissal required where defendant was committed for more than forty-five days on three separate occasions with no qualified examiner reports on file, resulting in detention for period \u201cvastly in excess of the maximum [period of detention] allowed by the statute\u201d). Dismissal is proper in such cases, we have explained, because \u201cthe liberty interests at stake compel strict adherence to the time frames set forth in the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">By contrast, the error in this case did not infringe on the defendant\u2019s liberty interest. Both qualified examiners timely filed their reports under \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>and the Commonwealth timely filed a petition for trial pursuant to \u00a7 14 (a). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagnon, </em>439 Mass. 826, 827, 830-831 (2003) (dismissal not required where qualified examiners\u2019 reports were filed after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>forty-five day statutory deadline because qualified examiners submitted reports and Commonwealth filed petition for trial all within sixty-day period of commitment in \u00a7 13 [a]). Contrary to the conclusion of the motion judge, a report that is based solely on a record review still qualifies as a \u201creport of examination and diagnosis\u201d under \u00a7 13 (a). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Connors, 447 Mass. 313, 318-320 (2006) (qualified examiner reports still admissible where defendant refuses to be interviewed personally). Additionally, this court has made clear that the Commonwealth may properly proceed to trial in a commitment proceeding where \u201cat least one of the two qualified examiners . . . opine[s] that the [defendant] [is] sexually dangerous.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Johnstone, petitioner, </em>453 Mass. at 553. Because the two qualified examiner reports and the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for trial were timely filed within the sixty-day period specified in \u00a7 13 <em>(a), </em>and at least one of those reports was based on a personal interview with the defendant and concluded that the defendant is a sexually dangerous person,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> dismissal of the petition is not appropriate.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">However, a qualified examiner\u2019s refusal to interview the defendant under the terms of a court order, where the defendant agrees to be interviewed under those terms, cannot simply be ignored. Permitting the Commonwealth to introduce the testimony or report of a qualified examiner who refused to conduct an interview would present an incomplete picture of the defendant\u2019s current sexual dangerousness and raises questions about the fairness of the commitment proceeding. As discussed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connors, </em>447 Mass. at 317-319 &amp; nn.8-9, we are wary of conduct in c. 123A proceedings that \u201cwould have allowed \u2018a distorting effect on the fact finder\u2019s role.\u2019 \u201d See <em>id. </em>at 318-319, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wayne W., </em>414 Mass. 218, 231 (1993). Accordingly, where a qualified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>examiner declines to conduct a personal interview as part of a \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>examination, the qualified examiner\u2019s report and testimony shall be inadmissible at any subsequent trial conducted under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">3. <em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-6\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>(\u00a7 13 [a]), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201cIf the court is satisfied that probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually dangerous person, the prisoner or youth shall be committed to the treatment center for a period not exceeding [sixty] days for the purpose of examination and diagnosis under the supervision of two qualified examiners who shall, no later than [fifteen] days prior to the expiration of said period, file with the court a written report of the examination and diagnosis and their recommendation of the disposition of the person named in the petition.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The package included court documents, incarceration and commitment records, treatment center records, and prior evaluations and reports of qualified examiners to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">For a summary of the statutory scheme governing sexually dangerous person commitment proceedings, see <em>Johnstone, petitioner, </em>453 Mass. 544, 546-547 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Although \u00a7 13 (a) does not confer a right to counsel at an interview with a qualified examiner, \u201c[a] judge may, in his or her discretion, permit counsel to be present during a psychiatric examination.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>449 Mass. 576, 579 n.5 (2007).

No. 4103 \u2014 the bill that inserted the interview requirement and associated penalty provision into \u00a7 9, see St. 1987, c. 116 \u2014 was designed to discourage petitioners from evading personal interviews because \u201c[qjuite understandably, some of the examiners retained by the [Department [of Mental Health] believe that it is clinically or ethically inappropriate to render an opinion concerning an individual they have not spoken with.\u201d The letter further emphasizes that \u201cthe refusal to speak to the examiners impedes the quest for a fair and accurate assessment of the petitioner\u2019s mental and emotional condition\u201d and that \u201c[cjommon sense dictates that the reliability of a prediction about someone\u2019s future behavior is significantly reduced if the prediction must be made without an oppor[tu]nity to speak to that individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">While \u00a7 9 was the focus, the concerns expressed by the Attorney General in this letter about making a reliable assessment of sexual dangerousness without a personal interview appear to be relevant as well in the context of the initial commitment proceeding to which \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>applies. Indeed, an interview is arguably more important in the context of an initial commitment proceeding than in connection with a petition for release under \u00a7 9, because a qualified examiner engaged in connection with a petition for commitment would likely have access to fewer, and less up-to-date, treatment records due to the defendant\u2019s relatively recent arrival at the treatment center. Compare \u00a7 9 (authorizing filing of petitions for discharge from the treatment center every twelve months), with \u00a7 12 (e) (commitment to treatment center pending probable cause determination), and \u00a7 13 <em>(a) </em>(commitment to treatment center after probable cause determination).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Although the issue before the court in <em>Johnstone, petitioner, </em>453 Mass. 544 (2009), arose in the context of a \u00a7 9 discharge proceeding, the court explicitly stated that the rule applies in the context of initial commitment proceedings under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12 <em>(b). </em>See <em>id. </em>at 550 n.9.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Where a defendant refuses to be interviewed personally by one or both qualified examiners, the Commonwealth may still petition for trial under G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14 <em>(a).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\">In such circumstances, one qualified examiner\u2019s refusal to interview a defendant in no way impairs the defendant\u2019s right to introduce at trial expert testimony based on personal interviews under \u00a7 14 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
