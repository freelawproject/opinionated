Moody and Devin Newman, were separately indicted for various violations of the Controlled Substances Act, G. L. c. 94C, stemming from their alleged involvement in an organized group engaged in drug trafficking in Berkshire County. In particular, Moody was indicted for one count of trafficking in cocaine, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (b); one count of distribution of cocaine, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (c); and two counts of conspiracy to violate the drug laws, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For his part, Newman was indicted for one count of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-14\">Prior to trial, the defendants filed separate motions to suppress the fruits of several search warrants issued under the Massachusetts wiretap statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, which authorized the interception of calls and text messages sent over their cellular telephones. The defendants argued that the interception of these forms of communication was beyond the scope of authority provided under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, and, thus, preempted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the cognate provisions of the Federal wiretap statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510 et seq. (2006 &amp; Supp. V 2011). In a consolidated decision, the motion judge denied the defendants\u2019 motions as to their cellular telephone calls, but granted their motions as to the interception of their text messages. The judge then reported the following question to the Appeals Court pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004): \u201cDoes G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 authorize a Superior Court Judge to issue a warrant permitting state law enforcement officers to intercept cellular telephone calls and text messages?\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">Based on the language of the Massachusetts wiretap statute and the legislative history surrounding the Federal wiretap statute, we conclude that a Superior Court judge possesses the authority under the Massachusetts wiretap statute to issue warrants permitting the interception of cellular telephone calls and text messages.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-18\"><em>Background. </em>In October, 2010, the Commonwealth applied for and was granted warrants authorizing the interception of \u201coral and wire communications\u201d made on cellular telephones belonging to or being utilized by the defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The warrants were sought in connection with an investigation into the defendants\u2019 participation in an \u201congoing conspiracy to commit the crimes of distribution of controlled substances, trafficking in controlled substances and conspiracy to commit the specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>narcotics offenses.\u201d According to the affidavit accompanying the warrant applications, the wiretaps were needed to reveal specific information about the \u201cnature, extent and methods of operation of the illicit business.\u201d Following the issuance of the warrants, the police monitored the defendants\u2019 cellular telephone calls and text messages for approximately one week. The contents of these cellular telephone calls and text messages were the subject matter of the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendants argue that, although the Federal wiretap statute, which was amended in 1986, both protects cellular telephone calls and text messages as well as authorizes their interception upon the issuance of a warrant, the Massachusetts wiretap statute, which has not been similarly amended since its adoption in 1968, does neither. For this reason, the defendants argue that the warrants at issue were illegal because they authorized the interception of communications beyond the scope of the Massachusetts wiretap statute and, further, that the Massachusetts wiretap statute is preempted because it provides less protection than its Federal counterpart. Consequently, the defendants suggest that the only permissible way for law enforcement authorities to intercept cellular telephone calls and text messages is under the Federal wiretap statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">1. <em>History of Federal and Massachusetts wiretap statutes, </em>a. <em>Federal wiretap statute </em>\u2014 <em>Title III. </em>In 1968, Congress enacted Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Acts of 1968, Pub. L. No. 90-351, 82 Stat. 211 (1968) (Title III). The purpose of Title III was to protect wire and oral communications by \u201cdefining] on a uniform basis, the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized, [and by] prohibiting] any unauthorized interception of such communications.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 801(b), 82 Stat. at 211. This purpose reflected a balance between Congress\u2019s recognition that the \u201cinterception of [wire and oral] communications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of justice,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 801(c), 82 Stat. at 211, and the overriding need \u201c[t]o safeguard the privacy of innocent persons,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 801(d), 82 Stat. at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">To effectuate this balance, Title III prohibited the wilful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u201cinterception]\u201d of any \u201cwire or oral communication,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 802, 82 Stat. at 213, unless a Federal or State judge of \u201ccompetent jurisdiction\u201d authorized such interception through the issuance of a warrant. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 802, 82 Stat. at 216, 218-219.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As pertinent to this case, the term \u201cwire communication\u201d was defined to mean \u201cany <em>communication </em>made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception\u201d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 802, 82 Stat. at 212. The term \u201cintercept\u201d was defined to mean \u201cthe aural acquisition of the contents of any wire . . . communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the definition of \u201cintercept\u201d was confined to the interception of the human voice by the human ear. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>New York Tel. Co., </em>434 U.S. 159, 166-167 (1977) (pen registers not subject to Title III because they \u201cdo not accomplish the \u2018aural acquisition\u2019 of anything\u201d); S. Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3566; H.R. Rep. No. 647, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 17-18 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In \u201cenacting Title III [Congress] intended to occupy [and thus preempt] the field of wiretapping and electronic surveillance, except as that statute specifically permits concurrent State regulation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>367 Mass. 224, 245 (1975) <em>(Vitello). </em>As for concurrent state regulation, Title III permitted States to \u201cpromulgate legislation authorizing certain designated officials to apply to State court judges ... for wiretap orders to be utilized in enforcement of statutes designated under the State criminal law.\u201d <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 246. See Pub. L. 90-351, \u00a7 802, 82 Stat. 211, 217, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(2) (2006 &amp; Supp. III 2009). Thus, while Congress en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>deavored to \u201cdefine on a uniform basis, the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 801(b), 82 Stat. at 211, it allowed for \u201cconcurrent State regulation subject, at the minimum, to the requirements of the Federal regulation.\u201d <em>Vitello, supra, </em>citing Pub. L. 90-351, \u00a7 801(b), 82 Stat. 211, 217-218. See S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2187.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">b. <em>Massachusetts wiretap statute \u2014 G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99. </em>Shortly after Congress enacted Title III, the Legislature rewrote the Massachusetts wiretap statute and modeled it on Title III. See G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, as appearing in St. 1968, c. 738, \u00a7 1. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>439 Mass. 64, 68 n.9 (2003). Like Congress, the Legislature was \u201c[ajlarmed by the commercial availability of sophisticated surveillance devices and the ease with which they facilitated surreptitious recording of private citizens,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>459 Mass. 289, 294-295 (2011), and wanted to \u201censure that unjustified and overly broad intrusions on rights of privacy [were] avoided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 295, quoting <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 231. At the same time, however, the Legislature was keenly aware that in order to combat \u201cthe increasing activities of organized crime [that] constitute a grave danger to the public welfare and safety .... law enforcement officials must be permitted to use modem methods of electronic surveillance . . . when investigating these organized criminal activities.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, supra </em>at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">To this end, in wording nearly identical to Title III, the Massachusetts wiretap statute prohibits the wilful \u201cinterception . . . of any wire or oral communication,\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 C 1, unless a judge of \u201ccompetent jurisdiction\u201d authorizes such interception through the issuance of a warrant. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 D 2 d &amp; H 2. Similarly, the statute also defined the term \u201cwire communication\u201d to mean <em>\u201cany communication </em>made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 1. In words different than those employed in Title III, however, the term \u201cintercep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion\u201d was defined to mean \u201cto secretly hear [or] secretly record ... the contents of any wire . . . communication through the use of any intercepting device.\u201d G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">c. <em>Electronic Communications Privacy Act. </em>In 1986, Congress amended Title III by enacting the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), Pub. L. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848 (1986), codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U.S.C. Congress\u2019s stated purpose in passing the ECPA was \u201cto protect against the unauthorized interception of electronic communications [by] updating] and clarifying] Federal privacy protections and standards in light of dramatic changes in new computer and telecommunications technologies.\u201d S. Rep. 541, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess., reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3555.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">To accomplish this goal, Congress amended Title III in several important respects. First, it built on the protection already afforded wire and oral communications by creating a new category of protected communication called \u201celectronic communication.\u201d Pub. L. 99-508, \u00a7 101(c)(1)(A), 100 Stat. 1848, 1851-1852, codified, as amended, at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(1)(a) (2006). Congress defined \u201celectronic communication\u201d as \u201cany transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic or photooptical system that affects interstate or foreign commerce, but does not include . . . any wire or oral communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 101(a)(6)(B), 100 Stat. at 1848-1849, codified, as amended, at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(12) (2006). As pertains to the issue before us, the definition of \u201celectronic communication\u201d under Federal law plainly includes the transmission of text messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-32\">Second, Congress amended the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d by substituting the words, \u201cany aural transfer,\u201d for the words, \u201cany communication,\u201d thereby explicitly limiting wire communications to those involving the human voice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>gress also added language clarifying that a \u201cwire communication\u201d is one that is made \u201cin whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and the point of reception <em>(including the use of such connection in a switching </em>station)\u201d (added language emphasized). <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 101(a)(1)(B), 100 Stat. at 1848, codified, as amended, at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1) (2006). Thus, Congress made clear that calls from one cellular telephone to another are included within the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d even when the \u201cwire, cable, or other like connection\u201d occurs only briefly in a switching station.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Third, Congress amended the term \u201cintercept\u201d to mean \u201cthe aural <em>or other </em>acquisition of the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device\u201d (emphasis added), <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 101(a)(3)(A), 100 Stat. at 1848, codified, as amended, at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(4) (2006), thereby ensuring that it included the acquisition of not only the human voice, but also other forms of communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Finally, the ECPA established a two-year grace period for States, essentially delaying Federal preemption with respect to the amendments and allowing States time to amend their wiretap statutes to the extent necessary to meet or exceed the level of protection provided to electronic communications under Title III.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 111(b), 100 Stat. at 1859. The Legislature never amended G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>2. <em>Authority to issue warrants authorizing interception of cellular telephone calls and text messages under Massachusetts wiretap statute, </em>a. <em>Validity of the wiretap warrants notwithstanding preemption. </em>Before proceeding to the preemption analysis, it is necessary to address a point not raised by any of the parties; that is, whether a State warrant that complied with the requirements of Federal law would be valid notwithstanding Federal preemption. In <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 245, we considered whether other provisions of the Massachusetts wiretap statute were preempted by Title III.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In our decision, we explicitly noted that the \u201cpreemption analysis . . . should be distinguished from the issue of the validity of a warrant issued pursuant to a State statute found in certain particulars to be in conflict with Title III and therefore partially preempted.\u201d <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 248. Based on our interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(2) (1970), which authorizes concurrent State legislation, we concluded that a warrant issued pursuant to a State wiretap statute is not automatically invalidated simply because a particular provision of the State statute is preempted by Title III. <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 248-249. Rather, as long as a State statute contains a valid provision authorizing applications for wiretap orders, \u201c[a]ny warrant issued under such a limited State authorization would be measured against the specific provisions of Title HI.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248. Because we concluded in <em>Vitello, </em>that the authorization provisions of the Massachusetts wiretap statute were valid and severable, even if other provisions of the statute were preempted by Title III, and thus inoperable, \u201cwarrants issued [under the statute] would be valid as long as . . . the warrants themselves meet the Federal standards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">This is significant for our purposes. Assuming that the Legislature\u2019s failure to amend the Massachusetts wiretap statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>in a manner consistent with the 1986 amendments to Title III results in preemption, based on our decision in <em>Vitello, supra, </em>the warrants issued under the Massachusetts statute do not automatically fail. Rather, if the warrants authorizing the interception of the defendants\u2019 cellular telephone calls and text messages themselves would satisfy the standards set forth in the Federal wiretap statute, they would remain valid.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, as we noted in <em>Vitello, supra, </em>\u201cwe need not rest our decision on this basis alone because we find . . . that the Massachusetts statute, in the several particulars challenged by the defendants, is not repugnant to the provisions of the Federal act and is accordingly not preempted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">b. <em>Interception of cellular telephone calls. </em>We begin by considering whether the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d under the Massachusetts wiretap statute includes, and thus protects, cellular telephone calls. Prior to 1986, the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d was identical under Title III and the Massachusetts wiretap statute. Compare Pub. L. 90-351, \u00a7 802, 82 Stat. 211, 212 (1968), with G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 1. For this reason, there can be no doubt that prior to the ECPA, the meaning of the term \u201cwire communication\u201d as used in the Massachusetts wiretap statute, was <em>at least </em>as inclusive, and thus protective, as its Federal counterpart. See <em>O\u2019Sullivan </em>v. <em>NYNEX Corp., </em>426 Mass. 261, 264 n.5 (1997). See also <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 251 (in substance, requirements of Massachusetts statute are same as Title III). Consequently, in ascertaining the scope of the term \u201cwire communication\u201d under the Massachusetts statute, it is instructive to review the scope of that term as it appears in the 1968 Federal wiretap statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>According to the 1986 Senate Report accompanying the ECPA, \u201cCongress, in passing the 1968 wiretap law already made willful monitoring of [cellular] telephone calls illegal when at least part of the conversation is carried by wire.\u201d See S. Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3561. The corresponding 1986 House Report is in agreement: \u201cThe availability of [cellular telephone] technology poses a troubling conflict between the technology of surveillance and new techniques of communicating using radio. Interception of cellular calls is illegal under current federal law.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 20 (1986). Read in conjunction, the two reports suggest that cellular telephone calls traveling in any part over a standard telephone wire or \u201cland line\u201d were covered by the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d under the 1968 Federal wiretap statute. What was left in some doubt by the 1968 statute was whether a call from one cellular telephone to another, which traveled entirely by radio signals, except for its passage through a switching station, was protected. Cf. <em>Bartnicki </em>v. <em>Vopper, </em>532 U.S. 514, 524 (2001) (\u201cAs enacted in 1968, Title III did not apply to the monitoring of radio transmissions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The ECPA eliminated any such doubt by amending the defin\u00edtion of \u201cwire communication\u201d to add the language, \u201cincluding the use of such connection in a switching station.\u201d Pub. L. No. 99-508, \u00a7 101(a)(1)(B), 100 Stat. 1848, 1848 (1986), In doing so, Congress \u201c[made] clear that cellular communications \u2014 whether they are between two cellular telephones or between a cellular telephone and a \u2018land line\u2019 telephone \u2014 are included in the definition of \u2018wire communicationQ \u2019 and are covered by [Title Bl].\u201d S. Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2nd Sess., reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3555, 3565.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, the ECPA did not mark the beginning of Title Ill\u2019s coverage of cellular telephone calls; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>rather, it served only to clarify that all forms of cellular telephone calls were protected under Title HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">As we have noted, the Legislature did not amend the Massachusetts wiretap statute after enactment of the ECPA. As a result, the scope of the term \u201cwire communication\u201d under the State statute still retains the language of the 1968 Federal wiretap statute, which could be interpreted as not protecting cellular telephone calls that travel primarily by radio signals. However, this does not mean that the Massachusetts statute is less protective than Title III \u2014 it only means that on its face the Massachusetts wiretap statute is less clear than its Federal counterpart. \u201cThe fact that there has been no amendment of the Massachusetts statute comparable to the Congressional action of 1986 does not bar us from reading the [statute] so as to preserve it in its intrinsic intended scope and maintain its viability in the broad run of cases . . . .\u201d <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 309, 315 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">We have no doubt that, in enacting the Massachusetts wiretap statute, the Legislature intended to protect all calls that to any extent or degree traveled \u201cby the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection.\u201d The reality that cellular telephone technology has drastically reduced the need for such connections does not alter the \u201cintrinsic intended scope\u201d that we read the statute to preserve. In sum, we conclude that the existing language of the Massachusetts wiretap statute is broad enough to protect all forms of cellular telephone calls that utilize wire, cable, or other like connections, even if the use of such connections is only in switching stations. Thus, the Massachusetts wiretap statute is as protective as the amended Federal wiretap statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">c. <em>Interception of text messages. </em>We turn next to whether text messages are protected under the Massachusetts wiretap statute. As discussed, in 1986, Congress purposefully narrowed the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d under Title III to include only \u201caural transfer[s].\u201d In doing so, Congress intentionally excluded non-oral electronic transmissions, such as text messages, from Title Ill\u2019s definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d and placed them within the newly defined category of \u201celectronic communication.\u201d Because the Legislature has never undertaken to amend G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99, to conform to the ECPA, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>ants argue that the Massachusetts wiretap statute does not protect text messages and, thus, is less protective than Title III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Once again, however, the defendants\u2019 argument runs head long into the legislative history of the ECPA, which explicitly recognized the possibility that \u201cstate laws [might] not need [to] be changed to accommodate revisions on interceptions of wire or oral communications.\u201d H. Rep. No. 99-647, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 62 (1986). If the Massachusetts wiretap statute and its definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d provide at least as much protection for text messages as the now amended Title III does, the statute would not be preempted. Given our recognition that, \u201cin certain respects the Massachusetts statute [even before the 1986 amendment of Title III] is more restrictive than Title III,\u201d <em>Vitello, supra </em>at 251 n.15, we are persuaded that the existing statutory language under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B, is broad enough to cover non-oral electronic transmissions and provides as much protection as Title III.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">While the ECPA narrowed the scope of \u201cwire communication\u201d in Title III, the Massachusetts wiretap statute continues to define \u201cwire communication\u201d broadly as <em>\u201cany communication </em>made in whole or in part through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the <em>aid of wire, cable, or other like connection </em>between the point of origin and the point of reception\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 1. Given that a text message is a communication transmitted over a cellular network that travels in part by wire or cable or other like connection within a switching station, it seems self-evident that text messages fall within the plain language of the definition of \u201cwire communication\u201d in \u00a7 99. Further, where Title III, as amended by the ECPA, broadened the definition of \u201cintercept\u201d to include \u201cthe aural or <em>other acquisition of </em>the contents of any wire, electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or other device\u201d (emphasis added), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510(4), the Massachusetts wiretap statute has always defined \u201cinterception\u201d broadly as meaning, \u201cto secretly hear [or] <em>secretly record </em>. . . the contents of any wire . . . communication through the use of any intercepting device\u201d (emphasis added). G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99 B 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Insofar as the Massachusetts wiretap statute does not define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the term \u201crecord,\u201d we are guided by the legislative imperative that, when interpreting statutes, \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Third. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>431 Mass. 772, 775 (2000) (\u201cWhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous, it must be given its ordinary meaning\u201d). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1898 (1971) defines \u201crecord\u201d to mean, \u201cto set down in writing\u201d or \u201cto cause (sound, visual images) to be transferred to and registered on something [by] electronic means in such a way that the thing so transferred and registered can ... be subsequently reproduced.\u201d Infused by the ordinary meaning of the term \u201crecord,\u201d it is apparent that the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \u201csecretly record\u201d includes the interception of text messages by viewing and transcribing them for use at a later date. See <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Superior Court Dep\u2019t of the Trial Court for the County of Worcester, </em>446 Mass. 123, 124 (2006), quoting <em>International Fid. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>387 Mass. 841, 853 (1983) (\u201cprimary source of insight into the intent of the Legislature is the language of the statute\u201d). Ostensibly, then, the definition of \u201cinterception\u201d under the Massachusetts wiretap statute, is as protective as the use of the phrase \u201cother acquisition\u201d in the definition of \u201cinterception\u201d under Title III.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In light of the broad statutory definitions of the terms \u201cwire communication\u201d and \u201cinterception,\u201d we conclude that the Massachusetts wiretap statute provides protection for the electronic transmission of text messages consistent with the protections currently provided by Title III and, therefore, is not preempted. Consequently, a Superior Court judge is permitted to issue warrants authorizing the interception of text messages under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The answer to the reported question being, \u201cYes,\u201d as to both cellular telephone calls and text messages, the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-15\">Specifically, the Commonwealth alleges Moody conspired to distribute cocaine, G.

Tavares, 459 Mass. 289, 297 (2001) (designated offense under G.
