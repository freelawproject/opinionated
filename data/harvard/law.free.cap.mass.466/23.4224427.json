L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), bars employment discrimination on the basis of handicap. This case presents the question whether the statute bars an employer from discriminating against its employee based on the handicap of a person with whom the employee associates. We answer that, in the circumstances of this case, it does.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\"><em>Background. </em>The plaintiff, Marc Flagg, appeals from the dismissal of his second amended complaint (complaint)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against his former employer, the defendant, AliMed, Inc. (AliMed). The complaint contained claims of defamation and of employment discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B (c. 151B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">We recite the pertinent facts alleged in the complaint. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>February, 2008, the plaintiff had worked for AliMed for approximately eighteen years, and had received good job performance reviews. As an employee, the plaintiff received a salary and benefits, including family medical insurance, and an implied term of his employment was that AliMed would not terminate him because a family member developed a serious medical condition that involved considerable medical expense. On December 7, 2007, the plaintiff\u2019s wife underwent surgery for removal of a brain tumor, and thereafter was receiving rehabilitative care. As a result, the plaintiff became responsible for caring for the couple\u2019s children, including the obligation to pick up his daughter from school \u2014 a task that required him to be absent from work from about 2:55 p.m. until about 3:20 p.m. on certain days. The plaintiff\u2019s manager at AliMed told him to take the time necessary to do what he had to do to care for his family. When the plaintiff left work to pick up his daughter on various days between December 27, 2007, and January 15, 2008,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he did not \u201cpunch out\u201d \u2014 either when he went to pick up his daughter or after he had returned to work and was leaving at the end of the day. His manager knew the plaintiff was not punching out, and did not say anything to him about this practice. On February 4, 2008, however, AliMed terminated the plaintiff\u2019s employment, proffering as its reason the fact that the plaintiff had failed to punch out on certain days when he left to pick up his daughter and therefore was being paid for hours that he had not actually worked. AliMed\u2019s proffered reason for the termination was false: the real reason the plaintiff was terminated was that his wife had a very serious and expensive medical condition that rendered her totally disabled, and for which Ali-Med, through its health plan, was financially responsible. The February 4 employment termination took place at a time when the plaintiff\u2019s wife was again a hospital inpatient because of a recurrence of the brain tumor, and the termination resulted in the immediate cancellation of the plaintiff\u2019s health insurance and an initial denial of unemployment benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>quence, the plaintiff had to deplete his retirement plan funds and all his savings and suffered mental anguish. In addition, AliMed\u2019s false reasons, and allegation that the plaintiff fraudulently was claiming that he had worked certain hours when he had not and thereby obtained money to which he was not entitled, \u201cbecame known amongst fellow workers and the community at large,\u201d likely leading people who learned of this allegation and who did not know him to conclude that the plaintiff \u201chad engaged in serious deliberate misconduct\u201d when in fact he had not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">AliMed moved to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), as amended, 365 Mass. 754 (1974), and to strike portions of the complaint under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (f), as amended, 365 Mass. 754 (1974).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> After a hearing, a judge in the Superior Court allowed the motion to dismiss, ruling that (1) the claim of defamation was not pleaded adequately; and (2) the plaintiff\u2019s claim of employment discrimination did not state a claim on which relief could be granted: \u201cthe theory that [AliMed] fired plaintiff because his wife was handicapped is not recognized in the Commonwealth.\u201d A judgment of dismissal entered on December 28, 2010, and the plaintiff timely filed an appeal in the Appeals Court. We transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>In reviewing the correctness of the judge\u2019s decision allowing AliMed\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, see Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), we \u201ctake as true \u2018the allegations of the complaint, as well as such inferences as may be drawn therefrom in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marram </em>v. <em>Kobrick Offshore Fund, Ltd., </em>442 Mass. 43, 45 (2004), citing <em>Blank </em>v. <em>Chelmsford Ob/Gyn, P.C., </em>420 Mass. 404, 407 (1995). To survive a motion to dismiss, the facts contained in the complaint, and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, must \u201c \u2018plausibly suggest[]\u2019 ... an entitlement to relief\u201d (citation omitted). <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008), quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 545 (2007). We consider first the plaintiff\u2019s claim under G. L. c. 151B, and thereafter his defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">2. <em>Violation of c. 151B. </em>As the motion judge implicitly recognized, the plaintiff\u2019s claim is one of associational discrimination. The term \u201cassociational discrimination\u201d refers to a claim that a plaintiff, although not a member of a protected class himself or herself, is the victim of discriminatory animus directed toward a third person who <em>is </em>a member of the protected class and with whom the plaintiff associates. See, e.g., <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Whirlpool Corp., </em>556 F.3d 502, 512 (6th Cir. 2009), citing <em>Tetro </em>v. <em>Elliott Popham Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick &amp; GMC Trucks, Inc., </em>173 F.3d 988, 994 (6th Cir. 1999). In substance, the c. 151B count of the complaint alleges that AliMed, the plaintiff\u2019s employer, terminated his employment premised on discriminatory animus directed toward his handicapped wife, that is, its desire to be free from its obligation to pay for the wife\u2019s costly medical treatment. The plaintiff\u2019s argument is that this form of discrimination fits within the scope of c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16) (\u00a7 4 [16]), because it causes a direct and specific injury to the employee and represents \u201ca formidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in the workplace,\u201d <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 162 (1987), which c. 151B, \u00a7 4, is intended to prevent. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">As we next discuss, interpreting \u00a7 4 (16) to encompass a claim of associational discrimination finds support in the language and purpose of that section and c. 151B more generally in the longstanding and consistent interpretation given to the statute by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (commission), and in the analogous provisions of Federal antidiscrimination statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Section 4 (16) provides in pertinent part that it shall be an unlawful practice,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-8\">\u201c[f]or any employer, personally or through an agent, to dismiss from employment or refuse to hire, rehire or advance in employment or otherwise discriminate against, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number><em>because of his handicap, any person alleging to be a qualified handicapped person, </em>capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved with reasonable accommodation, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation required to be made to the physical or mental limitations of the person would impose an undue hardship to the employer\u2019s business\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">AliMed argues that the language of this section precludes the plaintiff from raising a claim of associational handicap discrimination because the handicapped person at issue is not the plaintiff \u2014 its employee \u2014\u25a0 but the plaintiff\u2019s wife. AliMed reads the section too narrowly. \u201cThe general and familiar rule is that a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the Legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934). See, e.g., <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>463 Mass. 696, 707 (2012) (interpreting c. 151B, \u00a7 4 [4A]). Accordingly, although a statute\u2019s words are of prime importance in a court\u2019s effort to discern legislative intent, see, e.g., <em>Lowery </em>v. <em>Klemm, </em>446 Mass. 572, 577 (2006), the words must be evaluated in the context of the overarching purpose of the statute itself. We begin, therefore, with the objectives and purposes of c. 151B.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Chapter 151B was enacted in 1946 to provide remedies for employment discrimination, a practice viewed as harmful to \u201cour democratic institutions\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a \u201chideous evil\u201d that needs to be \u201cextirpated.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature recognized that employment discrimination is often subtle and indirect, and that it may manifest itself \u201cby so many devious and various means that no single corrective rule can be applied to prevent the injustices committed.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>And the Legislature determined that workplace discrimination harmed not only the targeted individuals but the entire social fabric. See <em>Gasior </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Gen. Hosp., </em>446 Mass. 645, 653-654 (2006), quoting <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 563, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Wilfert Bros. Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>543 U.S. 979 (2004) (recognizing that in context of c. 151B, punitive damages intended \u201cas not merely vindicating personal rights, but comprising part of a scheme to vindicate a \u2018broader public interest in eradicating systemic discrimination\u2019 \u201d). The remedial aims of the statute are \u201conly broadly set out.\u201d <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 239-240 (2001) <em>(Dahill), </em>quoting <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 204 (1981). The Legislature gave the commission comprehensive agency powers to effectuate the statute\u2019s aims, and expressly directed that c. 151B \u201cbe construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes.\u201d G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The statutory provisions that proscribe employment discrimination based on handicap \u2014 \u00a7 4 (16) and derivatively c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16), (17), and (19)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 were added primarily in 1983.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See St. 1983, c. 533, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 6. They were enacted three years after the Legislature ratified an amendment to the Massachusetts Constitution prohibiting all discrimination based on handicap. See art. 114 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Read against the backdrop of this constitutional amendment as well as the command of c. 151B, \u00a7 9, to interpret <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>the statute liberally in order to effectuate its remedial purposes, these provisions can only be understood as establishing an expansive, categorical prohibition against discrimination based on handicap in the workplace generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">When an employer subjects an otherwise satisfactory employee to adverse employment decisions premised on hostility toward the handicapped condition of the employee\u2019s spouse, it is treating the employee as if he were handicapped himself \u2014 that is, predicated on discriminatory animus, the employer treats the spouse\u2019s handicap as a characteristic bearing on the employee\u2019s fitness for his job.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The employee is thereby subjected to the type of \u201cprejudice, stereotypes, or unfounded fear\u201d relating to handicapped individuals that c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), seeks to protect against. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 383-384 (1993), quoting <em>School Bd. of Nassau County </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>480 U.S. 273, 287 (1987). Cf. <em>Dahill, </em>434 Mass. at 240-241.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Reading the statutory language broadly in light of its remedial purpose, and in order best to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent, we think that the concept of associational discrimination also furthers the more general purposes of c. 151B as a wide-ranging law, \u201cseeking] . . . removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to full participation in the workplace\u201d that are based on discrimination. <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 162 (1987). See <em>Ayash </em>v. <em>Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., </em>443 Mass. 367, 391-392, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Ayash, </em>546 U.S. 927 (2005) (c. 151B is \u201ccomprehensive statute\u201d and was enacted \u201cto provide judicial and administrative remedies for destructive acts of discrimination in the workplace\u201d). See also <em>Lopez </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>463 Mass. at 707. Significantly, c. 151B expressly gives standing to seek relief to <em>\u201c[a]ny </em>person claiming to be aggrieved\u201d by practices made unlawful by the statute (emphasis added). G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. This section, using the same language as a cognate provision in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (2006 &amp; Supp. V 2011) (Title VII), offers strong support for the conclusion that c. 151B\u2019s protections against workplace discrimination were intended to cover all those adversely affected, whether or not they are the direct target of the proscribed discriminatory animus. Cf. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>North Am. Stainless, LP, </em>131 S. Ct. 863, 869-870 (2011) (interpreting phrase \u201cperson claiming to be aggrieved\u201d in Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5[b] [2006]).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">We return to the language of \u00a7 4 (16). The section declares it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against, \u201cbecause of his handicap, any person alleging to be a qualified handicapped person.\u201d The key term in \u00a7 4 (16) is \u201chandicap.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is defined in relevant part to mean \u201c(a) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major Ufe activities of a person; <em>(b) </em>a record of having such impairment; or (c) <em>being regarded as having such </em>impairment\u2019 (emphasis added). G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17). The third prong of the definition \u201cprotects those persons who, whether actually impaired or not, may be the victims of stereotypic assumptions, myths, and fears regarding such limitations.\u201d <em>Dahill, </em>434 Mass. at 241. We read this broad definition, and especially its third prong, as a signal that the Legislature intended \u00a7 4 (16) to prevent an employer\u2019s animus against disabihty from adversely affecting not just those employees with actual handicaps but essentially all members of its workforce, because every employee theoretically has the potential for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>\u201cbeing regarded\u201d by the employer as having an impairment. When an employer takes adverse action against its employee because of his spouse\u2019s impairment, it is targeting the employee as the direct victim of its animus, inflicting punishment for exactly the same reason and in exactly the same way as if the employee were handicapped himself. In other words, an employee treated in such a manner by his employer suffers precisely the same type of discrimination as an employee whom the employer directly but incorrectly \u201cregard[s] as\u201d being handicapped. In light of the Legislature\u2019s expansive definition of \u201chandicap,\u201d and keeping in mind its command concerning liberal construction of the statute, see c. 151B, \u00a7 9, we conclude that the language of \u00a7 4 (16) is properly read to accommodate the concept of handicap discrimination based on association.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">Importantly, our interpretation of \u00a7 4 (16)\u2019s language is one that the commission itself has adopted and consistently followed. \u201cThe primary responsibility to determine the scope of [c. 151B] has been entrusted to the [commission], not to the courts,\u201d <em>Rock </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>384 Mass. 198, 206 (1981), and we generally afford the commission\u2019s interpretation of c. 151B\u2019s provisions substantial deference. See, e.g., <em>Dahill, supra </em>at 239.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See also, e.g., <em>Zoning Bd. Of Appeals of Amesbury </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm., </em>457 Mass. 748, 759-760 (2010). For over thirty years, the commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>through its decisions, has interpreted c. 151B, \u00a7 4, to protect against employment discrimination based on association,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> including associational discrimination based on handicap. See, e.g., <em>Dittbenner </em>v. <em>Hopeo Auto Parts, Inc., </em>11 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 1139 (1989) (person aggrieved due to association with disabled individual has standing to bring claim under c. 151B before commission).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This longstanding interpretation of \u00a7 4 (16) by the commission offers \u201cilluminating\u201d guidance to us, see <em>Dahill, </em>434 Mass. at 239, and we accord it the deference to which it is due.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">It is also significant that analogous Federal antidiscrimination statutes, Title VII and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 et seq. (2006 &amp; Supp. V 2011) (Rehabilitation Act), have been interpreted to reach and cover claims of associational discrimination despite a lack of a specific reference in the statutory language.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> See <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>418 Mass. 394, 397 (1994) (\u201cIt is our practice to apply Federal case law construing the Federal anti-discrimination statutes in interpreting G. L. c. 151B\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Title VII focuses on discrimination in employment, and \u201cshare[s] substantial common ground\u201d with c. 151B. See <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>450 Mass. 327, 337-338 (2008). While Title VII does not cover employment discrimination based on handicap, Federal courts have long construed its provisions prohibiting employment discrimination based on race to cover an adverse employment action taken against an employee because of his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>her association with someone of a different race against whom the discriminatory animus is directed \u2014 even though there is no mention in the statute of discrimination based on association, and even though, like \u00a7 4 (16), the statutory language on its face appears to focus only on discrimination \u201cbecause of\u201d the employee\u2019s <em>own </em>protected characteristic.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>University of Cincinnati, </em>215 F.3d 561, 573-575 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1052 (2000) (\u201cin order to state a cognizable claim under Title VII, the plaintiff himself need not be a member of a recognized protected class; he need only allege that he was discriminated on the basis of his association with a member of a recognized protected class\u201d); <em>Tetro </em>v. <em>Elliott Popham Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick &amp; GMC Trucks, Inc., </em>173 F.3d 988, 994-995 (6th Cir. 1999) (\u201cA white employee who is discharged because his child is biracial is discriminated against on the basis of his race, even though the root animus for the discrimination is a prejudice against the biracial child\u201d). See also <em>Holcomb </em>v. <em>Iona College, </em>521 F.3d 130, 138-139 (2d Cir. 2008) (employee claiming he was fired because of interracial marriage stated claim of discrimination based on race under Title VII); <em>Parr </em>v. <em>Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., </em>791 F.2d 888, 892 (11th Cir. 1986) (same). A stated reason in some of these decisions for the inclusion of associational discrimination is to carry out the clear congressional mandate underlying Title VII to eliminate discrimination based on, for example, race: \u201cTitle VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act provides us with a clear mandate from Congress that no longer will the United States tolerate this form of discrimination. It is, therefore, the duty of the courts to make sure that the Act works, and the intent of Congress is not hampered by a combination of a strict construction of the statute in a battle with semantics.\u201d <em>Parr </em>v. <em>Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., supra, </em>quoting <em>Culpepper </em>v. <em>Reynolds Metals Co., </em>421 F.2d 888, 891 (5th Cir. 1970). See <em>Tetro </em>v. <em>Elliott Popham Pontiac, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>Oldsmobile, Buick, &amp; GMC Trucks, Inc., supra </em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The specific directive in c. 151B, \u00a7 9, to interpret the statute liberally to effectuate its remedial purposes instmcts us that we have a similar duty when construing the handicap discrimination provisions of \u00a7 4 (16).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The Rehabilitation Act in a sense is a more direct analogy to \u00a7 4 (16). It was originally enacted in 1973 and it bars discrimination based on handicap or disability in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. The Rehabilitation Act is the statute on which the Massachusetts Legislature \u201cexplicitly patterned the definition of \u2018handicap\u2019 \u201d in c. 151B,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Dahill, </em>434 Mass. at 238 &amp; n.8, and the one to which we specifically have turned for interpretative guidance concerning the handicap discrimination provisions in c. 151B. See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 382 (1993). Federal courts have construed the Rehabilitation Act to reach associational handicap discrimination although, like \u00a7 4 (16), the statute itself does not mention this form of discriminatory action but simply proscribes discrimination against a handicapped person \u201csolely by reason of her or his disability.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) (2006). See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number><em>Loeffler </em>v. <em>Staten Island Univ.

See also <em>Glass </em>v. <em>Hillsboro Sch. Dist. 1J, </em>142 F. Supp. 2d 1286, 1288, 1291-1292 (D. Or. 2001) (parents of autistic child did not suffer separate and direct injury needed to state independent claims for associational discrimination based on disability). As with the Title VII cases previously cited, these Rehabilitation Act decisions, determining in substance that recognition of associational discrimination claims is necessary to effectuate that statute\u2019s protective purposes, support our interpretation of \u00a7 4 (16).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">AliMed makes much of the fact that the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) specifically includes associational discrimination in the employment context in a section specifying types of prohibited disability discrimination against a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(4) (2006 &amp; Supp. V 2011) (\u201cthe term \u2018discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability\u2019 includes . . . excluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a relationship or association\u201d). AliMed points out that in some respects, as this court has noted, c. 151B\u2019s provisions on handicap discrimination are \u201cless generous\u201d than the ADA, see <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Cooley Dickinson Hosp., Inc., </em>437 Mass. 443, 454 (2002), and argues that associational handicap discrimination is one of those less generous respects. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>We disagree. The ADA was enacted in 1990. The ADA, therefore, cannot usefully inform our understanding of the Legislature\u2019s intent concerning associational discrimination when it amended c. 151B seven years earlier to add \u00a7 4 (16) and related sections proscribing handicap discrimination in employment to our statute. We find a far more persuasive analogy in the earlier Rehabilitation Act, on which, as stated, c. 151B\u2019s handicap discrimination provisions were actually based.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">For all these reasons, we hold that associational discrimination based on handicap is prohibited under \u00a7 4 (16).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In the present case, the plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that he was a qualified, adequately performing employee who was terminated by AliMed because his wife\u2019s total disability resulted in substantial medical expenses that AliMed was obliged to cover as part of the family health benefits provided as a term of the plaintiff\u2019s employment \u2014 that is, he was fired because of his association with his handicapped wife. The plaintiff has alleged a plausible set of facts for relief, and the dismissal of this claim must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">3. <em>Defamation. </em>The judge allowed AliMed\u2019s motion to dismiss Count I, stating that \u201c[t]he defamation count is not adequately pleaded,\u201d because \u201c[t]he Second Amended Complaint does not clearly recite the defamatory statement or assert that it was published to anyone.\u201d Flagg argues that the dismissal was improper because he was unable to include in his complaint these specifics absent some form of discovery of AliMed\u2019s records to obtain the necessary information.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In order to state a claim of defamation, a plaintiff must allege facts indicating that (1) the defendant published a false statement regarding the plaintiff \u2014 that is, the defendant communicated the statement concerning the plaintiff to a third party; (2) the statement could damage the plaintiff\u2019s reputation in the community; and (3) the statement caused economic loss or is otherwise actionable without proof of economic loss.

See also <em>Hiles </em>v. <em>Episcopal Diocese of Mass., </em>437 Mass. 505, 519 (2002). We agree with the judge that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint does not meet this standard. The plaintiff alleges that AliMed\u2019s false allegation that the plaintiff fraudulently obtained money to which he was not entitled by claiming to have worked hours when he had not \u201cbecame known amongst fellow workers and the community at large.\u201d He does not, however, allege how that allegation \u201cbecame known\u201d: whether it was through a communication or \u201cpublication\u201d by AliMed to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfellow workers\u201d and others in the community \u2014 or whether it was via some other, independent source.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Transamerica Ins.

Massachusetts civil pleading rules are relatively liberal, see Mass. R. Civ.

(2006 &amp; Supp. V 2011) (Title VII), claiming that he had been fired in retaliation for the fact that his fianc\u00e9e, who was employed by the same company as he, had filed a charge of gender discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The United States Supreme Court ruled as follows: \u201cWe hold that the term \u2018aggrieved\u2019 in Title VII incorporates [the \u2018zone of interests\u2019] test, enabling suit by any plaintiff with an interest arguably [sought] to be protected by the statutes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The term \u201chandicap\u201d is key because the other defined terms in \u00a7 4 (16) are linked to it. Specifically, \u201cqualified handicapped person\u201d is defined as \u201ca handicapped person who is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap,\u201d c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (16); and \u201chandicapped person\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who has a handicap,\u201d c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (19).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In concluding that there are obvious and direct parallels between (1) an employee who fits within the third prong of the definition of \u201chandicap\u201d because he is \u201cregarded as\u201d handicapped by his employer, and (2) an employee whom the employer treats \u201cas if\u201d handicapped (here, because of the financial burden of the medical expenses arising from his spouse\u2019s known handicap), we have no occasion to consider whether an employee with a handicapped spouse himself is entitled to reasonable accommodation on account of his spouse\u2019s condition; that issue is not raised in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Regulations promulgated by the commission have the force of law, and courts are to give them the same deference as a statute. See <em>Global NAPs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Awiszus, </em>457 Mass. 489, 496 (2010).

Similarly, c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), defines as an unlawful practice an employer\u2019s discrimination against an employee <em>\u201cbecause of his </em>handicap\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\">It is true that, unlike a handicap, everyone has a race, and in a case where, for example, a white employee claims that his employer has discriminated against him because of his association with his African-American spouse or biracial child, as courts have noted, in one sense the claim is based on the employee\u2019s own race.

See <em>Tetro, supra. </em>At that fundamental level, claims of associational discrimination based on race and handicap are the same.

I agree with the court that, where an employee alleges that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>terminated from employment because the employer did not want to be financially responsible under its health plan for the anticipated medical expenses arising from his spouse\u2019s handicap, the employee states a cognizable claim of \u201cassociational discrimination\u201d under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), which bars employment discrimination on the basis of handicap. I write separately to emphasize the limited scope of this holding, because I fear that \u201cassociational discrimination\u201d might otherwise be interpreted more broadly than the court\u2019s opinion intends.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">As the court notes, \u00a7 4 (16) makes it an unlawful practice \u201c[f]or any employer ... to dismiss from employment . . . because of <em>his </em>handicap, any person alleging to be a qualified handicapped person, capable of performing the essential functions of the position involved with reasonable accommodation, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodations required to be made to the physical or mental limitations of the person would impose an undue hardship to the employer\u2019s business\u201d (emphasis added). This language reflects that the Legislature was focused on prohibiting employment discrimination against a qualified handicapped employee because of the employee\u2019s handicap where the employee with reasonable accommodation is capable of performing the essential functions of the job. The language <em>does not </em>suggest that it was intended to protect an employee from dismissal because of a family member\u2019s handicap, where the employee himself is not handicapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">I recognize that the interpretation of this language by the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (commission) would typically be entitled to substantial deference, but deference is warranted only where an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute is reasonable and, ultimately, our review is de novo. <em>See Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>450 Mass. 311, 319 (2008), quoting <em>Commerce Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>447 Mass. 478, 481 (2006) (\u201cWe review questions of statutory interpretation de novo, . . . giving \u2018substantial deference to a reasonable interpretation of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its administration enforcement\u2019 \u201d). Cf. <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Granby, </em>444 Mass. 627, 632-633 (2005) (where Legislature has \u201cspoken with certainty on the topic in question,\u201d no deference granted to agency regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tion interpreting statute). When one looks to the few commission cases that have interpreted \u00a7 4 (16) to include associational discrimination, one finds little analysis that warrants any deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In the case it characterized as one of \u201cfirst impression\u201d on this issue, the commission declared that \u201c[ajdjudicatory bodies, including this Commission, have consistently held that the zone of interest in discrimination cases includes an individual\u2019s association with a member of a protected class.\u201d <em>Dittbenner </em>v. <em>Hapco Auto Parts, Inc., </em>11 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 1139, 1140 (1989) (Dittbenner). But the cases it relied on to support this proposition each involved discrimination on the basis of race, religion, or gender, not handicap. There is no suggestion from the commission\u2019s opinion in <em>Dittbenner </em>that the commission considered whether the language of \u00a7 4 (16) would bar or limit a claim of associational discrimination, or whether an employer was required reasonably to accommodate an employee who was coping with a family member\u2019s handicap. In the only other handicap employment discrimination case where, following a full hearing, the commission recognized a claim of associational discrimination, the commission merely cited the holding of <em>Dittbenner </em>and then found that the plaintiff had failed to make a prima facie case of associational discrimination. <em>Hamer </em>v. <em>Cambridge Sch. Dep\u2019t, </em>21 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 154, 156 (1999).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">I am persuaded that the plaintiff in this case has stated a claim under \u00a7 4 (16) for two reasons, neither of which arises from any deference to the commission\u2019s interpretation of the statute. First, where an employer provides health insurance coverage to an employee\u2019s family, and a family member is handicapped, an employer will attribute the anticipated or actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>medical expenses arising from such a handicap to the employee, even if the employer recognizes that a family member and not the employee himself is handicapped, because the potential cost to the employer in higher insurance premiums is the same regardless of whether the medical expenses are incurred by the employee or a family member, and those costs would not be borne by the employer if the employee were terminated from employment. As a result, at least with respect to an employer\u2019s concern with the cost of health insurance premiums, an employee may be regarded by an employer as if he had his family member\u2019s impairment, which places the employee in a position akin to that of an employee who is \u201cbeing regarded as having [a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities of a person],\u201d the third alternative definition of \u201chandicap\u201d under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 1 (17). In such a case, the employer has taken an adverse employment action against the employee because of the fear that the <em>employee\u2019s </em>continued employment will increase the health insurance premiums that must be paid by the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Second, as the court notes, we have looked for guidance in interpreting the handicap discrimination provisions of c. 151B to interpretations by the Federal courts of portions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, notably its definition of \u201cdisability\u201d currently codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(9) (2006 &amp; Supp. V 2011) (Rehabilitation Act). We have done so because the Legislature itself \u201cexplicitly patterned the definition of \u2018handicap\u2019 \u201d in c. 15IB on the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d in the Rehabilitation Act. <em>Dahill </em>v. <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Boston, </em>434 Mass. 233, 238 &amp; n.8 (2001). See <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 375, 382 (1993) (\u201cwe may look\u201d to case law construing Rehabilitation Act for guidance in construing c. 151B). As with G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16), the language of the Rehabilitation Act suggests that the only persons who are protected by its prohibition against discrimination are those who are themselves disabled. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) (2006) (\u201cNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability . . . shall, solely <em>by reason of her or his disability, </em>... be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance\u201d [emphasis added]). Yet, as the court notes in this case, numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>ous Federal courts have interpreted that statute to reach associational handicap discrimination under certain circumstances. See <em>ante </em>at 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">While I agree with the court that the plaintiff has made a cognizable claim of associational discrimination under \u00a7 4 (16) in the circumstances he has alleged in this case, I note the special nature of these circumstances. The court\u2019s finding of a cognizable claim here is based solely on the allegation that he was fired because the employer feared the medical expenses his spouse was likely to incur because of her handicap; it is not based on any allegation that he was fired because the employer refused to accommodate his need to devote greater time to family matters because of his wife\u2019s handicap. In fact, the court\u2019s opinion does not suggest that an employer is required under \u00a7 4 (16) to provide reasonable accommodation to an employee who is not himself handicapped to allow the employee to attend to important family matters, medical or otherwise. See <em>ante </em>at note 18. Some accommodation may be required by other statutes, see, e.g., Family and Medical Leave Act, Pub. L. 103-3, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 107 Stat. 6 (1993), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 et seq. (2006 &amp; Supp. IV 2010), or by common decency, but the failure to do so is not handicap discrimination under \u00a7 4 (16).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">I note that \u00a7 102(b)(4) of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Pub. L. 101-336, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 104 Stat. 327 (1990), codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(4) (2006 &amp; Supp. V 2011) (ADA), expressly prohibits associational discrimination by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include \u201cexcluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a relationship or association.\u201d See <em>Den Hartog </em>v. <em>Wasatch Academy, </em>129 F.3d 1076, 1082 (10th Cir. 1997) <em>(Den Hartog). </em>But Federal courts, based on the plain language of this provision, its legislative history, and the \u201cinterpretive guidance\u201d of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, have concluded that an employer is not required under the ADA to provide an employee with reasonable accommodation because of a relative\u2019s or associate\u2019s disability. See <em>Larimer </em>v. <em>International Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>370 F.3d 698, 700 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 984 (2004) <em>(Larimer); Den </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>Hartog, supra </em>at 1084-1085; <em>Tyndall </em>v. <em>National Educ. Ctrs., Inc. of Cal., </em>31 F.3d 209, 214 (4th Cir. 1994). See also 29 C.F.R. Part 1630 App., at 401 (2012) (\u201cemployer need not provide the applicant or employee without a disability with a reasonable accommodation because that duty only applies to qualified applicants or employees with disabilities. Thus, for example, an employee would not be entitled to a modified work schedule as an accommodation to enable the employee to care for a spouse with a disability\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Because an individual associated with a handicapped person is not entitled to reasonable accommodation under the ADA, the types of cases that fall within the intended scope of the ADA\u2019s \u201crarely litigated . . . association section\u201d are sharply limited. <em>Larimer, supra. </em>One type of case, as here, is where a \u201cspouse has a disability that is costly to the employer because the spouse is covered by the company\u2019s health plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Another type is characterized as \u201cdisability by association,\u201d where an employer fears that a presently nondisabled employee will become disabled because of his association with a disabled person, such as through contact with a person carrying the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or because of common genetic components, such as where a relative suffers from a genetically caused disease. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The court does not decide in this case whether associational handicap discrimination under G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16), will be interpreted to extend beyond the type of case at issue here. But, where G. L. c. 151B does not expressly identify associational discrimination based on handicap as a form of unlawful employment discrimination, we should be reluctant to interpret it to be more expansive than the ADA, which expressly provides that \u201cexcluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or benefits to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a relationship or association\u201d constitutes \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against a qualified individual on the basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(4) (2006 &amp; Supp. V 2011).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">I acknowledge that the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (commission) has recognized claims of associational handicap discrimination in at least three other cases, but each of these cases involved discrimination outside the context of employment, and therefore has limited interpretive relevance in construing G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (16). See <em>Snelders </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Auth., </em>23 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 339 (2001) (housing); <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Kenmore Cafe, </em>17 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 1451 (1995) (place of public accommodation, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 98); <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Frank\u2019s Place, </em>16 Mass. Discrimination L. Rep. 1478 (1994) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-7\">It is also worthy of note that, under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a person who is not disabled but is nonetheless protected from discrimination because he is \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled is not entitled to reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12201(h) (Supp. V 2011) (employers and other covered entities \u201cneed not provide a reasonable accommodation or a reasonable modification to policies, practices, or procedures to an individual who meets the definition of disability in section 12102[1] of this title solely under subparagraph [C] of such section,\u201d which provides that an individual is considered disabled if he is \u201cbeing regarded as having such an impairment\u201d); 29 C.F.R. Part 1630 App., at 393 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
