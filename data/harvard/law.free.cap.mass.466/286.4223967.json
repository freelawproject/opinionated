L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>(\u00a7 32A [d]), which was reduced effective August 2, 2012, by St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7\u00a7 14 and 48 (Crime Bill), applies to a defendant who committed an offense prior to the effective date of the reduction, but whose conviction and sentencing did not occur until after that effective date. We conclude that to interpret the statute amending the mandatory minimum sentence in \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>not to apply to the defendant would be inconsistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>manifest intent of the Legislature that the benefits of the sentence reductions in the Crime Bill broadly apply to all those serving or subject to serving such sentences.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">1. <em>Background. </em>On June 3, 2011, the defendant sold cocaine to an undercover Framingham police officer. On October 18, 2011, he was indicted for distributing cocaine in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (c), and for being a second or subsequent offender in violation of \u00a7 32A <em>(d).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>He faced a mandatory minimum prison term of five years as a subsequent offender under the enhanced penalty provisions of \u00a7 32A <em>(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">On August 2, 2012, before the defendant\u2019s trial had commenced, the Legislature enacted the Crime Bill.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 14 of the Crime Bill amended the enhanced penalty provision of \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>by reducing the mandatory minimum sentence from five years to three and one-half years. Additionally, \u00a7 48 of the Crime Bill provided that those persons already serving a mandatory minimum sentence under the prior iteration of \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>would be eligible for parole, probation, work release, and deductions in sentence for good conduct under the more generous provisions of the amendments thereby enacted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Twenty days later, on August 22, 2012, the defendant waived his right to a jury trial on the subsequent offender indictment and was found guilty. The Commonwealth requested a State prison sentence of not less than five years based on the mandatory minimum required by \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>as it existed on the date of the offense. The judge imposed a mandatory minimum State prison sentence of three and one-half years as permitted by \u00a7 14 of the Crime Bill.* **<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Commonwealth objected to the sentence and requested that the judge, on her own motion, act under Mass. R. Crim. P. 29 (a), 378 Mass. 899 (1979), to correct the sentence so as to comply with the sentencing provisions as they existed on the date the defendant committed the offense.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge denied the Commonwealth\u2019s request without a hearing and noted that, \u201c[wjhere section 48 of [the Crime Bill] makes the sentencing changes (reductions) applicable to persons sentenced <em>after </em>the effective date of the new act even if the offense were committed <em>before </em>the effective date of the act, this request is denied\u201d (emphasis in original). Thereafter, the Commonwealth filed a petition for relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, which a single justice in the county court reserved and reported without decision to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">2. <em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Proper vehicle for Commonwealth\u2019s appeal. </em>As a preliminary matter, we consider whether G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is the proper mechanism by which the Commonwealth may appeal a purportedly illegal sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>parties that the Commonwealth\u2019s petition under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, was properly before the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 28E, sets forth a list of decisions, orders, and judgments from which the Commonwealth may take a direct appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, \u00a7 28E does not include a grant of authority for the Commonwealth to appeal an allegedly illegal sentence imposed by a judge in sentencing proceedings. Because no other statutory provision exists that authorizes the Commonwealth to appeal an illegal sentence, the Commonwealth would otherwise be left without a remedy if this court were not to exercise its superintendence powers. Because \u201c(i]t is well within this court\u2019s general superintendence power to correct a sentence that has been imposed contrary to law,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>440 Mass. 147, 150 (2003), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>422 Mass. 546, 547 (1996), we conclude that G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, is the proper means by which the Commonwealth may seek review of the imposition of an allegedly illegal sentence. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>461 Mass. 256, 257-258 (2012); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeJesus, supra </em>at 149-150; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lowder, </em>432 Mass. 92, 93 (2000); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cowan, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>410 Mass. 498, 499 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">b. <em>Applicability of the Crime Bill. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the judge was constrained to impose a sentence in accord with the mandatory minimum set forth in \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>as that section appeared on the date the defendant committed the offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>for which he was convicted, and that the defendant is not entitled to the benefit of either \u00a7 14 or \u00a7 48 of the Crime Bill. The defendant counters that the Legislature intended the Crime Bill to apply to cases pending on the Crime Bill\u2019s effective date and that he was lawfully sentenced pursuant to the reduced mandatory minimum set forth in \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">As a general rule of statutory construction, a newly enacted statute is presumptively prospective, and \u201c[t]he repeal of a statute shall not affect any punishment, penalty or forfeiture incurred before the repeal takes effect.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Second. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dotson, </em>462 Mass. 96, 100 (2012) (defendant not entitled to benefit of statutory amendment reducing penalty for disorderly person). This rule applies \u201cunless [its] observance would involve a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the law-making body or repugnant to the context of the same statute.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Section 14 of the Crime Bill amended the enhanced penalty provision under \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>by reducing the mandatory minimum sentence from five years to three and one-half years. While nothing in the text of \u00a7 14 expresses any legislative intent that its provision should be applied retroactively, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dotson, supra </em>at 101, \u00a7 48 demonstrates a clear legislative intent to confer backward-looking relief to individuals who had already been convicted of violating \u00a7 32A <em>(d) </em>and had been sentenced at the time of the Crime Bill\u2019s enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In ascertaining the intent of the Legislature, we look to \u201call [the statutory] words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.\u201d <em>Hanlon </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>286 Mass. 444, 447 (1934), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>S.S. Kresge Co., </em>267 Mass. 145, 148 (1929). In reviewing all of the provisions of the Crime Bill, it is apparent that one of its primary purposes was to significantly reduce the sentences to be served by individuals under the mandatory minimum provisions of a wide range of drug-related offenses, including \u00a7 32A <em>(d). </em>Such purpose is evident both from the reduction of those mandatory minimum sentences prospectively for new offenders, and from the provision of comparable opportunities for reduction in prison time served by those already sentenced under the prior, harsher version of those same laws. It would be anomalous, if not absurd, in this context to conclude that the Legislature intended to provide reductions for everyone except the limited class of persons who committed offenses before the amendments but were not convicted and sentenced until after the amendments\u2019 effective date. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>464 Mass. 355, 358 (2013), quoting <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Brookline, </em>435 Mass. 353, 360 (2001) (court need not adhere strictly to statutory words if to do so would lead to absurd result or contravene clear intent of Legislature); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>George W. Prescott Publ. Co., </em>463 Mass. 258, 264 (2012), quoting <em>Cote-Whitacre </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>446 Mass. 350, 358 (2006) (courts must interpret statute so as to render legislation effective, consonant with reason and common sense).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In these circumstances, we conclude that this is among those cases where construing the amendments to deny the effect of their benefits to the defendant would be \u201cinconsistent with the manifest intent of the [Legislature] or repugnant to the context of the same statute.\u201d G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The case is remanded to the county court for entry of an order denying the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for relief under G.L. c. 211, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\">We acknowledge the amicus brief of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The grand jury also returned indictments against the defendant alleging that he distributed cocaine within one hundred feet of a public park or playground, in violation of G.

The Commonwealth accordingly \u201crequested\u201d that the judge act under rule 29 (a) to correct the allegedly illegal sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b310-11\">GeneralLaws c. 211, \u00a7 3, states that this court \u201cshall have general superintendence of all courts of inferior jurisdiction to correct and prevent errors and abuses therein if no other remedy is expressly provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 28E, provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">\u201cAn appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the commonwealth by the attorney general or a district attorney from the district court to the appeals court in all criminal cases and in all delinquency cases from a decision, order or judgment of the court (1) allowing a motion to dismiss an indictment or complaint, (2) allowing a motion to suppress evidence, or (3) denying a motion to transfer pursuant to section sixty-one of chapter one hundred and nineteen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\u201cAn appeal may be taken by and on behalf of the commonwealth by the attorney general or a district attorney from the superior court to the supreme judicial court in all criminal cases from a decision, order or judgment of the court (1) allowing a motion to dismiss an indictment or complaint, or (2) allowing a motion for appropriate relief under the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The defendant also argues that a violation of his equal protection and due process rights will occur if the amendments to G.

We reject this argument because, as we previously have held, \u201c[t]he mere fact that some persons were at some later date governed by a law more favorable to them than the law which applied to the defendant is insufficient to strike down an otherwise valid statute; to hold the opposite would be either to eradicate all new statutes or to make them all retroactive.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v.
