The defendant was convicted by a Superior Court jury of four charges of possession of firearms and ammunition. The Commonwealth and the defendant agree that two of the four convictions on which sentence was imposed must be vacated because they are duplicative. The defendant, however, argues that the two convictions on lesser included offenses should be vacated, even though they carry higher penalties because of statutory sentencing enhancements applicable to repeat offenders, whereas the Commonwealth contends that the convictions carrying lesser penalties should be vacated. In the alternative, the Commonwealth asks that the case be remanded to the Superior Court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Because two of the sets of convictions and their related sentences are duplicative, constitutional and common-law principles require that two of the convictions and sentences be vacated. Because a determination as to which convictions should be vacated ordinarily rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, we remand the matter to the Superior Court so that a judge of that court may decide, in the exercise of that discretion, which conviction in each set of paired convictions should be vacated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Letkowski, </em>83 Mass. App. Ct. 847, 858-859 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 906 (2009). The defendant also challenges the lawfulness of the vehicle stop during which the firearm was seized, and the introduction at trial of testimony indicating that the police were conducting narcotics surveillance when an officer observed the defendant with a gun. As to these claims, we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress and for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\"><em>Background facts and proceedings. </em>The jury could have found the following facts. On the evening of December 15, 2009, Springfield police Officer Neil Maloney was conducting surveillance from an unmarked vehicle using binoculars. He saw the defendant approach a Honda station wagon parked on the street. A man approached the defendant, and the two had a conversation during which the defendant removed a silver firearm from his jacket and held it up against his own chest; the barrel was visible. The defendant then got into the Honda with a third man, and the vehicle was driven away. Maloney instructed other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>officers to stop the Honda. Officers stopped the vehicle and searched the defendant and the passenger. Finding nothing on their persons, an officer then searched the passenger compartment of the vehicle and discovered a loaded .22 caliber handgun under the passenger seat; the handgun was later determined to be operative. The magazine inside contained nine bullets but was capable of holding twelve. The weapon thus met the statutory definition of a large capacity firearm. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The defendant was indicted for unlawful possession of a firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>as a repeat offender, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G (c) (count 1); possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h), </em>as a repeat offender under \u00a7 10G (count 2); unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(n) </em>(count 3); and unlawful possession of a large capacity weapon, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>ini) </em>(count 4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all four underlying charges, and a separate proceeding was subsequently conducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>on the repeat offender portion of the indictments. In that proceeding, the defendant admitted to having been convicted previously of a violent crime and of narcotics distribution, and was therefore subject to sentencing enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 10G on his convictions of unlawful possession of a firearm under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(a), </em>and unlawful possession of ammunition without a firearm identification (FID) card under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h).* *</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The judge imposed concurrent, enhanced sentences under \u00a7 10G of not less than twelve and not more than fifteen years in State prison on each of the two convictions of unlawful possession of a firearm and of ammunition. Additionally, the judge imposed a concurrent sentence of not less than eight and not more than ten years on the conviction of unlawful possession of a large capacity weapon, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(m), </em>and a sentence of one day in a State prison on the defendant\u2019s conviction of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(n), </em>to run from and after the sentence on his firearm possession conviction. We transferred the defendant\u2019s appeal from the Appeals Court to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Duplicative convictions. </em>The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Massachusetts common law protect defendants against the imposition of multiple punishments for the same offense. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vick, </em>454 Mass. 418, 431, 433 n.15 (2009). The \u201cdouble jeopardy guarantee serves principally as a restraint on courts and prosecutors. The legislature remains free under the double jeopardy clause to define crimes and fix punishments; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>but once the legislature has acted courts may not impose more than one punishment for the same offense and prosecutors ordinarily may not attempt to secure that punishment in more than one trial.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161, 165 (1977).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>413 Mass. 224, 231 (1992) (Legislature has \u201cbroad power to define crimes\u201d and therefore to impose multiple punishments for the same criminal conduct). The Fifth Amendment prohibits the courts from \u201cprescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.\u201d <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 366 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Suero, </em>465 Mass. 215, 221 (2013). Where the Legislature has not stated its intent to impose multiple punishments for the same criminal conduct, we utilize the elements test set forth in <em>Morey </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>108 Mass. 433, 434 (1871), to determine whether the Legislature intended to punish the same conduct under multiple statutory offenses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>382 Mass. 387, 393 (1981). If such legislative intent cannot be discerned, the convictions are duplicative, and where a defendant has been sentenced on duplicative convictions, one of them must be vacated. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">In this case, we agree that the defendant\u2019s convictions are duplicative. His conviction under count 1, unlawful possession of a firearm, is a lesser included offense of his conviction under count 4, and thus counts 1 and 4 are duplicative.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the only ammunition found in the defendant\u2019s possession was inside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the firearm, his conviction under count 2, unlawful possession of ammunition, is a lesser included offense of his conviction under count 3, unlawful possession of a loaded firearm. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>461 Mass. 44, 52-54 (2011). See also note 2, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">When faced on appeal with two convictions that are duplicative of each other, appellate courts have generally considered it \u201cappropriate\u201d to vacate the conviction on the offense with fewer elements and \u201cto affirm the conviction on the more serious offense\u201d without remand to the trial court. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>424 Mass. 64, 69-70 (1997), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>384 Mass. 353, 358 n.6 (1981). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 54; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hoilett, </em>430 Mass. 369, 376 (1999), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mello, </em>420 Mass. 375, 398 (1995); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 227, 235 (2005), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valliere, </em>437 Mass. 366, 371-372 (2002). In such cases, where an appellate court has vacated the lesser included offense (and its lesser punishment) without remand, the decision has had little effect on the sentencing scheme devised by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Here, the decision as to which convictions to vacate may have a significant impact on the original sentencing scheme. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the one hand, were we to determine, as the defendant urges, that his convictions of unlawful possession of a firearm and of ammunition must be vacated, the defendant would be relieved of the more severe sentences imposed by the application of the repeat offender sentencing enhancement. In that event, he would face, as his most serious punishment, the eight- to ten-year sentence on his conviction of unlawful possession of a large capacity weapon. On the other hand, were we to adopt the Commonwealth\u2019s approach and vacate the defendant\u2019s convictions of unlawful possession of a large capacity firearm and of a loaded firearm, we would leave intact the convictions of the \u201clesser included\u201d offenses of unlawful possession of a firearm and of ammunition, for which the defendant received concurrent sentences of not less than twelve and not more than fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In prior decisions, we have not answered directly the question whether a trial judge must, in every instance in which convictions are duplicative, vacate the lesser included offense, or vacate the offense with the less severe penal consequences. Based on the following, we conclude that the decision as to which duplicative conviction to vacate is a discretionary one.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Courts face the question of which duplicative conviction to vacate only where the Commonwealth has not, prior to sentencing, made the decision to enter a nolle prosequi on one of the two duplicative convictions. Although the Commonwealth has significant discretion over what charges to bring and to prosecute, see note 4, supra, that discretion ends at sentencing. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 16, 378 Mass. 885 (1979);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harr</em>is, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 696, 703 (2009), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 19-20 (1923). Thus, where the Commonwealth has proceeded to sentencing without entering a nolle prosequi on a duplicative conviction, the decision is, at its essence, a sentencing decision, and the determination as to which conviction to vacate lies with the sentencing judge, who must exercise discretion to craft the most \u201cappropriate individualized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>sentence\u201d within the bounds of the applicable criminal statutes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 Mass. 88, 92 (1993) (\u201csentence should reflect the judge\u2019s careful assessment of several goals: punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 580, 586 (1991) (in fashioning sentence, \u201ca judge has discretion to consider a variety of factors and has wide latitude within the boundaries of the applicable penal statutes\u201d). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 908 (2009) (Brown, J., concurring) (\u201cto the extent that the only defect in unauthorized duplicative convictions lies in the affront they pose to double jeopardy principles, it is immaterial which convictions are dismissed .... A court should be free to fashion whatever remedy best serves the ends of justice in any particular case\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In the circumstances of this case, a trial judge could, in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>to fashion the most appropriate sentence, properly vacate either conviction.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We therefore remand the matter for a determination by a Superior Court judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, which conviction between counts 1 and 4, and which conviction between counts 2 and 3, should be vacated; and to enter sentences on the remaining two convictions in a manner that does not exceed the punishment imposed by the trial judge\u2019s original sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">We turn to the defendant\u2019s claims concerning asserted errors at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">2. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the firearm, arguing that police lacked probable cause to stop him and to search his vehicle without a warrant. In reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, \u201cwe accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Following a hearing on the motion to suppress, the judge found that Maloney and another police officer were conducting undercover narcotics surveillance in Springfield. Each was stationed in an unmarked vehicle. Maloney was familiar with the defendant \u201cas a result of prior drug arrests and convictions\u201d and had participated in arresting the defendant the previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>month for drug offenses. He noticed a Honda parked nearby and recognized it as the same vehicle that the defendant had been operating at the time of the prior drug arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Maloney, using binoculars, observed the defendant speaking to an unidentified male by the vehicle. As the two conversed, the defendant removed an object from his coat pocket and held it to his chest. Maloney saw a short silver gun barrel. Because Maloney \u201cwas aware of the defendant\u2019s drug convictions, he knew that the defendant could not possess a license to carry the firearm.\u201d Another unidentified male approached the vehicle and entered it without speaking to the defendant; the defendant got into the driver\u2019s seat and drove away. Maloney then apprised other officers of his observations and directed them to stop the vehicle. Following the stop, the occupants of the vehicle were frisked; when no weapons were found, an officer searched the vehicle and located a firearm under the passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s finding that Maloney was aware of the defendant\u2019s prior narcotic convictions was clearly erroneous and, therefore, that the officers did not have probable cause to stop him and to search his vehicle. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>407 Mass. 178, 179, 181, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 951 (1990) (merely glimpsing weapon, without reasonable basis to believe that holder is carrying it illegally, does not provide probable cause to search or arrest for firearms offense). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Maloney testified at the hearing that he was familiar with the firearms licensing laws and \u201cwas aware because of prior experience that [the defendant] did have narcotic violations and he would not be able to obtain [a] license to carry.\u201d The applicable statute prohibits the issuance of a license to carry a firearm if the applicant \u201chas, in any state or federal jurisdiction, been convicted or adjudicated a youthful offender or delinquent child for the commission of. . . a violation of any law regulating the use, possession or sale of controlled substances . . . .\u201d See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 131 <em>(d) </em>(i). On the basis of this testimony, the judge could draw the reasonable inference that, at the time of the arrest, Maloney was aware that the defendant had prior drug convictions, even though he referred to them as \u201cviolations,\u201d because Maloney knew the defendant was ineligible to obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>license to carry as a result of such convictions. The motion judge\u2019s finding that police had probable cause to stop and search the defendant was therefore not clearly erroneous. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Couture, supra </em>at 181 (no probable cause to search where police \u201chad no reason to believe, before conducting the search of the vehicle, that the defendant had no license to carry a firearm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">3. <em>Prior bad acts. </em>At the start of trial, the judge<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> allowed the defendant\u2019s motion in limine to exclude any evidence or testimony concerning his prior interactions with police. The judge ordered that, pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>441 Mass. 390, 399-400 (2004), Maloney could testify only that he was conducting surveillance, and could make no reference to drugs or to his assignment as a part of a Springfield police narcotics unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">During his testimony, however, Maloney referred to his assignment with the \u201cnarcotics bureau\u201d and said he was conducting \u201cstreet-level narcotics surveillance.\u201d Defense counsel did not object; following Maloney\u2019s testimony, however, the judge admonished the prosecutor. Nevertheless, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s questioning about the nature of his assignment on the night of the arrest, the next officer to testify also said that he was conducting narcotics surveillance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defense counsel objected to the testimony of the second officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>440 Mass. 519, 530-531 (2003), the defendant argues that this testimony constituted improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial evidence of his prior bad acts. Because the defendant objected to the second officer\u2019s testimony and the judge identified the error in the first officer\u2019s testimony sua sponte, we must determine if the admission of the testimony was prejudicial, that is, whether its admission \u201clikely affected the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Urban, </em>450 Mass. 608, 614 (2008). We conclude that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In her closing argument, the prosecutor made no mention of drug activity or other prior conduct. Although the implication that the defendant was involved with drugs was potentially prejudicial, testimony that the officers were conducting narcotics surveillance when they observed the defendant holding a firearm, without more to suggest that the defendant was the primary target of the surveillance operation, would have had little effect on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The denials of the motion to suppress and of the motion for a mistrial are affirmed. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-11\">The judge who imposed the original sentences in this case has retired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In count 1 of the indictment, the defendant was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm, G.

Without sentencing enhancement, the indictment would carry a sentence of not less than two and one-half years and not more than five years in State prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">In count 2, the defendant was charged with possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 <em>(h), </em>as a repeat offender. Conviction of this underlying offense ordinarily carries a sentence of not more than two years in a jail or house of correction and a fine of not more than $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">By agreement with the Commonwealth, the defendant pleaded guilty to counts 1 and 2 as a repeat offender with two prior convictions, bringing him under the provisions of \u00a7 10G <em>(b). </em>As relevant here, the defendant was subject as a repeat offender to an enhanced sentence of not less than ten years and not more than fifteen years in State prison on count 1 and to an enhanced sentence of not less than ten years and not more than fifteen years in State prison on count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">Count 3 charged unlawful possession of a loaded firearm under G.

See, e.g., <em>Ball </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 864 (\u201cthe only remedy consistent with the congressional intent is for the District Court, where the sentencing responsibility resides, to exercise its discretion to vacate one of the underlying convictions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Federal appellate courts considering similar cases have held that the decision of which duplicative conviction to vacate is one for the sentencing judge. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maier, </em>646 F.3d 1148, 1154 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 601 (2011) (\u201cThe choice of which count to vacate is fundamentally a sentencing decision\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Peel, </em>595 F.3d 763, 768 (7th Cir. 2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 994 (2011), and cases cited (decision as to which conviction to vacate \u201cis a matter committed to the trial judge\u2019s discretion because functionally it is a decision concerning the length of the defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>944 F.2d 1253, 1269 (6th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1112 (1992) (where \u201canomaly\u201d in sentencing guidelines produced a longer sentence on a duplicative lesser included offense than on the greater offense, \u201cwe think it is a decision for the trial court\u201d which to vacate). In contrast to proceedings under Massachusetts law, however, under Federal law, the prosecutor\u2019s unilateral authority to obtain a dismissal of some counts ends (absent permission of the defendant and the court) at the start of trial. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hector, </em>577 F.3d 1099, 1101-1103 (9th Cir. 2009) (because defendant did not consent to dismissal of duplicative conviction, judge had discretion following trial to determine which convictions to vacate). Compare Mass. R. Crim. P. 16, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>with Fed. R. Crim. P. 48(a) (requiring that prosecutor obtain \u201cleave of court\u201d to dismiss an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>indictment or complaint; \u201c[t]he government may not dismiss the prosecution during trial without the defendant\u2019s consent\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\"> We do not decide whether vacating a conviction for an offense that both carries the higher penalty and has more elements would be an abuse of discretion, but we note that the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has suggested that a judge might abuse his discretion by doing so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-10\">\u201cWhat is true is that in a case in which the lesser-included offense has fewer elements <em>and </em>is the less serious offense, vacating the sentence for the graver offense would be an abuse of discretion: imagine convicting a person of attempted murder and of murder and punishing him only for the attempt. This is not such a case; the lesser-included offense of obstruction of justice is the graver offense.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-11\"><em>United States </em>v. <em>Peel, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">We recognize also that, under the unique principles applicable to the felony-murder rule, the underlying felony is always considered a lesser included offense that will be vacated as duplicative. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>425 Mass. 685, 692 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\">The trial judge was also the judge who ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b216-9\">We are troubled by the officers\u2019 conduct in testifying concerning their assignments, in clear violation of a judge\u2019s explicit ruling. Whether their testimony was a consequence of the prosecutor\u2019s failure properly to prepare the witnesses, or a deliberate effort to evade the judge\u2019s restriction, the officers should not have testified as they did.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
