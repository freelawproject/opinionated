We must determine the effect of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>132 S. Ct. 2455 (2012), on the sentencing of juvenile defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> convicted of murder in the first degree under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Miller, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory imposition of sentences of life without parole on homicide offenders who were juveniles at the time of their crimes violates the bar against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2469. Additionally, we held today in <em>Diatchenko </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., ante </em>655, 658-659 (2013), that all sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>whether mandatory or discretionary, violate art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. We now hold that Brown is entitled to the benefit of <em>Miller </em>and <em>Diatchenko </em>and that he may not be sentenced to life without parole. He may only be sentenced to the lesser punishment under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, of mandatory life in prison with the possibility of parole set pursuant to the parole eligibility statute in effect at the time of Brown\u2019s crime, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, as amended through St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 230, providing for parole eligibility in fifteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">1. <em>Background. </em>In August, 2012, Marquise Brown was tried and convicted in the Superior Court of murder in the first degree for the killing of Tyriffe Lewis along with three related weapons charges. The murder took place on June 20, 2009, when Brown was seventeen years old. While Brown was awaiting trial, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>132 S. Ct. 2455. In <em>Miller, </em>the Court held that mandatory sentences of life without parole for juvenile homicide offenders violate the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2460. Under <em>Miller, </em>juvenile defendants convicted of homicide crimes may not be sentenced to life without parole unless the sentencing judge or jury is afforded an opportunity to consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cyouth and attendant characteristics\u201d before determining that the defendant is the \u201crare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2469, 2471.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Under the statutory sentencing scheme in Massachusetts, however, all defendants over the age of fourteen who are convicted of murder in the first degree must be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The sentence is mandatory. Consequently, after the jury returned its verdict in Brown\u2019s case, the trial judge stayed sentencing at the request of both parties to permit briefing on the effect of <em>Miller </em>on the sentencing of Brown. The Commonwealth then made a motion requesting that the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>judge report questions of law to the Appeals Court under Mass. R. Crim. P. 34, as amended, 442 Mass. 1501 (2004), to clarify how <em>Miller </em>should be applied in Brown\u2019s case. The judge denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion and in her order explained her planned sentencing approach. She first concluded that because the Legislature had not prescribed the procedures for the individualized sentencing hearing contemplated by <em>Miller </em>(a <em>\u201cMiller </em>hearing\u201d), the sentence of life without parole could not be imposed on Brown at all. The judge then concluded that the appropriate approach would be to apply principles of severability to construe the sentencing statutes as if excising the provisions that would be unconstitutional as applied to a juvenile defendant. What remained of the statute, then, was the punishment typically imposed for murder in the second degree: Ufe with the possibility of parole. According to the judge, the date of parole eligibility for Brown would be set based on the version of G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, in effect at the time of Brown\u2019s crime, which would make Brown parole eligible in fifteen years. G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In response to the judge\u2019s order, the Commonwealth requested that sentencing again be stayed while it sought relief under G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3. The judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s request without opposition. The single justice reserved and reported this entire matter without questions to the full court, and Brown has yet to be sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">2. <em>Application of </em>Miller <em>and </em>Diatchenko. The United States Supreme Court has held that new decisional law must be applied to criminal prosecutions that are not yet final when the decision is issued. See <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 328 (1987). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>407 Mass. 296, 299 (1990). Brown\u2019s criminal conviction is not final and appealable under Massachusetts law because he has not yet been sentenced. See <em>Doe, Sex Offender Registry Bd. No. 10800 </em>v. <em>Sex Offender Registry Bd., </em>459 Mass. 603, 621 (2011) (\u201cIn criminal cases, the final judgment is the sentence\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Das</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>calakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 19 (1923). Consequently, because Brown\u2019s criminal case was pending at the time the decision in <em>Miller </em>was issued, he is entitled to the benefit of <em>Miller\u2019s </em>prohibition of mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles. Similarly, our decision today in <em>Diatchenko </em>also will apply to Brown\u2019s case. In <em>Diatchenko </em>we held that any sentence of life without parole for juveniles, whether mandatory or discretionary, violates art. 26. See <em>Diatchenko, supra </em>at 658-659. Thus, because Brown was a juvenile at the time of his crime, he may not be sentenced, whether automatically or after a sentencing hearing, to life without the possibility of parole. See <em>Miller, 132 S. </em>Ct. at 2460; <em>Diatchenko, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"><em>3. Sentencing. </em>Following Brown\u2019s trial and conviction, the judge determined that <em>Miller </em>precluded applying to Brown the mandatory sentence of life without parole for murder in the first degree provided by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2. She further ruled that it would be improper for her to conduct a <em>Miller </em>hearing without guidance from the Legislature as to the specific contours of that proceeding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because <em>Miller </em>requires such a hearing prior to the imposition of a sentence of life without parole, the judge also determined that the only appropriate sentence for Brown would be the less severe penalty of life with the possibility of parole that is commonly imposed for murder in the second degree. Thus, in order to give effect to the discernible intent of the Legislature, the judge planned to impose on Brown as much of the sentencing scheme set forth in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, as would be permissible in light of <em>Miller\u2019s </em>prohibition against mandatory sentences of life without parole for juveniles.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We agree with this approach. The Legislature expressly has adopted the principle of severability of statutory provisions. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 6, Eleventh, inserted by St. 1983, c. 210 (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>provisions of any statute shall be deemed severable, and if any part of any statute shall be adjudged unconstitutional or invalid, such judgment shall not affect other valid parts thereof\u201d). This rule emerged at common law as a means of effectuating the Legislature\u2019s intent to the extent permitted by constitutional principles. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chou, </em>433 Mass. 229, 238 (2001); <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Kowalski, </em>380 Mass. 663, 670 (1980); <em>Del Duca </em>v. <em>Town Adm\u2019r of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1, 13 (1975). Additionally, our precedents establish that when a statutory provision is held unconstitutional, the valid portions of the statute should be preserved if the invalid provision is separable from the remainder of the statute. The unconstitutional provision is separable if the remaining provisions \u201cstand alone,\u201d meaning that those provisions are not so intertwined with the invalid provision that the Legislature could not reasonably have enacted the constitutional portions without those held unconstitutional. <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>444 Mass. 128, 137-138 (2005), quoting <em>Boston Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>387 Mass. 531, 540 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Petranich, </em>183 Mass. 217, 220 (1903). Furthermore, we have recognized the general rule that where a statute is unconstitutional as applied to a particular class of cases, but not to other classes of cases, the statute may be preserved and held to apply only to those other classes so long as such a result appears to comport with the Legislature\u2019s general purposes. See <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>316 Mass. 318, 322 (1944), quoting <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxation, </em>272 Mass. 422, 426 (1930). See also 2 N.J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 44:18, at 659 (7th ed. 2009) (\u201c[If] a single section of a statute contains language susceptible of applications, some of which are invalid[, t]he statute should be upheld if, after deletion of the invalid section, a workable statute remains\u201d). Indeed, when the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, in its current form, the Legislature expressly declared its intent that the provisions of the act be severable, meaning that should any individual provisions of the act be held invalid, the remaining provisions should continue to be given effect. St. 1982, c. 554, \u00a7 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Here, one application of one portion of the sentencing scheme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>for murder in the first degree has been rendered unconstitutional. The clauses in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, that except murder in the first degree from parole eligibility are unconstitutional as applied to juvenile defendants. See <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2469; <em>Diatchenko, supra </em>at 667, 671. It is reasonable to conclude, however, that what remains of the sentencing scheme set forth in these statutes, specifically, the sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole in no fewer than fifteen years, would have been enacted by the Legislature even without the provision imposing mandatory life without parole for murder in the first degree. Life with parole in no fewer than fifteen years is the next most severe sentence in Massachusetts imposed for the next most severe murder offense, murder in the second degree. See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2. When no harsher penalty is available, it is reasonable to conclude that the Legislature would impose the next most severe penalty provided in its sentencing scheme on defendants convicted of the most severe crime in that scheme. Additionally, in other circumstances we have permitted sentencing according to the next most severe lesser included offense for defendants convicted under criminal statutes deemed unconstitutional. For example, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bongarzone, </em>390 Mass. 326, 336-337, 352 (1983), where a portion of the criminal statute for trafficking in marijuana had been rendered void for vagueness, we allowed sentencing of the defendants according to the valid penalty statute for the next most severe lesser included possession offense for which the defendants had necessarily been convicted. Similarly, when the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 (1972), vacated certain death penalty sentences in Massachusetts, we held that defendants could be sentenced to life in prison, the next most severe penalty set forth by statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cassesso, </em>368 Mass. 124, 125 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We acknowledge that severing the unconstitutional applications of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, results in the functional equivalent of sentencing a defendant convicted of murder in the first degree to the punishment commonly imposed for murder in the second degree. However, we conclude that this result is preferable to either of the approaches suggested by the Commonwealth and Brown because the principles of severability help to ensure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>courts preserve as much as possible of the expressed intent of the Legislature while adhering to constitutional requirements. See <em>Lowell, </em>380 Mass. at 670. The sentencing approaches suggested by the Commonwealth and Brown each go beyond the expressed intent of the Legislature and the holding of <em>Miller </em>and propose crafting new sentencing schemes virtually from whole cloth. We decline to engage in that sort of judicial lawmaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The Commonwealth argues that sentencing judges have the inherent authority both to conduct <em>Miller </em>hearings and to identify a \u201cdistinct disposition\u201d for cases in which juvenile defendants are convicted of murder in the first degree. The Commonwealth would have judges draw on existing sentencing procedures under Mass. R. Crim. P. 28 (b), 378 Mass. 898 (1979), commonly utilized in sentencing for crimes in which the sentence is not mandatory,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 7along with the factors referenced in <em>Miller,\u2019</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to establish the substance and scope of a <em>Miller </em>hearing. The Commonwealth further contends that if, after conducting this new <em>Miller </em>hearing, the sentencing judge determines that parole eligibility for a juvenile convicted of murder in the first degree is appropriate, the judge has the authority to set the date of parole eligibility according to the nature of the crime and customary usage in the Commonwealth. Thus, according to the Commonwealth, in setting a juvenile offender\u2019s parole eligibility date for murder in the first degree, the judge need not be limited by the statute for the next most severe lesser included offense of murder in the second degree. Rather, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Commonwealth argues, the sentencing judge may draw on the authority granted by the Legislature under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 5, to set a parole eligibility date for a juvenile convicted of murder in the first degree as if the Legislature never had established a penalty for this crime. See G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 5 (\u201cIf no punishment for a crime is provided by statute, the court shall impose such sentence, according to the nature of the crime, as conforms to the common usage and practice in the commonwealth \u201d). As a limit on this authority, the Commonwealth further suggests that sentencing judges could look to recent revisions to the parole eligibility statute that permit judges to set parole eligibility for murder in the second degree and other life-sentence crimes at fifteen to twenty-five years. Judges could use that range, the Commonwealth suggests, to justify setting the parole eligibility for juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree at twenty-five years or more. Ultimately, the Commonwealth contends that its approach would be more consonant with the Legislature\u2019s goal of a graduated sentencing scheme than would simply applying the next most severe penalty that has already been articulated by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Taken as a whole, however, the Commonwealth\u2019s approach would have sentencing judges creating an entirely new penalty scheme ad hoc. The Commonwealth would require sentencing judges to define the substantive parameters of a <em>Miller </em>hearing by drawing from existing criminal procedures that are not directly applicable to crimes with mandatory sentences along with dictum in <em>Miller </em>that identifies the factors that may be relevant to a hearing intended to determine only whether a juvenile may be sentenced to life <em>without </em>parole. See <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2468. Further, the Commonwealth would permit sentencing judges to set parole eligibility for juvenile offenders at a date determined not by the Legislature but by the judge\u2019s own sense of what accords with the nature of the crime, using only as a starting point the limits set forth in a revised parole eligibility statute that does not apply to Brown at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">It is the province of the Legislature to define crimes and set penalties in the first instance. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyles, </em>423 Mass. 717, 721 (1996), quoting <em>Weems </em>v. <em>United States, </em>217 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>U.S. 349, 379 (1910) (\u201cThe function of the [L]egislature [in defining crimes and their punishments] is primary, its exercises fortified by presumptions of right and legality, and is not to be interfered with lightly, nor by any judicial conception of their wisdom or propriety\u201d). See also <em>Cepulonis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 495, 497 (1981), and cases cited. Although we acknowledge courts\u2019 statutory authority under G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 5, to impose sentences when the Legislature has not established the punishment for a particular crime, we prefer to adhere to our strong policy of preserving existing legislative enactments when certain provisions, or applications of those provisions, have been rendered unconstitutional. See <em>Massachusetts Pub. Interest Research Group </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>375 Mass. 85, 91 (1978). Indeed, in this case the Legislature has not been silent as to the appropriate punishments for murder crimes. It has enacted a comprehensive sentencing scheme that remains valid as applied to adults. Although one application of one portion of its sentencing scheme has been rendered unconstitutional, we seek to preserve as much as possible of the scheme the Legislature has actually established. See <em>id.; Ferguson, </em>316 Mass. at 322. In our view, applying the doctrine of severability to the existing sentencing statute for murder crimes adheres much more closely to the Legislature\u2019s expressed intent than drawing on the variety of sources the Commonwealth recommends.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Our concern for judicial law-making in this area also informs our rejection of Brown\u2019s proposed sentencing approach. Brown agrees that it is the role of the Legislature, not the courts, to establish the procedures required for a <em>Miller </em>hearing. Brown goes further, however, to argue that despite <em>Miller\u2019s </em>narrow holding, which prohibits only the automatic imposition of sentences of life without parole on juvenile homicide offenders, when taken as a whole, <em>Miller </em>calls for multiple discretionary sentencing options in all cases in which a juvenile is sentenced to a prison term. Brown also argues that art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and its bar against cruel or unusual punishment prohibits mandatory sentencing in all cases for juveniles. Thus Brown contends that the only appropriate sentence to which he may be subjected is the sentence for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>next most severe homicide offense that provides a range of discretionary sentencing options: the voluntary manslaughter penalty under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13. This statute provides that a defendant convicted of manslaughter may not be sentenced to more than twenty years in prison and thereby permits sentencing judges to exercise discretion in setting a particular defendant\u2019s prison term.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">We disagree with Brown\u2019s proposed sentencing approach, however, because neither <em>Miller </em>nor <em>Diatchenko </em>precludes mandatory sentencing for juveniles in all circumstances. The holding of <em>Miller </em>was cabined specifically to the need for discretion in imposing the \u201cparticular penalty\u201d of life without parole. Miller, 132 S. Ct. at 2471 (\u201cOur decision . . . mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process . . . before imposing <em>a particular </em>penalty\u201d [emphasis added]); <em>id. </em>at 2475 (\u201c[A] judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating circumstances before imposing <em>the harshest possible penalty </em>for juveniles\u201d [emphasis added]). Indeed, the Court\u2019s application of its individualized sentencing line of precedents to a nondeathpenalty sentence was based on the reasoning that life without parole is uniquely akin to the death penalty in that both punishments condemn the defendant to die in prison. <em>Id. </em>at 2466, 2467. Thus, the reasoning of <em>Miller </em>does not necessarily extend to mandatory sentences that afford the possibility of release. <em>Id. </em>at 2466, quoting <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>560 U.S. 48, 69 (2010) (\u201cLife-without-parole terms . . . \u2018share some characteristics with death sentences that are shared by no other sentences\u2019 \u201d). Furthermore, the State sentencing statutes at issue in <em>Miller </em>both set forth mandatory minimum life sentences. See <em>id. </em>at 2461, 2463, citing Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-4-104(b) (1997) and Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-5-40(9), 13A-6-2(c) (1982). If the Court in <em>Miller </em>had intended to invalidate all mandatory life sentences for juveniles, it could have reached that issue. Instead, Milleds holding was decidedly narrow, requiring discretionary sentencing of juveniles under the Eighth Amendment only when considering imposition of the State\u2019s \u201charshest possible penalty\u201d for juveniles: life without parole. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 2469, 2475. Indeed, if the Supreme Court had in fact held that all mandatory life sentences for juveniles, or all mandatory sentences of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>length, violated the Eighth Amendment, Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s dissent would not have criticized the Court\u2019s holding as establishing a principle that could in the future justify prohibiting all mandatory sentences for juveniles.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Additionally, to interpret <em>Miller </em>as broadly as Brown advocates would upset a host of statutory punishment schemes in the Commonwealth that incorporate mandatory minimum sentences that may be applied to defendants who were juveniles at the time of their crimes.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See, e.g., G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32E (a) (1) (punishment for trafficking in marijuana between fifty and one hundred pounds: not less than two and one-half years in State prison); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 17 (punishment for armed robbery committed while masked or armed with firearm: not less than five years in State prison); G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22B (c) (punishment for rape of child by force or threat of force while victim is tied, bound, or gagged: not less than fifteen years in State prison); G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 14 (punishment for burglary committed while armed with firearm: not less than fifteen years in State prison); G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 11B (punishment for possession of firearm with serial number removed: not less than two and one-half years in State prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Although <em>Miller </em>certainly emphasizes that juveniles are \u201cconstitutionally different\u201d for the purposes of sentencing, it does so not to set forth the rule that juvenile sentencing must always be discretionary but to support its rationale for holding that a mandatory penalty of life without parole, when imposed on a juvenile, can be disproportionate in a sense that contravenes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the Eighth Amendment. <em>Miller, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2464, 2465-2466 (\u201cBy removing youth from the balance \u2014 by subjecting a juvenile to the same life-without-parole sentence applicable to an adult \u2014 these laws prohibit a sentencing authority from assessing whether the law\u2019s harshest term of imprisonment proportionately punishes a juvenile offender\u201d). Thus, according to <em>Miller\u2019s </em>reasoning, only when a juvenile is sentenced to a \u201cforfeiture that is irrevocable\u201d is discretionary sentencing a constitutional requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 2466, 2469. Furthermore, although our holding in <em>Diatchenko </em>also acknowledges children\u2019s unique potential for rehabilitation and reform, our holding does not prohibit the imposition of life sentences, even mandatory ones, on juvenile defendants, so long as they are made eligible for parole. See <em>Diatchenko, supra </em>at 671. We disagree with Brown\u2019s argument that the only constitutionally permissible sentencing scheme for a juvenile defendant convicted of murder in the first degree is the discretionary sentencing range set forth in the voluntary manslaughter statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13, and we leave for another day the broader question whether discretion is constitutionally required in all instances of juvenile sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the sentencing judge\u2019s proposed application of severability principles to G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, in order to sentence Brown within the confines of <em>Miller </em>was correct, and we emphasize the importance of \u201cavoid[ing] judicial legislation in the guise of new constructions to meet real or supposed new popular viewpoints, preserving always to the Legislature alone its proper prerogative of adjusting the statutes to changed conditions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 595 (1975), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Isenstadt, </em>318 Mass. 543, 548 (1945). Thus, Brown, who has been convicted of murder in the first degree, must be sentenced under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2. However, the first half of the fourth sentence of this statutory provision, which excepts convictions of murder in the first degree from parole eligibility, may not be applied to Brown under <em>Miller </em>and <em>Diatchenko. </em>What remains of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, for Brown, then, is a mandatory sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole. This punishment is equivalent to the sentence provided for murder in the second degree under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2. Therefore, as in the case of convictions of murder in the second degree, in setting the date of parole eligibility, sentencing judges must refer to the parole eligibility statute, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A. Here, too, judges must utilize the doctrine of severability and construe the statute as if omitting the exception for parole eligibility for murder in the first degree when applying the statute to juveniles. Thus, juveniles like Brown who are convicted of murder in the first degree shall be eligible for parole within the time period provided under G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">4. <em>Remaining issues. </em>We acknowledge that applying G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 2, and G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, in the manner we have described is an imperfect solution to our invalidation of the sentencing scheme for murder in the first degree as applied to juvenile defendants. Indeed, we are cognizant of the potential inequalities in sentencing that may arise as a result of our holding today, particularly as our decision may be applied in the context of the Legislature\u2019s amendment to the parole eligibility statute. See G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, as amended through St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39. Under G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, as amended by St. 2012, c. 192 (Crime Bill), sentencing judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>may set parole eligibility between fifteen and twenty-five years for an offender convicted of a mandatory life-sentence crime committed on or after August 2, 2012. G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, as amended through St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39; G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, as amended through St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 46. As a result of our decision today, in the case of juvenile defendants convicted of homicide crimes committed after August 2, 2012, both murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree are mandatory life-sentence crimes with parole eligibility to be set between fifteen and twenty-five years. Thus, until the statutory sentencing scheme is further amended, sentencing judges effectively will be required to apply one discretionary parole eligibility range to juveniles convicted of two different crimes. This requirement could well give rise to disparate sentencing for juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. For example, a juvenile defendant could be convicted, whether by trial or guilty plea, of murder in the <em>second </em>degree for a killing committed after August 2, 2012, when the Crime Bill took effect. The judge could then exercise the discretion permitted by the new version of the parole eligibility statute and set that juvenile\u2019s parole eligibility at a time longer than the minimum term \u25a0\u2014 perhaps twenty years. Simultaneously, another juvenile defendant could be convicted of murder in the <em>first </em>degree for a killing committed after August 2, 2012. There, the judge would first apply severability principles to G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133 A, and omit the exception to parole eligibility for juveniles convicted of murder in the first degree. The judge could then exercise the discretion permitted by the statute and set the date of parole eligibility for this juvenile at the minimum term of fifteen years. Both of these applications of the statute could be proper, but as a result of applying the same discretionary parole-eligibility range to these two defendants, a juvenile convicted of the lesser crime of murder in the second degree could be sentenced to a lengthier minimum term than the juvenile convicted of the more severe crime of murder in the first degree. Although we do not go so far as to determine whether such a circumstance would constitute a violation of, for example, art. 26 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights or the equal protection clause of art. 1, this scenario admittedly raises such concerns. Consequently, we em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>phasize that the application of severability principles in sentencing juveniles like Brown is a temporary remedy \u2014 one that we hope the Legislature will soon address by creating a new, constitutional sentencing scheme for juveniles convicted of homicide crimes.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>We remand this case to the county court for entry of a judgment denying the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for relief and remanding this case to the Superior Court for sentencing proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-8\">We use the term \u201cjuvenile defendants\u201d here to refer to defendants who were under the age of eighteen on the date of their crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\">We acknowledge the amicus brief filed in support of Brown by American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Racial Justice at Harvard Law School, Children\u2019s Law Center of Massachusetts, Citizens for Juvenile Justice, Juvenile Rights Advocacy Project at Boston College Law School, the Child Advocate for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, Massachusetts Association of Court Appointed Attorneys, Massachusetts Bar Association, and seventeen law school professors from Massachusetts law schools; by Citizens for Juvenile Justice, Children\u2019s Law Center of Massachusetts, Children\u2019s League of Massachusetts, Home for Little Wanderers, and the Child Advocate for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; by Juvenile Law Center, Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, Citizens for Juvenile Justice, Defender Association of Philadelphia, Massachusetts Alliance for Families, Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, National Legal Aid and Defenders Association, Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia, Youth Law Center, and the Child Advocate for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and by Herby J.

G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 72A, as amended through St. 2013, c. 84, \u00a7 23.

L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, as amended through St. 2000, c. 159, \u00a7 230, which will result in a mandatory sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole in fifteen years. This statute was amended by St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7\u00a7 37-39, to provide discretion in sentencing defendants convicted of murder in the second degree to life in prison with the possibility of parole between fifteen and twenty-five years. See G. L. c. 279, \u00a7 24, as amended through St. 2012, c. 192, \u00a7 46. This discretionary range will not apply to Brown, however. As a general rule, a statute that enhances the possible penalty for a crime committed when an earlier version of the statute was in effect may never apply retroactively to a criminal defendant. See art. I, \u00a7 9, of the United States Constitution; art. 24 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bargeron, </em>402 Mass. 589, 590 591 (1988), citing <em>Colder </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dali.) 386, 390 (1798) (listing four types of ex post facto laws, including \u201c[e]very law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed\u201d [emphasis omitted]). Because the 2012 amendment to G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 133A, permits sentencing a defendant to life with the possibility of parole in up to twenty-five years, it enhances the potential penalty annexed to Brown\u2019s crime. Thus, any imposition of the current version of the statute on Brown, whose crime was committed in June, 2009, would be barred as an ex post facto law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">We leave to the sound discretion of the Legislature the specific contours of a new sentencing scheme for juveniles convicted of homicide crimes, including the length of any mandatory prison term or the minimum and maximum term of any discretionary sentencing or parole-eligibility ranges. We emphasize, however, that a constitutional sentencing scheme for juvenile homicide defendants must take account of the spirit of our holdings today here and in <em>Diatchenko, </em>and avoid imposing on juvenile defendants any term so lengthy that it could be seen as the functional equivalent of a sentence of life without parole.
