Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant pled guilty to simple possession of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (1982), which, under the circumstances of this case, carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for one year, a fine of at least $1000, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">Under the United States Sentencing Commission\u2019s guidelines, which apply here, appellant\u2019s offense \u2014 simple possession of cocaine \u2014 has a base offense level of 6. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D2.1(a)(2) (Jan. 15, 1988). Because appellant accepted responsibility for her crime, the district court reduced appellant\u2019s offense level by 2. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1. Thus, appellant\u2019s total offense level was 4. An evaluation of appellant\u2019s criminal history produced a criminal history category of I. For such offenders, the guidelines prescribe a sentencing range of 0-4 months incarceration. <em>See id. </em>Ch. 5, Part A. Because of the amount of cocaine in the appellant\u2019s possession and appellant\u2019s role in her offense, the district court departed from this range and sentenced appellant to prison for eleven months, to be followed by a one-year term of supervised release, and fined her $2525. Appellant now appeals her sentence, contending that the guidelines foreclosed the district court\u2019s reasons for departing from the guidelines range. We find that the court proceeded properly and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">The Sentencing Reform Act, Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 211, 98 Stat.1987 (codified, as amended, in scattered sections of 18 and 28 U.S.C.), authorizes the sentencing court to depart from the guideline sentencing range if \u201cthe court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines,\u201d and the court believes that the circumstance \u201cshould result in a sentence different from that [prescribed by the guidelines].\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b) (West Supp.1989). In deciding to depart from the guidelines, the district court concluded that the sentencing guidelines did not adequately take into account two circumstances of appellant\u2019s offense. We consider those circumstances in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-11\">The district court concluded that the amount of cocaine involved in appellant\u2019s offense \u2014 228 grams \u2014 warranted an upward departure from the guidelines sentencing range. Appellant contends that the district court erred in considering the amount of narcotics as a basis for a departure. Specifically, appellant notes that in fashioning guidelines for other narcotics offenses, the Commission explicitly considered the quantity of the drugs involved. <em>See, e.g., </em>Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2D1.1 (Oct. 1987). In fashioning the guideline for simple possession of narcotics, however, the Commission made no reference to quantity. Appellant therefore argues that the Commission intended that the sentencing judge should not consider the quantity of the drugs involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-12\">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently addressed this issue in <em>United States v. Ryan, </em>866 F.2d 604 (3d Cir.1989). In arriving at its decision, the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1070-13\">At various points throughout the sentencing guidelines, the drafters provided direction as to when departure from the guidelines is warranted. In chapter one, Part A, 4(b) of the guidelines, the Commission noted that although, in principle, it could have prevented a court from using a particular factor as grounds for departure by specifying that the Commission had adequately considered it, it had declined to do so. The Commission explained that it intended sentencing courts to treat the initial set of guidelines \u201cas carving out a \u2018heartland,\u2019 a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>guideline describes. When a court finds an atypical case, one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm, the court may consider whether a departure is warranted.\u201d It continued that with a few specific exceptions, \u201cthe Commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors (whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines) that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-5\">The Commission went on to explain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-6\">The Commission has adopted this departure policy for two basic reasons. First is the difficulty of foreseeing and capturing a single set of guidelines that encompasses the vast range of human conduct relevant to a sentencing decision. The Commission also recognizes that in the initial set of guidelines it need not do so. The Commission is a permanent body, empowered by law to write and rewrite guidelines, with progressive changes, over many years. By monitoring when courts depart from the guidelines and by analyzing their stated reasons for doing so, the Commission, over time, will be able to create more accurate guidelines that specify precisely where departures should and should not be permitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-7\">Second, the Commission believes that despite the court\u2019s legal freedom to depart from the guidelines, they will not do so very often. This is because the guidelines, offense by offense, seek to take account of those factors that the Commission\u2019s sentencing data indicate make significant difference in sentencing at the present time....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyH0\">The Commission then discussed three potential kinds of departure. The third kind of departure, the type involved here, is \u201cunguided\u201d departure. The Commission stated that unguided departure</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3c\">may rest upon grounds referred to in Chapter 5, Part H [none of which are applicable here] or on grounds not mentioned in the guidelines.... The Commission recognizes that there may be cases ... in which a departure outside suggested levels is warranted. In its view, however, such cases will be highly unusual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-9\">Further guidance is provided in the policy statement in \u00a7 5K2.0 of the guidelines, entitled \u201cGrounds for Departure,\u201d which provides in part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-10\">Circumstances that may warrant departure from the guidelines pursuant to [18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(b)] cannot, by their very nature, be comprehensively listed and analyzed in advance. The controlling decision as to whether and to what extent departure is warranted can only be made by the court at the time of sentencing.... Any case may involve factors in addition to those identified that have not been given adequate consideration by the Commission. Presence of any such factor may warrant departure from the guidelines, under some circumstances, in the discretion of the sentencing judge. Similarly, the court may depart from the guidelines, even though the reason for departure is listed elsewhere in the guidelines (e.g., as an adjustment or specific offense characteristic), if the court determines that, in light of unusual circumstances, the guideline level attached to that factor is inadequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-11\">... [A] factor may be listed as a specific offense characteristic under one guideline but not under all guidelines. Simply because it was not listed does not mean that there may not be circumstances when that factor would be relevant to sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1071-12\">To the extent that Ryan argues that the Commission\u2019s express references to quantity and purity of drugs in the context of other drug-related offenses indicate an intent to exclude these factors from consideration in sentencing for simple possession, the foregoing language from the guidelines suggests the contrary. Not only did the Commission indicate that a factor listed under one guideline may be relevant to sentencing under a different guideline making no reference to such factor, but it expressly stated that its failure to specifically reject various factors was designed to <em>permit </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>departure, not, as Ryan proposes, to foreclose it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 606-08 (footnotes omitted); <em>accord United States v. Correa-Vargas, </em>860 F.2d 35 (2d Cir.1988). We agree with the Third Circuit\u2019s analysis; accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in considering the amount of narcotics possessed by appellant in deciding whether to depart from the guideline sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">The district court also considered appellant\u2019s role in her offense in determining that a departure was warranted. Appellant notes that the guidelines specifically consider a defendant\u2019s role in the offense in assessing the appropriate guideline range. <em>See </em>Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.1 (aggravating role); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (mitigating role). Appellant therefore argues that because the evidence was insufficient in her case to support a finding that she played an \u201caggravating role\u201d in her offense, the guidelines precluded the district court from considering her role in deciding whether to depart from the guideline sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">We do not believe that a sentencing judge is precluded from considering a defendant\u2019s role in the offense merely because her action did not rise to the level of an aggravating role, as defined by guideline 3B1.1. As the Fifth Circuit observed in <em>United States v. Mejia-Orosco, </em>867 F.2d 216 (5th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 109 S.Ct. 3257, 106 L.Ed.2d 602 (1989):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-10\">Sentencing under the guidelines is not ... an exact science. Justice cannot be meted out according to mathematic formulas. The universe of potential factors that might affect the seriousness of the given offense is too broad to be refined to a mechanistic approach. The sentencing guidelines are not intended to cover all contingencies or rigidly bind district judges. The guidelines do not impose the sentence, they provide a framework for the district court to provide a sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-11\"><em>Id. </em>867 F.2d at 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-12\">Having concluded that the guidelines did not preclude the district court from considering whether to depart from the prescribed sentence range because of the amount of drugs involved in appellant\u2019s offense, we think that it follows that the court could consider appellant\u2019s role in the offense. The two factors were intertwined: the amount of drugs appellant and her accomplices possessed and the nature and extent of her involvement in the unlawful undertaking, considered together, demonstrated the seriousness of her offense. One who plays a minor role in the possession of 228 grams is obviously not as culpable as one who plays a more significant part in the same possession. In sum, the seriousness of appellant\u2019s offense was demonstrated by the amount of the cocaine involved <em>and </em>her role in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-14\">We must now determine whether the departure from the sentence range was \u201creasonable.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(f)(2) (West Supp.1989). We find nothing in the record indicating that the departure was unreasonable; in fact, we believe that the sentence was fair and just. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
