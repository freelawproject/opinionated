Bur\u00e9n proved to be less than a model employee. In 1983, he was fired because, to use Buren\u2019s own words, he \u201cevidently beat up a lady\u2019s three dogs, ... threw the mail in the lady\u2019s face and called the lady and her daughter a bitch.\u201d For reasons not altogether clear, Bur\u00e9n was reinstated in 1984. However, all was not well. On October 13, 1984, Bur\u00e9n was involved in an altercation with a supervisor, during which he held the supervisor in a bear hug and \u201cplac[ed] a pen to the [supervisor\u2019s] throat.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of this incident, the Postal Service fired Bur\u00e9n for the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-17\">Buren immediately turned to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), where he filed at least 217 charges detailing his grievances against the Postal Service, including such noteworthy complaints as the failure of an area manager to say \u201cplease\u201d when requesting Bur\u00e9n to return a box of flag pins (intended for children) that Bur\u00e9n had taken. Turning to Buren\u2019s more serious complaints, the EEOC rejected his claim that he had been discharged on a discriminatory<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or retaliatory basis, finding instead that he had been legitimately fired because of his assault on his supervisor. The EEOC also reprimanded Bur\u00e9n for \u201cblatantly overburdening] the administrative system\u201d with his frivolous complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-18\">After his failures with the EEOC, Bur\u00e9n then turned to the courts. On February 8, 1985, Bur\u00e9n filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint in the Southern District of Texas. After the district court held four separate conferences seeking to determine the nature of his claims, it found that Bur\u00e9n had at least fifteen other employment discrimination federal court suits pending against the Postal Service. Upon this discovery, the court consolidated all of these cases. Nevertheless, only six days later Bur\u00e9n filed another <em>pro se </em>complaint against the Postal Service, listing nine new claims, and after this suit was consolidated with the others he sought to amend his complaint to add another 142 claims! The district court then ordered Bur\u00e9n to file a single amended complaint listing <em>all </em>of his claims. Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>sponding with zeal, Buren submitted a twenty-one-page handwritten document containing 453 numbered paragraphs. However, on November 4, 1987, the district court granted the Postal Service\u2019s motion to dismiss Buren\u2019s claims with prejudice. The court also imposed a requirement that Buren submit any future complaints against the Postal Service to the court for review, advised him that it would dismiss any claims found to be frivolous and stated that in addition it would impose appropriate sanctions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We affirmed the district court in an unpublished opinion. <em>Buren v. United States Postal Service, </em>861 F.2d 716 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Unfortunately, Buren\u2019s sojourn through the courts has continued. On May 9, 1988, Bur\u00e9n filed yet another complaint. This complaint, like the multitude preceding it, alleged discriminatory and retaliatory discharge by the Postal Service. The district court dismissed this suit on May 24, 1988, and admonished Bur\u00e9n that it would set a criminal contempt hearing if he persisted in filing further frivolous actions. Bur\u00e9n then filed a motion to amend the above order, which was denied on June 14, 1988. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">We agree with the district court that Buren\u2019s complaint was frivolous. Furthermore, it is clear to us that this complaint is simply one more example of an ongoing pattern of vexatious, multiplicious, and frivolous litigation that has now extended for more than four years. In our first opinion regarding Bur\u00e9n, cited above, we observed that \u201c[pjlaintiff should be thankful that the district court merely dismissed his complaint rather than impos[e] Rule 11 monetary sanctions.\u201d Bur\u00e9n should heed our advice. Enough is enough. Fed.R. App.P. 38 allows us to \u201caward just damages and single or double costs to the ap-pellee\u201d if we deem an appeal to be frivolous, and Buren\u2019s litigation gives new meaning to the term \u201cfrivolous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of Buren\u2019s complaint and award the Postal Service double costs in addition to damages of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-15\">. These were the words of the supervisor. Bu-ren\u2019s only comment was that the supervisor\u2019s description was \"close enough to his own description for practical purposes.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ax1\">. Race (Caucasian), color (white), religion (Catholic), sex (male), and national origin discrimination were all alleged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">. The district court also noted Buren\u2019s own admission that \u2018\u2018his intense tracking of his multi-pie actions has so interfered with his life as to prevent his pursuit of future employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
