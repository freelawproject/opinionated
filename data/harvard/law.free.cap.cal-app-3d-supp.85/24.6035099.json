J</author>\n<p id=\"AGe\">The issues raised in this consolidated appeal and habeas corpus proceeding involve the relationship between subdivisions (f) and (ff) of section 647 of the Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as subdivision (f) and subdivision (ff)). In colloquial language the former makes it a misdemeanor to be drunk in public in such a condition that one is unable to exercise care for his or her own safety or that of others.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">Subdivision (ff) provides an alternative to criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceedings for persons arrested for violating subdivision (f).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 28\">*Supp. 28</page-number>In response to the issues raised in these proceedings we hold (1) that under current law, binding on us, we must reject an argument that it is cruel and unusual punishment to subject a chronic alcoholic who is not homeless to criminal prosecution (part III, <em>infra); </em>(2) that compliance with subdivision (\u00f1) is not an element of the offense of being drunk in public established by subdivision (f) (part IV, <em>infra); </em>(3) that in subdivision (f) prosecutions once the defendant raises the issue the People must establish their reasonable inability to comply with subdivision (ff) (part V, <em>infra); </em>and (4) that among the factors which the court may take into account in determining the People\u2019s ability to comply with subdivision (ff) are limitations of space, time and money (part VI, <em>infra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">These proceedings involve an appeal from a conviction for violation of subdivision (f) and a request for relief on habeas corpus in connection with two other such convictions. In connection with the habeas corpus matter we appointed a referee to take testimony. The referee has reported that testimony to us together with findings of fact which we adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b974-9\">Paris Ambellas is a chronic alcoholic. With respect to the arrest leading to the appealed from conviction the testimony of a Long Beach police officer was sufficient to establish Ambellas\u2019 violation of subdivision (f) (aside from issues concerning the constitutionality of the subdivision and its interrelationship with subdivision (ff) which issues we discuss below). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 29\">*Supp. 29</page-number>No evidence was received with respect to any efforts by the officer who arrested Ambellas to comply with subdivision (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">With respect to the convictions involved in the habeas corpus proceeding, the referee determined that Ambellas is not homeless in the sense that he did not have the funds to find a private place to live and do his drinking, if necessary. Ambellas\u2019 drinking career is centered in Long Beach, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">The kind of facility referred to in subdivision (fi) is a facility for the 72-hour treatment and evaluation of inebriates (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5170), commonly referred to as a detoxification center. Only one such facility has been established in Los Angeles County. It is located in the \u201cskid row\u201d area of East 5th Street in the City of Los Angeles and has a capacity of only 20 beds. As to the two convictions involved in the habeas corpus proceeding, the referee found that it would not be reasonable for the Long Beach Police Department to transport Ambellas to this facility. The factors upon which he relied and others are discussed by us in part VI of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Subdivision (F) Does Not Subject Appellant to Cruel and Unusual Punishment</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">Appellant argues that no volitional act is proscribed by subdivision (f), and that because he is a chronic alcoholic his arrest was the result of his inability to resist a compulsion to drink. Consequently, he argues that to punish him as a result of his status violates his Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. While the record on appeal would not sustain a finding that appellant was a chronic drunk the record of the habeas corpus proceeding does establish that information. Based on medical testimony the referee found that Ambellas was a chronic alcoholic. We see no reason why the fact that defendant is a chronic alcoholic should not be considered by us with respect to the offense involved in the appeal as well as the offenses involved in the writ proceeding, especially since in the six and one-half years between October 1970 and April 1977, which includes the offense involved in the appeal, appellant was arrested approximately 80 times for being under the influence of alcohol and was convicted or forfeited bail on most of those occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 30\">*Supp. 30</page-number>The Eighth Amendment argument was made in <em>In re Spinks </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 748 [61 Cal.Rptr. 743]. Appellant attempts to distinguish <em>Spinks </em>on the ground that the defendant there had pleaded guilty. Nevertheless, <em>Spinks </em>was a habeas corpus proceeding and the question whether punishing a chronic alcoholic constituted cruel and unusual punishment was the square issue which the court was called upon to decide. We are, of course, aware that much evidence\u2014not developed in this proceeding\u2014can be mustered for the argument that chronic alcoholism is a disease and that criminal punishment therefor is entirely inappropriate. However, the alleged unconstitutionality of subdivision (f) as to a defendant who is not homeless was rejected in <em>Spinks </em>based on the same arguments raised here. We are bound by that decision. <em>(Auto Equity Sales </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Proof of Compliance With Subdivision (FF) Is Not an Element of the Offense Proscribed by Subdivision (F)</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Appellant argues in effect that the provisions of subdivision (ff) are part of subdivision (f). He urges \u201cthat a simple violation\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of subdivision (f) is not an offense unless it is first shown, under the language of subdivision (fi) that the officer was not reasonably able to transport the persons arrested to a detoxification facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">As noted, subdivision (fi) requires a peace officer who is reasonably able to do so to place a subdivision (f) arrestee in \u201ccivil protective custody\u201d in a detoxification center. When that has occurred the arrestee is not subject to criminal prosecution. The program of civil protective custody for inebriates is experimental. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Colon) </em>(1972) 29 Cal.App.3d 397, 400-401 [105 Cal.Rptr. 695]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 761, 763 [139 Cal.Rptr. 152].) It is an attempt \u201cto deal with the problem of inebriates by permitting any county which wishes to participate in the program an opportunity to deal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 31\">*Supp. 31</page-number>with such people as \u2018sick\u2019 rather than as criminals.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Colon), supra, </em>at p. 400.) In accord with its experimental nature the legislative intent was to encourage establishment of detoxification facilities and to avoid the discouragement of county participation which might result if there was a blind insistance upon a minimum bed capacity beyond the funding capability of the county. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>p. 764.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">With this brief background we turn to a discussion of the contention of Ambellas and of amici that a \u201csimple violation\u201d of subdivision (f) does not constitute an offense unless the arresting officer is not reasonably able to transport the accused to the designated facility. Appellant approaches the problem by stressing the mandatory language of subdivision (ff). Amici build on this theme by asserting that a showing that the officer was not reasonably able to place a subdivision (f) arrestee in a detoxification facility is an element of the crime set forth in subdivision (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">We reject the argument that subdivision (ff) is part of the offense described in subdivision (f). In the first place the plain language of subdivision (ff) precludes such an interpretation. The opening phrase of the section is, \u201c <em>When a person has violated subdivision (f) </em>of this section, a peace officer, if he is reasonably able to do so, shall place the person, or cause him to be placed, in civil protective custody.\u201d (Italics added.) By that very language, subdivision (ff) cannot even start to come into play until a person \u201chas violated\u201d subdivision (f). In the second place case law is against this contention. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Colon), supra, </em>29 Cal.App.3d 397, the court stated that subdivision (f) and subdivision (ff) \u201care not in conflict, rather they offer alternatives\u201d <em>(id., </em>at p. 401). The court also said \u201cSection 647, subdivision (ff) is clearly severable from and creates an exception to section 647, subdivision (f),. . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 402.)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Once the Defendant Raises the Issue in a Subdivision (F) Prosecution the People Must Prove Their Reasonable Inability to Comply With Subdivision (FF)</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">In support of the argument that subdivision (ff) is an element of the subdivision (f) offense, appellant and amici remind us of the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in subdivision (ff). While we have held for the reasons stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 32\">*Supp. 32</page-number>above that subdivision (f\u00ed) is not part of the drunk in public offense proscribed by subdivision (f), we still must consider the effect of a failure of the People to place an arrestee in a detoxification center in light of that seemingly mandatory language and the benign purposes of the statute. By its language, subdivision (fi) creates a defense to subdivision (f) prosecutions. When a defendant is on trial for a subdivision (f) violation and suggests that subdivision (fi) has not been obeyed the People should be required to proceed to produce evidence of the reason for their noncompliance. The ultimate burden of proof should remain on the defendant, but he is not required affirmatively to produce evidence himself, although he may do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Subdivision (fi) categorically states that when a person has violated subdivision (f) \u201ca peace officer, if he is reasonably able to do so, <em>shall </em>place the person, or cause him to be placed in civil custody. Such person <em>shall </em>be taken to a facility. . . .\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The California Supreme Court has recently discussed at length the effect of the use of apparently mandatory language in a statute. Focusing on the effect that a failure to perform an obligatory procedure has on invalidating the governmental action to which the procedural requirement relates <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 948 [140 Cal.Rptr. 657, 568 P.2d 382]), the court has concluded that when the object of the directed act is'to subserve some public purpose and the statute is not express as to the result which follows when the act is not performed, the result is to be determined by that conclusion which will best accomplish the purpose of the statute. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee, supra, </em>at p. 962, citing <em>Morris </em>v. <em>County of Marin </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 901, 909-910 [136 Cal.Rptr. 251, 559 P.2d 606].)</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">When compliance is had with subdivision (fi), the result is that the subdivision (f) violator is completely free of the criminal process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This result obviously comports with the purpose of the statute to provide medical instead of penal treatment for one drunk in public. Accordingly, to carry out the legislative purpose, the \u201cshall\u201d language of subdivision (fi) statute must be accorded a mandatory effect and the People\u2019s failure to follow the proscribed procedure constitutes a basis for challenging the subsequent criminal prosecution. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGee, supra, </em>at p. 961.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 33\">*Supp. 33</page-number>The Legislature unfortunately has not spelled out the procedural details to be applied in a subdivision (f) trial as to how the issue of noncompliance with the statute is to be raised, and who bears the burden of proof. We believe that requiring the defendant initially to raise the issue and to bear the ultimate burden, but placing on the People the requirement of proceeding with evidence on the subject, once the defendant raises the issue, will accomplish the statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Concerning defenses \u201cwhich raise no challenge to the sufficiency of the prosecution\u2019s proof of any element of the crime charged but for reasons of public policy insulate the accused notwithstanding the question of his guilt\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury </em>(1976) 15 Cal.3d 953, 964 [127 Cal.Rptr. 135, 544 P.2d 1335]), the burden of proving the defense may be placed on the defendant. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 963-965.) In the present instance it is evident that when a defendant is placed on trial for a subdivision (f) violation he has not been accorded the benefits of subdivision (fi); if he had received those benefits there would not have been a criminal prosecution. Trial may have resulted, however, either because the officer was not reasonably able to place the particular defendant into a detoxification facility, or because the officer while reasonably able so to do had not complied with the provisions of the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">In these circumstances, the defendant who contends that the statute has not been complied with should at least be required to call the court\u2019s attention to that defense and to bear the ultimate burden of persuasion on the defensive issue of the officer\u2019s reasonable ability to put him or her in a detoxification facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">This is so because the defense does not challenge any element of the People\u2019s case under subdivision (f), but instead exists on account of reasons of public policy <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 954) and because, ordinarily, the burden of proving every element of a defense is on the one who asserts it. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Also, ordinarily, \u201c(a) The burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is on the party against whom a finding on that fact would be required in the absence of further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 34\">*Supp. 34</page-number>\u201c(b) The burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is initially on the party with the burden of proof as to that fact.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 550.)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">This rule is not absolute, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">\u201c[F]or practical reasons the burden of explanation or of going forward with the evidence is sometimes placed on a party-opponent who has information lacking to the one who asserts and seeks to establish a fact.\u201d <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Com. </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 689, 694 [263 P.2d 8]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Halopoff </em>(1976) 60 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 5-7 [131 Cal.Rptr. 531].) Here, the Legislature has chosen to make the applicability, <em>vel non, </em>of subdivision (ft) dependent upon the officer\u2019s reasonable ability to comply with it. The very statement of that test suggests that it involves considerations peculiarly within the knowledge of the People who are seeking to convict defendant of the subdivision (f) violation. Why were they, in the person of the officer involved, not reasonably able to comply with subdivision (ff)?</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Accordingly, we hold that when a defendant suggests that the People\u2019s failure to comply with subdivision (f\u00ed) should result in his acquittal, the burden shifts to the People to produce evidence of the reasons for the failure. Once that evidence has been presented the defendant is, of course, free to present other relevant evidence of his own on the issue. And, since the defense is one allowed for reasons extraneous to the guilt or innocence of the defendant <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tewksbury, supra) </em>the ultimate burden remains on the defendant to persuade the trier of fact by a preponderance of the evidence that the defense is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Factors Which May Be Considered in Determining Officer\u2019s Reasonable Ability to Comply With Subdivision (FF)</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>70 Cal.App.3d 761, it appeared that Alameda County had established a detoxification facility of limited capacity which not infrequently was unable to accommodate all of the persons referred to it. The petitioners in <em>Johnson, </em>each arrested for a subdivision (f) violation, were taken to the police station where an officer telephoned the facility and was told that there was no vacant bed available. Each was then booked and arraigned as a misdemeanant for violating subdivision (f). The <em>Johnson </em>writ proceeding followed, wherein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 35\">*Supp. 35</page-number>it was complained that petitioners had been denied the equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">It was held in <em>People </em>v. <em>McNaught, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d 599 and in <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Colon), supra, 29 </em>Cal.App.3d 397, that equal protection is not denied to inebriates prosecuted under section 647, subdivision (f) in a county which has not established a facility at all simply because another county has established such a facility. <em>Johnson </em>presented the equal protection issue on an <em>intra </em>county basis. The question was whether the petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights were violated because the facility which had been established in Alameda County was not physically large enough to accommodate them, causing them to be prosecuted on a criminal basis while other Alameda County arrestees received the benefits of subdivision (fi). The court held that despite this intracounty disparity of treatment, equal protection concepts were not violated. The court reiterated the experimental nature of the subdivision (if) program to deal with the problem of alcoholism and stated: \u201cDoubts as to efficacy of the experimental alternative can be resolved only by trying it. We find no denial of equal protection in such an experiment. The state is not required \u2018to strike at all evils at the same time\u2019 <em>(Semler </em>v. <em>Dental Examiners, </em>294 U.S. 608, 610 [79 L.Ed. 1086, 1089, 55 S.Ct. 570]). A legislature may \u2018take reform \u201cone step at a time\u201d \u2019 <em>(McDonald </em>v. <em>Board of Election, </em>394 U.S. 802, 809 [22 L.Ed.2d 739, 745, 89 S.Ct. 1404]). The equal protection guaranty is not violated \u2018whenever officials \u201cprosecute one and not [another] for the same act\u201d [citations] . . .\u2019 but \u2018simply prohibits prosecuting officials from purposefully and intentionally singling out individuals for disparate treatment on an invidiously discriminatory basis.\u2019 <em>(Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>15 Cal.3d 286, 297 [124 Cal.Rptr. 204, 540 P.2d 44].)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">\u201cHere, there is no singling out or discrimination. Each violator of section 647, subdivision (f) is sent to the civil facility if space for him is available. Only those whose offense occurs when no space is available are subject to court processing as misdemeanants. Petitioners in no way suggest the exercise of any choice by police or prosecutors as to the place of confinement. Whether the experiment succeeds, and warrants application in all counties or to all inebriates, is a matter for legislative judgment. We are disinclined to risk premature termination of the experiment by a judicial broadening of its scope at a cost we neither know nor are able to estimate.\u201d (70 Cal.App.3d at p. 765.)</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 36\">*Supp. 36</page-number>Before reaching this conclusion, the court stated in dictum \u201cIt is somewhat difficult to conceive of circumstances other than lack of space which would affect the reasonable ability of the officer to place an inebriate in the facility. The provision for county fixing of a maximum capacity indicates that capacity is the major element affecting such ability.\u201d (70 Cal.App.3d at p. 764.) We believe that many other circumstances may have an effect on the officer\u2019s reasonable ability to comply with the statute and that this record discloses some of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">In the instant habeas corpus proceeding, the referee based his finding that it was not reasonable for the Long Beach officers to transport Ambellas to the East Fifth Street detoxification center in Los Angeles on the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-5\">\u201ca. The Long Beach police officers who were involved in the arrest, which the writ addresses itself to, were not aware of any facility complying with the \u00a7 5170 of the Welfare and Institutions Code located at 541 East 5th Street in the City of Los Angeles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-6\">\u201cb. There is no policy established by the Long Beach Police Department in regard to transportation of 647f arrestees to the facility at 541 East 5th Street in the City of Los Angeles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-7\">\u201cc. Both officers testified that in order to leave the city of Long Beach, with the exception of going to the Norwalk State Hospital, or in hot pursuit of a suspected criminal, they would be forced to get the permission of their supervisor. Neither officer thought such permission in 647f arrest cases would be forthcoming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-8\">\u201cd. There is a so-called detoxification center in the city of Long Beach where the Long Beach police officers take a 647f arrestee, if the center will accept the arrestee, and if the arrestee is not likely to be the type of person they cannot handle because of his attitude at the timeJ<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>! Although neither officer in the cases concerned in the writ considered the Los Angeles facility, both officers stated that they did not take Mr. Ambellas to the Long Beach facility because he would have been troublesome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-9\">\u201ce. The following is a breakdown of the number of police cars on patrol in the city of Long Beach during the different watches:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 37\">*Supp. 37</page-number>\u201c1) Patrol Watch No. 1 from 10:30 p.m. to 8:15 a.m. There are about 24 Long Beach police vehicles assigned to patrolling the streets of Long Beach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-5\">\u201c2) Patrol Watch No. 2 from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. About 35 Long Beach police vehicles are assigned to this patrol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-6\">\u201c3) Patrol Watch No. 3 from 4:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. About 35 Long Beach police vehicles are assigned to this patrol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-7\">\u201cf. The frequency of Penal Code \u00a7 647f arrests in the city of Long Beach by Long Beach police officers is variable, but generally averages between 90 to 110 arrests per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">\u201cg. Since August 28, 1975, applicant Paris Louis Ambellas has forfeited $950 in bail for Penal Code 647f offenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-9\">\u201ch. On November 19, 1976, applicant Paris Louis Ambellas deposited $500 in bail on a appeal bond, which was subsequently exonerated and not yet returned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-10\">Note: \u201cg\u201d and \u201ch\u201d are findings of fact which are made at the request of defense attorney pursuant to a stipulation of the city prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-11\">\u201ci. Between October 1, 1970 and April 8, 1977, Paris Louis Ambellas has been arrested 79 times for violation of 647f of the Penal Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-12\">\u201cj. The nearest facility to Long Beach which complies with \u00a7 5170 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is, according to stipulation, 23 to 25 miles away at 541 East 5th Street in Los Angeles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-13\"> The referee then said: \u201cThe Court has concluded, in view of all of the above, that it was unreasonable to expect the Long Beach Police Department to transport Ambellas to the facility mentioned on these two occasions because it would be unreasonable to expect the Long Beach Police Department to deprive itself of one police car, and at least one officer, probably two, for a period of 45 minutes to an hour each time an arrest for 647f is made, which according to the findings above would be 90 to 110 times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">\u201cWhether a detoxification center complying with \u00a7 5170 of the Welfare &amp; Institutions Code should be set up in Long Beach or not is a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 38\">*Supp. 38</page-number>that this Court need not address itself to. However, it seems that since the nearest facility is 23 to 25 miles away, it was unreasonable to transport Mr. Ambellas, and it would be unreasonable to expect the Long Beach Police Department to transport every 647f arrestee who qualifies for the facility in Los Angeles. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>McNaught, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d 599, the court enumerated a number of factors which a county might take into account in determining whether to establish and maintain a detoxification center.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We see no reason why at least some of the factors suggested in <em>McN aught </em>do not also bear directly on the ability of the officer to comply with subdivision (fi) by transporting a patient to a facility which has been established in a county. Obviously, when a county decides to open a facility it must determine how much to spend on the program. It may legitimately take into account the experimental nature of the program. Its conclusion, as in Los Angeles, may be to start small and expand the operation if it proves its worth. Clearly the East 5th Street facility is woefully inadequate if approached from the viewpoint of accommodating every subdivision (f) arrestee in the county. The facility has 20 beds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 39\">*Supp. 39</page-number>Appellant states in his opening brief that in 1975 there were 80,240 arrests for subdivision (f) violations in Los Angeles County.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">It may well be that elimination of \u201csimple\u201d 647, subdivision (f) violations from the criminal system and the substitution therefor of detoxification facilities able to accommodate all arrestees would be more effective, more humane and less costly than the present outmoded criminal procedures. That, however, is a subject for attention of the board of supervisors in its capacity as the legislative and executive body of county government. The judiciary should not mandate an end to otherwise constitutional criminal procedures because there may be something better which the executive and legislative branches of government have not seen fit to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Were we to hold that Ambellas and other persons arrested in Long Beach (or Pomona or Lancaster or Malibu or any other outlying area of this far-flung county) must be considered for subdivision (fl) treatment without regard to factors of time, distance and manpower available to transport such a person to the detoxification facility, we would in effect put an end to the subdivision (fl) program in this county. \u201cIt might be tragic if section 647, subdivision (fl), had the effect contended for by defendant. While a decision in his favor would not invalidate the section, the result would necessarily be that simple section 647, subdivision (f), arrestees in [areas other than the vicinity of East Fifth Street] must be released. It is anybody\u2019s guess how the Legislature would react to such a holding. The possibility that the net result would simply be a repeal of section 647, subdivision (fl), cannot be overlooked.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McNaught, supra, </em>31 Cal.App.3d at p. 609.)</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">We decline to be so unrealistic. There is much to be said for the value of the experimental program. The widespread nature of the evil of alcoholism should be attacked on all possible fronts. The detoxification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 40\">*Supp. 40</page-number>facility is one of them.  Thus the referee\u2019s findings concerning the number of available Long Beach police officers and vehicles, the number of Long Beach arrests of violators of subdivision (f) and the time and distance involved in travelling to the only available facility all play a legitimate role in deciding whether the arresting officer was reasonably able to comply with subdivision (ff).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Concededly, this conclusion has practical difficulties since the result may well be that Long Beach arrestees, for example, will never be taken to the present subdivision (ff) detoxification facility if a court determines that it was factually reasonable under the circumstances of the particular case not to devote the manpower and expense to the transportation required. That result, however, is a by-product of the experimental nature of the program. Presumably, a proper allocation of resources will be made by the appropriate governmental bodies when and if the program proves itself of such value that it should be substituted completely for criminal procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Conclusion and Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">To sum up, we have held that under <em>In re Spinks, supra, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 748, subdivision (f) is constitutional as applied to a chronic alcoholic who is not homeless; the offense proscribed by that subdivision is complete without reference to subdivision (ff); if a defendant suggests in a subdivision (f) prosecution that the People should have placed him or her in civil protective custody, the People have the burden of going forward with evidence on that subject, the ultimate burden of proof remaining with defendant; and finally, that included in the factors which relate to a reasonable ability to place a defendant in a detoxification center are considerations relating to the number of beds available, the location of the center, the time and cost involved in transporting an arrestee to a center and the manpower available for the task.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">We must apply these conclusions to the convictions involved in the habeas corpus and appeal proceedings now before us. With respect to the two arrests and convictions involved in the habeas corpus proceedings, we do not, ourselves, need to determine in this case whether the factors enumerated by the referee which we have approved should excuse compliance with subdivision (ff). This is so because evidence of Arabellas\u2019 \u201ctroublesome\u201d character adduced in that proceeding, with respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 41\">*Supp. 41</page-number>those arrests, shows that his violation on those occasions was not of the \u201csimple\u201d kind. In other words, there is factual support for a conclusion that he would be \u201cunreasonably difficult for medical personnel to control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">No such evidence appears with respect to the arrest and conviction involved in the appeal. In their petition for rehearing, the People suggest that the subdivision (fi) issue ought to be the subject of a pretrial motion addressed to the court rather than an issue to be presented to the jury on the trial of the matter. The People also suggest that with respect to the disposition of this particular case, the proper remedy wi 1 be to allow them to present evidence to the trial court on remand as to the reasonable inability of the officer to comply with subdivision (fi).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">For both of these suggestions the People rely largely on <em>Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 286 [124 Cal.Rptr. 204, 540 P.2d 44] and on <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 948. <em>Murgia </em>involved the issue of discriminatory enforcement of the law. The court held that the question should be raised by pretrial motion to dismiss and should be decided by the court, not by a jury (15 Cal.3d at fn. 4, pp. 293-294). The reason for the decision in <em>Murgia </em>was two-fold: first, the court said the issue did not relate to the guilt or innocence of the accused but rather addressed itself to a constitutional defect in the institution of the prosecution. Second, the court said that because a claim of discriminatory prosecution generally rests upon evidence \u201ccompletely extraneous to the specific facts of the charged offense,\u201d the issue should not be raised at trial but should be submitted by pretrial motion. The court concluded that in light of the constitutional nature of the issue, the trial court, as opposed to a jury, had authority to entertain the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">It is at once apparent that the question of the officer\u2019s reasonable ability to comply with subdivision (fi) is unlike <em>Murgia </em>in that no constitutional issue is involved. Further, the subdivision (fi) question is not entirely divorced from the guilt or innocence of the accused because the subdivision comes into effect only \u201c[W]hen a person has violated subdivision (f).\u201d Still further, while evidence of the officer\u2019s reasonable ability to comply with subdivision (fi) is <em>somewhat </em>extraneous to the specific facts of the charged offense, it is not \u201ccompletely'\u2019 so as the <em>Murgia </em>court said was generally the case with discriminatory enforcement. It will be remembered that subdivision (fi) exempts from its application three classes of persons (see fn. 2, ante) and the applicability of those exemptions may depend in part on specific facts occurring in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 42\">*Supp. 42</page-number>connection with the charged offense. <em>Murgia </em>is therefore not apt authority for the People\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\"><em>People </em>v. <em>McGee, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 948, held that in a welfare fraud prosecution under Welfare and Institutions Code section 11483, the state was required to seek restitution before instituting criminal proceedings. Citing its <em>Murgia </em>decision, the court held that the issue of whether the state had sought restitution was not for the jury but was a procedural defense properly resolved by the trial court prior to trial. (19 Cal.3d at p. 967.) The court considered the <em>McGee </em>problem to be \u201ccomparable\u201d to <em>Murgia, </em>stating that the question of whether or not the state had sought restitution did not relate to the guilt or innocence of the accused but to the question of a statutory defect in the institution of the prosecution (19 Cal.3d at p. 967).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\"><em>McGee </em>is like the present case in that no constitutional issue is involved in the point under discussion. It is somewhat like the present case in that if it is established that the officer did have a reasonable ability to comply with subdivision (ff), the subdivision (f) prosecution should not have been brought. But, as noted, the question does not arise until a person \u201chas violated\u201d subdivision (f) and the fact of violation cannot be established until after trial. Therefore, it is not possible to invoke the subdivision (ff) defense by way of pretrial motion. Further, the subdivision (f) case may, as in Arabellas\u2019 case, have been tried to a jury. One of the reasons for not applying subdivision (ff) benefits to a defendant may be that he or she falls within one of the three categories of persons excluded from the statute. Whether this is so may be a factual question based on the officer\u2019s testimony concerning the arrestee\u2019s conduct at the time of arrest\u2014for example was the person one who the officer in good faith believed would be unreasonably difficult for medical personnel to control? Accordingly, <em>McGee </em>does not furnish us with apt analogy.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">The People argue that they had no chance to present testimony concerning factors such as those discussed in part VI of this opinion, because they did not know they would be required to do so. They ask that instead of reversing Arabellas\u2019 conviction, we send the matter back to the trial court with directions to hear the evidence. We do not do so. The conviction was based on jury verdict, and the jury should resolve the facts involved. By so holding, we give Arabellas the benefit of the rules established in this case which his incentive has brought about. <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1967) 388 U.S. 293, 301 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1205-1206, 87 S.Ct. 1967].) While this result is not compelled, neither is it prohibited. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 43\">*Supp. 43</page-number>Further, our reversal will not preclude the People from retrying the action if they are so minded, and given the nature of the case an inordinately lengthy trial is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">The judgment of conviction in Crim.

If a defendant in such a trial suggests subdivision (ff) as a defense, the People should readily be able to establish, through the testimony of the officer, why the defendant fell within one of the three categories of persons not entitled to subdivision (ff) benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b982-10\">This facility has not been established pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 5170 and is therefore not a facility contemplated by subdivision <em>(if).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b984-5\">We reject the first of the above reasons. The fact that the Long Beach officers in question did not know the facility existed is simply no excuse.

Given the proximity of the small detoxification center to Los Angeles\u2019 skid row area, the court noted that the police department\u2019s practice was that the detoxification facility notified the local watch commander when there was an empty bed. At that point local Los Angeles Police Department officers charged with enforcing subdivision (f) on skid row would first proceed to the detoxification center before transporting the prisoners to jail.
