WRIGHT, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b652-20\">This injunction action initiated by plaintiff, Luckenbach Steamship Company, Inc. (Luckenbach) against the United States and certain railroads, seeks: \u201c(1) to enjoin, set aside, annul, suspend or rescind the action and order of the Interstate Comm\u00e9rce Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>an agency of said defendant [United States], denying plaintiff\u2019s petition for suspension * * * of certain railroad rates published to become effective October 23, 1959\u201d, and \u201c(2) to direct the said defendant [United States] through its agency the Commission, to suspend the operation of said rates;\u201d and to direct the defendant railroads, \u201cparties to such rates, to refrain from doing and/or continuing the actions and things herein complained of, designed (1) to monopolize the transportation of canned goods from Pacific coast origins to Atlantic coast destinations and (2) to drive plaintiff from the business.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On October 22, 1959 the District Court issued a temporary restraining order staying the action of the Interstate Commerce Commission (Comnpssion) denying plaintiff\u2019s petition for suspension and ordering the Commission to suspend the proposed rail rate. Thereafter, a three-judge statutory court was convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2325 and 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Jurisdiction is alleged under the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1336-1337, 1398, 2284 and 2321-2325; Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 1009); Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, 3); and Sections 12 and 16 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 22, 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The matters now before the court are plaintiff\u2019s motion for an interlocutory injunction and defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint and dissolve the temporary restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">The essential allegations of plaintiff\u2019s complaint and amendment thereof to which defendants\u2019 dismissal motion is addressed may be summarized as follows <em>:</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Luckenbach, the only general cargo carrier in the intercoastal trade, is the low cost carrier of canned goods. Its rate on this traffic, without which it cannot exist, fully covers cost plus a return. The proposed rail rate is below cost. Apart from its effect on Luckenbach, it will substantially reduce present railroad revenues now being earned on the large volume of canned goods moving by rail. The reduced rail rate will either deprive Luckenbach of its backbone traffic or force its rate to a point below cost, and drive the more efficient carrier out of the trade, exposing the public to later rail rate increases. The railroads have expressly limited the rate reduction to a term of one year at the end of which the present rate will automatically be restored. The Commission ordered an investigation, thus placing upon the railroads the burden of sustaining it. But the investigation could be, and in the-light of the injury to Luckenbach, probably would be nullified by the failure to-suspend the rate. For if, upon conclusion of the investigation, the Commission should find that the rate was unlawful,- the elimination of Luckenbach from the trade might make permanent and irremediable the interim violation of the National Transportation Policy and' the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The Commission\u2019s failure to suspend was inconsistent with its order of investigation. This was compounded by its silence as to its reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-15\">Plaintiff asserts that the immediate consequences in permitting the proposed rail rate to become effective would be: \u201c(1) to violate and frustrate the mandate of the National Transportation-Policy, 49 U.S.C. preceding \u00a7 1; (2) to-violate the Sherman Anti-Trust Act under the doctrine of [State of] Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. R., 324 U.S. 439 [65 S. Ct. 716, 89 L.Ed. 1051] (1945); and (3) to subject Luckenbach, a major water carrier under the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, to immediate, incalculable and irreparable injury.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-16\">The defendants have moved for dismissal on the ground that this court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>without jurisdiction to review a Commission decision not to suspend the operation of new rate tariffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Plaintiff urges that Section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> plainly confers jurisdiction on the court to review the Commission\u2019s failure to suspend as it is authorized to do under Section 15(7) of the Interstate Commerce Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the material portion of which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">\u201c(7) Whenever there shall be filed with the Commission any schedule stating a new individual or joint rate, fare, or charge, or any new individual or joint classification, or any new individual or joint regulation or practice affecting any rate, fare, or charge, the Commission shall have, and it is given, authority, either upon complaint or upon its \u25a0own initiative without complaint, at once, and if it so orders without answer or other formal pleading by the interested carrier or carriers, but upon reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the lawfulness of such rate, fare, charge, \u25a0classification, regulation, or practice; and pending such hearing and the decision thereon the Commission, upon filing with such schedule and delivering to the carrier or carriers affected thereby a statement in writing of its reasons for such suspension, may from time to time suspend the operation of such schedule and defer the use of such rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice, but not for a longer period than seven months beyond the time when it would otherwise go into effect; * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-13\">\u201cExcept so far as (1) statutes preclude judicial review or (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion * * * (c) Every agency action made reviewable by statute and every final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in any court shall be subject to judicial review *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-15\">The wording of the Administrative Procedure Act apparently makes no change in the law of reviewability. Section 10 is so worded that it is obvious that the introductory clause modifies each of the subsections. Thus agency action is left unreviewable if the statute precludes review or to the extent agency action is by law committed to agency discretion. These two reasons were the only ones precluding review of administrative action by the court before the Administrative Procedure Act was enacted and the wording of the Act has brought about no change.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-16\">Whatever the scope of review of subsection (e)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is when read alone, the scope of review is certainly narrowed by that portion of the introductory clause, \u201cExcept so far as * * * (2) agency action is by law committed to agency discretion.\u201d Thus, although subsection (e) provides that the reviewing court shall set aside agency action <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>to be \u201carbitrary [or] capricious\u201d, it may not set aside arbitrary or capricious action so far as agency action is by law committed to agency discretion. So far as the action is by law committed to agency discretion it is not reviewable\u2014 even for arbitrariness or abuse of discretion. Whether or not agency action is reviewable, for a limited purpose or otherwise, depends upon what is committed by the statutes and common law to agency discretion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The Supreme Court in discussing the legislative history of the Act and how extensively, if at all, Section 10 changed the prior law on judicial review said:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACS8\">\u201c * * * No easy answer is found in our decisions on the subject. Each statute in question must be examined individually; its purpose and history as well as its text are to be considered in deciding whether the courts were intended to provide relief for those aggrieved by administrative action. Mere failure to provide for judicial intervention is not conclusive; neither is the presence of language which appears to bar it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Section 15(7) of the present Transportation Act<footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>authorizing the Commission to suspend rates, pending a hearing to determine the lawfulness of the filed rate was added to the original Interstate Commerce Act of February 4, 1887 by Act of June 18, 1910.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-17\">Prior to the passage of the amendment several bills in equity had been filed in Federal courts seeking injunctive relief against the carriers to preclude the collection of the newly published rates, pending a full hearing before the Commission. Some courts held that a court of equity had the power to enjoin the collection of the new rates<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and others held to the contrary.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-18\">The reviewability of action of the Commission under the amendment in refusing to suspend rates pending hearing seems to have been raised for the first time in M. C. Kiser Co. v. Central of Georgia Ry. Co.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> There the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-19\">\u201c * * * The point here involved is whether this remedy is exclusive or not \u2014 whether it ousts the United States courts of their general equity jurisdiction on that particular subject. The court is inclined to think the intention of Congress was to make the remedy provided by the amendment exclusive. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-20\">Since then, a span of approximately forty-three years, whenever the reviewability of denial of a rate suspension by the Commission has been the issue, the courts have refused review.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Not always have the reasons for unreviewability been the same,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but in every case review has been denied. The background against which the amendment was adopted and the wording of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>amendment indicates Congress did not intend to bestow upon the court authority to review the denial of a suspension order. Prior to the amendment, the right to promulgate rates in the first instance rested with the carrier. The Interstate Commerce Act does not deprive the carrier of this initiative which was theirs at common law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Act generally contemplates the filing of new tariffs with the Commission prior to a hearing. The grant or denial of a suspension order is an interlocutory step preceding a hearing and decision as to the lawfulness of the proposed rate. It may be made pending a hearing on the merits and without the introduction of testimony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Act does provide that if a suspension order is granted reasons must be stated, but if denied no reason whatever need be stated.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Since the Act contemplates Commission action without a hearing the basis for decision, whether written reasons are required or not, is the expertise of the Commission in the field of transportation. The Act clearly contemplates, no hearing by the Commission before decision and requires no reason be given if it denies suspension. Review in this posture would, in effect, supersede agency functioning. The court is constrained, therefore, to hold that the denial of a suspension of a rate by the Commission is by law committed to agency discretion and therefore not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">There remains for disposition plaintiff\u2019s antitrust claim. Defendants\u2019 conduct cited as evidencing Sherman Act \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 violations is set forth below: <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cThe railroads know, from Luck-enbaeh\u2019s filed reports, the financial condition of the company and the-fact that canned goods are vital to. Luckenbaeh\u2019s business. Having already diverted a major part of this, traffic to themselves by a previous rate cut, they now propose a further-cut which will confront Luckenbach with two alternatives, both ruinous \u25a0 \u2014 to cut its rates below cost or to see all its canned goods traffic taken by the railroads. In either case Luckenbach cannot long remain in business, a result which the railroads, have professed a determination to bring about. The proposed reduced rate terminates at the end of a year, when the present rate <em>automatically </em>again becomes effective. The reduced rate is below cost and will substantially reduce the revenue from the 62 percent of the canned goods traffic the railroads are carrying at the higher present rate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Judicial cognizance of the above action is predicated upon two factors: <footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">(1) The independent applicability of the Sherman Act provision to regulate railroads remains unimpaired, for the I.C.C. has not been delegated power to enforce Sherman standards; and</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">(2) The provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, authorizing the Commission to relieve carriers from antitrust responsibility for collective rate-making procedures, does not immunize the so-called predatory practices alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">Conceding plaintiff\u2019s proffer for the purpose of discussion it does not resolve the fundamental issue presented, namely, the applicability of the primary juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>diction doctrine.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Plaintiff misconceives the modern import of the concept.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The recent decisional law, in conjunction with the legal literature strongly urges where an administrative board, particularly knowledgeable in a specialized area, has been established, preliminary resort to the body should be had if some phase of the matter in litigation is within its exclusive jurisdiction.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">As observed by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Far East Conference v. United States: <footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-6\">\u201c * * * Uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by more flexible procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The requirement of preliminary resort to administrative boards is imperative to achieve maximum effectiveness from our judicial process. To bypass an agency peculiarly adapted in a particular field would be a complete economic and judicial waste. An integrated system necessitates that agency action precede court review where machinery has been created for this procedure. Especially is this true in the area of national transportation and other fully regulated industries.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-15\">Application of the foregoing principles to the allegations of the complaint conclusively demonstrates the antitrust charges should be initially considered by the Commission. That the precise facts forming the basis of plaintiff\u2019s antitrust action are cognizable by the Commission is amply supported by plaintiff\u2019s showing before the Commission in the suspension proceeding. There, in an application designated \u201cProtest and Petition for Suspension\u201d at pages 9-10 plaintiff stated: <footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-16\">\u201cIV. <em>Violation of the Antitrust Laws</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-17\">\u201cThe proposed reduction is thus designed to eliminate the competi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>tion of Luckenbaeh \u2014 and is well calculated to that effect. When such a purpose is effected through collective rate-making procedures and action \u2014otherwise exempt \u2014 they violate sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">The National Transportation Policy required to be considered by the Commission provides in part:<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">\u201c \u2018 It is hereby declared to be the national transportation policy of the Congress to provide for fair and impartial regulation of all modes of transportation subject to the provisions of this Act, * * * to encourage the establishment and maintenance of reasonable charges for transportation services, without unjust discriminations, undue prefer-enees or advantages, or unfair or destructive competitive practices; * * * All of the provisions of this Act * * * shall be administered and enforced with a view to carrying out the above declaration of policy.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-18\">Plaintiff\u2019s assertion that the railroads\u2019 predatory practices violate, inter alia, the aforementioned provision, additionally forms the basis for its charge that defendants wrongfully attempt to monopolize \u201ca part of the trade or commerce among the several States\u201d.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-19\">Plaintiff seeks not only antitrust relief against defendant railroads but also against the Commission for it is the final action of the Commission in permitting the rates to become effective that is injurious to plaintiff.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>rates be finally declared contrary to the National Transportation policy, then the purported conspiratorial action will have been thwarted.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Paramount in this determination inviting the Commission to initially rule on the instant claims is the fact that defendant railroads are operating pursuant to \u00a7 5(a) antitrust exemption agreements.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u25a0 Section 5 (a) supersedes the Sherman Act to the extent that the Approved agreement is immunized from Sherman Act proscriptions;<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and since Section 5(a) is administered by the Commission it is incumbent upon the court to seek the observations of the Commission with respect to the extent and scope of the exemption. The exemption certainly does not sterilize all forms of conspiratorial action, however, to foster an orderly administration of the immunization provision requires, at the minimum, primary construction by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Professor Davis in his Administrative Law Treatise suggests that under the circumstances presented, initial resort to the administrative agency is indicated: <footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">\u201c(1) On the question whether the doctrine applies to problems or relief which are beyond administrative jurisdiction, the theory seems reasonably clear. The test is not whether some parts of the case are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts; the test is whether some parts of the case are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the agency. Because of the purpose of the doctrine \u2014 to assure that the agency will not be by-passed on what is especially committed to it \u2014 -and because resort to the courts is still open after the agency has acted, the doctrine applies even if the agency has no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">The principle enunciated by Professor Davis is eminently sound. Accordingly, plaintiff is required to address these antitrust charges in the first instance to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">The sole question remaining is whether to dismiss or retain jurisdiction of the antitrust charges. The preferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>procedure is to dismiss. As observed by the Supreme Court: <footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">\u201cWe believe that no purpose will here be served to hold the present action in abeyance in the District Court while the proceeding before the Board and subsequent judicial review or enforcement of its order are being pursued. A similar suit is easily initiated later, if appropriate. Business-like procedure counsels that the Government\u2019s complaint should now be dismissed, * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Defendants have questioned the jurisdiction and propriety of the statutory three-judge court acting upon the antitrust claim. The antitrust cause and the action to review are so inextricably enmeshed that it would be unwarranted to truncate the litigation at this juncture. To refer the antitrust phase to the district court would require different reviewing tribunals to initially rule on the respective phases of this determination.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Against this background, and in view of the ancillary nature of the antitrust charges, Chief Judge Biggs and I are in accord that the presently constituted court has jurisdiction in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The complaint will be dismissed. An order to such effect is filed concurrently with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\">. Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b653-11\">.

Plaintiff\u2019s Reply Brief at page 3 states: \u201cInsofar as relief is sought against the Interstate Commerce Commission on anti-trust grounds, the basis for jurisdiction in this panel is clear. Commission action is the <em>sine qua non </em>for effectuating the anti-trust violation. The Commission\u2019s imprimatur is an essential prerequisite to the proposed reduction by which the roads seek plaintiff\u2019s destruction. Fully informed that its action will have this effect, the Commission has, nevertheless, persisted in its position. When, as here, an agency of the government permits its sanctions to be used to consummate a violation of the anti-trust laws, it is not beyond the judicial reach.\u201d And on pages 86-87 of the Transcript of the Oral Argument the following colloquy between court and counsel for plaintiff appears:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-11\">\u201cJudge Wright: Suppose you just wanted to restrain the Railroads from exercising the right given them by the Commission, I.C.C. law, to make these rates effective, would that not have been a one-judge matter which would come up under the Clayton Act, anti-trust laws?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-13\">\u201cMr. Kirkpatrick: If our relief were sought solely against the Railroads, then I would have thought that a one-judge court could have heard the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-14\">\u201cJudge Wright: It is your position, under the anti-trust theory, that you are entitled to any relief at all against the I.C.C.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-21\">\u201cMr. Kirkpatrick: Yes, sir, very definitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-22\">\u201cJudge Biggs: Do you assert that the I.C.C. is in an illegal combination with the Railroads?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-23\">\u201cMr. Kirkpatrick: Our theory is that the action of the I.C.C. here is really the last link in the chain by which this anti-trust violation will be consummated. Here is the point: As I understand it, the rate, which the Railroads propose, cannot be made effective except by a filing with the Commission and Commission action permitting it to become effective. Unless that is done the rate cannot be charged. When the rate is filed with the Commission, the Commission permits it to become effective, then that becomes the only legal rate. It acquires statutory force, and it is the only rate which the carriers can lawfully collect or the shippers can properly pay. Consequently, Commission action is really the last step in this whole thing. If the rate did not go into effect, by virtue of Commission processes, then we would not be hurt and would not be before your Honors this afternoon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-24\">Chief Judge Biggs and I construe the broad allegations of the complaint, together with counsel for plaintiff\u2019s aforementioned remarks as enunciating an antitrust cause of action against the Commission. We find it unnecessary in view of the final determination to pass on whether an agency o'f the United States can be made a party defendant in a private antitrust action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">. \u201cThe railroad defendants engage, together with virtually all other United States and some Canadian railroads, in collective ratemaking under .agreements approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission under section 5a of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5b).\u201d Complaint, allegation 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b659-8\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 5b provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">[If 2] \u201cAny carrier party to an agreement between or among two or more carriers relating to rates, fares, classifications, divisions, allowances, or charges (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), or rules and regulations .pertaining thereto, or procedures for the joint consideration, initiation or establishment thereof, may, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, apply to the Commission for approval of the agreement, and the Commission shall by order approve any such agreement (if approval thereof is not prohibited by paragraph (4), (5), or (6) of this section) if it finds that, by reason of furtherance of the national transportation policy declared in tbis Act, the relief provided in paragraph (9) of this section should apply with respect to the making and carrying out of such agreement; otherwise the application shall be denied.

I agree that, under existing provisions of law and procedure, where change of rate of transportation is considered by the carrier, it is the duty of the carrier, intending such change, to file the proposed new rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission. Upon a protest being filed, it becomes the duty of the Interstate Commerce Commission to determine the lawfulness of the new rates. In doing this the Commission may, but need not, order a suspension of the new rates until final hearing. If suspension is ordered, reasons for the action by the Commission must be assigned. If no suspension of the new rates is ordered by the Commission, no order is signed and, under the weight of authority, no reasons need be assigned for such refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">The failure or refusal of the Interstate Commerce Commission to suspend the operation of the new rates as in this case until final hearing is, I agree, an exercise of discretion vested in such Commission and since the discretion has been exercised then under the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009(e)) it is excluded as to reviewability. So much for the relief sought against the Interstate Commerce Commission by injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The complaint also states a claim against the defendant railroads and others acting in combination with them under the antitrust laws. The majority opinion finds that the doctrine of Primary Jurisdiction requires that this matter be first considered by the Interstate Commerce Commission and dismisses the plaintiff\u2019s claim as arising from the violation of the antitrust laws upon that basis. It is not the conclusion that the Primary Jurisdiction with reference to some features of the antitrust laws rests with the Interstate Commerce Commission to which I object for I do not reach that question. I question whether the special three-judge court should determine this matter or whether it should be determined by the district court as normally constituted, and with which this case was originally filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The three-judge court is somewhat of an anomaly. It is a federal district court consisting at times of three judges instead of one. It is of purely statutory origin and intended for distinct and limited purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Starting as an expediting provision in 1903 with reference to certain antitrust cases and as insuring direct review by the Supreme Court (32 Stat. 823, 15 U. S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 28, 29) the three-judge court has been made applicable to several situations. Among these were suits to annul, set aside or restrain orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and matters concerning the constitutionality of the state statutes or administrative orders. In these latter instances the requirement of a three-judge court is inextricably and almost universally interwoven with the matter of injunction and the disinclination to allow the issuance or refusal of an injunction in certain cases to be determined by one judge. So it is that by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2325 any injunction restraining the enforcement operation or execution, in whole or in part, of any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission will be determined by a three-judge court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">It will be borne in mind that it is not every proceeding to review an order or action of the Interstate Commerce Commission that requires a three-judge court. While every action to enforce, annul or set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission is required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2321 to be taken under the provision of Chapter 157 of Title 28, yet the bringing of such action does not operate of itself to require a three-judge court or to operate as a stay or suspend the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission and if no request is made for a stay or suspension of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission the case would remain in the district court as normally constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">It is only under.Section 2325 the three-judge court comes into existence. If an interlocutory or permanent injunction restraining the enforcement of the order of the Interstate Commerce Commission is requested, then and only then does the three-judge court come into existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">In the present proceedings and insofar as the antitrust claim is concerned, no injunction against the Interstate Commerce Commission with reference to the antitrust claim is suggested in the complaint nor mentioned in the relief sought. It is true that in the briefs the plaintiff seeks to consider the action of the Commission in refusing to suspend the proposed rates as constituting an effective step in the antitrust claim, but no injunction is considered in the complaint with reference to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Although neither the complaint in this case nor the prayers for relief mention the Interstate Commerce Commission with reference to the antitrust claim, yet the majority of this Court considers that the Interstate Commerce Commission is claimed by the plaintiff with participating in some way in the antitrust violation. Whether the Commission be considered an active participant in the antitrust claim and therefore essentially as a defendant, or whether the non-action of the Commission merely furnished the means by which the railroads may be charged with violation of the antitrust <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>laws, then in neither case do I see any jurisdiction in a three-judge court since no injunctive relief is involved in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">I am of the opinion that the three-judge court as such has only such jurisdiction as is expressly given to it by statute and does not have jurisdiction to determine either the merits of the antitrust claim nor to dismiss the antitrust claim under the Primary Jurisdiction principle. I think that all questions as to the antitrust claim should be considered by the district court as normally constituted and as embracing the residuum of the claim of the plaintiff not cognizable by the three-judge court. A portion of the complaint not cognizable by a three-judge court may, I think, be segregated from that part coming within the jurisdiction of such three-judge court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-20\">.
