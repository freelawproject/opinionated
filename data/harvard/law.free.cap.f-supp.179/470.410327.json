Plaintiffs further allege that defendants, as the Governor, other officials of the Executive Department of the State of Indiana, and the Sheriff of St. Joseph County, Indiana, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>are threatening and attempting to collect from plaintiffs a gross income tax for the year 1955. Plaintiffs further allege that as citizens of the State of Indiana they have the right to have the entire membership of the Indiana Legislature reapportioned, as provided in the State Constitution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201cThe General Assembly shall, at its second session after the adoption of this Constitution, and every sixth year thereafter, cause an enumeration to be made of all the male inhabitants over the age of twenty-one years.\u201d Const, art. 4, \u00a7 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The petition alleges that the last reapportionment of the senatorial and representative districts was in 1921, and \u25a0that in the absence of reapportionment .\u25a0since the year 1927 the subsequent acts of the Legislature are void and any action on the part of the defendants to collect this tax will be in deprivation of plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights. Plaintiffs pray that the Indiana Gross Income \"Tax Law of 1933, as amended, Burns\u2019 Ann.St. \u00a7 64-2601 et seq., be declared \u00a1unconstitutional and that defendants be \u25a0restrained from collecting, or attempting :to collect the tax from plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Defendants herein have filed a motion to dismiss. Briefs have been filed .and oral argument has been heard by \u25a0\u00a1this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Historically, since the dawn of 'Courts of Equity in our Anglo-American \u00a1system of jurisprudence, it has been held that Courts of Equity will not act in \u00a1such a circumstance as here when adequate legal remedies exist. Plaintiffs have an adequate legal remedy available. Plaintiffs are asking this Court to concern itself with a purely State political \u2022 question. The plaintiffs have the power ..of the ballot to correct any unrealistic .apportionment of the State Legislature -which might exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">It is admitted that the Legislature has failed to reapportion the legislative districts as provided in the Indiana -Constitution. No attempt is made here -to defend this flagrant disregard of the plain, constitutional provision. However, the Federal Government is a body politic of strictly limited powers. The powers which were not specifically delegated to the Federal Government were reserved to the sovereign States of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">We are here concerned with two, distinct, sovereign bodies: the State of Indiana and the United States of America. As stated above, we are here presented with a State political question in which the plaintiffs seek to invoke the Equity jurisdiction of this Federal Court. This Court has no jurisdiction to determine this question as the plaintiffs have adequate remedies at law available to them, and, what is more important, the Federal sovereignty must not and shall not invade this bulwark of State sovereignty. Perry v. Folsom, D.C., 144 F.Supp. 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss is hereby .granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
