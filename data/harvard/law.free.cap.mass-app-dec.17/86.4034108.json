The defendant pleaded a general denial, and contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">On January 6, 1957 at about 11:20 a.m. the plaintiff, Helen Mooney, was riding as a passenger in a motor vehicle driven by her daughter, the plaintiff Mary T. Mooney. The car was proceeding along Massachusetts Avenue toward Boston, and while the weather was clear and the sun was out the roadway was \u201crutted with snow and ice\u201d. The plaintiff driver testified that she saw an oil truck to her right double-parked, and that in passing it her car \u201clurched and hit the truck with a bang.\u201d An ordinance of the city of Cambridge prohibiting double parking was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>put into evidence and its validity is not in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The defendant operator testified that after parking \u201che was standing across the street talking to his brother\u201d when the collision occurred. He gave evidence of contributory negligence of the plaintiff operator, Mary T. Mooney, and the trial court found for the defendant in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In the case of Helen Mooney, the passenger, there was a finding for the plaintiff, and this action is here on the denial of the defendant\u2019s third request for ruling which appropriately raises the only question argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">Stated .concisely, the defendant. concedes that in double parking on a public way the defendant\u2019s agent violated a city ordinance and that such violation was evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence, but contends that this act of negligence was not the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">It argues that this violation was a condition and not the proximate cause in that the defendant driver as a reasonable man was not required to foresee that an accident would happen in the manner in which it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Correctly given, the rule is that the violation of a penal statute or of a valid ordinance, rule or regulation is evidence of negligence as to all consequences that were intended to be prevented. <em>Baggs v. Hirschfield, </em>293 Mass. 1, 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">It is equally true that such violation, like other negligence, is without legal consequence unless it is a proximate cause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>injury. <em>Wall v. King, </em>280 Mass. 577. Generally whether the violation is a mere circumstance or a cause is a question of fact. <em>Kralik v. LeClair, </em>315 Mass. 323-326. A casual connection may be found upon one of two theories. \u2014 First, if \u201cthe negligence of the earlier wrongdoer remained a dangerous force until the negligence of the late wrongdoer concurred and combined with it to cause injury\u201d or secondly, \u201cthat the earlier wrongdoer ought to have foreseen that his negligence would be followed by negligence of another resulting in injury, and consequently that in law the act of that other is the act of the original wrongdoer because it is the natural and probable consequence of his wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Medaglia, </em>287 Mass. 46, 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">While there are numerous precedents bearing on this issue there are some apparent difficulties in application and we are inclined to the view that the circumstances of this case do not bring it within the cases of either <em>Kralik v. LeClair, </em>315 Mass. 323 or <em>Falk v. Finkelman, </em>268 Mass. 524, relied on by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">In the <em>Kralik </em>case, the defendant operator parked his tractor trailer \u201cpartly on and partly off\u201d a public way in violation of state regulations, the roads were dry and the plaintiff driver lost control of his tractor trailer which was being driven at an excessive speed and the damage to the plaintiff\u2019s tractor was caused by coming in contact with trees which were knocked over. <em>Falk v. Finkelman </em>is even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>less applicable to the circumstances of the instant case for the defendant there was an unlawful occupant of a parking space.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The trial court was warranted under the circumstances in finding that the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the violation of the Cambridge ordinance against double parking. Certainly it cannot be said that the ordinance was not in the interest of the public safety and convenience and that its violation might under certain conditions even amount to a nuisance. The circumstances in this case where the road was \u201crutted with snow and ice\u201d, making the passing of motor vehicles on the public way hazardous, and while this condition prevailed the defendant driver as a reasonable prudent person ought to have apprehended and foreseen that passing traffic might become rutted and lurch and come <em>into </em>collision with his oil truck. In the light of common experience, such a collision cannot be said to be unlikely where an oil truck was heedlessly as well as unlawfully parked and occupying a substantial portion of the travelled way, and where the icy, rutted road made the maneuverability of cars passing difficult and somewhat hazardous if not actually dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">A <em>majority </em>of this court are of the opinion that this case comes clearly within the decision of <em>Milbury v. Turner Centre System, </em>274 Mass. 358; <em>Lane v. Atlantic Works, </em>111 Mass. 136; <em>Rea v. Checker Taxi, </em>272 Mass. 510; <em>Wall v. King, </em>280 Mass. 577; <em>Baggs v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Hirschfield, </em>293 Mass. <em>1. </em>See also <em>Morrison v.
