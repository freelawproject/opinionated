C. B. Smith, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b54-4\" pgmap=\"54(326) 55(235)\">This was a bill in chancery, brought by Joseph J. Bentley and Benjamin Bentley, on February 20,1883, against William O\u2019Bryan and David Bice, to have their two certain deeds of conveyance of certain lands to William O\u2019Bryan, dated December 7,1878, declared a mortgage, and for leave to redeem from the same. The bill alleges, complainants, before making such conveyances, farmed said lands as partners; that they, being largely in debt, and unable to meet their liabilities, made an arrangement with O\u2019Bryan, who was their surety on many of the debts, whereby he was to pay off such debts, and complainants were to convey to him said lands to indemnify him as surety, and to secure him in moneys advanced and to be advanced by him for the complainants, or whatever sum they might be indebted to him, O\u2019Bryan; that complainants should have five years in which to pay O\u2019Bryan the principal owing him, with interest, and that under such arrangement said lands were conveyed to said O\u2019Bryan by deeds absolute upon their face, but in reality they were mortgages to secure said O\u2019Bryan in his advances then and thereafter to be made, and that O\u2019Bryan did, in pursuance of said arrangement, pay off most of complainants\u2019 said debts. The bill alleges various payments which were claimed to have been made by the complainants, and prayed that an account might be taken of what was due, and for leave to redeem from such conveyances. It also charged that O\u2019Bryan, for the purpose of defrauding complainants, conveyed said lands to said Bice, on August 31, 1882, without the knowledge or consent of complainants, for $4200 in cash, and the assumption of a mortgage on the premises, of $2200. The bill also charged that O\u2019Bryan claims to have leased the lands to complainant Joseph J. Bentley, and had commenced a proceeding by distress for rent claimed to be due, and had levied the same. The bill prayed that all proceedings at law be enjoined, etc. Bice and O\u2019Bryan both answered the bill, the latter claiming that the conveyances to him were absolute, and not as a mortgage to secure the payment of money, and that complainant Joseph J. Bentley remained on the larfds as his tenant. Bice claimed as a purchaser for value, without notice that the deeds to O\u2019Bryan were given to secure the latter, if such was the case, and claims that he informed the complainant Joseph J., of his intended purchase of such land from O\u2019Bryan, and that Joseph J. said nothing about any claim to the property. The complainants afterwards filed their supplemental bill, which was amended so as to set up certain proceedings by O\u2019Bryan to collect rent by distress, and a finding and judgment against the claim for rent as res judicata, upon the question of there being the relation of landlord and tenant between said Joseph J. and the said O\u2019Bryan. The court sustained a demurrer to this amended supplemental bill. The cause was heard on the bill, answers, replication thereto, and proofs, and a decree entered dismissing the bill, and for costs against the complainants. From this decree the complainants bring the c\u00e1se to this court by appeal, and assign for error the sustaining of the demurrer to their amended supplemental bill, and the dismissal of such bill and the original bill.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-4\" pgmap=\"55\">Messrs.

This is especially true where, as here, the rights of third parties have intervened. Maxfield v. Patchen, 29 Ill. 42; Ferguson v. Tallmadge, 20 id. 599; Carpenter v. Carpenter, 70 id. 457; Clark v.

Blessing, 80 id. 188.</p> <opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b58-7\" pgmap=\"58\">Mr. Justice Dickey</p> <author id=\"AjR\" pgmap=\"58\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</author> <p id=\"ASn\" pgmap=\"58(113) 59(249)\">The complainants in this case contend that their conveyances of the lands to O\u2019Bryan, though absolute in form, are only a security in the nature of a mortgage. It appears that the complainants, and part of the time another brother, David Bentley, were partners, and interested as such in the lands in dispute, though the title to one tract stood in Joseph J. Bentley, and the other in Benjamin Bentley; that the partnership business was conducted mainly by Joseph J., and that in conducting the business, (principally farming,) debts were contracted, and both tracts of the land were mortga'ged or conveyed by trust deed to one Harmon, to secure a loan of $2250, which was used to discharge such debts, and otherwise, in the partnership business; that further indebtedness was contracted in the business to divers persons, for which notes of the Bentleys were given, upon nearly all of which O\u2019Bryan was security; that O\u2019Bryan had paid one or more of these security debts, for which complainants, on December 7, 1878, were owing him, besides other unsettled accounts between them; that complainants, and O\u2019Bryan with them, were being pressed by the creditors of the Bentleys, judgments were taken and others threatened, and that on December 7, 1878, complainants conveyed the lands to O\u2019Bryan by warranty deeds, but no money or thing of value passed from O\u2019Bryan to the complainants as a consideration for such conveyances. The only consideration for the conveyances was the agreement of O\u2019Bryan with-complainants at the time, but what that agreement was is the subject of dispute in this cause. Shortly after making these conveyances the partnership of the Bentleys was dissolved, and Benjamin and David Bentley left the farm, Joseph J. Bentley remaining in the exclusive occupancy and apparent exclusive com trol of the farm up to the filing of this bill, and who paid and delivered to O\u2019Bryan, from time to time thereafter, both money and grain. O\u2019Bryan, after such conveyances, paid, or caused to be paid, a large part of the complainants\u2019 indebtedness, taking receipts to himself, and retaining old notes and mortgages taken up by him.</p> <p id=\"b59-9\" pgmap=\"59(88) 60(111)\">The complainants contend that their deeds to O\u2019Bryan were mortgages, made with the express agreement that they should be security to O\u2019Bryan for what complainants then owed him, and for future advances to be thereafter made by O\u2019Bryan in paying off complainants\u2019 debts, and that Joseph was to remain upon the farm, pay a sum each year sufficient to pay interest and the annual taxes, and have five years in which to discharge the indebtedness and redeem the land from the mortgage lien. The defendants claim that the deeds are absolute conveyances, made in pursuance of an agreement to sell the land to O\u2019Bryan at $30 per acre, to be paid by O\u2019Bryan in taking up complainants\u2019 indebtedness; that if .the debts were less than the price, the balance should be paid to Joseph J. Bentley by O\u2019Bryan, and if more, Bentley was to repay such excess to O\u2019Bryan, and that at the same time a separate agreement was made between O\u2019Bryan and J oseph J. Bentley for the leasing of the land to the latter for one-third of the crops raised on the same, and that. Joseph J. has since occupied said land under such agreement for renting.</p> <p id=\"AV\" pgmap=\"60(265) 61(105)\">To estop the defendant O\u2019Bryan from setting up and claiming the relation of landlord and tenant between him and J oseph J. Bentley, and that the latter was to pay rent for the land, complainants, by their amended supplemental bill, set up a judgment in favor of the defendant, in a proceeding by distress for rent, brought by O\u2019Bryan, against said Joseph J. Bentley. The circuit court sustained a demurrer to this amended supplemental bill, and this is assigned for error. Upon the hearing the complainants offered in evidence the record in the distress proceeding as a bar to the defence set up, which the court refused to admit, and this is also urged as an error. We think there was no error in either ruling of the court. A proceeding by distress for rent may involve two issues, \u2014 that is, whether the relation of landlord and tenant exists, and whether any rent is due. The proceeding in this case was commenced on September 12, 1882, by O\u2019Bryan, against Joseph J. Bentley, and was tried after the conveyance to Bice. It was brought to recover rent claimed to have accrued before the conveyance to Bice. To the distress warrant, as amended, the defendant therein pleaded that he was not indebted in manner and form as alleged in said warrant, upon which issue was taken. There was no plea denying the demise, and the verdict found that there was no rent due the plaintiff at the time of suing out the distress warrant. The judgment of the court was to the same effect. The verdict might have been the result of a finding that the rent had not matured, or had been paid, or that a deed of the lands to Bice before the rent was due, transferred O\u2019Bryan\u2019s rights to him. The verdict and judgment can not be regarded as an estoppel upon O\u2019Bryan to claim that Bentley was his tenant before he conveyed to Bice. They were not even evidence in favor of Joseph J. Bentley upon the real issue involved in his bill. They could not afford any evidence that complainants\u2019 deeds were given merely as securities for the payment of money.</p> <p id=\"b61-4\" pgmap=\"61\">As to the conveyance of Benjamin Bentley to O\u2019Bryan, of his eighty-acre tract, there can he but little doubt that it was, and is, an absolute deed. He testifies as follows: \u201cO\u2019Bryan first wanted a mortgage, and then the mortgage matter fell through for some reason, and then he proposed taking a deed. O\u2019Bryan made a statement to me that if my brother Joseph should stay on the farm and redeem, he would throw off $500. The arrangement was for him (O\u2019Bryan) to see that the indebtedness was paid off, and release me. That was all the arrangement we had on the subject.\u201d He afterwards states that he derived his knowledge of the arrangement from what his brother said. His deed to O\u2019Bryan was made subject to the incumbrances, then on the land, and upon making the same he left the State, and has ever since made his home in Pennsylvania, and he has never claimed any right to redeem, or that he ever had any agreement with O\u2019Bryan giving him a right to redeem. His subsequent conveyance to his brother Joseph, without any consideration, gives him no right of redemption. As to this- tract there was no error in dismissing the bill.</p> <p id=\"b61-8\" pgmap=\"61(54) 62(148)\">Where a deed for land on its face appears to be an absolute and unconditional conveyance, and is acknowledged and delivered, the law will presume, in the absence of proof showing the contrary, that it is what it purports to be, \u2014 an absolute conveyance. (Sharp v. Smitherman, 85 Ill. 153; Hancock v. Harper, 86 id. 445.) Where a warranty deed for land absolute in form is claimed to be a mortgage only, the party alleging such a character must sustain his claim by evidence sufficiently clear and satisfactory to overcome this presumption of the law. Loose, indefinite and unsatisfactory evidence will never suffice. Wilson v. McDowell, 78 Ill. 517; Lindauer v. Cummings, 57 id. 195; Remington v. Campbell, 60 id. 516; Dwen v. Blake, 44 id. 135; Sutphen v. Cushman, 35 id. 186; Low et al. v. Graff et al. 80 id. 360; Price v. Karnes, 59 id. 276; Magnusson v. Johnson et al. 73 id. 156; Knowles et al. v. Knowles, 86 id. 1; Clark v. Finlon, 90 id. 245; Bartling et al. v. Brasuhn et al. 102 id. 441; Shays et al. v. Norton, 48 id. 100; Taintor v. Keys et al. 43 id. 332.</p> <p id=\"b62-4\" pgmap=\"62\">It is not necessary to review the evidence on this branch of the case. It is sufficient to say that in our opinion it does not overcome the presumption of law that the deeds are absolute conveyances. It may be further observed that the declarations and admissions of O\u2019Bryan, made after his conveyance of the premises to Bice, not in the presence of Bice, can not be received and considered as against Bice. The law is well settled that declarations of a grantor when the \u25a0 grantee is not present, can not be admitted to invalidate his deed or to affect the grantee. Barrett v. French, 1 Conn. 354; Pettibone v. Phelps, 13 id. 450; Whiter. Wheaton, 16 id. 535.</p> <p id=\"b62-5\" pgmap=\"62\">Perceiving no error in the record, the decree of the circuit court is affirmed..</p> <p id=\"b62-6\" pgmap=\"62\">Decree affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
