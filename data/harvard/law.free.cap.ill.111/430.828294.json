This question must be answered in the affirmative. It is not a new one in this court, and so far as we are advised the ruling upon it has uniformly been in conformity with the conclusion just stated. Ellis v. Southwell, 29 Ill. 552; Walker v. Abt, 83 id. 226; Sales v. Shephard, 99 id. 621.</p> <p id=\"b431-10\" pgmap=\"431\">The judgment of the Appellate Court which is sought to be reversed by the present writ of error being in conformity with this view of the law, is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b431-11\" pgmap=\"431\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
