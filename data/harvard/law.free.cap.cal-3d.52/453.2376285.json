J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHG\">Defendant Stephen Wayne Anderson appeals from a judgment imposing the death penalty following his conviction of first degree murder and burglary, accompanied by a felony-murder special circumstance. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 58 [210 Cal.Rptr. <em>777, </em>694 P.2d 1149] <em>{Anderson I), </em>we reversed defendant\u2019s original judgment as to penalty and set aside the special circumstance finding because of the court\u2019s failure to instruct on intent to kill as an element of the felony-murder special circumstance. (See <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862], overruled by <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306].)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">We affirmed the judgment in all other respects. On retrial, the jury again found the special circumstance allegation true and returned a death verdict. Thereafter, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to modify the sentence (Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.4, subd. (e); all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise indicated). Defendant\u2019s appeal is automatic. (\u00a7 1239, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">A. <em>Special Circumstance Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">The evidence on retrial of the special circumstance allegation largely paralleled the evidence introduced at defendant\u2019s first trial and summarized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>in <em>Anderson I. </em>Defendant confessed to the burglary/murder of an elderly woman, Mrs. Lyman. Defendant had scrutinized the premises for several days, awaiting indications that the occupants were on vacation. He arrived at the house shortly before midnight on May 25, 1980, cut through a screen door and removed a pane of glass from a second door to gain entry. Armed with a handgun, he entered the bedroom where Mrs. Lyman was sleeping. She awoke and began to scream. Defendant turned toward her and fired his weapon, killing her. As defendant admitted, \u201cI sleep with my gun. Somebody come at me and I\u2014I\u2019m going to blow them away. You know, that\u2019s the first thing I thought of, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Defendant ransacked the house, finding approximately $112. He turned on the television set and was eating some noodles when sheriff\u2019s deputies, alerted by neighbors, arrived and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Defendant did not testify with respect to the special circumstance issue. He called a psychiatrist, Dr. Thompson, who testified that he had a brain abnormality which, when affected by alcohol, diminished his capacity to form a specific intent. A psychologist, Dr. Beaber, testified that one\u2019s survival instincts, coupled with a perception of danger, might arouse action without thought. On rebuttal, a neurologist, Dr. Hunt, and a psychiatrist, Dr. Oshrin, disputed the theory that defendant had a brain abnormality or reacted unthinkingly or impulsively to Mrs. Lyman\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">B. <em>Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The People introduced evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions for aggravated burglary and aggravated assault of a prisoner, as well as evidence of two unadjudicated murders involving victims Blundell and Glashien.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The defense called a prison chaplain, Eshelman, who opined that defendant\u2019s many occupations (e.g., plumber, electrician, cook and carpenter) would be useful to the prison. Defendant testified on his own behalf. Among other things, he denied any intent to kill Mrs. Lyman, disputed killing Glashien, claimed he killed Blundell in self-defense, related facts about his troubled childhood, and submitted poems and stories he wrote in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">On rebuttal, the People introduced statements by defendant to the effect that he was born or trained to be a killer and always wanted to be a killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">II. Special Circumstance Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">Before addressing defendant\u2019s specific contentions, we observe that, by reason of our decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1104, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>overruling <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 131, any asserted errors pertaining to the contested intent-to-kill issue were necessarily harmless. <em>Anderson </em>overruled <em>Carlos\u2019s </em>holding that the 1978 death penalty law imposes a blanket intent-to-kill requirement on all felony-murder special circumstances. <em>Anderson </em>held that intent to kill need be charged and proved for a felony-murder special circumstance only where the defendant was an aider and abettor to the homicide and not the actual killer. (43 Cal.3d at pp. 1138-1147.) Here, defendant does not dispute, and the evidence confirms, that he personally killed Mrs. Lyman in the commission of a burglary of her house. As we have recently held, <em>Carlos </em>should not be deemed \u201cthe law of the case\u201d in light of <em>Anderson </em>and, accordingly, many of defendant\u2019s present challenges to the special circumstance finding on retrial may be deemed irrelevant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitt </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 620, 637-639 [274 Cal.Rptr. 252, 798 P.2d 849].)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">A. <em>Disclosure of Defendant\u2019s Prior Reversed Death Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">During the jury selection process, and on voir dire, the court informed the jurors that a previous jury had convicted defendant of first degree murder and burglary and had sentenced him to death, but that this court, on defendant\u2019s automatic appeal, had ordered a retrial of the special circumstance and penalty issues because \u201cthe rules had changed\u201d regarding the need to instruct on the issue of defendant\u2019s intent to kill. Defendant made no objection to these voir dire disclosures. He now contends, however, that the trial court erred in relating the foregoing information to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Defendant contends that, by reason of the court\u2019s disclosures, the jury improperly learned that a prior jury had found death to be the appropriate penalty for defendant, that the jury\u2019s verdict was subject to an automatic appeal to this court, and that we reversed the death judgment and special circumstance finding based on a \u201cchange of rules\u201d regarding the need to prove defendant\u2019s intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Initially, defendant suggests that the foregoing information was irrelevant and potentially prejudicial, coming at a time (October and November 1985) when this court\u2019s disposition of death penalty cases was becoming a subject of discussion and controversy. Defendant argues that the jury was thereby led to speculate on impermissible matters, including the availability of an appeal to this court, a matter tending to reduce the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility regarding the seriousness of its task. (See <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi </em>(1985) 472 U.S. 320 [86 L.Ed.2d 231, 105 S.Ct. 2633]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 136, 155-159 [207 Cal.Rptr. 800, 689 P.2d 430].) Although defendant does not concede the point, it seems clear that any possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s disclosures was limited to the jury\u2019s penalty determination, for the evidence supporting the felony-murder special circumstance was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">As we recently observed, \u201cThe fact that a first jury deadlocked, <em>or the numerical vote of the first jury, </em>is irrelevant to the issues before the jury on a penalty retrial.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 134, 178 [266 Cal.Rptr. 309, 785 P.2d 857], italics added.) Defendant argues that, by a parity of reasoning, the first jury\u2019s vote to impose death was irrelevant to the issues. No reason appears why the court could not have simply explained that the judgment had been reversed and remanded for retrial, without also disclosing the first jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Defendant cites several federal cases recognizing the prejudicial nature of disclosing to a jury engaged in determining a defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence the fact that the defendant had been previously convicted on the same charges. (E.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 772 F.2d 482, 488 [dictum]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(5th Cir. 1978) 568 F.2d 464, 471.) Defendant also cites an Illinois case <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hope </em>(1986) 116 Ill.2d 265 [508 N.E.2d 202, 205-206]), which reversed a judgment on the ground that two jurors in the sentencing phase of a capital case were exposed to news stories indicating the defendant had been previously sentenced to death on charges unrelated to the capital case being tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In the present case, the court disclosed that a prior jury had imposed the death penalty on defendant for the same offense. A similar disclosure was made to the jury in <em>People </em>v. <em>Whitt, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at pages 639-641, involving another retrial for <em>Carlos </em>error. In <em>Whitt, </em>without reaching the merits, we concluded that any error in informing the jury regarding the prior death sentence and subsequent reversal on automatic appeal was invited by defendant\u2019s own conduct in (1) submitting, at the court\u2019s direction, a proposed statement covering these matters (without referring to the automatic nature of the appeal), and (2) failing to object to the court\u2019s own statement covering these matters. We further opined that defense counsel had tactical reasons for not objecting to the statement, namely, his reliance on a penalty phase defense of \u201cDeath Row redemption,\u201d to the effect that defendant had reformed after being initially sentenced to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Similar reasoning governs our decision here. Prior to trial, defense counsel asked the court whether the jury would be told about the procedural history of the case. The court announced its intention to \u201cpretty much level\u201d with the jury and explain about the prior trial, death sentence, reversal on automatic appeal, and the reason for the reversal. Defense counsel was given a copy of the court\u2019s intended statement but failed to object or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>propose revisions to the draft.  As the People observe, objections to noninstructional statements or comments by the trial court must be raised at trial or are waived on appeal. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 362, 398 [85 Cal.Rptr. 409, 466 P.2d 961]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cheary </em>(1957) 48 Cal.2d 301, 316 [309 P.2d 431]; cf. \u00a7 1259 [objection not required to preserve claim of <em>instructional error on </em>appeal].)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">As in <em>Whitt, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d 620, it seems apparent that defense counsel herein had a tactical purpose for declining to object to the court\u2019s disclosures regarding defendant\u2019s death sentence and subsequent reversal on automatic appeal. During the course of trial and in argument, counsel frequently referred to the prior death sentence and, as in <em>Whitt, </em>presented a \u201cDeath Row redemption\u201d defense stressing defendant\u2019s changed attitude, reformed character and his many useful, redeemable skills. For example, counsel asked defendant whether his \u201cthinking\u201d had changed during the five years since he was sentenced to death. Defendant replied that \u201cthe experience of being condemned to die made me grow up and realize that it was a serious matter. And I matured. And I realized there\u2019s more to life than living and the life that I had lived. And maybe I had a chance to change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Regarding the reference to the automatic appeal, it is true that \u201c[a]s a general rule, the jury should not be advised regarding the availability of an appeal in death cases, because such information may dilute the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility in fixing the penalty. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 584 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776]; see <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Mississippi, supra, </em>472 U.S. 320.) But as <em>Whitt </em>explains (51 Cal.3d at p. 641), any reasonable juror, knowing that defendant was once sentenced to death and was now being retried for the same crimes, could easily infer that an appeal was available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">We conclude that any error in the court\u2019s pretrial disclosures was waived by counsel\u2019s apparently tactical failure to object. We further conclude that it is not reasonably possible defendant was prejudiced by those disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In a related contention, defendant complains of the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the fact that defendant had previously received a death sentence which was \u201cunfortunately\u201d reversed. Thus, in the course of suggesting that defendant\u2019s \u201credemption\u201d was feigned, the prosecutor observed that \u201cWe had him here. We had him tried. We had him convicted. We had him sentenced to death .... And then unfortunately, the case was reversed and it came back to trial.\u201d No objection was made to these remarks (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 27 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468]), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>which included no factual information not already recounted by the trial court\u2019s pretrial disclosures. The prosecutor\u2019s disappointment with the reversal of the judgment was hardly a surprising revelation.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">B. <em>Trial Court Comments Effectively \u201cDirecting a Verdict\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Defendant contends that additional trial court comments essentially directed the jury to find true the special circumstance allegation, and that these comments require reversal of the judgment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The court at one point noted its \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that deliberations would commence on Thursday, December 19, that \u201cvery likely\u201d a special circumstance verdict would be reached on that day, and that any further deliberations, if needed, would take place the following day in view of the forthcoming holiday recess. Thereafter, prior to closing arguments, the court indicated the issue of defendant\u2019s intent to kill was a \u201cfairly simple question,\u201d and stated that presumably a verdict would be reached within two or three hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">Defendant did not object to the foregoing remarks, and accordingly waived any claim of error based thereon. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Terry, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 362, 398; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cheary, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d 301, 316.) On the merits, the court\u2019s statements do approach the kind of coercive conduct deemed improper in prior cases. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Keenan </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 478, 534 [250 Cal.Rptr. 550, 758 P.2d 1081], we admonished that \u201cA trial judge should refrain from placing specific time pressure on a deliberating jury and should never imply that the case warrants only desultory deliberation. Such comments risk persuading legitimate dissidents, whatever their views, that the court considers their position unreasonable.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 775 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113] [coercion through insistence on further deliberations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Here, of course, the jury had not yet commenced its deliberations and no \u201cdissidents\u201d had yet voiced their concerns. Nonetheless, we think trial judges should avoid any potentially coercive \u201cpredictions,\u201d at any stage of the trial, concerning the ease with which the jury should decide the case or particular issues. In any event, as previously explained, any error in the determination of the intent to kill issue was necessarily harmless in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1104. In addition, it is not reasonably possible the court\u2019s remarks, directed to the special circumstance issue, could have affected the jury\u2019s penalty decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\">C. <em>Voluntariness of Defendant\u2019s Confession</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-11\">At trial, defendant contended his tape-recorded confession and a subsequently filmed reenactment were involuntary and hence inadmissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>because the statements were made (1) while he was suffering from sleep deprivation, and (2) without adequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings or waivers <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974]). Following a foundational hearing, the court ruled the confession and reenactment were voluntary and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">1. <em>Statements to </em>Police\u2014In his recorded statement to the officers, defendant admitted he had been watching the Lyman house for several days from a nearby location. Believing the residents were vacationing, he decided to burglarize the house. He shot Mrs. Lyman when she confronted him unexpectedly. According to defendant, he reacted out of fear, without knowing his victim\u2019s identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In challenging the voluntariness of his confession, defendant points to his own trial testimony indicating he was suffering from sleep deprivation when interrogated. That testimony, if believed, would support a finding that he did not knowingly waive his right to remain silent. Defendant urges us to hold that the prosecution failed to carry its burden of proving the voluntariness of a confession beyond a reasonable doubt. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Jiminez </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 595, 606-608 [147 Cal.Rptr. 172, 580 P.2d 672] [applicable to cases involving crimes committed prior to the adoption of Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 28, subd. (d) (Prop. 8) in 1982]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Markham </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 63, 71 [260 Cal.Rptr. 273, 775 P.2d 1042] [Prop. 8 abrogated <em>Jiminez </em>rule]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 251, 258 [193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 667 P.2d 149] [Prop. 8 not retroactive].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Our role as a reviewing court is to examine the uncontradicted facts to determine independently whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion of voluntariness was properly found; if conflicting testimony exists, we must accept that version of events which is most favorable to the People, to the extent supported by the record. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 744, 773 [248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Here, as the People observe, the facts were conflicting regarding the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s confession. Although he testified that he had been awake for 30 hours prior to confessing, other facts support a finding of voluntariness, including his age at the time of the offense (27), his high IQ (136), and his reflective actions during the course of the offenses charged, including the careful and methodical way in which he obtained entry into Mrs. Lyman\u2019s house only a few hours prior to his confession. In light of the whole record, defendant\u2019s self-serving testimony affords insufficient basis for overturning the trial court\u2019s finding of voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">2. <em>Statements to Dr. </em>Flanagan\u2014Several days after defendant made his recorded statement to the officers, and evidently before counsel was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>pointed to represent him, the officers introduced him to Dr. Flanagan, a psychiatrist retained to perform a mental examination of defendant. During the interview, which lasted several hours, defendant stated that he was sober during the burglary, that he thought the Lyman house was unoccupied, and that he was surprised when Mrs. Lyman confronted him. Dr. Flanagan concluded defendant was alert, cooperative and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Defendant now asserts his statements to Dr. Flanagan violated his Fifth Amendment rights because they were elicited without adequate warning that Dr. Flanagan was an agent of the prosecution and this purpose was to obtain incriminating information. We disagree. After introducing Dr. Flanagan, and immediately before the psychiatric interview began, Officer Daw gave defendant full <em>Miranda </em>warnings, including the admonition that, \u201cAnything you say can and will be used in evidence against you in a court of law.\u201d Defendant thereupon waived his rights and agreed to talk. Dr. Flanagan himself cautioned defendant that his statements would not be deemed confidential. Under the circumstances, the foregoing admonitions were sufficient. (See <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1981) 451 U.S. 454, 466-469 [68 L.Ed.2d 359, 371-373, 101 S.Ct. 1866].)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">D. <em>The \u201cCooked </em>Noodles\u201d <em>Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">During retrial of the special circumstance issue, the prosecutor was permitted to introduce evidence that defendant, after killing Mrs. Lyman, remained in her house, and cooked and ate a bowl of noodles. Rejecting defendant\u2019s objection that the evidence was irrelevant and unduly prejudicial (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 352), the court ruled that the evidence, though not conclusive, was sufficiently probative of defendant\u2019s mental state and intent as to warrant its admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Defendant claims the court erred in admitting the evidence and later permitting the prosecutor during the penalty phase to call additional witnesses to confirm the incident. We find no error. As the People observe, the fact that defendant had the presence of mind to calmly cook and eat noodles after killing Mrs. Lyman indicated a lack of concern or remorse usually associated with an accidental or unintentional killing, and accordingly bore on the disputed issue of defendant\u2019s intent to kill. In any event, any evidentiary error seems harmless with respect to the special circumstance finding in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1104. As for calling additional penalty phase witnesses to prove the point, the People reasonably deemed it appropriate to call these witnesses after defendant took the stand and recanted his recorded statement and denied cooking or eating the noodles.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>E. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Defendant asserts the prosecutor committed misconduct in various respects during her closing arguments regarding the special circumstance issue. Because defendant failed to object to the statements, or request an appropriate admonition, his misconduct claims are deemed waived on appeal. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, 27.) Nonetheless, we briefly review them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">1. <em>Burden of Proof and Presumption of </em>Innocence\u2014  The prosecutor used a baseball analogy in describing the state\u2019s burden of proof, stating that just as a tie \u201cgoes to the runner\u201d in baseball, an \u201cevidentiary tie\u201d in a criminal case benefits the defendant. Defendant now complains that the jury may have interpreted that remark as meaning that defendant would prevail only if the evidence were closely balanced (\u201ctied\u201d), but would lose, despite a reasonable doubt, if the prosecution\u2019s case slightly outweighed the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">We have reviewed the remarks in context and find no misconduct, for the prosecutor appears to have been merely observing that conflicting testimony and inferences must be resolved in defendant\u2019s favor. In any event, defense counsel amply clarified the matter during his own closing argument, and thereafter the court correctly instructed on the subjects of reasonable doubt and burden of proof. (See CALJIC No. 2.90.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The prosecutor also observed during closing arguments that although the court would instruct on reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence, \u201cin this particular case, there isn\u2019t a presumption of innocence because he\u2019s been convicted.\u201d Although defendant now finds the comment objectionable, in context it seems harmless, referring only to the prior <em>murder </em>conviction which, as the jury was advised, was not the subject of retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">2. <em>Comment on Defendant\u2019s Failure to </em>Testify\u2014  During closing argument on the special circumstance issue, the prosecutor commented that only two persons could \u201ctell us about what went on\u201d during the night of the murder, namely, deceased victim Lyman and defendant, who \u201ctold you his version through the interview with the police.\u201d The prosecutor continued by noting that parts of the statement should be believed, and parts disbelieved. Defendant now claims the remark constituted an improper comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify. (See <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609, 615 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 110, 85 S.Ct. 1229].)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\"><em>Griffin </em>forbids either direct or indirect comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, but does not extend to mere comments on the state of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>evidence or the failure of the defense to present material evidence. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 543, 572 [finding nonprejudicial <em>Griffin </em>error in prosecutor\u2019s remark, \u201cHe\u2019s never said anything to you about why, why he did these things\u201d].) The prosecutor\u2019s statement that defendant was one of two persons who could \u201ctell\u201d about the murder approaches indirect comment on defendant\u2019s failure to testify, but the prosecutor\u2019s further observation that defendant in fact told his version of the facts during the police interview substantially lessened any risk that the jury might penalize defendant for remaining silent at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In any event, as stated in <em>Hovey, </em>the remark was \u201cindirect, brief and mild . . . without any suggestion that an inference of guilt be drawn therefrom.\u201d Such remarks \u201care uniformly held to constitute harmless error. [Citations.]\u201d (44 Cal.3d at p. 572.) We find the prosecutor\u2019s remark herein similarly harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">3. <em>Reference to </em>Punishment\u2014During closing arguments on the special circumstance issue, the prosecutor stressed that defendant was the one responsible for \u201cwhat he did that night,\u201d and that \u201che\u2019s the one that should pay for what he did that night.\u201d  According to defendant, the prosecutor was urging the jury to consider matters of punishment inappropriate at the special circumstance retrial. The People, on the other hand, suggest the prosecutor was simply asking the jury to find defendant responsible for a murder accompanied by a special circumstance. As an interpretive matter, we tend to agree with the People. In any event, the prosecutor\u2019s brief remark was too mild to have resulted in any possible prejudice to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">4. <em>Injection of Personal Belief\u2014 </em> Defendant contends the prosecutor injected her own personal belief into her argument when she disparaged defendant\u2019s defense based on lack of intent to kill, characterizing it as a \u201csmokescreen\u201d and suggesting it was \u201cnot true,\u201d and then stating, \u201cWe knew that beforehand. But it was for the purpose of keeping an open mind.\u201d According to defendant, the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cbeforehand\u201d remark implied to the jury the prosecutor held a personal belief as to defendant\u2019s intent, based on evidence outside the record. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bain </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 839, 848 [97 Cal.Rptr. 684, 489 P.2d 564].) To the contrary, examined in context the prosecutor\u2019s remarks had a far less sinister connotation, referring merely to the <em>jurors\u2019 </em>(and not the prosecutor\u2019s) prior knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Thus, the prosecutor first reminded the jury that, during voir dire, the court had asked each juror to keep \u201can open mind\u201d on the subject of defendant\u2019s intent to kill. The prosecutor then suggested that, although the jurors may have kept an open mind during the presentation of evidence, they nonetheless knew \u201cbeforehand\u201d that anyone who enters another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>person\u2019s house late at night, armed with a loaded firearm, necessarily possesses the requisite intent to kill. One reasonably might disagree with the prosecutor\u2019s assumption in this regard, but clearly her remarks did not constitute <em>Bain </em>error <em>(supra, 5 </em>Cal.3d 839).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We conclude that none of the prosecutor\u2019s various remarks constituted misconduct, and that in any event defendant has waived any misconduct claim by failing to object or seek an appropriate admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">F. <em>Statement Regarding M-l Rifle</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In a taped interview with police officers, defendant indicated that although he did not attempt to escape from Mrs. Lyman\u2019s house when the police arrived and announced their presence, nonetheless \u201cIf I\u2019d have had my M-l Carbine, yeah, I\u2019d have come out. But I don\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t have it.\u201d The trial court admitted the statement at the special circumstance phase over defendant\u2019s objection, reasoning that it was relevant to the issue of his state of mind at the time of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Defendant renews his objection on appeal, claiming the statement was irrelevant to the contested issue of his intent to kill, and further was unduly prejudicial when weighed against any slight relevance his remark might have had. We disagree. The statement was clearly relevant for it indicated that defendant would have initiated a gun battle with police if he had been armed with his rifle, thus disclosing defendant\u2019s readiness to react violently when he had the opportunity to do so. We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the statement\u2019s relevance outweighed its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">G. <em>Photograph of Mrs. Lyman and Her Daughter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s introduction at the special circumstance phase of a photograph showing Mrs. Lyman with her adult daughter. The court overruled the objection, noting that the photo was simply an ordinary, nongruesome one, and that the jury was already aware Mrs. Lyman had a daughter. The court stated that the photo was not the sort that would either shock the jury or arouse any sort of passion or sympathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Defendant now argues the photo was irrelevant to any issue and could only have been used for the improper purpose of gaining the jury\u2019s sympathy for the victim\u2019s family. (See <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529].) We considered a similar claim of error in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 543, 576, involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>prosecutor\u2019s use, at both the guilt and penalty phases, of a \u201cportrait\u201d-style photograph of the young murder victim for the apparent purpose of gaining sympathy for her. As we stated in <em>Hovey, </em>\u201cAlthough admission of a photograph of the victim while alive may be considered error if irrelevant to any contested issue in the case, any error here was harmless. [Citations.] []f] [The victim\u2019s] photo, though perhaps \u2018charming,\u2019 was nonetheless an \u2018ordinary\u2019 one not likely to produce a prejudicial impact.\u201d (44 Cal.3d at p. 571.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">We have examined the photo in question and conclude, as in <em>Hovey </em>and similar cases, that its introduction could not have prejudiced defendant. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 584, 594-595 [238 Cal.Rptr. 66, 737 P.2d 1350].)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">III. Penalty Phase Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">A. <em>Asserted Boyd Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 773-776 [215 Cal.Rptr. 1, 700 P.2d 782], we examined section 190.3 and concluded that at the penalty phase, \u201cEvidence of defendant\u2019s background, character, or conduct which is not probative of any specific listed factor would have no tendency to prove or disprove a fact of consequence to the determination of the action, and is therefore irrelevant to aggravation.\u201d (38 Cal.3d at p. 774.)  Defendant argues the trial court committed reversible <em>Boyd </em>error by allowing the prosecution to introduce incidents of nonviolent criminal activity, or of noncriminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">According to defendant, the prosecutor\u2019s penalty phase evidence included such irrelevant matters as (1) defendant\u2019s long-standing lack of gainful employment, (2) his various unadjudicated burglaries, and (3) his use of an alias. Our examination of the record indicates none of these claims has merit. With respect to defendant\u2019s employment record, he opened the door by introducing, in mitigation of penalty, evidence of his various jobs and participation in a work furlough program. In response, the prosecutor was entitled to explore whether defendant had been able to hold steady employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">As for defendant\u2019s burglaries, the record indicates that defendant was indeed convicted of these offenses, a matter properly considered as an aggravating factor. (See \u00a7 190.3, factor (c).) Finally, the matter of defendant\u2019s use of an alias was raised by him during the course of a tape-recorded interview with police. Defendant waived any claim of error by failing to object when the tape, and his reference to using an alias, was played to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 749, 777-778 [251 Cal.Rptr. 83, 759 P.2d 1260].)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We conclude that no <em>Boyd </em>error <em>(supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 762) occurred here. In any event, any such error involved minor matters that could not possibly have affected the penalty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">B. <em>New Mexico Assault</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Defendant contends the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to admit evidence that defendant participated in an armed assault in New Mexico in 1971, 14 years prior to the penalty phase retrial in this case. According to defendant, the evidence was too remote to be of any value as aggravating evidence and, accordingly, should have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Possible remoteness of the defendant\u2019s prior offenses is not a proper ground of exclusion under section 190.3, as remoteness affects the weight, not admissibility, of the offense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 718, 729 [274 Cal.Rptr. 372, 798 P.2d 1215]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 468, 511, 531 [268 Cal.Rptr. 126, 788 P.2d 640].)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In addition, we note that defendant did not object to the evidence when admitted at trial <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at pp. 777-778), and that although the offense occurred 14 years prior to the penalty retrial in this case, it was committed only <em>8Vi </em>years prior to Mrs. Lyman\u2019s murder. We conclude that introduction of the evidence affords defendant no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">C. <em>Defendant's Hearsay Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The prosecution was permitted to introduce on rebuttal at the penalty phase defendant\u2019s remark to police officers that he was \u201ceither born or trained to be a killer,\u201d and \u201calways wanted to be a killer.\u201d Defendant had objected to the introduction of such evidence as constituting improper rebuttal evidence and inadmissible hearsay. The trial court ruled, however, that the statement was admissible as a relevant declaration against defendant\u2019s interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">Defendant, acknowledging the statement at issue was a mere \u201cbravado\u201d boast, nonetheless asserts its admission was reversible error. He contends the statement was inadmissible as a declaration against his interest because, among other reasons, he was available as a witness at the penalty phase. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230.) But as the People explain, the trial court\u2019s ruling can be sustained on a separate ground not relied on, namely, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>statement was an admission relevant to rebut defendant\u2019s own penalty phase testimony that he had no malicious intent to kill his three murder victims (Mrs. Lyman, and two \u201cother crimes\u201d victims, Blundell and Glashien), as well as to rebut his general \u201cgood character\u201d evidence. (See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1220; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, ante, </em>p. 367 [276 Cal.Rptr. 731, 802 P.2d 221]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 791-792; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 762, 775-776.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Although defendant\u2019s \u201ckiller\u201d remark would not conclusively rebut his good character evidence, it was certainly relevant to the inquiry. As the trial court observed, defendant\u2019s penalty phase evidence attempted to depict him as \u201cnot the type of a person who would go around killing people, except on extreme provocation. [([] This [referring to defendant\u2019s remark] is a statement by him which contradicts that image . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Defendant contends the trial court failed explicitly to weigh the purported relevance of the statement with its likely prejudice to defendant. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 352; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 25.) Here, defense counsel based his objection on three grounds: that the statement was not admissible as a statutory aggravating factor, that it was hearsay, and that it constituted improper rebuttal. <em>After </em>the court denied his objection, he asked that the record reflect that the evidence was \u201chighly prejudicial,\u201d without citing Evidence Code section 352, or requesting a weighing of relevance with prejudice, and the court reiterated its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">We think that under the foregoing circumstances, including the belated invocation of an objection based on \u201cprejudice,\u201d the trial court was not obligated to make an express ruling weighing relevance and prejudice under Evidence Code section 352. We note that the requirement of such an explicit ruling can be a trap for a trial judge presented, as here, with multiple objections to the same evidence. For that reason, we think the requirement should be triggered only if defendant either expressly invokes Evidence Code section 352 as a ground for objection, or at least affirmatively argues that the risk of prejudice outweighs the relevance of the proffered evidence. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1009-1010 [248 Cal.Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017] [\u201cthe probative/prejudicial issue was before the court\u201d because of defense counsel\u2019s reference, in his objection, to the \u201cdanger of undue prejudice\u201d outweighing \u201cthe probative value\u201d of the challenged evidence]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1129, fn. 3 [defendant failed \u201ceven to allude to Evidence Code section 352\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 711, 732 [214 Cal.Rptr. 801, 700 P.2d 415] [defendant \u201cinvoked Evidence Code section 352 several times\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 24 [counsel\u2019s argument that probative value is outweighed by prejudicial effect impliedly invoked Evidence Code section 352].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>D. <em>Officer Thompson\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Officer Thompson testified for the People during the penalty phase concerning his investigation of the Glashien and Blundell killings. He recounted defendant\u2019s confession to those crimes as well as defendant\u2019s vague statements concerning other murders he purportedly committed in Las Vegas. On cross-examination, Thompson admitted that he doubted the veracity of defendant\u2019s confession to the Las Vegas killings, and he observed that no law enforcement officers contacted by him credited it. On redirect, Thompson stated his further belief that defendant\u2019s confession to the Glashien and Blundell killings, being supported by sufficient details, was true. Defendant did not object to the foregoing testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Defendant now observes that a police officer\u2019s opinion regarding the truthfulness of a suspect\u2019s confession is generally deemed inadmissible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(1956) 47 Cal.2d 99, 103 [301 P.2d 854, 56 A.L.R.2d 1435]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Arguello </em>(1966) 244 Cal.App.2d 413, 421 [53 Cal.Rptr. 245].) His failure to object, however, bars our consideration of the point on appeal. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Coleman, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 749, 777-778.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">E. <em>Asserted Prosecutorial Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Defendant complains of various instances of misconduct by the prosecutor during closing arguments at the penalty phase. We find no prejudicial misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">1. <em>Vouching for Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Credibility, and Attacking Defendant\u2019s </em>Credibility\u2014At one point in her argument, the prosecutor remarked that \u201cA law enforcement <em>officer </em>is no <em>good </em>as a witness if his credibility is in doubt,\u201d and in essence supported the credibility of the officers testifying in this case by noting that \u201ca number of them . . . are old, experienced officers. They\u2019ve got 15, 20, 22 years of experience on the force.\u201d The prosecutor expressed her doubt that any of them would \u201cjeopardize\u201d his reputation by lying on the witness stand \u201cjust to convict one defendant.\u201d The prosecutor continued by noting that defendant, on the other hand, would only be testifying once, rather than a number of times, that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything else to lose,\u201d and \u201cso what if you do catch him in a few lies?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Defendant failed to object, or seek an admonition, as to any of these remarks, and accordingly he cannot raise a claim of misconduct on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, 27.) Nonetheless, we briefly review the merits of his argument that the prosecutor\u2019s comments violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>his state and federal constitutional rights and constituted reversible misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The prosecutor is generally precluded from vouching for the credibility of her witnesses, or referring to evidence outside the record to bolster their credibility or attack that of the defendant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1989) 47 Cal.3d 1047, 1079 [255 Cal.Rptr. 352, 767 P.2d 619]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Guzman </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 915, 941 [248 Cal.Rptr. 467, 755 P.2d 917], and cases cited.) In the present case, the prosecutor limited her remarks to <em>facts of record, </em>namely, the years of experience of the officers involved, and her \u201cvouching\u201d was clearly based on inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, rather than on her personal belief or knowledge. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Adcox </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 207, 258-259 [253 Cal.Rptr. 55, 763 P.2d 906] [prosecutor\u2019s arguments were based on inferences warranted by the evidence, rather than personal belief].) We find no improper prosecutorial vouching here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">2. <em>Reference to Utah\u2019s Failure to </em>Extradite\u2014In cross-examining prosecution witnesses, defense counsel elicited the fact that the State of Utah had not attempted to extradite defendant for the Blundell and Glashien murders, thereby implying that the evidence of his guilt was weak. Thereafter, in her closing argument, the prosecutor suggested an alternative theory for Utah\u2019s lack of action, namely, that California\u2019s prosecution of defendant adequately satisfied Utah\u2019s interest in bringing him to justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Defendant, having objected to the prosecutor\u2019s remark at trial, characterizes such argument as speculative and improper, being based on the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion, rather than any evidence in the record. Again, as with the \u201cvouching\u201d issue, the prosecutor was entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, and the prosecutor\u2019s suggested explanation for the failure to extradite was a plausible alternative to the one suggested by defense counsel. We see no misconduct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">3. <em>Argument That Sympathy for Defendant Does Not Outweigh Aggravating </em>Circumstances\u2014  In closing argument, the prosecutor remarked that if the jury felt that \u201csympathy\u201d for defendant outweighed defendant\u2019s violent offenses and precluded a death sentence, \u201cthen Heaven help our judicial system and our society.\u201d Defendant, who objected to the statement at trial, claims that the foregoing remark was unduly inflammatory and prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">We have stated that \u201cIsolated, brief references to retribution or community vengeance . . . , although potentially inflammatory, do not constitute misconduct so long as such arguments do not form the principal basis for advocating the imposition of the death penalty. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 771 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250].) The prosecutor\u2019s statement herein, rather than calling for vengeance or retribution, was directed at the jury\u2019s weighing function and indicated the prosecutor\u2019s emphatic opinion that, under the circumstances in this case, the aggravating circumstances clearly outweighed any considerations of sympathy for defendant. We have never found such comments improper or prejudicial. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 1142, 1182-1184 [259 Cal.Rptr. 701, 774 P.2d 730].)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">4. <em>Argument About Impact on Victims' </em>Families\u2014The prosecutor in closing argument observed that defendant had expressed a wish to live (\u201cNobody wants to die\u201d), and further noted that no one asked defendant\u2019s victims whether they wished to die. The prosecutor then remarked that Mrs. Lyman\u2019s daughter, Pauline, has \u201cfeelings\u201d too, and is probably \u201cgrateful\u201d she had the chance to spend Mother\u2019s Day with Mrs. Lyman a few weeks before her murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The People concede that such argument \u201cwas arguably inappropriate\u201d under <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland, supra, </em>482 U.S. 496. (See also <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Gathers </em>(1989) 490 U.S. 805 [104 L.Ed.2d 876 109 S.Ct. 2207].) <em>Booth </em>precludes evidence of the impact of the victim\u2019s death on his or her family. <em>Gathers </em>makes it clear that comments regarding the victim\u2019s character or background made in order to elicit the sympathy or pity of the jury are inadmissible. Both cases held that such evidence is irrelevant to a defendant\u2019s decision to kill and to the jury\u2019s decision on the appropriate sentence. But neither <em>Booth </em>nor <em>Gathers </em>bars brief references to the victims or their families. <em>(Booth, supra, </em>482 U.S. at p. 507, fn. 10 [96 L.Ed.2d at p. 451]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Douglas, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d 468, 536; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 284 [266 Cal.Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carrera </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 291, 336 [261 Cal.Rptr. 348, <em>777 </em>P.2d 121].) The prosecutor\u2019s references to the victims were indeed far more fleeting than those made in either <em>Booth </em>or <em>Gathers </em>and reiterated what the jury already knew\u2014that murder is a crime against the victims, their families and society. <em>(Lewis, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p.285.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Even if we were to conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s comments violated the proscriptions of <em>Booth </em>or <em>Gathers, </em>we would find beyond a reasonable doubt there was no prejudicial error. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].) In our view, the prosecutor\u2019s brief comments could not have diverted the jury from its task of determining the appropriate punishment. (See <em>Douglas, supra, </em>50 Cal.3d at p. 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">5. <em>Cumulative Effect of </em>Misconduct\u2014Finally, defendant argues that the cumulative effect of the various prosecutorial misconduct resulted in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>miscarriage of justice warranting a new trial. Yet as we have explained, only one of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks was arguably improper, and we believe these remarks had no effect on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">F. <em>Questions From Jury</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">During the penalty phase, various individual jurors directed written questions to the court. One juror asked for \u201cmore detail\u201d regarding the evidence of defendant\u2019s participation in the prison chapel program and its \u201ceffect\u201d on him. The next day, another juror inquired about such matters as defendant\u2019s whereabouts when his son was born, his marital status, and his feelings toward his son. Subsequently, a third juror asked whether a person sentenced to life imprisonment without parole is segregated from the general prison population, could attain \u201ctrustee\u201d status, or could be released from prison at some future time. Defendant asserts two separate claims of error arising from these questions and the court\u2019s responses thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">1. <em>Jury Misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Defendant first claims the jury committed misconduct by prematurely submitting the foregoing questions to the court prior to starting its deliberations. Defendant observes that deliberations do not commence until all evidence is presented and the jury is instructed. Until that time, the jurors should not converse with each other or form or express any opinion about the case. (\u00a7 1122.) We find no misconduct here.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The authorities cited by defendant in support of his theory of \u201cpremature deliberation\u201d are inapposite, as none of them suggests that mere questions from individual jurors prior to actual deliberations constitute jury misconduct. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierce </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 199, 206-207 [155 Cal.Rptr. 657, 595 P.2d 91] [prior to conclusion of defense case, juror discussed case with police officer/witness]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 476, 480-481 [132 Cal.Rptr. 217] [prior to conclusion of People\u2019s case, juror expressed to other juror his opinion of defendant\u2019s guilt].) As noted in <em>People </em>v. <em>McAlister </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 633, 644 [213 Cal.Rptr. 271], \u201cIn a proper case there may be a real benefit from allowing jurors to submit questions [to witnesses] under proper control by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s thesis, we do not believe that the questions tendered here indicated the jurors had commenced their deliberations or had formed any tentative conclusions regarding the appropriate penalty. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the questions posed here constituted misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>2. <em>Court\u2019s Inadequate Responses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">As previously indicated, some of the jurors\u2019 inquiries concerned the status, privileges and potential for release of a prisoner serving a sentence of life without possibility of parole. Responding to the potential for release, the court stated that \u201cLife imprisonment without the possibility of parole means exactly that,\u201d admonishing the jurors not to assume anything \u201cother than death means death by execution in the gas chamber; life without possibility of parole means imprisonment for the rest of his natural life.\u201d Defendant does not suggest the court\u2019s response was inadequate or improper in any way. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Caro </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1035, 1064-1065 [251 Cal.Rptr. 757, 761 P.2d 680].)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In response to the jury\u2019s other inquiries, however, the court stated in essence that no evidence had been received on these points, and no one was available to testify competently about them. Defendant argues this response, though \u201ctechnically correct,\u201d was inadequate, failing to constitute a \u201cfirm reiteration that LWOP [life imprisonment without parole] <em>meant </em>LWOP and that there was nothing in the law or in the way the state prison system operated that ameliorated the LWOP sentence.\u201d We disagree. The court\u2019s response essentially advised the jury not to speculate regarding the possible privileges and conditions of prison confinement. In light of the court\u2019s additional response to the basic question whether defendant might someday be released to society, the jury could not possibly have been misled in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">G. <em>Jury\u2019s Renewed Deliberations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">After deliberating over penalty for six days, one juror was injured and replaced by an alternate juror. The court instructed the jury to set aside and disregard its prior deliberations and recommence them with the alternate juror present.  Defendant asked the court to examine the jurors as to their ability to set aside their prior deliberations. The court denied the motion, stating its assumption the jury would be able to follow the foregoing instructions (citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 687, 694 [131 Cal.Rptr. 782, 552 P.2d 742]), and observing that voir dire on the subject might be seem by the jurors as \u201ccoercive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In <em>Collins, </em>we rejected the contention that a mistrial must be declared whenever the jury\u2019s deliberations were interrupted by dismissal of a juror for cause, providing an alternate juror is available as a substitute, and the jury is instructed to set aside and disregard all past deliberations and begin deliberating anew. (17 Cal. 3d 687, 694.) We stated that \u201cWe are confident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that juries made aware of the rights involved will faithfully follow such instructions.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">It is clear that the court followed <em>Collins\u2019s (supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 687) prophylactic procedures and gave the instructions we recommended in that case. Indeed, the court even required the new jury to pick a different foreperson. Defendant, disputing that <em>Collins </em>and the cautionary instructions it prescribed adequately protected his right to jury trial untainted by any prior deliberations, asserts the trial court abused its discretion in failing to conduct voir dire examination of each juror. <em>Collins </em>does not require such a procedure, and we see no basis for reconsidering our decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Defendant also asserts the court erred in allowing some jurors, over his objection, to retain notes taken prior to the interrupted deliberations. The record indicates, however, that these notes did not involve the jury\u2019s deliberations. In one case, they summarized trial testimony, while in another they reflected the private, uncommunicated thoughts of a juror, made while he was at home. Defendant speculates that \u201cthe possibility exists that outside influences, e.g., consultation of a dictionary for interpretation of legal terms, entered the jury room.\u201d Such speculation cannot form the basis for a successful attack on the verdict or judgment. As the People observe, a juror\u2019s thinking process necessarily continues outside the jury room. We see nothing improper in allowing a juror to reduce his thoughts to writing, and privately to consult those notes during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">H. <em>Overemphasizing Defendant\u2019s Prior Crimes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Defendant observes that the court\u2019s penalty phase instructions included 22 pages devoted to the elements, burden of proof and evaluation of evidence of his prior criminal activity. Although he made no objection to the number or content of these instructions (see \u00a7 1259), he now asserts their \u201csheer bulk\u201d may have unduly focused the jury\u2019s attention on the \u201cother crimes\u201d issues, distracting it from its primary duty to weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 72-73, fn. 25 [222 Cal.Rptr. 127, 711 P.2d 423].)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The instructions given by the court were presumably deemed necessary to assist the jury in properly evaluating the aggravating aspects of defendant\u2019s prior criminal activity, and in assisting it to determine whether such offenses were established beyond a reasonable doubt. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 739, 773.) Defendant does not suggest that any of these instructions was incorrect or misleading, and we cannot base error solely on speculation regarding the jury\u2019s inability to digest that material without undue distraction from its sentencing task.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>I. <em>Modification of Sentence Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The trial court, after stating its reasons, denied defendant\u2019s motion to modify the death verdict. (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e).)  Defendant first contends the court\u2019s statement of reasons failed to explain why defendant\u2019s \u201csadly unremarkable\u201d murder of Mrs. Lyman justified the death penalty. According to defendant, in the absence of more egregious or heinous facts, the court erred in failing to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment without parole. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The trial court was not required to \u201cjustify\u201d the imposition of the death penalty in this case. By reason of the burglary-murder special-circumstance finding, defendant fell within that class of persons deemed by law to merit the death penalty if aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating ones. The court\u2019s statement of reasons outlined the relevant evidence, including defendant\u2019s probable knowledge that Mrs. Lyman was in the house when he entered it, his lack of intoxication, and his cold-blooded act of shooting her as she lay in bed. Describing defendant as \u201cthe type of person who doesn\u2019t really care whether somebody else lives or dies,\u201d as long as it suits his convenience, the court concluded that \u201cif there is to be a death penalty, there is no legitimate excuse why it should not be applied to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Although the court could have mentioned even more aggravating facts to support its decision, including defendant\u2019s violent criminal background, on the present record we see no basis for overturning that decision. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 315, 373-374 [253 Cal.Rptr. 199, 763 P.2d 1289].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">Defendant also complains that the trial court failed affirmatively to ask defendant or his counsel for their comments prior to ruling on the motion to modify the sentence. (Counsel did express some views on defendant\u2019s reformed character <em>after </em>the court\u2019s announcement of its ruling.) The People observe, however, that defense counsel had ample opportunity to address the court prior to the court\u2019s ruling. The record shows that counsel, when asked, \u201cIs there any legal cause why judgment should not now be pronounced?,\u201d acknowledged that his motions for new trial and modification of sentence were before the court, and he then proceeded to argue the new trial matter (based on the substitution of the alternate juror during the penalty phase). Counsel freely elected to withhold oral argument on the modification motion. Under these circumstances, the court was not required to expressly request argument on the motion before announcing its ruling thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>J. <em>Constitutional Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Finally, defendant asserts various constitutional challenges to the 1978 death penalty law and sentencing procedures. He acknowledges that all such challenges have been rejected by this court in recent opinions. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Jennings </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 963, 992 [251 Cal.Rptr. 278, 760 P.2d 475]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bonin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 659, 698-704 [250 Cal.Rptr. 687, 758 P.2d 1217]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 102-107 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 777-779; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 264, 315-317 [168 Cal.Rptr. 603, 618 P.2d 149]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 172-188 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587].) He states no compelling reasons which might induce us to reconsider these decisions. (See also <em>Boyde </em>v. <em>California </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 370 [108 L.Ed.2d 316, 110 S.Ct. 1190]; <em>Blystone </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 299 [108 L.Ed.2d 255, 110 S.Ct. 1078].)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The judgment of death is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Panelli, J., Eagleson, J., Kennard, J., and Arabian, J., concurred. Broussard, J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b517-8\">MOSK, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AU\">I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">After review, I have concluded that none of the claims that defendant has raised warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">I write separately, however, because I am most troubled by a claim that defendant does <em>not </em>make\u2014that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, section 15, of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">To succeed, such a claim requires proof by the defendant that (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, i.e., his conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms; and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient performance was prejudicial, i.e., there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s failings, the result would have been different. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 216-218 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839] [discussing both federal and state constitutional rights]; <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 687-696 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 693-699, 104 S.Ct. 2052] [discussing federal constitutional right].)</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">As to the first component, proof may indeed be available. Certainly, counsel\u2019s performance\u2014or better, nonperformance\u2014with regard to the court\u2019s \u201cinstruction\u201d on the history of defendant\u2019s case appears deficient. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>The court effectively\u2014and altogether improperly\u2014informed the jurors that a prior judgment of death had been reversed on a \u201ctechnicality,\u201d viz., the failure to instruct on intent to kill as an element of the felony-murder special circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(5th Cir. 1978) 568 F.2d 464, 471, the United States Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit stated, \u201c[W]e are hard pressed to think of anything more damning to an accused than information that a jury had previously convicted him for the crime charged.\u201d I am not. More damning still is information\u2014which the court here inexplicably provided\u2014that a jury had previously condemned the defendant to death, but was subsequently reversed on a \u201ctechnicality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">In spite of the obvious detriment that the court\u2019s \u201cinstruction\u201d threatened, counsel did nothing, or at least practically nothing, to avoid the harm. Therefore, in this regard his conduct may well have fallen below an objective standard of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">As to the second component, however, proof is lacking. On the peculiar facts of this case, prejudice does not appear. The People and defendant litigated the special circumstance and penalty issues \u201con the merits\u201d without undue reference to the \u201ctechnicality.\u201d In light of the record before this court, it must be presumed that the jury decided those questions on that same basis. Therefore, there is not a reasonable probability that, but for any deficient performance on counsel\u2019s part, the result would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Accordingly, having concluded that reversal is not warranted for ineffective assistance or for any of the reasons presented by defendant, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied February 20, 1991.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
