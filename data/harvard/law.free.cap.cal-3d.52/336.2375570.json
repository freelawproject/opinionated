J.</author>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">I. Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">In this proceeding, we consider challenges to the validity of an initiative measure adopted at the June 5, 1990, Primary Election. This measure, designated on the ballot as Proposition 115, is entitled by its framers as the \u201cCrime Victims Justice Reform Act.\u201d Its stated general purpose is to adopt \u201ccomprehensive reforms . . . needed in order to restore balance and fairness to our criminal justice system.\u201d To achieve that purpose, the measure adopts a variety of changes and additions to our state Constitution and statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Petitioners herein are taxpayers and voters asserting a challenge to the manner in which Proposition 115 was presented to the voters, and objecting to any further expenditure of funds to enforce or implement the measure. Specifically, petitioners (and several amici curiae supporting them) claim the measure violates both (1) the \u201csingle subject\u201d rule embodied in our state Constitution (art. II, \u00a7 8, subd. (d)), and (2) the rule requiring constitutional \u201crevisions\u201d to be accomplished by more formal procedures than are contemplated for mere constitutional \u201camendments\u201d (art. XVIII).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Respondents are certain public officials and courts charged with the responsibility of implementing, enforcing or applying the new measure. They too are supported by various amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Although the present petition sought issuance of an original writ of mandate or prohibition from the Court of Appeal, we granted respondent Attorney General\u2019s motion to transfer the cause to this court. (See rule 20, Cal. Rules of Court.)  As we observed in a similar case, \u201cIt is uniformly agreed that the issues are of great public importance and should be resolved promptly. Accordingly, under well settled principles, it is appropriate that we exercise our original jurisdiction. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 236, 241 [186 Cal.Rptr. 30, 651 P.2d 274] [hereafter Brosnahan], reviewing similar constitutional challenges to Prop. 8, \u201cThe Victims\u2019 Bill of Rights\u201d initiative; see also <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 219 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281] [hereafter <em>Amador], </em>upholding Prop. 13, a property tax initiative.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">As in <em>Brosnahan, </em>the challenges presented here are directed to the manner in which the initiative measure was presented to the voters. We have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>occasion at this time to consider other possible attacks that may be directed at the various substantive and procedural changes accomplished by the measure. Similarly, except as necessary to resolve the basic questions before us, we do not consider in this case possible interpretive or analytical problems arising from the measure, including the retroactive application of all or part of its provisions. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 251, 262-263 [193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 667 P.2d 149] [adopting prospective application for Prop. 8].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\"><em>Brosnahan </em>succinctly set forth the general principles that must guide the courts in evaluating the validity of initiative measures: \u201cPreliminarily, we stress that \u2018it is a fundamental precept of our law that, although the legislative power under our constitutional framework is firmly vested in the Legislature, <em>\u201cthe people </em>reserve to themselves the powers of initiative and referendum.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 1.) It follows from this that, \u201c\u2018[the] power of initiative must be <em>liberally construed </em>... to promote the democratic process.\u2019\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(Amador, [supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d] at pp. 219-220, italics added <em>[by Brosnahan].) </em>Indeed, as we . . . acknowledged in <em>Amador, </em>it is our solemn duty jealously to guard the sovereign people\u2019s initiative power, \u2018it being one of the most precious rights of our democratic process.\u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 248.) Consistent with prior precedent, <em>we are required to resolve any reasonable doubts in favor of the exercise of this precious right. (Ibid. </em>[italics in original].)\u201d <em>(Brosnahan, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 241; see also <em>Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 591 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038].)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">As will appear, we have concluded that one provision of Proposition 115 (namely, section 3, which would amend section 24 of article I of the state Constitution) contemplates such a far-reaching change in our governmental framework as to amount to a qualitative constitutional revision, an undertaking beyond the reach of the initiative process. (See <em>Amador, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 223.) Although we must invalidate that provision, the remaining sections of Proposition 115 are severable and properly may be given effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Before reaching the contested issues, we briefly outline the basic provisions of the new measure. As in <em>Brosnahan </em>and <em>Amador, </em>we caution that our summary description and interpretation of the measure by no means preclude subsequent litigation regarding the meaning or legality of its provisions, apart from the specific issues considered herein. (See <em>Brosnahan, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 242; <em>Amador, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>II. Summary of Proposition 115</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">A. <em>Preamble</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">As previously explained, the measure is entitled the \u201cCrime Victims Justice Reform Act.\u201d The preamble recites that the people of the state \u201chereby find that the rights of crime victims are too often ignored by our courts and by our State Legislature, that the death penalty is a deterrent to murder, and that comprehensive reforms are needed in order to restore balance and fairness to our criminal justice system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The preamble continues by stating that in order to accomplish these goals, \u201cwe the people further find that it is necessary to reform the law as developed in numerous California Supreme Court decisions and as set fortlf in the statutes of this state. These decisions and statutes have unnecessarily expanded the rights of accused criminals far beyond that which is required by the UniteduStates Constitution^ thereby unnecessarily adding to the costs of criminal cases, and diverting the judicial process from its function as a quest for truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Finally, the preamble observes that the goals of the measure are \u201cto restore balance to our criminal law system, to create a system in which justice is swift and fair, ... in which violent criminals receive just punishment, in which crime victims and witnesses are treated with care and respect, and in which society as a whole can be free from the fear of crime in our homes, neighborhoods, and schools.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The measure adopts a variety of changes and additions to our state Constitution and statutes. We summarize the primary changes and additions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">B. <em>Postindictment Preliminary Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">The measure adds section 14.1 to article I of the state Constitution, to provide that \u201cIf a felony is prosecuted by indictment, there shall be no postindictment preliminary hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">C. <em>Independent Construction of State Constitutional Criminal Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-13\">The measure amends section 24 of article I of the state Constitution, to provide that certain enumerated criminal law rights shall be construed consistently with the United States Constitution, and shall not be construed to afford greater rights to criminal or juvenile defendants than afforded by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the federal Constitution. We discuss this amendment in greater detail in connection with our analysis of the \u201crevision\u201d issue (pt. III.B., below).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">D. <em>People Entitled to Due Process and Speedy, Public Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The measure adds section 29 to article I of the state Constitution, to provide that \u201cIn a criminal case, the people of the State of California have the right to due process of law and to a speedy and public trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">E. <em>Joinder and Severance of Cases</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Section 30, subdivision (a), is added to article I, declaring that the state Constitution will not be construed to bar joinder of criminal cases as may be provided by law. In addition, the measure adds section 954.1 to the Penal Code, stating that jointly charged offenses need not be cross-admissible to join them for trial. Finally, section 1050.1 is added to the Penal Code to provide that (1) a continuance granted to one or more jointly charged codefendants shall constitute good cause for a continuance as to the other codefendants, so as to maintain the joinder of cases, and (2) the court shall not sever jointly charged cases due to the unavailability or unpreparedness of one or more codefendants unless it is impossible for all codefendants to be available and prepared within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">F. <em>Hearsay Testimony at Preliminary Hearings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Section 30, subdivision (b), is added to article I of the state Constitution, declaring hearsay evidence admissible at preliminary hearings in criminal cases, as may be provided by law. (See also new Pen. Code, \u00a7 872, subd. (b) [probable cause finding may rest on hearsay testimony by officer possessing certain credentials and experience]; new Evid. Code, \u00a7 1203.1 [exception to Evid. Code, \u00a7 1203 requirement for cross-examination of hearsay declarant].)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">G. <em>Discovery Procedures</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Section 30, subdivision (c), is added to article I of the state Constitution! calling for \u201creciprocal\u201d discovery in criminal cases, as may be provided by law. The measure also adds a new chapter to the Penal Code (\u00a7 1054 <em>ejl </em>seq.), outlining thematerials and information that the prosecutor andcriminal defendant must jointly disH\u00f3se,\" such as the names, addresses and statements of intended witnesses. ,/</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">In addition, the measure deletes language in sections 859, 1102.5, 1\u00cd\u00d32.7 and 1430 of the Penal Code superseded by the new provisions. Finally, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>section 866 of the Penal Code is amended to provide that at the preliminary examination, (1) the prosecutor may demand an offer of proof as to defense testimony, (2) the magistrate shall not permit the testimony unless it meets certain criteria (e.g., it establishes an affirmative defense, negates an element of the crime, or impeaches a witness), and (3) the purpose of the hearing is to determine probable cause, not to afford the parties an opportunity for further discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">H. <em>Voir Dire Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The measure adds section 223 to the Code of Civil Procedure (and repeals former Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 223.5), to provide that in criminal cases (1) the court shall conduct voir dire examination of prospective jurors, (2) the parties may conduct further examination on a showing of good cause, (3) voir dire should occur in the presence of the other jurors \u201cwhere practicable,\u201d (4) voir dire is limited to exploring possible challenges for cause, and (5) errors in discretionary rulings regarding voir dire examination do not require reversal of judgment unless a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">I. <em>Felony-murder Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Penal Code section 189, the felony-murder statute, is amended to add kidnapping, train wrecking, and various sex offenses to the list of felonies supporting a charge of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">J. <em>Special Circumstance Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Penal Code section 190.2 is amended in various respects, including (1) expanding the witness-murder provision (subd. (a)(10)) to include juvenile proceedings; (2) deleting the requirement in the torture-murder provision (subd. (a)(18)) of proof of the infliction of extreme physical pain; (3) dispensing with any requirement the actual killer have an intent to kill, as to any special circumstance provision not expressly requiring such intent; (4) imposing a penalty of death or life imprisonment without parole for aiders and abettors of first degree murder who intend to kill, when special circumstances exist; and (5) imposing a penalty of death or life imprisonment without parole for aiders and abettors of felony murder who \u201cwith reckless indifference to human life and as a major participant\u201d aid and abet in the commission of any felony specified in Penal Code section 189 that results in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">In addition, new section 190.41 is added to the Penal Code, providing that the corpus delicti of a felony-murder special circumstance \u201cneed not be proved independently of a defendant\u2019s extrajudicial statement.\u201d Further, section 190.5 is added to the Penal Code, providing for a penalty of life imprisonment without parole, or a term of 25 years to life, for defendants ages 16 or 17, who commit first degree murder, when special circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>exist. Finally, section 1385.1 is added to the Penal Code, providing that a judge may not strike or dismiss a special circumstance finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">K. <em>Torture Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">The measure adds sections 206 and 206.1 to the Penal Code, to define the crime of torture, dispense with the requirement of proof the victim suffered pain, and impose a term of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">L. <em>Appointment of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The measure adds section 987.05 to the Penal Code, requiring the appointment of counsel willing and able to proceed with the preliminary examination and trial of felony cases in a timely manner, in accordance with standards specified in the new provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">M. <em>Trial Date and Continuances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Section 1049.5 is added to the Penal Code to provide for a trial of felony cases within 60 days of arraignment unless good cause is shown (and stated on the record) for lengthening the time. New section 1511 is added to the Penal Code to allow either party to seek appellate writ review of a ruling which sets the trial beyond the 60-day period without good cause, or continues the hearing of any matter without good cause. Such a petition has preference over all other cases. (See also new Pen. Code, \u00a7 871.6 [mandate review by superior court of delays in holding preliminary examinations].)</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">N. <em>Severance Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">The measure contains a severance clause declaring that, \u201cIf any provision of this measure or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the measure wjiish^^^^^y^S^ffect without the invalid provision or appljcation, and to thia:/Cn3^eprovisionsof this measure are severable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">t <em>\\</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">O. <em>Amendment by Lie ' </em>\u2019 <em>ture</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">The measure\u2019s statutory provisions \u201cmay not be amended by the Legislature except by statute passed in each house by roll call vote entered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>journal, two-thirds of the membership concurring, or by a statute that becomes effective only when approved by the electors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">III. Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">A. <em>Single-subject Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Under the California Constitution, \u201cAn initiative measure embracing <em>more </em>than one subject <em>may not </em>be submitted to the electors or have any effect.\u201d (Art. II, \u00a7 8, subd. (d).) This court has recently considered numerous initiative challenges based on the single-subject rule, and the principles that guide our analysis are now well settled.  We have held that \u201can initiative measure does not violate the single-subject requirement \u2018if, despite its varied collateral effects, <em>all of its parts are \u201creasonably germane </em>\u201d to each other,\u2019 and to the general purpose or object of the initiative. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brosnahan, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 245, quoting <em>Amador, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 230, italics added by <em>Brosnahan; </em>see also <em>Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 805, 841-842 [258 Cal.Rptr, 161, 771 P.2d 1247]; <em>Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1078, 1098-1099 [240 Cal.Rptr. 569, 742 P.2d 1290]; <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 33, 38-41 [157 Cal.Rptr. 855, 599 P.2d 46] [hereafter <em>FPPC].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The case closest on point is <em>Brosnahan </em>itself, which dealt with a multifarious criminal justice reform initiative (Proposition 8) quite similar in purpose, scope and effect to the measure under scrutiny here. We summarized the essential components of Proposition 8 at 32 Cal.3d, pages 242-245 of our <em>Brosnahan </em>opinion. The measure contained a preamble, comparable to the one introducing Proposition 115, expressing \u201cgrave statewide concern\u201d for crime victims and announcing \u201cbroad reforms\u201d in the procedures governing the trial and sentencing of criminals.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">There followed a variety of constitutional and statutory provisions and amendments, including a right to <em>restitution </em>by crime victims, an \u201cinalienable right\u201d to <em>safe schools, </em>a \u201ctruth-in-evidence\u201d provision which essentially abrogated most of the state\u2019s <em>evidentiary exclusionary rules, </em>restrictions on <em>bail, </em>unlimited use of <em>prior convictions </em>for impeachment or enhancement purposes, abolition of the <em>diminished capacity defense, </em>sentence enhancements for <em>habitual criminals, </em>consideration at sentencing of <em>statements of crime victims </em>or their families, limitations on <em>plea bargaining, </em>restrictions on commitment to the <em>California Youth Authority, </em>and repeal of provisions governing <em>mentally disordered sex offenders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">In <em>Brosnahan, </em>we held that, despite its varied topics, \u201cit is readily apparent that Proposition 8 meets the \u2018reasonably germane\u2019 standard.\u201d (32 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>at p. 247.) We described the theme unifying these various provisions as follows: \u201cEach of [the measure\u2019s] several facets bears a common concern, \u2018general object\u2019 or \u2018general subject,\u2019 <em>promoting the rights of actual or potential crime victims. </em>As explained in the initiative\u2019s preamble, the 10 sections were designed to strengthen <em>procedural and substantive safeguards for victims in our criminal justice system. </em>These changes were aimed at achieving more severe punishment for, and more effective deterrence of, criminal acts, protecting the public from the premature release into society of criminal offenders, providing safety from crime to a particularly vulnerable group of victims, namely school pupils and staff, and assuring restitution for the victims of criminal acts, [fl] . . . Proposition 8 constitutes a reform aimed at certain features of the criminal justice system <em>to protect and enhance the rights of crime victims. </em>This goal is the readily discernible common thread which unites all of the initiative\u2019s provisions in advancing its common purpose.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><em>Brosnahan </em>is controlling here. As with Proposition 8, the various elements of Proposition 115 unite to form a comprehensive criminal justice reform package. As in <em>Brosnahan, </em>the measure was \u201cdesigned to strengthen procedural and substantive safeguards for victims in our criminal justice system.\u201d (32 Cal.3d at p. 247.) Procedurally, restrictions are imposed on the rights of criminal defendants during the <em>discovery </em>stage (allowing reciprocal discovery, and codifying discovery rules), the <em>preliminary examination </em>stage (excluding postindictment preliminary hearings, and allowing use of hearsay testimony), and the <em>trial </em>stage (promoting joinder and limiting severance, restricting voir dire by counsel, regulating appointment of counsel, and limiting trial continuances). Substantively, the measure creates the new offense of <em>torture, </em>and revises both the <em>felony-murder </em>and <em>special circumstance </em>statutes, to achieve more severe punishment for criminal defendants whose offenses or conduct fall within those provisions. As in <em>Brosnahan, </em>the single subject of Proposition 115 is promotion of the rights of actual and potential crime victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">A subsidiary unifying theme underlying Proposition 115 is that/ajl the, foregoing .changes appear directed toward abrogating particular holdings of this court that the initiative\u2019s framers deemed unduly expansive of criminal defendants\u2019 rights. Once again, <em>Brosnahan </em>applies here. In that case, we stressed that ^'W'e are reinforced in our conclusion that Proposition 8 embraces a single subject by observing that the measure appears to reflect public dissatisfaction with several prior judicial decisions in the area of criminal law .... In our democratic society in the absence of some compelling, overriding constitutional imperative, we should not prohibit the sovereign people from either expressing or implementing their own will on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>matters of such direct and immediate importance to them as their own perceived safety.\u201d (32 Cal.3d at p. 248.)</p>\n<p id=\"ATr\">As previously observed, the preamble to Proposition 115 recites that \u201cwe the people further find that it is necessary to reform the law as developed in numerous California Supreme Court decisions . . . [that] have unnecessarily expanded the rights of accused criminals.\u201d The measure proceeds to adopt various changes in procedural or substantive law previously man-1 dated by this court. For example, thfejestriction on postindictment prelimii nary hearings seems directed toward our holding in Hawkins v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 5 84 [150 Cal.Rptr. 435; 586 P.2d 916]; the changes in the special circumstance statutes seem aimed at such decisions as <em>People </em>v. <em>Spears </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 279 [188 Cal.Rptr. 454, 655 P.2d 1289] (sentence of life imprisonment without parole unavailable for persons under age 18), <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 470 [179 Cal.Rptr. 443, 637 P.2d 1029] (trial court\u2019s power to strike or dismiss special circumstance finding), <em>People </em>v. <em>Mattson </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 85 [207 Cal.Rptr. 278, 688 P.2d 887] (independent proof of corpus delicti required for felony-murder special circumstance), and <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862] (intent to kill requirement). Similar citations could be provided for the other procedural and substantive changes accomplished by Proposition 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">Thus, although the provisions of Proposition 115 seem somewhat disparate, as in <em>Brosnahan </em>they reflect a consistent theme or purpose to nullify particular decisions of our court affecting various aspects of the criminal justice system. We do not suggest, of course, that a measure addressing wholly diverse and unrelated subjects could be saved from a single-subject challenge by the mere fact of perceived public displeasure with court decisions or statutes treating those matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Petitioners argue that the broad diversity of the provisions of Proposition 115 suggests the possibility that \u201clogrolling\u201d played a part in its passage. They contend that \u201cThe law [Proposition 115] also links together matters which, by themselves, could not command a majority yet do so either by combining minority constituencies or by adding on many provisions as, in effect, loosely affiliated \u2018riders\u2019 to other provisions which command strong public support. (See <em>Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian [supra] </em>43 Cal.3d at 1096.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">We considered and rejected a similar argument in <em>Brosnahan, </em>noting that such risks are inherent in the passage of most laws, whether enacted by the Legislature or by initiative, in which benefits and burdens must be evaluated. As we stated, \u201cThe decision to enact laws, whether directly by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>people or through their representatives, involves the weighing of pros and cons. The resolution of few public issues is free from this balancing process and exercise of choices.\u201d (32 Cal.3d at p. 251.) We thus rejected the argument that the single-subject rule contemplates some functional interrelationship or interdependence, or \u201crequires a showing that each one of a measure\u2019s several provisions was capable of gaining voter approval independently of the other provisions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>FPPC, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 42; <em>Amador, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 232.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Finally, petitioners suggest the diversity of its provisions rendered Proposition 115 \u201cunconscionably complex, defying ready summary or easy comprehension by even the most \u2018conscientious and sophisticated\u2019 voters.\u201d We disagree. As with Proposition 8 in <em>Brosnahan, </em>Proposition 115 was the subject of intense public focus (centering on its potential effect on abortion rights) prior to the election. The official voters\u2019 pamphlet set forth a summary of the measure, a detailed analysis by Jjhe Legislative Analyst, and a complete text of the proposed measure, together with tHe customary written arguments and rebuttals. We must assume the voters duly considered and comprehended these materials. <em>(See Brosnahan, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 251-252; <em>Amador, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 231, 243-244.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Supplementing their single-subject attack, petitioners predict dire consequences will befall the state if Proposition 115 is permitted to remain in effect. They posit great delays and soaring financial costs in prosecuting, defending and trying cases. Similar arguments were made in <em>Brosnahan, </em>in which the petitioners forecast \u201cjudicial and educational chaos\u201d as a result of the implementation of Proposition 8. (32 Cal.3d at p. 261; see also <em>Amador, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 224-226.) As we indicated in both those cases, nothing on the face of the challenged measures \u201cnecessarily or inevitably\u201d compels such dire results. A similar conclusion applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">We conclude that Proposition 115 does not violate the single-subject Requirement of the California Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\n<em>B. Constitutional Revision or Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Petitioners next argue that Proposition 115 in effect achieved a constitutional <em>revision </em>rather than a mere amendment. Although \u201c[t]he electors mayfainehd the Constitution by initiative\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XVIII, \u00a7 3), a \u201crevision]^ of the Constitution may be accomplished only by convening a constitutional convention and obtaining popular ratification <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 2), or by legislative submission of the measure to the voters <em>(id., </em>\u00a7 1). (See also <em>Amador, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 221.) Petitioners suggest the revision provision is based on the principle that \u201ccomprehensive changes\u201d to the Consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tution require more formality, discussion and deliberation than is available through the initiative process. (See Note, <em>Preelection Judicial Review: Taking the Initiative in Voter Protection </em>(1983) 71 Cal.L.Rev. 1216, 1224.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Although the Constitution does not define the terms \u201camendment\u201d or \u201crevision,\u201d the courts have developed some guidelines helpful in resolving the present issue. As explained in <em>Amador, </em>and confirmed in <em>Brosnahan, </em>our revision/amendment analysis has a dual aspect, requiring us to examine both the quantitative and qualitative effects of the measure on our constitutional scheme. Substantial changes in either respect could amount to a revision. (See <em>Brosnahan, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 260; <em>Amador, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 223.) Before examining the applicable authorities in greater depth, we first set forth the nature of petitioners\u2019 revision challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Petitioners\u2019 arguments focus primarily on a single provision of Proposition 115, namely, the amendment to article I, section 24, of the state Constitution relating to the independent nature of certain rights guaranteed by that Constitution. (The additional constitutional changes effected by Proposition 115, involving such\u201dTsoIated matters as postindictment preliminary hearings, joinder of cases, use of hearsay, reciprocal discovery, and the People\u2019s right to due process and a speedy, public tria 1. -cannot he deemed matters which standing alone, or in the aggregate, substantially^ change our preexisting governmental framework.) As will appear, petitioners\u2019 arguments\" are welt Taken. '</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Article I, section 24, added in 1974, originally provided in relevant part that \u201cRights guaranteed by this Constitution are not dependent on those guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d Proposition 115 would add the important proviso that \u201cIn criminal cases the rights of a defendant to equal protection of the laws, to due process of law, to the assistance of counsel, to be personally present with counsel, to a speedy and public trial, to compel the attendance of witnesses, to confront the witnesses against him or her, to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, to privacy, to not be compelled to be a witness against himself or herself, to not be placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense, and not to suffer the imposition of cruel or unusual punishment, shall be construed by the courts of this state in a manner consistent with the Constitution of the United States. This Constitution shall not be construed by the courts to afford greater rights to criminal defendants than those afforded by the Constitution of the United States, nor shall it be construed to afford greater rights to minors in juvenile proceedings on criminal causes than those afforded by the Constitution of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Petitioners stress the formidable impact of the measure on the constitutional rights of criminal defendants, asserting that at least 32 such rights are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>affected and essentially \u201celiminated\u201d by Proposition 115 and its amendment to section 24 to article I of the Constitution (hereafter article I, section 24). In petitioners\u2019 view, the measure has in essence \u201cvested\u201d or \u201cdelegated\u201d all judicial interpretive power respecting those rights in or to the <em>federal </em>courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Respondent Attorney General, on the other hand, consistent with an interpretation previously given by him (see Cal. Dept. Justice, 1990 Crime Victims Justice Reform Initiative, Proposition 115 Manual, at pp. 13-15), talces the position that the last sentence of the new section must be read as referring only to the enumerated rights mentioned in the immediately preceding sentence, and not also to unspecified rights, such as the right to jury trial, free speech, habeas corpus or bail. Otherwise, the last sentence would render wholly superfluous the preceding sentence specifying the various rights affected, a result we must avoid in construing the measure. (E.g., <em>Legislature </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 658, 676 [194 Cal.Rptr. 781, 669 P.2d 17] [constitutional provisions added by initiative \u201cmust be harmonized and construed to give effect to all parts\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">We need not resolve the foregoing interpretive debate, for even if we adopt respondent\u2019s position, in our view the effect of the measure would be so far reaching as to amount to a constitutional revision beyond the scope of the initiative process. We turn to a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative effects of Proposition 115 and particularly its restriction on the independent judicial interpretation of the enumerated state constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">1. <em>Quantitative </em>effect\u2014Quantitatively, Proposition 115 does not seem \u201cso extensive ... as to change directly the \u2018substantial entirety\u2019 of the Constitution by the deletion or alteration of numerous existing provisions . . . .\u201d <em>(Amador, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 223.) The measure deletes no existing constitutional language and it affects only <em>one </em>constitutional article, namely, article I. As previously outlined, the measure adds three new sections to this article and amends a fourth section. In short, the quantitative effects on the Constitution seem no more, extensive than those presented in prior cases upholding initiative measures challenged as constitutional revisions. (See <em>Brosnahan, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 260 [upholding measure likewise affecting only Cal. Const., art. I]; <em>Amador, supra, </em>at p. 224 [upholding measure affecting only a few articles dealing with taxation]; cf. <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 330, 334-345 [196 P.2d 787] [invalidating measure adding 21,000 words to Constitution and affecting 15 of its 25 articles].)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">2. <em>Qualitative </em>effect\u2014We have stated that, apart from a measure effecting widespread deletions, additions and amendments involving many constitutional articles, \u201ceven a relatively simple enactment may accomplish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>such far reaching changes in the nature of our basic governmental plan as to amount to a revision also .... <em>[A]n enactment which purported to vest all judicial power in the Legislature would amount to a revision </em>without regard either to the length or complexity of the measure or the number of existing articles or sections affected by such change.\u201d <em>(Amador, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 223, italics added; see also <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>32 Cal.2d at pp. 347-348 [rejecting argument that revision must involve changes affecting <em>all </em>articles of Constitution].)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Proposition 115 contemplates a similar qualitative change. In essence and practical effect, new article I, section 24, would vest all judicial <em>interpretive </em>power, as to fundamental criminal defense rights, in the United States Supreme Court. From a qualitative standpoint, the effect of Proposition 115 is devastating.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Even under respondent Attorney General\u2019s \u201climited\u201d construction of new article I, section 24, fundamental constitutional rights are implicated, including the rights to due process of law, equal protection of the law, assistance of counsel, and avoidance of cruel and unusual punishment. As to these rights, as well as the other important rights listed in new section 24, California courts in criminal cases would no longer have authority to interpret the state Constitution in a manner more protective of defendants\u2019 rights than extended by the federal Constitution, as construed by the United States Supreme Court. (Decisions of the lower federal courts interpreting federal law, though persuasive, are not binding on state courts. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1969) 1 Cal.3d 80, 86 [81 Cal.Rptr. 457, 460 P.2d 129]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7 780, p. 751, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">For example, if the high court were to rule that public torture or maiming of persons convicted of minor misdemeanors did not offend the federal due process, equal protection or cruel and unusual punishment clauses, presumably the California courts interpreting similar state constitutional guaranties would be compelled to agree and to uphold state legislation imposing such severe forms of punishment. As a practical matter, ultimate protection of criminal defendants from deprivation of their constitutional rights would be left in the care of the United States Supreme Court. Moreover, the nature and extent of state constitutional guaranties would remain uncertain and undeveloped unless and until the high court had spoken and clarified <em>federal </em>constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In effect, new article I, section 24, would substantially alter the substance and integrity of the state Constitution as a document of independent force and effect. As an historical matter, article I and its Declaration of Rights was viewed as the only available protection for our citizens charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>crimes, because the federal Constitution and its Bill of Rights was initially deemed to apply only to the conduct of the federal government. In framing the Declaration of Rights in both the 1849 and 1879 California Constitutions, the drafters largely looked to the constitutions of the other states, rather than the federal Constitution, as potential models. (See e.g., <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1230, 1241-1245 [265 Cal.Rptr. 144, 783 P.2d 731]; <em>Barron </em>v. <em>Baltimore </em>(1833) 32 U.S. 243, 247-251 [8 L.Ed. 672, 674-675]; Grodin, <em>Some Reflections on State Constitutions </em>(1988) 15 Hastings Const.L.Q. 391, 393-397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Thus, Proposition 115 not only unduly restricts judicial power, but it does so in a way which severely limits the independent force and effect of the California Constitution. We acknowledge that, as respondent Attorney General observes, the idea of deferring to the United States Supreme Court in interpreting identical or similar constitutional language found in the state and federal Constitutions is not new. As early as 1938, we stated that \u201ccogent reasons must exist before a state court in construing a provision of the state Constitution will depart from the construction placed by the Supreme Court of the United States on a similar provision in the federal Constitution.\u201d <em>(Gabrielli </em>v. <em>Knickerbocker </em>(1938) 12 Cal.2d 85, 89 [82 P.2d 391]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Teresinski </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 822, 835-839 [180 Cal.Rptr. 617, 640 P.2d 753]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 334, 349-361 [161 Cal.Rptr. 762, 605 P.2d 401]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Houston </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 595, 624 [230 Cal.Rptr. 141, 724 P.2d 1166] [dis. opn. by Lucas, J., discerning no \u201cindependent state interest needing additional protection\u201d than afforded by federal law]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Disbrow </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 101, 119 [127 Cal.Rptr. 360, 545 P.2d 272] [dis. opn. by Richardson, J., calling for deference to the high court\u2019s constitutional interpretations \u201cin the absence of very strong countervailing circumstances\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Norman </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 929, 941 [123 Cal.Rptr. 109, 538 P.2d 237] [dis. opn. by Clark, J.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The foregoing authorities acknowledge and support a <em>general </em>principle or policy of deference to United States Supreme Court decisions, a policy applicable in the absence of good cause for departure or deviation therefrom. Yet it is one thing voluntarily to defer to high court decisions, but quite another to <em>mandate </em>the state courts\u2019 blind obedience thereto, despite \u201ccogent reasons,\u201d \u201cindependent state interests,\u201d or \u201cstrong countervailing circumstances\u201d that might lead our courts to construe similar state constitutional language differently from the federal approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Despite the general rule of deference, the adoption in 1974 of article I, section 24, confirmed that the California courts had the authority to adopt an independent interpretation of the state Constitution. As the section then read, in pertinent part, \u201cRights guaranteed by this Constitution are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>dependent on those guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\u201d This declaration of independence made explicit a preexisting fundamental principle of constitutional jurisprudence (see Ballot Pamp., Proposed Stats, and Amends, to Cal. Const, with arguments to voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 5, 1974), analysis by Legislative Analyst, p. 26), and in the years that followed served as the basis for numerous decisions interpreting the state Constitution as extending protection to our citizens beyond the limits imposed by the high court under the federal Constitution. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Houston, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 595, 609-610 [self-incrimination privilege]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 136, 152 [207 Cal.Rptr. 800, 689 P.2d 430] [due process clause]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bustamante </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 88, 97-99 [177 Cal.Rptr. 576, 634 P.2d 927] [right to counsel]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pettingill </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 231, 247-248 [145 Cal.Rptr. 861, 578 P.2d 108] [self-incrimination privilege]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hannon </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 588, 606-608 [138 Cal.Rptr. 885, 564 P.2d 1203] [right to speedy trial]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Disbrow, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 101, 114-115 [self-incrimination privilege]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Norman, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 929, 939 [unreasonable search and seizure]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brisendine </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 528, 548-552 [119 Cal.Rptr. 315, 531 P.2d 1099] [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">While acknowledging the policy of deference, most of the foregoing cases reaffirmed the overriding principle that this court sits \u201cas a court of last resort [in interpreting state constitutional guaranties], subject only to the qualification that our interpretations may not restrict the guarantees accorded the national citizenry under the federal charter.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Longwill </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 943, 951, fn. 4 [123 Cal.Rptr. 297, 538 P.2d 753].) In each of these cases, dissenting justices argued against adopting an independent interpretation of the applicable state constitutional provisions. But no dissenter ever suggested that deference was compelled as a matter of constitutional imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Proposition 115 imposes such an imperative for the first time in California\u2019s history. It substantially alters the preexisting constitutional scheme or framework heretofore extensively and repeatedly used by courts in interpreting and enforcing state constitutional protections. It directly contradicts the well-established jurisprudential principle that, \u201cThe judiciary, from the very nature of its powers and means given it by the Constitution, must possess the right to construe the Constitution in the last resort . . . .\u201d <em>(Nogues </em>v. <em>Douglass </em>(1858) 7 Cal. 65, 69-70; see also <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison </em>(1803) 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 176 [2 L.Ed. 60, 73] [interpreting and applying the Constitution is \u201cthe very essence of judicial power\u201d]; <em>Marin Water, etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad Com. </em>(1916) 171 Cal. 706, 711-712 [154 P. 864].) In short, in the words of <em>Amador, supra, </em>this \u201crelatively simple enactment [accomplishes] . . . such far reaching changes in the nature of our basic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>governmental plan as to amount to a revision . . . .\u201d (22 Cal.3d at p. 223; see <em>also Livermore </em>v. <em>Waite </em>(1894) 102 Cal. 113, 118-119 [36 P. 424] [revisions involve changes in the \u201cunderlying principles\u201d on which the Constitution rests].)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">It is true, as the Attorney General observes, that in two earlier cases we rejected revision challenges to initiative measures which included somewhat similar restrictions on judicial power. In <em>In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 891 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744], we upheld a provision limiting the state exclusionary remedy for search and seizure violations to the boundaries fixed by the Fourth Amendment to the federal Constitution. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Frierson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 142, 184-187 [158 Cal.Rptr. 281, 599 P.2d 587], we upheld a provision which in essence required California courts in capital cases to apply the state cruel or unusual punishment clause consistently with the federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Both <em>Lance W. </em>and <em>Frierson </em>concluded that no constitutional revision was involved because the isolated provisions at issue therein achieved no far reaching, fundamental changes in our governmental plan. But neither case involved a broad attack on state court authority to exercise independent judgment in construing a wide spectrum of important rights under the state Constitution. New article I, section 24, more closely resembles <em>Amador\u2019s </em>hypothetical provision vesting all judicial power in the Legislature, a provisioti we deemed would achieve a constitutional revision. As noted, in <em>practi</em>cal effect, the.new provision vests a critical portion of state judicial power in the United States Supreme Court, certainly a fundamental change in oi\u00edr preexisting governmental plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that new article I, section 24, represents an invalid revision of the California Constitution. But its invalidity does not affect the remaining provisions of Proposition 115, which are clearly severable from the invalid portion. As previously indicated, Proposition 115 contains a severance clause providing, \u201cIf any provision of this measure or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the measure which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this measure are severable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">The remaining provisions of Proposition 115 clearly can be \u201cgiven effect\u201d without regard to the validity or operation of the provision purporting to revise the \u201cindependent rights\u201d principle of article I, section 24. As we recently explained, \u201c[t]he cases prescribe three criteria for severability: the invalid provision must be grammatically, functionally, and volitionally separable. [Citations].\u201d <em>(Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>pp. 821-822 [involving validity of Proposition 103, an insurance rate initiative].) We briefly demonstrate that the present measure satisfies each of the foregoing criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">First, the invalid provision is mechanically and grammatically severable, constituting a separate and distinct provision of Proposition 115 which can be removed without affecting the wording of any other provision. Second, the invalid provision is functionally severable, touching on. an area, (judicial 1 coristfuction of state constitutional provisions) essentially unrelated ta any | of the various remaining substantive or procedural provisions. Finally, the invalid p\u00f3\u00edtib\u00f1 is volitionally severable, in that the remainder of the measure probably would have been adopted by the people even if they had foreseen the success of petitioners\u2019 revision challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The petition for a peremptory writ of mandate is granted to the extent that it seeks to compel respondents to refrain from enforcing section 3 of Proposition 115. In all other respects the petition is denied. The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Broussard, J., Panelli, J., Eagleson, J., Kennard, J., and Arabian, J., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b388-7\">MOSK, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGP\">Concurring and Dissenting.\u2014I join in the unanimous opinion of the court on the revision issue. The Chief Justice has explicated the basis for holding that section 3 of the measure known as Proposition 115 would have effected a revision of the California Constitution contrary to the requirements of our fundamental law.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">I part company with my colleagues on the single-subject issue. I do not agree that this case is controlled by <em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 236 [186 Cal.Rptr. 30, 651 P.2d 274]. If it were, we should forthrightly overrule that discredited four-to-three decision and restore the constitutional single-subject rule to its appropriate role.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Parenthetically, one cannot fail to observe widespread disenchantment with the modern initiative process. At the November 6, 1990, General Election, 10 of the 13 initiatives on the ballot were defeated by the voters, some perhaps on the merits, but some undoubtedly because of prolix texts that were perplexing to all but the measures\u2019 authors.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\"><em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 236, dealt with only one initiative on the June 8, 1982, Primary Election ballot, and magnanimously held the measure did not violate the single-subject rule. The opinion, however, did not give carte blanche to initiative promoters to join together numerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>disparate topics into one \u201cgrabbag\u201d proposal, held together with a seductive title designed for voter appeal. Indeed, the four justices in the majority warned that they were not suggesting \u201cthat initiative proponents are given blank checks to draft measures containing unduly diverse or extensive provisions bearing no reasonable relationship to each other . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 253.) In short, they were considering one proposition only and not devising a rule requiring approval of subsequent measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">A cursory reading of Proposition 115 reveals the monumental complexity and diversity of the 31 sections that it contains. The measure reaches into multitudinous areas. It also makes many changes. For example, in the Constitution, three new sections are added and one amended; in the Code of Civil Procedure, one new section is added and two repealed; in the Evidence Code, one new section is added; and in the Penal Code, eighteen new sections are added, six sections are amended, and three sections are repealed. It is difficult to conceive of a more pervasive violation of the single-subject rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Since 1911 the California Constitution has declared that the legislative power is vested in the Legislature but the people reserve to themselves the power of initiative. The original wording was as follows: \u201cThe legislative power of this State shall be vested in a senate and assembly which shall be designated \u2018The legislature of the State of California,\u2019 but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws and amendments to the Constitution, and to adopt or reject the same at the polls, independent of the Legislature . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., former art. IV, \u00a7 1, added by initiative, Special Statewide Elec. (Oct. 10, 1911), reprinted in Stats. 1911, Ex. Sess. 1911, p. xvi.) The present wording is simply: \u201cThe legislative power of this State is vested in the California Legislature which consists of the Senate and Assembly, but the people reserve to themselves the power[] of initiative . . . .\u201d (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">It has long been recognized that \u201cthe initiative is in essence a legislative battering ram which may be used to tear through the exasperating tangle of the traditional legislative procedure and strike directly toward the desired end.\u201d (Key &amp; Crouch, The Initiative and the Referendum in California (1939) p. 458 (hereafter Key and Crouch).) Although lawmaking by the Legislature and lawmaking by the people are different in process, they are, of course, identical in substance and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">On March 2, 1948, a bill entitled \u201cAssembly Constitutional Amendment No. 2\u201d was introduced in that body to add the single-subject rule as section lc of article IV of the California Constitution. (Assem. J. (1948 Reg. Sess.) p. 68.) On March 26 the Assembly concurred in certain Senate amendments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>to the bill and ordered the measure enrolled. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 659-660.) On March 27 Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 2 was filed with the Secretary of State. (Assem. J., <em>supra, </em>at p. 709.) It read: \u201cEvery constitutional amendment or statute proposed by the initiative shall relate to but one subject. No such amendment or statute shall hereafter be submitted to the electors if it embraces more than one subject, nor shall any such amendment or statute embracing more than one subject, hereafter submitted to or approved by the electors, become effective for any purpose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 660.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Preceding Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 2 was \u201ca series of initiatives in the 1930s and 40s, mostly far-reaching pension plans proposed by the so-called \u2018ham and eggs\u2019 movement led by Lawrence and Willis Allen. The initiative that apparently was the immediate stimulus for, the [measure] was a \u2018ham and eggs\u2019 proposal\u2014the self-styled \u2018California Bill of Rights\u2019\u2014some of whose many provisions related to pensions, taxes, right to vote for Indians, gambling, oleomargarine, the health professions, reapportionment of the State Senate, fish and game, and surface mining. Petitions for the \u2018bill of rights\u2019 measure were circulating when [Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 2] was introduced into and approved by the legislature. Campaign arguments supporting [the latter] when it was on the ballot generally used the \u2018bill of rights\u2019 measure as an example of the need for . . . a [single-subject] rule.\u201d (Lowenstein, <em>California Initiatives and the Single-Subject Rule </em>(1983) 30 UCLA L.Rev. 936, 949-951, fns. omitted (hereafter Lowenstein).)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Evidently in late April or early May 1948, the \u201cCalifornia Bill of Rights\u201d initiative measure was certified as qualified for the ballot at the November 2, 1948, General Election. (Lowenstein, <em>supra, </em>30 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 950, fn. 57.) Before the election, in <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 330 [196 P.2d 787], the court ordered issuance of a writ of mandate directing the Secretary of State not to submit the measure to the voters, having determined that it \u201camounts substantially to an [improper] attempted revision, rather than [a proper] amendment, of our state Constitution\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 331).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 2 was placed on the ballot at the November 2, 1948, General Election as Proposition 10. The ballot pamphlet contained arguments for and against the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The argument in favor stated that \u201cThe purposes to be achieved are: [][] (1) Simplification and clarification of issues presented to the voters, and [fl] (2) A more intelligent amendment of the constitution by permitting the adopted sections to be placed in appropriate subdivisions of the constitution.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Proposed Stats, and Amends, to Cal. Const, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>arguments to voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 1948), pt. I, argument in favor of Prop. 10, p. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The argument in opposition was in pertinent part as follows: \u201cThe Constitution was amended in 1911 to reserve to the people the right to initiate laws and constitutional amendments\u2014the right, as individual electors, to a direct voice in the government of this State, [fl] Proponents of this proposition now seek to restrict this power reserved to the people by requiring that each initiative measure relate to only one subject, [fl] There is no basis upon which this infringement on the right of the people can be justified . . . . fl[] ... [^1] Should this proposition carry it will create a lawyer\u2019s holiday as initiative measures hereafter will be attacked to prove that more than one subject was involved. After all, what constitutes one subject? Is \u2018taxation,\u2019 or \u2018education,\u2019 or \u2018liquor,\u2019 or \u2018social welfare\u2019 one or more than one subject? Only the Supreme Court will be able to determine after long and expensive litigation.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Proposed Stats, and Amends, to Cal. Const, with arguments to voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 1948), pt. I, argument against Prop. 10, p. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">On November 2, 1948, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 2 was approved by the voters and as a result section lc was added to article IV of the California Constitution. In 1966 section lc of article IV was repealed and section 22, subdivision (d), was added in its place: \u201cAn initiative measure embracing more than one subject may not be submitted to the electors or have any effect.\u201d Thus came the single-subject rule into its present wording. In 1976 section 22 of article IV was renumbered as section 8 of article II. Thus came the single-subject rule into its present numbering: article II, section 8, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In the years since its adoption, the single-subject rule has been construed and applied in several opinions by this court and its members and also by the Courts of Appeal: <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Jordan </em>(1949) 34 Cal.2d 87 [207 P.2d 47] (hereafter sometimes <em>Perry), </em>which followed <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1932) 215 Cal. 58 [8 P.2d 467], a case dealing with the single-subject rule for statutes; <em>Metropolitan Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Marquardt </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 159 [28 Cal.Rptr. 724, 379 P.2d 28] (dealing directly with the single-subject rule for statutes); <em>Schmitz </em>v. <em>Younger </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 90 [145 Cal.Rptr. 517, 577 P.2d 652]; <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]; <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 33 [157 Cal.Rptr. 855, 599 P.2d 46]; <em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 1 [181 Cal.Rptr. 100, 641 P.2d 200]; <em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 236; <em>Planned Parenthood Affiliates </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1187 [219 Cal.Rptr. 664] (dealing directly with the single-subject rule for statutes); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1078 [240 Cal.Rptr. 569, 742 P.2d 1290] (same); <em>California Trial Lawyers Assn. </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 351 [245 Cal.Rptr. 916]; and <em>Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 805 [258 Cal.Rptr. 161, 771 P.2d 1247].</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">After review of its history and its construction and application in specific cases, it becomes clear that the single-subject rule requires an initiative measure to constitute a coherent enactment in and of itself\u2014negatively, in the words of article II, section 8, subdivision (d), of the California Constitution, not to \u201cembrac[e] more than one subject.\u201d It is not enough for such a measure merely to be capable of bearing some label of indefinite scope. The reason is plain: <em>\u201cany </em>combination of concepts and things may appropriately be regarded as a \u2018subject\u2019 so long as there are people who find it expedient to so classify them\u201d (Lowenstein, <em>supra, </em>30 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 939, italics in original). Of course, such people <em>always </em>exist for <em>every </em>initiative, at least among its proponents. Therefore, if the rule required a label and nothing more, it would be nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">It follows that the \u201creasonably germane\u201d test\u2014which the cases have framed and used to implement the single-subject rule\u2014must contain as its ultimate criterion whether the initiative measure in question is internally interrelated as a whole and parts. To be sure, the test does \u201cnot require the several provisions of an initiative to be related to each other in any particular manner.\u201d (Lowenstein, <em>supra, </em>30 UCLA L.Rev. at p. 944.) But it does indeed require them to be related to each other in some reasonable fashion. (See <em>ibid.) </em>A standard that focuses on whether the measure is capable of bearing some label of indefinite scope is simply empty. This point has been recognized by the courts when they warn that \u201cthe rule obviously forbids joining disparate provisions which appear germane only to topics of excessive generality such as \u2018government\u2019 or \u2018public welfare.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 253; see <em>California Trial Lawyers Assn. </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 358; cf. <em>Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1099, 1100-1101 [single-subject rule for statutes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The conclusion that the single-subject rule establishes, as it were, a requirement of <em>substance </em>rather than <em>label </em>derives from the language of the rule, the intent underlying its words, the construction adopted and applied by the courts, and the actual results yielded in individual cases. These matters will be reviewed seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">First, the language of the single-subject rule reveals that the requirement established is one of substance rather than label. As noted, article II, section 8, subdivision (d), of the California Constitution declares that \u201cAn initiative measure embracing more than one subject may not be submitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>electors or have any effect.\u201d The rule impliedly requires initiatives to \u201cembrac[e]\u201d\u2014in other words, <em>comprise </em>\u2014only \u201cone subject.\u201d It does not speak only of a capability to bear some label of indefinite scope. This causes no surprise. As explained above, to require such a capability is to require virtually nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Second, the intent of the single-subject rule points to a requirement of substance rather than label. As the history presented above demonstrates, the basic object of the rule is manifest: to prevent the submission or approval of incoherent initiative measures that are little more than \u201cgrabbags\u201d of various provisions. Certainly, the object is <em>not </em>to require that a measure simply be capable of bearing some label of indefinite scope. The opponents of Proposition 10, which added the single-subject rule to the California Constitution, argued in the ballot pamphlet: \u201cShould this proposition carry it will create a lawyer\u2019s holiday as initiative measures hereafter will be attacked to prove that more than one subject was involved. After all, what constitutes one subject? Is \u2018taxation,\u2019 or \u2018education,\u2019 or \u2018liquor,\u2019 or \u2018social welfare\u2019 one or more than one subject? Only the Supreme Court will be able to determine after long and expensive litigation.\u201d (Ballot Pamp., Proposed Stats, and Amends, to Cal. Const, with arguments to voters, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 1948), pt. I, argument against Prop. 10, p. 9.) It should of course be presumed that the voters intended the rule <em>not </em>to be read in accordance with such a self-nullifying interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Whether or not, as has commonly been asserted, the single-subject rule is intended to prevent \u201clogrolling\u201d or voter confusion or both (see, e.g., <em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 7 (cone. &amp; dis. opn. of Mosk, J.) [voter confusion]; <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High School Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 231 [voter confusion]; <em>Schmitz </em>v. <em>Younger, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 97-98 (dis. opn. of Manuel, J.) [\u201clogrolling\u201d and voter confusion]; but see Lowenstein, <em>supra, </em>30 UCLA L.Rev. at pp. 954-963), the rule is perhaps best \u201cunderstood as simply reflecting a sense of what initiatives are supposed to be. The \u2018ham and eggs\u2019 proposals caused concern . . . mostly because they were simply too diverse and far-reaching. Such proposals . . . were . . . beyond the intended scope of the initiative as an instrument of governance. fl[] . . . The initiative was neither intended nor suited for wholesale law revisions. [][]... The initiative\u2019s purpose was to provide an outlet for the public\u2019s dissatisfaction with the legislature\u2019s treatment or nontreatment of an important and, in many cases, broad policy area .... The initiative process is not well-suited to simultaneous policy changes across the board. When such changes are desired, the remedy is to elect new legislators.\u201d (Lowenstein, <em>supra, </em>30 UCLA L.Rev. at pp. 963-964.) Put simply, the single-subject rule was intended to further coherent enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>Third, the construction of the single-subject rule adopted and applied by the courts reveals that the requirement established is one of substance rather than label. Thus, in the seminal decision of <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>supra, 34 Cal.2d 87, which was virtually contemporaneous with the adoption of the rule, the court declared: \u201c \u2018Numerous provisions, having one general object, . . . may be united in one act. Provisions governing projects so related and interdependent as to constitute a single scheme may be properly included within a single act . . . \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 92, quoting <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>215 Cal. at p. 62 , ellipsis added.) <em>Perry </em>has been expressly or impliedly followed, without deviation, in the years that followed. (See <em>Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 841-842; <em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 245-247; <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at pp. 38-39 (plur. opn.); <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 229-230; <em>California Trial Lawyers Assn. </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at pp. 357-358; cf. <em>Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1098 [single-subject rule for statutes]; <em>Planned Parenthood Affiliates </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1195-1197 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">It must, of course, be admitted that some cases do indeed contain loose language suggesting that the single-subject rule would be satisfied if the initiative measure in question was simply capable of bearing some label of indefinite scope. Such language, however, constitutes mere dictum: with the possible exception of <em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 236\u2014more on which later\u2014it is not necessary to any decision. Also, as explained above, it is radically unsound, threatening to make the constitutional requirement nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Fourth and finally, the actual results yielded in individual cases in which the single-subject rule operates show that the requirement established is one of substance rather than label.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Thus, a single-subject challenge was unanimously denied in <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>34 Cal.2d 87, which reviewed an initiative measure to repeal an article of the California Constitution providing for pensions for the needy aged and blind. A similar claim was unanimously rejected in <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 208, which considered the measure adding article XIII A, the parts of which were \u201creasonably interrelated and interdependent, forming an interlocking \u2018package\u2019 \u201d of real property tax reform (22 Cal.3d at p. 231). Another such claim was rejected in <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 33, which passed on the measure enacting the Political Reform Act of 1974, a \u201ccomprehensive[]\u201d and \u201cdetail[ed]\u201d scheme (25 Cal.3d at p. 41 (plur. opn.)) \u201cconcern[ing] elections and different methods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>for preventing corruption and undue influence in political campaigns and governmental activities\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 37 (plur. opn.)). Yet another such claim was unanimously rejected in <em>Calfarm Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 805, in which provisions allowing insurance agents to give rebates to consumers and permitting banks to sell insurance were held not to embrace a \u201csubject\u201d different from the balance of the measure, which dealt with making insurance more affordable and available. Finally, a claim under the single-subject rule for statutes was unanimously rejected in <em>Metropolitan Water Dist. </em>v. <em>Marquardt, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d 159, which considered a bond act comprising an integrated scheme for the development of the state\u2019s water resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">By contrast, a single-subject challenge was unanimously sustained in <em>California Trial Lawyers Assn. </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d 351. There the court held that the self-styled \u201cInsurance Cost Control Initiative of 1988,\u201d which was supported by the insurance industry, embraced more than one subject: one of the measure\u2019s sections would have provided that there was no limitation on campaign contributions by insurers and others and that state elected officials receiving such contributions were not disqualified from participating in decisions affecting a contributor\u2019s interests. Similar claims of violations under the single-subject rule for statutes were unanimously upheld in <em>Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1078, and <em>Planned Parenthood Affiliates </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d 1187. In the former, this court held invalid Senate Bill No. 1379 (Stats. 1984, ch. 268, p. 1302 et seq.), which contained numerous sections enacting, amending, repealing, and otherwise affecting numerous code and statutory provisions. In the latter, the Court of Appeal held invalid a section of the Budget Act of 1985 that went beyond appropriating funds for authorized activities to amending the substantive law authorizing those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In <em>California Trial Lawyers Assn. </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d 351, 360, the Court of Appeal effectively acknowledged that the proposed initiative measure there challenged was capable of bearing some label\u2014so long as that label was defined broadly enough. Similar acknowledgments appear, more or less clearly, in <em>Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1078, 1100-1101, and <em>Planned Parenthood Affiliates </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d 1187, 1198-1201. In none of these cases, however, was such \u201ccapability\u201d found sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Prominent by its absence from the foregoing analysis is, of course, the decision in <em>Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 236. As noted, a bare majority of four justices to three rejected a single-subject challenge to Proposition 8, the self-styled \u201cVictims\u2019 Bill of Rights.\u201d In my view, they erred. Instead of seeking to determine whether the measure comprised a single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>subject in and of itself, they asked in essence whether it was capable of bearing some label. By so doing, they misstepped\u2014fatally. As explained above, there is no measure, no matter how heterogeneous, that is incapable of bearing some label, so long as that label is defined broadly enough. Although they correctly recognized that the single-subject rule bars \u201cgrab-bag\u201d initiatives (32 Cal.3d at p. 253), the majority failed to realize that Proposition 8 was manifestly such a measure. In an evident attempt to give effect to what they perceived to be the will of the people, they upheld Proposition 8 and effectively struck down the constitutional single-subject rule. They should have done the opposite: the former was passed with the approval of 56.4 percent of the voters (Statement of Vote, Prim. Elec. (June 8, 1982), p. 45), the latter with 67.2 percent (Statement of Vote, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 2, 1948), p. 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In summary, the single-subject rule requires an initiative measure to constitute a coherent enactment in and of itself. It is not enough for such a measure to be capable of bearing some label of indefinite scope. It follows that the \u201creasonably germane\u201d test must contain as its ultimate criterion whether an initiative measure is internally interrelated as a whole and parts. A standard that focuses on whether the measure is capable of bearing some label is simply empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">In light of the foregoing, the question whether Proposition 115 satisfies the single-subject rule practically answers itself. As explained above, the rule requires a coherent enactment. The test demands the parts to be reasonably germane to each other and to the whole. When that test is applied here, the conclusion is inescapable that the initiative fails to exhibit the necessary internal interrelationship. The measure is a veritable \u201cgrabbag of . . . enactments.\u201d <em>(Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 253.) To be sure, it is arguably not as capacious as the self-styled \u201cCalifornia Bill of Rights\u201d considered in <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>Jordan, supra, </em>32 Cal.2d 330, nor does it contain as many heterogeneous items. But the fact remains, it is indeed a \u201cgrabbag.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">One need only glance through the potpourri comprising the 31 sections of Proposition 115. The measure deals with the following subjects among others: postindictment preliminary hearings, the independence of state constitutional rights, the granting of constitutional rights to the prosecution, joinder, hearsay at preliminary hearings, \u201creciprocal\u201d discovery, voir dire, voir dire pilot projects, cross-examination of hearsay declarants at preliminary hearings, the felony-murder rule, procedural and substantive law relating to special circumstances, the corpus delicti of a felony-murder special circumstance, life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 16- and 17-year-old juveniles who commit special circumstance murders, a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>crime of torture, punishment for the new crime of torture, abrogation of the prosecution\u2019s duty to provide certain discovery in felony cases, offers of proof for defense witnesses at preliminary hearings, immediate writ review of delays in preliminary hearings, sufficiency of hearsay as a basis for probable cause at preliminary hearings, joinder of offenses and \u201ccross-admissibility\u201d of evidence, appointment of \u201cready\u201d counsel, setting of trial in felony cases, maintenance of joinder of cases, rules for \u201creciprocal\u201d discovery, prohibition against striking a special circumstance, abrogation of the prosecution\u2019s duty to provide certain discovery in misdemeanor cases, and immediate writ review of delays in felony trials. Further illustrative of the diversity of the subject matter is the fact that on occasion the Attorney General and other prosecutors have maintained that some provisions are prospective only, whereas others are retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In view of the foregoing, Proposition 115 must be held to violate the single-subject rule: it simply cannot be deemed a coherent enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">My colleagues, however, find no violation. They claim that \u201cthe single subject of Proposition 115 is promotion of the rights of actual and potential crime victims.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 347.) That \u201csubject,\u201d however, is nothing more than a label of indefinite scope, much like \u201cgovernment\u201d or \u201cpublic welfare.\u201d As explained, that a measure is capable of bearing such a label is not enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">My colleagues further claim that \u201cthe various elements of Proposition 115 unite to form a comprehensive criminal justice reform package.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 347.) But the summary they provide and the analysis they offer undermine their assertion and also demonstrate how great an understatement is their concession that \u201cthe provisions of Proposition 115 seem somewhat disparate\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 348): the measure \u201ccomprehends\u201d nothing more than its many and heterogeneous parts\u2014in other words, it is again a \u201cgrabbag,\u201d no more, no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">My colleagues also claim that \u201c[a] subsidiary unifying theme underlying Proposition 115 is that all the . . . changes appear directed toward abrogating particular holdings of this court which the initiative\u2019s framers deemed unduly expansive of criminal defendants\u2019 rights.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 347.) The presence of such a \u201cunifying theme\u201d cannot satisfy the single-subject rule. To hold in effect that animus could meet the requirement would effectively nullify the requirement itself. The reason is manifest: animus inheres in initiatives and is indeed their very soul (see generally Key &amp; Crouch, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 442-458, 565-569, 571-576).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Therefore, I would hold that Proposition 115 \u201cembrac[es] more than one subject\u201d in violation of the single-subject rule and as a result does \u201cnot . . . have any effect.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 8, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>For the reasons stated above, although I join my colleagues in striking down section 3 of Proposition 115 as an unconstitutional revision of our fundamental law, I would go beyond them to invalidate the measure in its entirety as violative of the single-subject rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Respondents\u2019 petition for a rehearing was denied February 14, 1991.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
