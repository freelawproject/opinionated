Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> does not authorize the Fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Employment and Housing Commission (Commission) to award punitive damages. In the present case we consider whether the Commission has statutory authority to award compensatory damages, a question we reserved in <em>Dyna-Med.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">I. <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">Rose Brown was a temporary employee with the Peralta Community College District (Peralta) during the 1980-1981 school year. She was terminated in April of 1981. Shortly after her termination, she filed a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (the Department), in which she alleged that her immediate supervisor had subjected her to various acts of sexual harassment. The Department filed an accusation with the Commission. Following a hearing, the Commission found in Ms. Brown\u2019s favor and awarded her $374.55 for her out-of-pocket expenses and $20,000 \u201cto compensate her for the damage to her dignity and esteem, and [for] her humiliation, embarrassment, emotional pain and distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Peralta petitioned the superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.) The superior court denied the petition as to the Commission\u2019s findings of sexual harassment, but ordered stricken that part of the decision awarding Ms. Brown compensatory damages, as not within the authority of the Commission. On appeal by the Commission, the Court of Appeal, one justice dissenting, reversed. The court held that the Commission is authorized by the FEHA to award compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Because there is a conflict among the Courts of Appeal concerning the Commission\u2019s authority to award compensatory damages, we granted review to secure uniformity of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">In <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1379, we reviewed the origins, purposes and provisions of the FEHA. The California Fair Employment Practice Act (FEPA) (former Lab. Code, \u00a7 1410 et seq.) was enacted in 1959 and recodified in 1980 as part of the FEHA (Stats. 1980, ch. 992, \u00a7 4, p. 3140 et seq.). The law establishes that freedom from discrimination in employment on specified grounds, including sex, is a civil right (\u00a7 12921) and such discrimination is against public policy (\u00a7 12920). The law declares <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>discrimination or harassment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the specified grounds an unlawful employment practice. (\u00a7 12940, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The statute creates two administrative bodies: the Department, whose function is to investigate, conciliate, and seek redress for claimed discrimination (\u00a7\u00a7 12901, 12930), and the Commission, which performs adjudicatory and rulemaking functions (\u00a7\u00a7 12903, 12935). An aggrieved person may file a complaint with the Department (\u00a7 12960), which must promptly investigate (\u00a7 12963). If the Department deems a claim valid it seeks to resolve the matter\u2014in confidence\u2014by conference, conciliation, and persuasion. (\u00a7 12963.7.) If that fails or seems inappropriate, the Department may issue an accusation to be heard by the Commission. (\u00a7\u00a7 12965, subd. (a), 12969.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">If the Department fails to issue an accusation within 150 days after the filing of the complaint, or if it earlier determines not to prosecute the case and the matter is not otherwise resolved, the Department must give the complainant a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter. The complainant may then bring a civil suit in superior court. (\u00a7 12965, subd. (b); <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1382-1384; <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 213-214 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912] (hereafter <em>Commodore Home Systems).) </em> In a private action under the FEHA, the superior court may award compensatory and punitive damages. <em>(State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 422, 429 [217 Cal.Rptr. 16, 703 P.2d 354]; <em>Commodore Home Systems, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 221.)</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">When, as in the case at bench, an accusation issues, the Commission holds a hearing. The hearings are full evidentiary proceedings governed by the California rules of evidence and conducted in accordance with the California Administrative Procedure Act (\u00a7 11500 et seq.). (\u00a7 12972.) The Department serves as prosecutor and advocate on the complainant\u2019s behalf and also bears the costs of the hearing. (\u00a7 12969.) The hearing is presided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>over by an administrative law judge (ALJ) (\u00a7 11512, subd. (a)), who renders a proposed decision to the Commission, which then either adopts the decision as its own or, after reviewing the administrative record, adopts a different decision (\u00a7 11517). Either party can petition the superior court for a writ of administrative mandamus. (\u00a7 11523; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1094.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">If the Commission finds that the respondent employer or labor union has engaged in an unlawful discrimination practice, it is required to state its findings of fact and determination and to issue and serve on the parties a cease and desist order. (\u00a7 12970, subd. (a).) In addition, pursuant to section 12970, subdivision (a), the Commission is authorized to require the respondent to \u201ctake such action, including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, and restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, as, in the judgment of the commission, will effectuate the purposes of [the FEHA], and including a requirement for report of the manner of compliance.\u201d Because it is undisputed that the Commission\u2019s authority must come from the Act, our disposition of the instant case turns on the meaning of this latter provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">In concluding that the statute authorized the Commission to award compensatory damages, the Court of Appeal first looked to the words of the statute. The court observed that the phrase \u201cincluding, but not limited to\u201d enlarged the Commission\u2019s authority, and that the statute authorizes the Commission to fashion such remedies as \u201cin the judgment of the commission\u201d will effectuate the purposes of the Act. (\u00a7 12970, subd. (a).) From these phrases, taken together with the legislative directive that the Act is to be \u201cconstrued liberally for the accomplishment of [its] purposes\u201d (\u00a7 12993, subd. (a)), the court determined that the plain language of the statute allowed compensatory damages, if the judgment of the Commission is that the damages are necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The Court of Appeal next considered the legislative intent in enacting the law. The purpose of the Act, the court noted, is to \u201cprovide effective remedies which will eliminate such discriminatory practices\u201d that are contrary to the public policy of the state. (\u00a7 12920; see <em>Commodore Home Systems, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 220.) Compensatory damages are a necessary and effective remedy, the court concluded, because such damages are effective at both punishing and deterring and, as in the instant case, may provide the only suitable remedy available to the victim of the unlawful discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, the availability of compensatory damages may actually pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>mote the important conference and conciliation goals of the Act, in that employers may be more willing to confer and negotiate if they know the Commission can impose damages against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1379, decided after the Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion in this case, we rejected the argument that the expansive language of section 12970, subdivision (a), taken together with the legislative statement of purpose (\u00a7 12920) and directive that the Act should be liberally construed (\u00a7 12993, subd. (a)), authorized the Commission to award punitive damages. The statutorily authorized remedies, we noted, are \u201cexclusively corrective and equitable in kind. They relate to matters which serve to make the aggrieved employee whole in the context of the employment. [1J] Punitive damages, by contrast, are neither equitable nor corrective; punitive damages serve but one purpose\u2014to punish and through punishment, to deter.\u201d (43 Cal.3d at p. 1387.) Consequently, although we recognized that in their deterrent effect punitive damages would further the purpose of the Act to eliminate unlawful discrimination, in light of the \u201cextraordinary nature\u201d of such damages we found the foregoing factors \u201cinsufficient to support an inference that the Legislature intended sub silentio to empower the commission to impose punitive damages.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1389.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Seeking to distinguish <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1379, the Attorney General argues that, unlike punitive damages, compensatory damages are of the same make-whole kind as the other statutorily enumerated remedies. Compensatory damages include out-of-pocket losses and general damages for emotional distress. (See <em>Memphis Community School Dist. </em>v. <em>Stachura </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 299, 307 [91 L.Ed.2d 249, 258-259, 106 S.Ct. 2537]; <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 232, 237 [187 Cal.Rptr. 712, 33 A.L.R.4th 958].) Emotional distress, he observes, is a compensable injury <em>(Delta Farms Reclamation Dist. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 699, 711 [190 Cal.Rptr. 494, 660 P.2d 1168]), and courts have consistently recognized that emotional and mental injuries often occur as a result of discrimination. (E.g., <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 497-498 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216]; <em>Hess </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra; Woods-Drake </em>v. <em>Lundy </em>(5th Cir. 1982) 667 F.2d 1198, 1203.) The state Legislature, he maintains, impliedly recognized this concept when in 1982 it amended the Act to provide, inter alia, that \u201cMoss of tangible job benefits shall not be necessary in order to establish harassment.\u201d (Former \u00a7 12940, subd. (i), see now \u00a7 12940, subd. (h).) Often, as in the instant case (see fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>compensatory damages are the only significant remedy available to the victim of harassment. Consequently, the Commission\u2019s authority to award compensatory damages must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>upheld in order to serve public policy concerns, preserve the Commission as an effective enforcement mechanism, and avoid constitutional equal protection problems; any decision to the contrary, the Attorney General urges, would both destroy the effectiveness of the Commission and also deny meaningful relief for many of the most meritorious discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Before addressing the Attorney General\u2019s argument, we think it important to emphasize what this case is <em>not </em>about.  There is absolutely no dispute in this case that employment discrimination, including sexual harassment as occurred here, can cause emotional distress,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that such distress is a compensable injury under traditional theories of tort law (e.g., <em>Agarwal </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 932, 952-953 [160 Cal.Rptr. 141, 603 P.2d 58]; <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d 493, 498), or that courts in appropriate cases may award an injured employee who successfully asserts a statutory cause of action both punitive and compensatory damages <em>(Commodore Home Systems, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 215). Nor is there at issue the validity of an express statutory authorization for an administrative award of compensatory damages. (Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 12987, subd. (2) [authorizing Commission to award \u201cactual damages\u201d in housing discrimination cases], 19702, subd. (e) [authorizing State Personnel Board to award compensatory damages in employment discrimination cases].)  Rather, the sole issue before us is whether under the employment discrimination provisions of the FEHA, which make no reference to compensatory or any damages, the Commission has the authority to award unlimited compensatory damages, or must an employee who seeks such damages pursue his or her judicial remedies in a court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">B. <em>The Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">As in <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1379, we start, as we must, with the statute itself. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1386.) The stated purpose of the FEHA is to provide effective remedies that will eliminate discriminatory practices. (\u00a7 12920; <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1387.) To this end the Legislature, as noted, has authorized the Commission, on finding that a respondent employer or labor union has engaged in an unlawful discrimination practice, to issue an order requiring the respondent to cease and desist from the practice and \u201cto take <em>such action, including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, and restoration to </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>membership in any respondent labor organization, </em>as in the judgment of the commission, will effectuate the purposes of [the Act], and including a requirement for report of the manner of compliance.\u201d (\u00a7 12970, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Construing section 12970 in light of established principles of statutory construction, in <em>Dyna-Med </em>we concluded that the Legislature had intended to authorize the Commission <em>\u201cto take such other remedial action as in its judgment seems appropriate to redress a particular unlawful employment practice and to prevent its recurrence, thus eliminating the </em>practice\u201d (43 Cal.3d at p. 1390, fn. omitted, italics added). The statutorily authorized remedies, we observed, \u201care exclusively corrective and equitable in kind. <em>They relate to matters which serve to make the aggrieved employee whole in the context of the </em>employment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1387, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Although compensatory damages, as the Attorney General argues, may serve to make whole an employee who suffers emotional distress, and may in addition deter the respondent and other employers from future discriminatory practices, unlike the other statutory remedies that focus on corrective measures the employer can take <em>in the workplace, </em>this remedy goes substantially beyond the context of the employment. Compensatory damages, often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> serve to recompense the victim of discrimination not just for the tangible detriment to the victim\u2019s employment situation, but also for the intangible injury to his or her psyche (see fn. 4, ante) suffered as a result of the unlawful action of another and, as such, are designed to make the victim whole in relation to the offender in the manner of traditional tort damages awarded by a jury in a private action in a court of law. (See generally Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984) \u00a7\u00a7 1-2, pp. 5-7.) This effect, we believe, is beyond the scope of the Legislature\u2019s intended purpose in enacting the FEHA to prevent and eliminate discrimination in the workplace. (Cf. <em>Gutwein </em>v. <em>Easton Publishing Company </em>(1974) 272 Md. 563 [325 A.2d 740, 743, 85 A.L.R.3d 340].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Analysis of the relevant statutory language supports our conclusion. Section 12970, subdivision (a) authorizes the Commission to order the respondent to take <em>\u201csuch </em>action\u201d as the Commission believes will effectuate the purposes of the Act. (Italics added.) Unlike hiring, reinstatement or upgrading, with or without backpay, and the other specified remedies, payment of compensatory damages arguably is not, in the common usage of the term, an <em>action </em>to be taken by the employer, nor, in any event, is payment of damages the <em>kind of specific and limited action </em>directed to elimination of discrimination and its effects in the workplace as the Commission is otherwise empowered to require the employer to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u201c \u2018[T]he doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis . . . </em>states that where general words follow the enumeration of particular classes of persons or things, the general words will be construed as applicable only to persons or things of the same general nature or class as those enumerated. The rule is based on the obvious reason that if the Legislature had intended the general words to be used in their unrestricted sense, it would not have mentioned the particular things or classes of things which would in that event become mere surplusage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>San Diego County Dist. Council of Carpenters </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 317, 331, fn. 10 [158 Cal.Rptr. 370, 599 P.2d 676].) Application of the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>is particularly appropriate when, as here, the Legislature in related and otherwise similar statutes has expressly provided for the remedy in question and thus has demonstrated the ability, had it wished, to do so in section 12970.  \u201cWhere the [Legislature] has demonstrated the ability to make [its] intent clear, it is not the province of this court to imply an intent left unexpressed.\u201d <em>(Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 402, 412 [267 Cal.Rptr. 589, 787 P.2d 996].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Thus, section 12987 of the FEHA, relating to housing discrimination, authorizes the Commission to order the respondent to cease and desist from the discriminatory practice and \u201cto take such actions, as, in the judgment of the commission, will effectuate the purpose of this part, <em>including, but not limited to, </em>any of the following: [jf] (1) The sale or rental of the housing accommodation . . . or . . . of a like housing accommodation, . . . [fl] (2) The payment of punitive damages in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars . . . <em>and the payment of actual damages.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although of separate origin, the housing and employment provisions of the FEHA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>were combined and chaptered together in 1980 to form the FEHA, with enforcement of both sections of the Act vested in the Commission. (Stats. 1980, ch. 992, p. 3138 et seq.; see <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1394.) Had the Legislature intended to authorize the Commission to award damages in employment as in housing cases, it could easily have expressly so provided at that time, yet it did not. (See generally <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>at pp. 1394-1396.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Section 19702, subdivision (e) of the Civil Service Act, relating to the Civil Service Personnel Board, similarly authorizes the board on a finding of discrimination to issue an order \u201crequiring the appointing authority to cause the discrimination to cease and desist and to take any action, <em>including, but not limited to, </em>hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, <em>and compensatory damages, </em>which in the judgment of the board, will effectuate the purposes of this part.\u201d (Italics added.) As we observed in <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>\u201cif, as Commission argues, the nonexhaustive language of section 12970 were sufficient to embrace the authority to award damages, the specific references to damages in both the Civil Service Act and the housing section of the FEHA would be mere surplusage.  \u2018[Sjtatutes must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.] Interpretive constructions which render some words surplusage . . . are to be avoided. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (43 Cal.3d at p. 1397, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In light of the foregoing, we are reluctant to infer that through the expansive language of section 12970 the Legislature intended by implication to grant the Commission the authority not only to award compensatory damages, but to award such damages without limit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">C. <em>Legislative Intent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Contrary to our analysis, the Attorney General argues that the legislative intent has always been, or at the least is now, that the FEHA remedy intangible as well as tangible losses resulting from discrimination. He points to Assembly Bill No. 1163, 1987-1988 Regular Session, passed by the Legislature after our decision in <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1379, but vetoed by the Governor, who described the legislation as \u201cpremature\u201d in light of the pendency of the instant case. Assembly Bill No. 1163 would have amended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>section 12970 to explicitly authorize the Commission to award \u201cactual damages\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 1163, \u00a7 3) and specified that its remedy provisions were \u201cclarifying and declaratory of existing law\u201d (Assem. Bill No. 1163, \u00a7 1, subd. (c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The declaration of a later Legislature is of little weight in determining the relevant intent of the Legislature that enacted the law. <em>(Teamsters </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 324, 354, fn. 39 [233 Cal.Rptr. 294, 729 P.2d 728]; see Dickerson, The Interpretation and Application of Statutes (1975) p. 179.) This is especially true when, as here, such declared intent is without objective support in either the language or history of the legislation and (until recently) is contrary as well to the practice of the affected agency.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That the Legislature, as indicated in Assembly Bill No. 1163, may <em>now </em>intend that intangible losses be remedied does not of itself empower the Commission to award damages for such losses; the Commission is bound by the statute presently in effect, not by a legislative statement of intent that failed to become law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The Attorney General points also to Assembly Bill No. 1985, 1981-1982 Regular Session (Stats. 1982, ch. 1193, \u00a72, pp. 4259-4260), which amended the FEHA expressly to prohibit harassment and to provide that \u201c[l]oss of tangible job benefits shall not be necessary in order to establish harassment. The provisions of this subdivision are declaratory of existing law . . . .\u201d This legislative declaration, however, does not serve to amend the remedy provisions of the FEHA. Rather, the statement confirms that harassment on a basis enumerated in the Act constitutes unlawful discrimination regardless of whether the victim can show a loss of tangible job benefits. (See <em>Dept. Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. </em>v. <em>Fresno Hilton Hotel, supra, </em>FEHC Dec. No. 84-03, CEB 2, p. 28; <em>Dept. Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. </em>v. <em>La Victoria Tortilleria, supra, </em>FEHC Dec. No. 85-04, CEB 13, p. 14.) This view is consistent with the Commission\u2019s definition of sexual harassment (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>which describes activity that does not necessarily impact on the victim\u2019s employment status. (See also <em>Meritor Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Vinson </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 57, 64-67 [91 L.Ed.2d 49, 57-60, 106 S.Ct. 2399] [discussing \u201chostile environment\u201d harassment].) Once harassment has been established as provided in section 12940, subdivision (h), the Commission is authorized, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>as in other cases, to order the employer to take appropriate steps to eliminate the practice. (\u00a7 12970, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The Attorney General argues, however, that in harassment cases, as here, where no detriment to the employment has been shown and the employee\u2019s out-of-pocket losses are minimal, the only injury is emotional distress and the only redress is compensatory damages. This argument, we believe, takes too narrow a view of both the problem and the purpose of the Act, as well as the available remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">While emotional distress may be the individual employee\u2019s only injury, the practice of harassment once proven remains to be eliminated. Consequently, if the employee\u2019s complaint is administratively determined, on finding harassment the Commission will order such corrective measures as will benefit both the complainant <em>and others, </em>including that the employer cease and desist the practice, report the manner of compliance, and take other remedial action as appropriate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition, the Commission will thereafter conduct a compliance review to see that the employer is fully obeying the order. (\u00a7 12973.) Hence, the administrative procedure serves the statutory purpose of providing effective remedies that will eliminate the discriminatory practice and prevent its recurrence, not just as to the immediate victim, but as to all employees, present and future (\u00a7 12920).* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>The administrative procedure, moreover, does not preclude the employee from instituting a private lawsuit based on nonstatutory causes of action.

Furthermore, the Department in every case has the discretion to issue the complainant a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter, thereby clearing the way for a private civil action under the FEHA.

In providing for an administrative rather than a judicial resolution of discrimination complaints, the Legislature\u2019s objective \u201cwas to provide a \u2018speedy and informal\u2019 process unburdened with \u2018procedural technicalities.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018To achieve this end the [Fair Employment Practices Commission] established procedures that are as simple and uncomplicated as possible. Complaints are drafted by laymen; the commission informally attempts to eliminate discriminatory practices before instituting formal accusations; the commission, on a finding of discrimination, may fashion remedies both to correct unique cases of such practice as well as to curb its general incidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1393, citing <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Fair Employment Practice Com. </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 205, 214 [98 Cal.Rptr. 467, 490 P.2d 1155] [housing discrimination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Under the FEHA, moreover, the Department is the plaintiff and the employee only a witness. \u201c[T]he Department bears the expense of investigating, conciliating and, where necessary, prosecuting the action on behalf of the claimant. [Citations.] This includes the services of an attorney from the Department to try the case at no expense to the claimant. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>39 Cal.3d 422, 432.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Consistent with the foregoing, we believe a primary purpose of the alternative systems of redress for employment discrimination is to permit efficient and prompt administrative disposition\u2014without cost to the victim\u2014of claims that are amenable to conciliation or to corrective equitable remedies, and thus do not warrant a full-scale judicial proceeding with its attendant expense and delay (see <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Fair Employment Practice Com., supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 214), while reserving to the judicial system, with its attendant constitutional and statutory safeguards, those statutory claims that seek significant nonquantifiable monetary recompense or that the complainant wishes to join with nonstatutory causes of action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Consequently, if the employee\u2019s complaint reveals significant intangible loss, such as emotional distress, or discloses facts suitable for an award of punitive damages (see Civ. Code, \u00a7 3294; <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1404), or the complainant wishes to join a statutory cause of action with other legal causes of action, the Department may forgo the administrative procedure in favor of a private civil action by the employee to recover all of his or her damages, including mental anguish and distress. <em>(Commodore Home Systems, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 211; see <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1402 [Department permits any claimant who so wishes to bring a private court action]; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 481 [plaintiffs joined FEHA claim after Department notified them of their right to sue]; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Department of Rehabilitation, supra, </em>212 Cal.App.3d 1271, 1277 [Court of Appeal affirmed $1.5 million verdict on statutory causes of action]; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc., supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 1399 [Court of Appeal affirmed verdict of $100,000 emotional distress damages and $200,000 punitive damages on statutory cause of action]; <em>Snipes </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 861, 864 [193 Cal.Rptr. 760] [employee sought $1 million in punitive damages on statutory cause of action].)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Were it otherwise, as the Attorney General argues, and the Commission were authorized to award unlimited compensatory damages, no evident purpose would be served by providing alternative routes for resolution of claims. Nor would there be any standards to guide the Department in its determination as to the cases in which to seek compensatory damages rather than issue a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter. Finally and most significantly, the purpose of the FEHA to provide an efficient and expeditious avenue for elimination of discriminatory practices would be compromised as agency proceedings would come increasingly to resemble traditional lawsuits, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>predictable result when general pecuniary damages for mental distress are permitted. (See <em>Zahorian </em>v. <em>Russell Fitt Real Estate Agency </em>(1973) 62 N.J. 399 [301 A.2d 754, 764, 61 A.L.R.3d 927] (dis. opn. of Hall, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">We conclude, therefore, that in authorizing the Commission to take such action, \u201cincluding, but not limited to,\u201d the enumerated remedies, the Legislature intended to authorize the Commission to fashion such other corrective or equitable remedies as, in its expertise, it may devise to eliminate the discriminatory practice and make the employee whole in relation to the employment (see <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1387, 1390-1391), but that the Legislature did not, by contrast, intend to authorize the Commission to adjudicate noneconomic general damage claims traditionally awarded in judicial actions between private parties (cf. <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 348, 381, fn. 53; <em>Youst </em>v. <em>Longo, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 80).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Practical considerations support our view. As the Commission itself recognized when in 1982 it first undertook to award compensatory damages, \u201cCourts have traditionally been reluctant to award compensatory damages of this nature [for emotional distress] in the absence of circumstances which afford some guarantee of the genuineness of the claimed injury.\u201d <em>(Dept. Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. </em>v. <em>Ambylou Enterprises, supra, </em>FEHC Dec. No. 82-06, CEB 3, p. 9.) Although California \u201chas long recognized this type of injury as compensable in cases . . . which involve extreme and outrageous intentional invasions of one\u2019s mental and emotional tranquility\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 10), the Commission noted that in seeking to place a dollar value on the complainant\u2019s injuries it had found little in legal authority to guide it, for the reason that \u201c[i]t has traditionally been left to the trier of fact to assess the degree of harm suffered and to fix a monetary amount as just compensation therefor. (See, e.g., <em>Agarwal </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>[1979] 25 Cal.3d 932, 953 [160 Cal.Rptr. 141, 603 P.2d 58], and cases cited therein.)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In <em>Agarwal </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>cited by the Commission, we recognized that harm suffered from emotional distress, \u201cthough less susceptible of precise measurement than more tangible pecuniary losses or physical injuries would be, is no less real or worthy of compensation.\u201d (25 Cal.3d at p. 953.) Given the intangible nature of the harm, \u201cit is the members of the jury,\u201d we admonished, \u201cwho, when properly instructed, are in the best position to assess the degree of the harm suffered and to fix a monetary amount as just compensation therefor. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.-, </em>see <em>Capelouto </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 893; see also Prosser &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Keeton on Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 12 at p. 55 [referring to the difficulty of proof and measurement of damages for emotional distress].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Although we are not called upon in the instant case to determine whether the Commission\u2019s award of unlimited compensatory damages violates the right to jury trial (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16) and we express no view on that issue (cf. <em>McHugh </em>v. <em>Santa Monica Rent Control Bd., supra, </em>49 Cal.3d 348, 379-381 &amp; fn. 53; <em>id., </em>dis. opn. of Panelli, J., at pp. 386-387), we reaffirm the well-established principle stated in <em>Agarwal </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at page 953, that the jury, as the trier of fact, is in the best position to determine just compensation for emotional and mental distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">D. <em>Sister States and Federal Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">As we noted in <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at page 1400, courts in our sister states are divided on the availability of compensatory damages under statutory schemes similar to ours. (See generally Annot. (1978) 85 A.L.R.3d 351, \u00a7\u00a7 6-10, pp. 367-379.) According to the Attorney General, a review of the decisions upholding the authority of state civil rights agencies to award compensatory damages, even absent specific statutory language explicitly authorizing such awards, reveals many similarities between those laws and the FEHA. The reasoning in the cases, he urges, applies with equal force in the instant case. Thus, the decisions cite (1) the need to provide full relief to the victim of unlawful discrimination (e.g., <em>Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Mass. Comm. Against Discrim. </em>(1976) 371 Mass. 303 [358 N.E.2d 235, 242-243]; <em>A. P. Green Serv. D. of Bigelow-L. Corp. </em>v. <em>State F.E.P.C. </em>(1974) 19 Ill. App. 3d 875 [312 N.E.2d 314, 319-320]) and the remedial nature of compensatory damages <em>(Andersen </em>v. <em>Exxon Co. </em>(1982) 89 N.J. 483 [446 A.2d 486, 496]; <em>Chauffeurs, Loc. U. 238 </em>v. <em>Civil Rights Com'n </em>(Iowa 1986) 394 N.W.2d 375, 383); (2) the role such damages serve in eliminating the effects of discrimination <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Joyce </em>(Ore.Ct.App. 1971) 479 P.2d 513, 523-524 [40 A.L.R.3d 1272]); <em>A. P. Green Serv. D. of Bigelow-L. Corp., supra, </em>312 N.E. 2d at p. 319); and (3) deference to legislation granting the civil rights agency discretion to order appropriate relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number><em>(Bournewood Hosp., supra, </em>358 N.E.2d at p. 242; <em>Chauffeurs, Loc. U. 238, supra, </em>394 N.W.2d at p. 383).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">What the Attorney General overlooks is that the issue before us is not the beneficial effect of awarding compensatory damages but, rather, whether the FEHA authorizes the Commission to make such an award. Furthermore, of the state statutes at issue in the cited cases, only those of New Jersey and Massachusetts are sufficiently similar to ours to warrant comparison.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Thus, the Iowa statute authorizes \u201c \u2018remedial action,\u2019 \u201d which includes but is not limited to \u201c <em>\u2018damages for an injury caused by the discriminatory practice which damages shall include but are not limited to actual damages </em>....\u2019\u201d <em>(Chauffeurs, Loc. U. 238 </em>v. <em>Civil Rights Com\u2019n, supra, </em>394 N.W.2d at p. 382, italics added); the FEHA, by contrast, is silent on the award of damages. The Oregon statute states its purposes are to \u201c \u2018insure human dignity\u2019\u201d and to <em>protect [the </em>victim\u2019s] <em>health </em>from the consequences of [discrimination]\u2019 \u201d and its intent is to \u201c \u2018provide an adequate remedy <em>for persons aggrieved \u2019 \u201d </em>by unlawful discriminatory acts; the statute authorizes a cease and desist order requiring the respondent to perform acts to carry out the purposes of the law and \u201c \u2018to <em>eliminate the effects\u2019 \u201d </em>of the unlawful practice. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Joyce, supra, </em>479 P.2d at pp. 523-524, italics added.) Similarly, the Illinois statute, since amended, authorized the agency to require such further affirmative or other actions \u201c <em>\u2018with respect to the complainant </em>as will eliminate <em>the effect\u2019 \u201d </em>of the discriminatory practice.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>(A. P. Green Serv. D. of Bigelow-L. Corp. </em>v. <em>State F.E.P.C., supra, </em>312 N.E.2d at p. 319, first italics in original, second italics added.) Our statute, by contrast, speaks only of remedies that will eliminate <em>the discriminatory practice </em>and makes no mention of eliminating its <em>effects </em>or of remedies <em>for the person aggrieved. </em>(\u00a7\u00a7 12920, 12970.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The New Jersey statute, while similar to ours, was interpreted to allow compensatory damages only in such limited amounts as may be characterized as \u201cminor or incidental\u201d awards. <em>(Zahorian </em>v. <em>Russell Fitt Real Estate Agency, supra, </em>301 A.2d 754, 761-762 [$750]; <em>see Andersen </em>v. <em>Exxon Co., supra, </em>446 A.2d 486, 496 [$500].) The Massachusetts statute, likewise similar to the FEHA (Mass. Gen. L. ch. 15 IB, \u00a7 5), was interpreted by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Bournewood Hosp. </em>v. <em>Mass. Comm. Against Discrim., supra, </em>358 N.E.2d 235, as authorizing damages not merely for discrimination, but for the independent and more egregious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>offense of <em>retaliation </em>against an employee who was \u201csimply doing that which the law\u201d provides is her right, i.e., filing a complaint about discrimination; the availability of damages for discrimination alone was not decided. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 242-243; accord, <em>College-Town </em>v. <em>Mass. Com\u2019n Against Discrim. </em>(1987) 400 Mass. 156 [508 N.E.2d 587, 594-595] [discrimination and retaliation]; but see <em>Buckley Nursing Home </em>v. <em>Com\u2019n Against Discrim. </em>(1985) 20 Mass. App. 172 [478 N.E.2d 1292, 1299] [emotional distress damages allowed for discrimination only].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Neither the New Jersey court\u2019s limitation on the amount of damages, nor the Massachusetts court\u2019s distinction between discrimination and retaliation, is to be found in the applicable statutes. Rather, evidently to achieve a result they found just, both courts engaged in patent judicial legislation. We are unwilling to do the same. Rather, we find persuasive the reasoning of the numerous courts in our sister states with statutes similar to ours that have concluded their statutes do not empower a commission to award nonquantifiable pain and suffering money damages for unlawful discrimination. (See <em>Pennsylvania Human Relations Com\u2019n </em>v. <em>Zamantakis </em>(1978) 478 Pa. 454 [387 A.2d 70, 73] [stating that a majority of states have found that absent express legislative authority, a civil rights agency cannot award emotional distress damages]; accord <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Midwest Conveyor Co., Inc. </em>(1982) 231 Kan. 763 [648 P.2d 234, 241]; <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(Alaska 1981) 631 P.2d 82, 88; <em>Gutwein </em>v. <em>Easton Publishing Company, supra, </em>325 A.2d 740, 745-747 [quoting other state courts]; <em>Ohio Civil Rights Commission </em>v. <em>Lysyj </em>(1974) 38 Ohio St.2d 217 [313 N.E.2d 3, 7, 70 A.L.R.3d 1135]; see generally Annot., <em>supra, </em>85 A.L.R.3d at pp. 370-373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Like the foregoing state courts, federal courts, in interpreting the closely analogous remedy language of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 141 et seq.) relating to unfair labor practices,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> have uniformly held that monetary awards other than back pay may not be awarded (see <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1379, 1397 and cases cited), and a majority have held likewise in interpreting the similarly analogous remedy language of title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, relating to employment discrimination<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>(Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1397-1398; see <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Midwest Conveyor Co., Inc., supra, </em>648 P.2d 234, 240, citing <em>DeGrace </em>v. <em>Rumsfeld </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>(1st Cir. 1980) 614 F.2d 796, 808; see generally Annot., Title VII\u2014Compensatory Damages (1980) 48 A.L.R.Fed. 338 et seq.). Because the title VII remedies are judicially enforced, precedents under that statute are, in any event, of little relevance to the issue before us. (See <em>Commodore Home Systems, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Insofar as the Attorney General argues that denial of general compensatory damages in the administrative hearing constitutes a denial of equal protection to claimants who do not file suit in court, we disposed of the argument in <em>Dyna-Med, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pages 1401-1404.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In sum, in view of the language and purpose of the FEHA, the failure of section 12970 expressly to authorize an award of general compensatory damages, the existence in other civil rights statutes of express authorization for such awards, the unlikelihood of a legislative grant by implication of unbridled power to an administrative agency to make monetary awards without guidelines or limitations, the cited cases from our sister states, and relevant federal precedent, we conclude that the Commission is not authorized to award compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reversed with directions to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Lucas, C.

An employee may have stoically endured a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>of harassment without a termination of employment. Nonetheless, the employee should be made whole for suffering the deprivation of the right, assured by statute, to work in an environment free from sexual harassment and discrimination. The majority would make the administrative remedy available through the Commission a barren one for such an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Under the Fair Employment and Housing Act (the Act), the Commission has authority to award compensatory damages. The purpose of the Act is to provide effective remedies which will eliminate discriminatory practices. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 12920.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is to be liberally construed to accomplish this purpose. (\u00a7 12993, subd. (a).) If the Commission finds that an employer has engaged in a discriminatory practice, it orders the employer to cease and desist and also orders the employer \u201cto take such action, including, but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay, and restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, as, in the judgment of the commission, will effectuate the purposes of this part, and including a requirement for report of the manner of compliance.\u201d (\u00a7 12970, subd. (a).) This is expansive language, vesting in the Commission broad rather than limited power to devise effective remedies to eradicate employment discrimination. As we said so recently, the Act was \u201cintended to authorize the commission to take such other remedial action as in its judgment seems appropriate to redress a particular unlawful employment practice and to prevent its recurrence, thus eliminating the practice.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1390 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The measures the Commission may order the employer to undertake all \u201crelate to matters which serve to make the aggrieved employee whole in the context of the employment.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387.) We decided <em>in Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>that since punitive damages are not this sort of equitable, corrective measure, aimed at \u201cmaking the employee whole in the context of the employment,\u201d the statute cannot be interpreted to authorize the Commission to award them. \u201c \u2018Punitive damages by definition are not intended to compensate the injured party, but rather to punish the tortfeasor. . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1387.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Compensatory damages are a completely different story. It is black letter law that compensatory damage awards are intended to make the injured party whole when the injury consists of emotional distress. (See <em>Memphis Community School Dist. </em>v. <em>Stachura </em>(1986) <em>477 </em>U.S. 299, 307 [91 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>249, 258-259, 106 S.Ct. 2537]; <em>Capelouto </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 889, 892-893 [103 Cal.Rptr. 856, 500 P.2d 880].) Thus it is consistent with <em>Dyna-Med </em>to hold that compensatory damages, as they are not punitive but intended as compensation for injury, are within the authority of the Commission to award.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">As the majority willingly acknowledge, we have recognized the emotional damage incurred by those who are subjected to racist abuse and discrimination in the workplace. <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 497-498 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216]; see also <em>Woods-Drake </em>v. <em>Lundy </em>(5th Cir. 1982) 667 F.2d 1198, 1203.) Sexual harassment in the workplace inflicts grave emotional injury as well. <em>(Fisher </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 590, 618 [262 Cal.Rptr. 842].) When an employee has been subjected to sexual abuse on the job, the injury normally is one which undermines personal dignity, not one which affects job security. The employee can only be made whole by an award which compensates her for emotional distress. Thus compensatory damages are precisely related to \u201cmatters which serve to make the aggrieved employee whole . . . .\u201d Indeed, when reinstatement is not an issue because there has been no termination, compensatory damages are the only remedy which can be provided to the employee and can deter the employer from further transgressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The majority maintain that although compensatory damages may serve to make the employee whole, they go substantially beyond the context of the employment. The argument is that the remedies enumerated by the statute focus on corrective measures the employer can take in the workplace, while compensatory damages compensate for intangible injury and are designed to make the victim whole in relation to the offender in the manner of traditional tort damage awards in a jury trial. \u201cThis effect, we believe, is beyond the scope of the Legislature\u2019s intended purpose in enacting the FEHA to prevent and eliminate discrimination in the workplace.\u201d (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 49.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The claim that compensatory damages for emotional injury caused by sexual or racial abuse are not compensation in the context of employment is difficult to understand. Obviously the abuse occurs in the context of employment; indeed, if the abuse caused a disabling injury, the employee would be entitled to a workers\u2019 compensation award to make her whole. (See <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 148 [233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743].) If the argument is that the payment of make-whole damages will not ameliorate the employer\u2019s conduct in the workplace, it is mistaken on two grounds. First, the argument depends upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>mistaken assumption that the Act is intended to be wholly preventive, and not to operate to make the injured employee whole. Since the Act specifically provides for backpay awards, it is directed not only at improving the employer\u2019s behavior but also at making the abused employee whole. We recognized as much in <em>Dyna-Med. (Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1387.) Second, as the Court of Appeal maintained, a compensatory damage award is an effective learning device for obtuse employers. \u201cIf employers are forced to compensate for all the effects of their unlawful acts, if they are hit in the pocketbook where it hurts, they will be less likely to discriminate in the future. The awarding of damages will not only deter the wrongdoer, it will send a message to other employers that they must pay for the consequences of their discrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The majority express the concern that an administrative agency cannot function reliably in the inherently judicial role of assessing damages for emotional injury. (See maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at pp. 56-57.) This argument expresses a lack of confidence in the competence of an administrative body to adjudicate a claim for compensatory damages. The Legislature does not share this lack of confidence; it has conferred express authority on the State Personnel Board to award compensatory damages for discrimination in the workplace. (\u00a7 19702, subd. (e).) The Commission itself is explicitly authorized to award compensatory damages for housing discrimination. (See \u00a7 12987.) There is no reason to think it is less competent in assessing compensatory damages in the context of employment discrimination\u2014or to think that the Commission is less competent than the State Personnel Board to tackle the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The majority also claim that to allow the Commission to award compensatory damages would undermine the ability of the Commission to function efficiently. If it were to award compensatory damages, instead of speedy and informal hearings, it is argued, there would be the expense and delay of factfinding sessions which would resemble proceedings in traditional lawsuits. The majority conclude that such lengthy, complex hearings are better left to the courts, in private civil actions brought against the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">In many cases, including this one, the only remedy that will be effective to make the victim whole and to deter future misconduct is a compensatory damage award. If we conclude that such an award can only be had in the judicial forum, we frustrate the legislative goal of providing administrative relief for the problem. Such a rule would encourage claimants to bypass administrative relief, or to treat it simply as a matter of form. If the claimant treats the administrative process as a matter of form, so will the employer and the conference and conciliation goals of the Act would be frustrated. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Further, more cases would be brought to court, rather than resolved expeditiously in a less expensive forum, as was the intent of the Act. And only those who can afford to pay for counsel could go to court, while the less affluent would be confined to a forum which cannot afford them full compensation. Finally, it is not normally the function of this court to determine how an administrative agency can operate most efficiently; the Commission has determined that it can operate efficiently in this arena, and it is free to abandon the effort if it proves unwieldy or unprofitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The majority maintain that to allow the Commission to award compensatory damages would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act to encourage prompt, inexpensive, and efficient disposition of claims. But a concern with moving the cases along must coexist with a commitment to providing an effective remedy. There is a persistent and prevalent social problem of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. (See, e.g., Women Lawyers and the Practice of Law in California, The Women in Law Committee, State Bar of California (1989) [finding that nearly half of survey respondents had experienced sexual harassment on the job; 88 percent perceived subtle, pervasive gender bias within the profession].) We are often taxed with being too litigious a society; one alternative to this state of affairs is to allow administrative remedies to function effectively. This the majority refuse to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Kennard, L, concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\"> All further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
