Code, \u00a7 12900 et seq.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereafter FEHA or act) provides the exclusive remedy for injuries relating to sex discrimination in employment; whether an employee must exhaust the administrative remedies under the FEHA as a prerequisite to pursuing a civil action; and whether sex discrimination in employment may give rise to a claim of wrongful discharge in contravention of public policy. We conclude that the FEHA does not supplant other state laws, including claims under the common law, relating to employment discrimination; that an employee need not exhaust the administrative process under the act before resort to judicial relief for nonstatutory causes of action; and that sex discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>in employment may support a claim of tortious discharge in contravention of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Plaintiffs Emma Rojo and Teresa Maloney were employed as assistants by defendants Erwin H. Kliger, a practicing physician, and Erwin H. Kliger, M.D., a medical corporation (hereafter referred to collectively as defendant). In August 1986, plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendant for violations of the FEHA and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Plaintiffs alleged that during the term of their employment they had been subjected by defendant to sexually harassing remarks and demands for sexual favors which had ultimately forced them to leave their employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Defendant answered, denied the allegations and asserted various affirmative defenses. He then moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the FEHA constituted plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive remedy and that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the act. Plaintiffs opposed the motion, arguing that the FEHA does not supplant other state law remedies, including common law claims, relating to discrimination in employment, and that pursuit of the administrative remedy is not a condition precedent to judicial relief. They also requested leave to amend their complaint to assert causes of action for assault and battery and tortious discharge in contravention of public policy, among other causes of action. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion and entered summary judgment in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The Court of Appeal reversed. It held the FEHA does not preempt or preclude other state law claims relating to employment discrimination. It further held a victim of sex discrimination is not required to pursue the FEHA administrative remedy except with respect to claims under the act. Accordingly, the court concluded plaintiffs could proceed with their suit and seek recovery under any applicable theory independent of the FEHA, but could not state a cause of action under section 12940 because they did not exhaust their administrative remedies under the act. Finally, the court ruled that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination would support a claim of tortious discharge in contravention of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">A. <em>The FEHA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">As our resolution of the important questions raised in this case turns in large part on the language and purposes of the FEHA, we briefly review the salient features of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The California Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA) was enacted in 1959 (former Lab. Code, \u00a7 1410 et seq.) and recodified in 1980 in conjunction with the Rumford Fair Housing Act (former Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 35700 et seq.) to form the FEHA. (Stats. 1980, ch. 992, \u00a7 4, p. 3140 et seq.) The law establishes that freedom from job discrimination on specified grounds, including sex, is a civil right. (\u00a7 12921.) It declares that such discrimination is against public policy (\u00a7 12920) and an unlawful employment practice (\u00a7 12940). <em>(Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 211, 213 [185 Cal.Rptr. 270, 649 P.2d 912].) The statute creates two administrative bodies: the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (Department) (\u00a7 12901), whose function is to investigate, conciliate, and seek redress of claimed discrimination (\u00a7 12930), and the Fair Employment and Housing Commission (Commission) (\u00a7 12903), which performs adjudicatory and rulemaking functions (\u00a7 12935). An aggrieved person may file a complaint with the Department (\u00a7 12960), which must promptly investigate (\u00a7 12963). If the Department deems a claim valid, it seeks to resolve the matter\u2014in confidence\u2014by conference, conciliation, and persuasion. (\u00a7 12963.7.) If that fails or seems inappropriate, the Department may issue an accusation to be heard by the Commission. (\u00a7\u00a7 12965, subd. (a), 12969.) The Department acts as prosecutor on the accusation and argues the complainant\u2019s case before the Commission. <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1383-1384 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">If no accusation is issued within 150 days after the filing of a complaint, or if the Department earlier determines not to prosecute the case and the matter is not otherwise resolved, the Department must give the complainant a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter. Only then may that person bring a civil suit \u201cunder this part.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u00a7 12965, subd. (b); <em>Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d <em>at </em>p. 1384; <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 211, 213-214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">The broad goal of the FEHA is set forth at section 12920, which states in pertinent part: \u201cIt is hereby declared as the public policy of this state that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>is necessary to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgement on account of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical handicap, medical condition, marital status, sex or age.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">B. <em>FEHA Preclusion of Common Law Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The first question we address is whether the FEHA provides the exclusive remedy for injuries arising from discrimination in employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addressing this issue we begin, as always, with the language of the statute itself.  \u201c[A] court is to construe a statute so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d <em>(White </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 681 [183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191] [internal quotation marks omitted].) However, \u201c[w]hen statutory language is . . . clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u201d <em>(Solberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 182, 198 [137 Cal.Rptr. 460, 561 P.2d 1148].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The meaning of the FEHA is clear in this regard. The act expressly disclaims any intent to repeal other state laws relating to employment discrimination. Subdivision (a) of section 12993 provides: \u201cThe provisions of this part shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof. Nothing contained in this part shall be deemed to repeal any of the provisions of the Civil Rights Law or of <em>any other law of this state relating to discrimination </em>because of race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical handicap, medical condition, marital status, sex, or age.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>It is settled that the \u201claw\u201d of this state includes the common law as well as the Constitution and the codes. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 1895, 1899; <em>Victory Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Hancock Oil Co. </em>(1954) 125 Cal.App.2d 222, 229 [270 P.2d 604].)  \u201c \u2018The code establishes the law of this state respecting the subjects to which it relates\u2019; but this . . . does not mean that there is no law with respect to such subjects except that embodied in the code . . . . [WJhere the code is silent, the common law governs.\u201d <em>(Estate of Apple </em>(1885) 66 Cal. 432, 434 [6 P. 7]; accord <em>Estate of Elizalde </em>(1920) 182 Cal. 427, 432-433 [188 P. 560]; <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Rush </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 345, 356 [289 P.2d 450, 54 A.L.R.2d 1137]; <em>Li </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 804, 815 [119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d 1226, 78 A.L.R.3d 393].)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">It is equally settled that the common law of this state provides any number of remedial theories to compensate for injuries \u201crelating to discrimination\u201d (\u00a7 12993, subd. (a)). <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 477 [208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272] is illustrative. There, the plaintiff filed a civil suit alleging a statutory cause of action for discharge on grounds of race and common law causes of action for emotional distress and wrongful discharge. Each of the three claims was based on the same factual allegations regarding liability and damages.  \u201c[E]mployment discrimination cases,\u201d we observed, \u201cby their very nature, involve several causes of action arising from the same set of facts. <em>A responsible attorney handling an employment discrimination case must plead a variety of statutory, tort and contract causes of action in order to fully protect the interests of his or her client. </em>[Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 486, italics added.) Although the common law theories do not per se \u201crelate to discrimination,\u201d they are nonetheless a standard part of a plaintiff\u2019s arsenal in a discrimination case. (See generally Montgomery, <em>Sexual Harassment in the Workplace: A Practitioner\u2019s Guide to Tort Actions </em>(1980) 10 Golden Gate L.Rev. 879.)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Indeed, this court has recognized on many occasions that both administrative and judicial remedies are available to victims of employment discrimination.  While holding, for example, in <em>Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1379, that punitive damages may not be awarded in an administrative adjudication under the act, we stressed that \u201cin appropriate cases a complainant can seek punitive damages by filing an independent civil action alleging tort causes of action either with or without an FEHA count.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1403; accord <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 220; <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 493, 498 [86 Cal.Rptr. 88, 468 P.2d 216].)  As we explained in <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 422, 431 [217 Cal.Rptr. 16, 703 P.2d 354]: \u201cThe FEHA was meant to supplement, not supplant or be supplanted by, existing antidiscrimination remedies, in order to give employees the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>maximum opportunity to vindicate their civil rights against discrimination ....(\u00a7 12993, subd. (a).)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">By expressly disclaiming a purpose to repeal other applicable state laws (\u00a7 12993, subd. (a)), we believe the Legislature has manifested an intent to amplify, not abrogate, an employee\u2019s common law remedies for injuries relating to employment discrimination. Had the Legislature intended otherwise, it plainly knew how to do so. (See, e.g., Lab. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3600, 3601 [workers\u2019 compensation law declared the \u201cexclusive remedy\u201d for work-related injuries]; see generally <em>Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Myers, ante, </em>p. 1 [276 Cal.Rptr. 303, 801 P.2d 1054].)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Defendant advances several arguments in an effort to rebut the clear import of the statutory language and the prior decisions of this court. None of these, upon examination, proves to be persuasive.  Defendant first contends that the use of the term \u201crepeal\u201d in section 12993, subdivision (a) reveals a legislative intent to preserve only <em>statutory </em>provisions, not common law theories. Defendant cites no authority, however, to show that \u201crepeal\u201d is ordinarily used with reference only to statutes. On the contrary, the term is generally considered to be all inclusive: \u201c[Rjepeal ordinarily means revocation, rescission, abrogation, or destruction . . . .\u201d <em>(Rains </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa </em>(1951) 37 Cal.2d 263, 265 [231 P.2d 55]; see Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict. (2d ed. 1935) p. 2111, col. 3.) Numerous cases and no less an authority than Sutherland have spoken in terms of \u201crepeal\u201d with reference to the common law. (See, e.g., <em>Weaver </em>v. <em>Bank of California </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 428, 437 [30 Cal.Rptr. 4, 380 P.2d 644] [\u201cAssuming the purpose of the statute to be the repeal of the common-law presumption of damages, . . .\u201d]; <em>Valdes </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 773, 780 [189 Cal.Rptr. 212] [\u201c[I]t is elementary that the Legislature has power . . . expressly to amend or repeal both the common law and existing statutes\u201d]; <em>White </em>v. <em>Church </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 627, 631 [231 Cal.Rptr. 565] [Elec. Code, \u00a7 17113 \u201crepealed the common law of California that votes cast for a deceased candidate were invalid\u201d]; <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Geernaert </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1104, 1108 [246 Cal.Rptr. 440] [\u201c[T]here is a presumption a statute does not, by implication, repeal the common law.\u201d]; 3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1986) \u00a7 61.03, p. 95 [\u201cThe repeal of a common law rule may be evidenced by various other . . . aids of statutory interpretation. \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The savings clause set forth in section 12993, subdivision (a) is expressly phrased in the broadest of terms; it disclaims any intent to \u201crepeal\u201d\u2014a term used in conjunction with both statutes and common law\u2014 any other \u201claws of this state\u201d\u2014a phrase that also encompasses statutory and common law. There is no merit, therefore, to defendant\u2019s contention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>that a more narrow meaning of section 12993, subdivision (a) may be inferred from the text.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Defendant also cites subdivision (c) of section 12993 (hereafter subdivision (c) or section 12993(c)). Subdivision (c) states: \u201cWhile it is the intention of the Legislature to occupy the field of regulation of discrimination in employment and housing encompassed by the provisions of this part, exclusive of all other laws banning discrimination in employment and housing by any city, city and county, county, or other political subdivision of the state, nothing contained in this part shall be construed, in any manner or way, to limit or restrict the application of Section 51 of the Civil Code.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This provision, defendant contends, expresses the legislative intent to supersede all preexisting state laws except Civil Code section 51. Were it otherwise, he argues, the Civil Code section 51 savings clause would be unnecessary and mere surplusage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">As written, subdivision (c) is ambiguous. First, the phrase \u201coccupy the field\u201d may convey displacement either of all other law, without limitation (see, e.g., <em>Pacific Scene, Inc. </em>v. <em>Penasquitos, Inc. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 407, 411-413 [250 Cal.Rptr. 651, 758 P.2d 1182] [statutory scheme displaced antecedent common law remedies]; <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 564, 574-575 [139 Cal.Rptr. 97, 565 P.2d 122] [new statutory cause of action precluded extrastatutory relief], disapproved on other grounds in <em>Ochoa </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 159, 171 [216 Cal.Rptr. 661, 703 P.2d 1]), or, alternatively, of only local law by a higher law (see <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp. </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 218, 230 [91 L.Ed. 1447, 1459, 67 S.Ct. 1146]; cf. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 277, 290-291 [219 Cal.Rptr. 467, 707 P.2d 840]; see also <em>Froyd </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>681 F.Supp. 669, 670, fn. 2, 673-674).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">Second, the stated legislative intent to occupy the field <em>\u201cexclusive of </em>all other laws banning discrimination ... by any city, city and county [etc.]\u201d (\u00a7 12993(c), italics added) can be read to mean \u201cnot including\u201d local laws (see, e.g., Webster\u2019s New Internal. Diet. (2d ed. 1935) p. 890, col. 3), thereby removing them from the preemptive effect of the statute, or, as the parties assume, \u201cto the exclusion of\u201d local laws, thereby preempting such laws. Further, \u201claws banning discrimination <em>. . . by </em>any city [etc.]\u201d (italics added) can mean laws that prohibit discrimination <em>on the part of </em>any city, etc., or, as the parties assume, laws that are <em>enacted by </em>any city or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>local entity. Faced with these ambiguities, we turn to the legislative history of the act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">As noted earlier, the FEHA is the product of a legislative amalgamation of two separate acts, the FEPA (former Lab. Code, \u00a7 1410 et seq.), which applied exclusively to employment discrimination, and the Rumford Fair Housing Act (former Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 35700 et seq.) (hereafter fair housing act), which banned discrimination in housing. Thus, subdivision (c) is derived from a blending of two analogous provisions. Former Labor Code section 1431, the original FEPA \u201crepeal\u201d section, stated a legislative intent to preserve other applicable state laws and to displace local regulation of employment discrimination, with a one-year grace period for pending or undetermined enforcement proceedings brought thereunder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n                   No specific mention was made of Civil Code section 51, because none was needed: the Unruh Civil Rights Act has no application to employment discrimination. <em>(Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 500; <em>Isbister </em>v. <em>Boys\u2019 Club of Santa Cruz, Inc. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 72, 83, fn. 12 [219 Cal.Rptr. 150, 707 P.2d 212].)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">The equivalent fair housing provision (former Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 35743) was phrased quite differently, and it is there we find the origins of the ambiguous phrases in subdivision (c). The provision stated: \u201cAs it is the intention of the Legislature to <em>occupy the whole field </em>of regulation encompassed by the provisions of this part, the regulation by law of discrimination in housing contained in this part <em>shall be exclusive of </em>all other laws banning discrimination in housing by any city, city and county, county, or other political subdivision of the State. <em>Nothing contained in this part shall be construed to, in any manner or way, limit or restrict the application of Section 51 of the Civil Code.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Read in context of the fair housing act, the meaning of the ambiguous subdivision (c) phrases is clear: consistent with the Legislature\u2019s intent to occupy the field of housing discrimination regulation, the fair housing act was to exclude all other <em>local </em>laws banning housing discrimination, but was not to be construed to limit the application of Civil Code section 51. Although the fair housing act, like the FEPA, thus preempted only local laws banning discrimination, its reference to Civil Code section 51 nevertheless was not surplusage because the Unruh Civil Rights Act, among other things, prohibits discrimination in housing and provides for local enforcement by city or district attorneys. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52, subd. (c).) Thus, while disallowing local <em>regulation </em>of housing discrimination, the fair housing act carefully preserved the option under the Unruh Civil Rights Act of local <em>enforcement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In 1978, the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) proposed and the Legislature enacted a series of procedural and \u201cclean up\u201d amendments to the FEPA that included replacing former Labor Code section 1432. The original text of former Labor Code section 1432, with its one-year grace period for proceedings under local regulations (see fn. 7, <em>ante), </em>was clearly out of date. In its place the Legislature adopted a provision nearly identical to its counterpart in the fair housing act, the aforementioned former Health and Safety Code section 35743, whose parallel language\u2014including the stated intent to \u201coccupy the field\u201d and the Civil Code section 51 savings clause\u2014served as its pattern.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When in 1980 the fair housing act and the FEPA were combined to form the FEHA, former Labor Code section 1432 and former Health and Safety Code section 35743 were merged to form present section 12993(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">As the foregoing history demonstrates, both of the predecessor statutes to section 12993(c) indicate a legislative intent to preempt only local law. The reference to Civil Code section 51 in subdivision (c), therefore, provides no support for the view that the FEHA was intended to displace <em>state </em>laws relating to employment discrimination. Its purpose, rather, was to retain local enforcement authority against housing discrimination. Thus understood, subdivision (c) is harmonized with section 12993, subdivision (a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>which, as indicated, expresses a legislative intent not to displace other applicable state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Defendant also relies on the \u201cnew right\u2014exclusive remedy\u201d rule of statutory construction and its counterpart, the doctrine of \u201cpreexisting right\u2014 cumulative remedies,\u201d to infer a legislative intent to cover the field of employment discrimination.  As a general rule, where a statute creates a right that did not exist at common law and provides a comprehensive and detailed remedial scheme for its enforcement, the statutory remedy is exclusive. <em>(Flores </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Turf Club </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 736, 746-747 [13 Cal.Rptr. 201, 361 P.2d 921]; see <em>Hentzel </em>v. <em>Singer Co. </em>(1982) 138 Cal.App.3d 290, 301 [188 Cal.Rptr. 159, 35 A.L.R.4th 1015].) But where a statutory remedy is provided for a preexisting common law right, the newer remedy is generally considered to be cumulative, and the older remedy may be pursued at the plaintiff\u2019s election. <em>(Flores, supra, </em>at p. 747; <em>Hentzel, supra, </em>at pp. 301, 303; see generally 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Actions, \u00a7\u00a7 7-8, pp. 38-40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Defendant\u2019s reliance on the above-stated rules of statutory interpretation is misplaced. First, as noted earlier, in this respect the pertinent language of the FEHA is plain and its meaning unmistakable: the act expressly disclaims any intent to repeal other state laws relating to discrimination, legislative or otherwise. Where statutory language is clear, a court need not and should not rely upon artificial canons of construction. <em>(Solberg </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 198.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Second, as discussed above, we have long recognized that the common law provides a variety of means independent of the FEHA or its predecessor, the FEPA, to redress injuries arising from discrimination in employment. (B<em>rown </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 486; <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 220; <em>Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at pp. 498-500.) In asserting otherwise, defendant relies on the statement in <em>Gay Law Students Assn. </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 458, 490 [156 Cal.Rptr. 14, 595 P.2d 592], that \u201cthe prohibitions on employment discrimination contained in the [FEHA] are in no sense declaratory of preexisting common law doctrine but rather include areas and subject matters of legislative innovation, creating new limitations on an employer\u2019s right to hire, promote or discharge its employees.\u201d Read in context, however, the import of this statement is simply that the scope of the FEHA is limited to the categories specifically enumerated in the statute, some of which did not exist before enactment of the act; thus, unlike the Unruh Civil Rights Act, which \u201crepresented a codification of the common law principle barring <em>all </em>discrimination by public accommodations,\u201d the FEHA bars discrimination only on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>grounds specified, which do not include sexual orientation. <em>{Ibid., </em>italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the FEHA is such a \u201cgeneral and comprehensive legislation\u201d as to imply a legislative intent to displace or preclude employees\u2019 common law rights.  The general rule is that statutes do not supplant the common law unless it appears that the Legislature intended to cover the entire subject. <em>(I. E. Associates </em>v. <em>Safeco Title Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 281, 285 [216 Cal.Rptr. 438, 702 P.2d 596].) \u201c \u2018[G]eneral and comprehensive legislation, where course of conduct, parties, things affected, limitations and exceptions are minutely described, indicates a legislative intent that the statute should totally supersede and replace the common law dealing with the subject matter.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid. </em>[nonjudicial foreclosure of deeds of trust]; accord <em>Pacific Scene, Inc. </em>v. <em>Penasquitos, Inc., supra, </em>46 Cal.3d 407, 411 [corporate dissolution]; see <em>Justus </em>v. <em>Atchison, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 564, 574-575 [recovery for wrongful death]; <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Turf Club, supra, </em>55 Cal.2d at p. 746 [legalized horse racing and wagering].)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Although this and other courts have on occasion described the FEHA as a \u201ccomprehensive scheme\u201d for combating employment discrimination (e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 485; <em>Snipes </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 861, 865, 868 [193 Cal.Rptr. 760]), in context the statement served to expand, not restrict, the plaintiff\u2019s rights; the exclusivity of the FEHA was not at issue. (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 487 [FEHA venue statute controls when FEHA claim is joined with non-FEHA claim arising out of same facts]; <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 431 [FEHA covers state civil service employees]; <em>Snipes </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield, supra, </em>at pp. 868-869 [actions under FEHA are exempt from general Tort Claims Act requirements].) An examination of the act supports the view it lacks the comprehensiveness necessary to infer a legislative intent to displace all preexisting or alternative remedies for employment discrimination. For example, with the exception of cases involving harassment, the FEHA applies only to \u201cemployers\u201d of five or more persons (\u00a7\u00a7 12926, subd. (c), 12940, subd. (h)), it excludes religious associations or nonprofit corporations (\u00a7 12926, subd. (c)), and it does not protect against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation <em>(Gay Law Students Assn. </em>v. <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra, </em>24 Cal.3d at p. 489). As a remedial scheme, the act also has its limitations in that the Commission is not authorized to award either punitive or general compensatory damages. <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1404; <em>Peralta Community College Dist. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, ante, </em>at pp. 55-57, 60.) Although conference, conciliation and persuasion, together with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>available administrative remedies of injunctive relief, upgrading and reinstatement, with or without back pay, may prove effectual in many cases, in others the employer\u2019s conduct or the employee\u2019s injuries may be such that judicial remedies, including punitive and compensatory damages, can provide the only adequate form of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Employment discrimination may, of course, result in injury entitling an employee to damages in a civil action under the act. (\u00a7 12965, subd. (b); <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 220-221.) The same conduct, however, may also simultaneously cause additional injury outside the ambit of statutory protection. For example, as alleged in this case, an employer\u2019s discriminatory actions may constitute assault and battery or outrageous conduct redressable under a theory of intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Defendant relies on several Court of Appeal and federal decisions (applying California law) that have held the FEHA provides the exclusive remedy for injuries relating to discrimination in employment. Illustrative of one line of cases is <em>Ficalora </em>v. <em>Lockheed Corp. </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 489 [238 Cal.Rptr. 360]. In <em>Ficalora, </em>an employee sued her former employer for retaliatory discharge for filing a sex discrimination complaint. The trial court granted the employer summary judgment on grounds the employee had no common law remedy. The Court of Appeal affirmed. The court held that the employee\u2019s sole cause of action was the statutory cause of action: \u201cEven if a common law cause of action existed before retaliation was identified in the [FEHA] as an unlawful employment practice, the Legislature has made clear its intent to \u2018occupy the field of regulation of discrimination in employment\u2019 by virtue of the FEHA. (\u00a7 12993, subd. (c).)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 492; accord <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Hewlett-Packard Corp. </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1108, 1124-1125 [228 Cal.Rptr. 591] [racial discrimination].)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">What the <em>Ficalora </em>v. <em>Lockheed Corp. </em>court overlooked in its analysis is that the intent expressed in subdivision (c) is not simply to \u201coccupy the field,\u201d but to occupy the field <em>\u201cexclusive of all other laws ... by any city, city and county, county, or other political subdivision of the state, . . </em>.\u201d (\u00a7 12993(c), italics added.) As shown, the intent was to preempt local anti-discrimination law, not state law. Indeed, as previously noted, the FEHA elsewhere expressly disclaims any intent to repeal other applicable state laws, statutory or otherwise. (\u00a7 12993, subd. (a); see <em>Froyd </em>v. <em>Cook, supra, </em>681 F.Supp. 669, 674.)</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Illustrative of a second line of cases is <em>Strauss </em>v. <em>A. L. Randall Co. </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 514 [194 Cal.Rptr. 520]. In <em>Strauss, </em>an age discrimination case, the employee filed a civil suit alleging a common law cause of action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. The Court of Appeal affirmed the judgment of dismissal following an order sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer. Asserting that no common law remedy for age discrimination predated the FEPA, the court concluded that the Legislature, in creating a new right, intended the statutory remedy to be exclusive. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 520.) \u201c \u2018Where a new right is created by statute, the party aggrieved by its violation is confined to the statutory remedy if one is provided . . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 518-519.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In determining legislative intent, however, <em>Strauss </em>and its progeny needlessly invoked the \u201cnew right\u2014exclusive remedy\u201d doctrine of interpretation. Because the FEHA, like its predecessor the FEPA, expressly disclaims any intent to displace other relevant state laws, no resort to interpretative aids is required and the existence vel non of a preexisting cause of action for the particular discrimination is irrelevant. While the FEHA conferred certain new rights and created new remedies, its purpose was not to narrow, but to expand the rights and remedies available to victims of discrimination. (\u00a7\u00a7 12993, 12920.) Under the act, plaintiffs are free to seek relief for injuries arising from discrimination in employment under <em>any </em>state law, without limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">In sum, we hold that the FEHA does not displace any causes of action and remedies that are otherwise available to plaintiffs.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">C. <em>Exhaustion of FEHA Administrative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The second question we address is whether, notwithstanding the availability of common law remedies for injuries relating to employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>discrimination, employees are required to exhaust the FEHA administrative process before seeking judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Neither party disputes that, with respect to a cause of action under the act, exhaustion of administrative remedies is required before initiating a private civil action. The rule is that where a right is given and a remedy provided by statute, the remedy so provided must ordinarily be pursued. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Craycroft </em>(1852) 2 Cal. 243, 244.)  The FEHA, moreover, by its terms implies exhaustion is required, and we have so assumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Section 12965, subdivision (b) provides that if the Department does not issue an accusation within 150 days after the filing of a complaint, or if the Department earlier determines that no accusation will issue, it shall promptly issue a notice indicating that the complainant \u201cmay bring a civil action under this part . . . within one year from the date of such notice.\u201d Commenting in prior decisions on the availability of judicial relief under this provision, we have stated that the right-to-sue letter is a prerequisite to judicial action. (See <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 218; <em>State Personnel Bd. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 433, fn. 11.) Relying on such statements, other courts have held that exhaustion of FEHA administrative remedies is a prerequisite to judicial relief on a statutory cause of action. (See <em>Yurick </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1116, 1123 [257 Cal.Rptr. 665]; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Department of Fair Employment &amp; Housing </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1414, 1416 [239 Cal.Rptr. 908]; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United Airlines, Inc. </em>(1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 878, 890 [220 Cal.Rptr. 684]; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 1059, 1063 [218 Cal.Rptr. 630]; <em>Snipes </em>v. <em>City of Bakersfield, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at p. 866.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We agree that exhaustion of the FEHA administrative remedy is a precondition to bringing a civil suit <em>on a statutory cause of action. </em> In cases appropriate for administrative resolution, the exhaustion requirement serves the important policy interests embodied in the act of resolving disputes and eliminating unlawful employment practices by conciliation (see <em>Yurick </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.3d at p. 1123), as well as the salutory goals of easing the burden on the court system, maximizing the use of administrative agency expertise and capability to order and monitor corrective measures, and providing a more economical and less formal means of resolving the dispute (see <em>McKee </em>v. <em>Bell-Carter Olive Co. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1230, 1244-1245 [231 Cal.Rptr. 304]). By contrast, in those cases appropriate for judicial resolution, as where the facts support a claim for compensatory or punitive damages, the exhaustion requirement may nevertheless lead to settlement and serve to eliminate the unlawful practice or mitigate damages and, in any event, is not an impediment to civil suit, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>that the Department\u2019s practice evidently is to issue a right-to-sue letter (\u00a7 12965) at the employee\u2019s request as a matter of course <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at pp. 1401-1402; see, e.g., <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1057, 1060 [257 Cal.Rptr. 768]; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Coldwell Banker Commercial Group, Inc. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1394, 1399 [245 Cal.Rptr. 606]).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Because, however, our prior decisions have been concerned with the procedures and remedies available to a litigant bringing a <em>statutory </em>cause of action \u201cunder this part\u201d (\u00a7 12965, subd. (b)), they are authority only for the narrow proposition that the FEHA administrative process must be pursued with respect to the specific rights and remedies enumerated in the act. Whether an aggrieved employee must exhaust administrative remedies before seeking damages on nonstatutory grounds remains an open question.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Citing <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715], <em>George Arakelian Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 654 [221 Cal.Rptr. 488, 710 P.2d 288], and related cases, defendant relies on the rule that \u201cwhere an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act.\u201d <em>(Abelleira, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d at p. 292; accord <em>George Arakelian Farms, Inc., supra, </em>at pp. 661-662.) As the cited cases illustrate, however, this oft-quoted rule speaks only to the need to exhaust administrative remedies provided for a statutory right and does not govern rights and remedies outside the legislative scheme. (See generally 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, Actions, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 234, at pp. 264-265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\"><em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of Appeal, supra, </em>17 Cal.2d 280, has been described as the seminal California case establishing the exhaustion doctrine. (Comment, <em>Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies in California </em>(1968) 56 Cal.L.Rev. 1061.) At issue in <em>Abelleira </em>was whether employers who objected to the award of employee benefits under the California Unemployment Insurance Act could seek judicial relief before completing the appeal process under this act. Observing that the Unemployment Insurance Act contained a complete administrative procedure, including an original proceeding and two appeals (17 Cal.2d at p. 291), this court held that under the circumstances, \u201cexhaustion of the administrative remedy is a jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>tional prerequisite to resort to the courts\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 293). In <em>George Arakelian Farms, Inc. </em>v. <em>Agricultural Labor Relations Bd., supra, </em>40 Cal. 3d 654, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board certified the United Farm Workers as the employee\u2019s bargaining representative after summarily dismissing the employer\u2019s objections and rejecting as untimely its request for review. Observing that the employer neither explained its late request nor sought relief from the late filing, we held judicial review of its election objections was barred by its unexcused failure to exhaust the administrative remedies. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 663; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1941) 19 Cal.2d 189, 194 [120 P.2d 26]; <em>County of Contra Costa </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 62, 72-73 [222 Cal.Rptr. 750].)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">As Witkin explains: \u201cThe administrative tribunal is created by law to adjudicate the issue sought to be presented to the court. The claim or \u2018cause of action\u2019 is within the special jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal, and the courts may act only to <em>review </em>the final administrative determination. If a court allowed a suit to be maintained prior to such final determination, it would be interfering with the subject matter jurisdiction of another tribunal.\u201d (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, Actions, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 234, at p. 265, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Defendant, however, argues that the policy considerations underlying the exhaustion doctrine justify extending the requirement to related constitutional and common law claims not specifically within the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. He cites <em>Westlake Community Hosp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 465 [131 Cal.Rptr. 90, 551 P.2d 410] (hereafter Westlake), involving an excluded physician\u2019s failure to pursue internal hospital remedies before filing a civil suit for damages, where we summarized these policy concerns as follows: \u201cIn the first place, even if a plaintiff no longer wishes to be either reinstated or admitted to the organization, an exhaustion of remedies requirement serves the salutary function of eliminating or mitigating damages. If an organization is given the opportunity quickly to determine through the operation of its internal procedure that it has committed error, it may be able to minimize, and sometimes eliminate, any monetary injury to the plaintiff by immediately reversing its initial decision and affording the aggrieved party all membership rights . . . . [fl] Moreover, by insisting upon exhaustion even in these circumstances, courts accord recognition to the \u2018expertise\u2019 of the organization\u2019s quasi-judicial tribunal, permitting it to adjudicate the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in the first instance. [Citation omitted.] Finally, even if the absence of an internal damage remedy makes ultimate resort to the courts inevitable [citation omitted], the prior administrative proceeding will still promote judicial efficiency by unearthing the relevant evidence and by providing a record which the court may review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Thus, as explained in <em>Westlake, supra, </em>17 Cal. 3d 465, exhaustion of administrative remedies furthers a number of important societal and governmental interests, including: (1) bolstering administrative autonomy; (2) permitting the agency to resolve factual issues, apply its expertise and exercise statutorily delegated remedies; (3) mitigating damages; and (4) promoting judicial economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We agree the exhaustion doctrine, when applicable, serves important policy considerations.  The issue before us, however, is not the merits of the doctrine, but whether in the first instance the doctrine applies to the case at hand. On this point, <em>Westlake </em>\u2014involving exhaustion of a private association\u2019s internal remedies\u2014is not determinative. As we stated in <em>Westlake, </em>\u201cFrom the earliest decisions reviewing actions of voluntary private associations,. . . our courts have recognized the applicability of the exhaustion of remedies doctrine in this context.\u201d (17 Cal.3d at p. 474, citing, e.g., <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Magnolia Lodge, I.O.O.F. </em>(1895) 110 Cal. 297, 307-308 [42 P. 887], and <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Templar Lodge, I.O.O.F. </em>(1897) 117 Cal. 370, 375-376 [49 P. 170], both cases disapproved on other grounds in <em>Westlake, supra, </em>at p. 479.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The \u201ccontext\u201d to which <em>Westlake </em>properly applies is where the party or entity whose \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d determination is challenged\u2014be it hospital, voluntary private or professional association, or public entity\u2014has provided an internal remedy. (See, e.g., <em>Holderby </em>v. <em>Internat. Union etc. Engrs. </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 843, 846 [291 P.2d 463] [labor union]; <em>Pinsker </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 541, 557 [116 Cal.Rptr. 245, 526 P.2d 253] [professional society]; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Templar Lodge, I.O.O.F., supra, </em>117 Cal. 370 [fraternal organization]; <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Magnolia Lodge, I.O.O.F., supra, </em>110 Cal. 297 [same]; <em>City of Fresno </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 188 Cal.App.3d 1484, 1490-1491 [234 Cal.Rptr. 136] [city]; <em>Edgren </em>v. <em>Regents of University of California </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 515 [205 Cal.Rptr. 6] [university]; <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 116, 123-124 [185 Cal.Rptr. 878] [state-funded agency]; <em>Holder </em>v. <em>California Paralyzed Veterans Assn. </em>(1980) 114 Cal.App.3d 155 [170 Cal.Rptr. 455] [veterans association].)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The reason for the exhaustion requirement in this context is plain. As we stated in <em>Pinsker </em>v. <em>Pacific Coast Society of Orthodontists, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at page 557: \u201c[W]e believe as a matter of policy that the association itself should in the first instance pass on the merits of an individual\u2019s application rather than shift this burden to the courts. For courts to undertake the task \u2018routinely in every such case constitutes both an intrusion into the internal affairs of [private associations] and an unwise burden on judicial administration of the courts.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Though <em>Westlake, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 465, concerned the exhaustion of private internal remedies, many courts have nevertheless relied on its reasoning to require exhaustion of \u201cexternal\u201d administrative remedies in a variety of public contexts. In so doing, the courts\u2014albeit with little, or no, analysis\u2014have expressly or implicitly determined that the administrative agency possesses a specialized and specific body of expertise in a field that particularly equips it to handle the subject matter of the dispute. Typical of these is <em>Karlin </em>v. <em>Zalta </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 953 [201 Cal.Rptr. 379], involving a physician\u2019s class action for equitable relief and damages arising out of defendant insurers\u2019 alleged charging of excessive malpractice insurance premium rates. As the court there stated: \u201cWhether the exhaustion doctrine is to be applied in a particular instance because of its extreme utility to the court and the agency itself to initially engage administrative expertise, or is to be held inapplicable because of the alleged inadequacy of the administrative remedy, has been determined by a qualitative analysis on a case-by-case basis with concentration on whether a paramount need for agency expertise outweighs other factors.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 981; <em>see McKee </em>v. <em>Bell-Carter Olive Co., supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d 1230, 1245 [all the factors pulling toward exhaustion \u201creflect recognition that many agencies have developed special expertise within that area the agency has been created to serve\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In <em>Karlin </em>v. <em>Zalta, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.3d 953, the court held plaintiffs were required to exhaust their administrative remedies under the McBride Act (Ins. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1850-1860.3). Citing the \u201cfactual complexities\u201d of medical malpractice insurance ratemaking and the McBride Act\u2019s \u201cpervasive and self-contained system of administrative procedure\u201d for monitoring rates and relevant market conditions, the court determined the excessive-rates issue was a matter \u201csingularly within the technical competence of the Insurance Commissioner through the enlistment of agency resources.\u201d (154 Cal.App.3d at p. 983.) In these circumstances, the court held, \u201cit is indispensable that the expertise of the insurance commissioner and the agency\u2019s staff be initially engaged to make such review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 986; accord <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Norcal Mutual Ins. Co. </em>(1979) 98 Cal.App.3d 307 [159 Cal.Rptr. 416]; see <em>Yamaha Motor Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 1232, 1242 [230 Cal.Rptr. 382] [New Motor Vehicle Board has \u201cparticular expertise\u201d in making factual determinations regarding good cause to modify franchises]; <em>Morton </em>v. <em>Hollywood Park, Inc. </em>(1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 248 [139 Cal.Rptr. 584] [Horse Racing Board must determine whether its rules authorized plaintiff\u2019s ejection].)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Unlike in the cited cases, the FEHA does not have a \u201cpervasive and self-contained system of administrative procedure\u201d <em>(Karlin </em>v. <em>Zalta, supra, </em>154 Cal.App.3d at p. 983) for general regulation or monitoring of employer-employee relations so as to assess or prevent discrimination or related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>wrongs in the employment context, nor are the factual issues in an employment discrimination case of a complex or technical nature beyond the usual competence of the judicial system. Rather, a judge or jury is fully capable of determining whether discrimination has occurred. With all due respect to the efficiency and expertise the Department and Commission bring to bear in investigating and determining statutory discrimination cases, and the salutory effect they have on the settlement and disposition of such cases, these are not cases having such a paramount need for specialized agency fact-finding expertise as to require exhaustion of administrative remedies before permitting an aggrieved person to pursue his or her related nonstatutory claims and remedies in court. Requiring exhaustion as to nonstatutory claims, on the other hand, would either lead to routine issuance of right-to-sue letters, thus nullifying the requirement, or, alternatively, burden the Department and Commission with the investigation and determination of issues beyond their jurisdiction and special expertise, limit the resources available for the resolution of cases within the scope of the act, raise complex issues of collateral estoppel or res judicata, and ultimately have no beneficial impact on the judicial system, in that the case in any event must still enter the \u201cjudicial pipeline,\u201d a result the exhaustion doctrine was in part intended to avert <em>(McKee </em>v. <em>Bell-Carter Olive Co., supra, </em>186 Cal.App.3d at p. 1245).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">We conclude, therefore, that although an employee must exhaust the FEHA administrative remedy before bringing suit on a cause of action under the act or seeking the relief provided therein, exhaustion is not required before filing a civil action for damages alleging nonstatutory causes of action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> An employee, of course, may elect to waive the statutory cause of action and remedies, and proceed directly to court on the common law claims <em>(see Alcorn </em>v. <em>Anbro Engineering, Inc., supra, 2 </em>Cal.3d 493, 500, fn. 7); alternatively, the employee may pursue both the administrative and the judicial avenues, either sequentially (e.g., <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Department of Rehabilitation </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 1271, 1277-1278 [261 Cal.Rptr. 204]; <em>Monge </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 503, 507 [222 Cal.Rptr. 64]) or simultaneously, in the latter case amending his or her complaint to join the FEHA cause of action once the Department has issued the right-to-sue letter (e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 481).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">D. <em>Tortious Discharge Against Public Policy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Finally, we address defendant\u2019s contention that the Court of Appeal erred in concluding that plaintiffs may amend their complaint to plead a cause of action for wrongful discharge in contravention of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>In <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373] (hereafter <em>Foley), </em>this court recently reaffirmed the viability of a tort action where an employer\u2019s discharge of an employee contravenes the dictates of fundamental public policy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 665-669; see <em>Tameny </em>v. <em>Atlantic Richfield Co. </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 167, 176-177 [164 Cal.Rptr. 839, 610 P.2d 1330, 9 A.L.R.4th 314] (hereafter <em>Tameny); Petermann </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters </em>(1959) 174 Cal.App.2d 184, 188-189 [344 P.2d 25].) Though we did not decide in <em>Foley </em>whether a statutory or constitutional basis for the policy must exist, we did stress that the policy must be \u201cfundamental\u201d and \u201cpublic\u201d in nature, i.e., one \u201cwhich inures to the benefit of the public at large rather than to a particular employer or employee.\u201d (47 Cal.3d at p. 669.)</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Plaintiffs assert that they were continually subjected to sexual harassment and demands for sexual favors by defendant, and that their refusal to tolerate that harassment or acquiesce in those demands resulted in the wrongful discharge of Ms. Maloney and the constructive wrongful discharge of Ms. Rojo. Plaintiffs further assert that a fundamental public policy against sex discrimination in the workplace may be found in article I, section 8 of the California Constitution (hereafter article I, section 8), which provides: \u201cA person may not be disqualified from entering or pursuing a business, profession, vocation, or employment because of sex, race, creed, color, or national or ethnic origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Defendant advances several arguments against recognition of plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful discharge claims. He contends that the \u201ccomprehensive\u201d remedial scheme for combating employment discrimination established by the FEHA either precludes independent common law claims or renders such claims unnecessary and redundant. This argument we considered and rejected in part B of the preceding discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Defendant also vigorously opposes the proposition that a fundamental public policy against sex discrimination in employment may be found in article I, section 8, or indeed in any other statutory or constitutional provision of this state. Citing <em>Sail'er Inn, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kirby </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 1, 8 [95 Cal.Rptr. 329, 485 P.2d 529, 46 A.L.R.3d 351], defendant asserts that the constitutional provision applies only to \u201cstate action\u201d and has no application to private sector employers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, we have previously assumed that article I, section 8 covers private as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>State action <em>(Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 220 [dictum]; cf. <em>Wilkinson </em>v. <em>Times Mirror Corp. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 1034, 1040-1044 [264 Cal.Rptr. 194] [constitutional right of privacy limits private as well as governmental conduct]; <em>Luck </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1, 19 [267 Cal.Rptr. 618] [same]), an assumption the Legislature evidently shares (see Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 16721 [recognizing that certain business practices denigrate the \u201cfundamental constitutional principles\u201d against discrimination]). For our purposes here, however, whether article I, section 8 applies exclusively to state action is largely irrelevant; the provision unquestionably reflects a fundamental <em>public policy </em>against discrimination in employment\u2014public or private\u2014on account of sex. (Cf. <em>James </em>v. <em>Marinship Corp. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 721, 740 [155 P.2d 329, 160 A.L.R. 900] [\u201cAlthough the [Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments] have been said to apply to state action rather than to private action, they nevertheless evidence a definite national policy against discrimination because of race or color.\u201d]; accord <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 463, 471 [20 Cal.Rptr. 609, 370 P.2d 313]; <em>Winchell </em>v. <em>English </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 125, 128 [133 Cal.Rptr. 20]; see <em>Petermann </em>v. <em>International Brotherhood of Teamsters, supra, </em>174 Cal.App.2d 184, 188 [defining \u201cpublic policy\u201d].) Regardless of the precise scope of its application, article I, section 8 is declaratory of this state\u2019s fundamental public policy against sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, which, as noted, is merely one form of sex discrimination (see fn. 4, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The public policy against sex discrimination and sexual harassment in employment, moreover, is plainly one that \u201cinures to the benefit of the public at large rather than to a particular employer or employee.\u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at p. 669.) No extensive discussion is needed to establish the fundamental <em>public </em>interest in a workplace free from the pernicious influence of sexism. So long as it exists, we are <em>all </em>demeaned. As section 12920 states: \u201cIt is recognized that the practice of denying employment opportunity and discriminating in the terms of employment . . . foments domestic strife and unrest, deprives the state of the fullest utilization of its capacities for development and advance, and substantially and adversely affects the interest of employees, employers, and the public in general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In sum, defendant\u2019s discharges of plaintiffs on the grounds alleged contravened a fundamental, substantial public policy embodied in the state Constitution, a public policy, by whatever measure, that was \u201c \u2018firmly established\u2019 \u201d <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d at pp. 668, 670, fn. 11) at the time plaintiffs were discharged. Consequently, whatever the parameters of the <em>Tameny</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>Foley </em>cause of action for wrongful discharge, on the facts alleged plaintiffs were entitled to leave to amend to plead a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">In light of our conclusion, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that <em>Tameny </em>claims should be limited to situations where, as a condition of employment, the employer \u201ccoerces\u201d an employee to commit an act that violates public policy, or \u201crestrains\u201d an employee from exercising a fundamental right, privilege or obligation. The contention is without merit. Although decided in the factual contexts of coercion (Tameny, <em>supra, 27 </em>Cal.3d 167) and restraint <em>(Foley, supra, </em>47 Cal.3d 654), neither <em>Tameny </em>nor <em>Foley </em>excludes wrongful discharge claims based solely on sex discrimination or sexual harassment. To the contrary, the cases strongly imply that an action for wrongful discharge will lie when, as here, the basis of the discharge contravenes a fundamental public policy. (See <em>Foley, supra, </em>at p. 669; <em>Tameny, supra, </em>at pp. 176-177; see also <em>Commodore Home Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 220.)</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, in any event, easily satisfy defendant\u2019s own criteria. Plaintiffs assert, in essence, that they were terminated for refusing to engage in conduct that violated fundamental public policy, to wit, nonconsensual sexual acts. (See, e.g., Pen. Code, \u00a7 243.4.) They also assert, in effect, that they were discharged in retaliation for attempting to exercise a fundamental right\u2014the right to be free from sexual assault and harassment. Under either theory, plaintiffs, in short, should have been granted leave to amend to plead a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">Lucas, C. J., Mosk, J., Eagleson, J., and Anderson (Carl W.), J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-12\"> Unless otherwise indicated, all further statutory references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-9\"> The complaint alleged, inter alia, that Kliger committed various acts against plaintiffs. As to Emma Rojo, these included grabbing and touching her breasts, and kissing and French-kissing her; as to Teresa Maloney, the acts alleged included blocking her exit from his office, forcibly grabbing her groin, rubbing her legs, and grabbing her hand, forcing her to feel his groin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-10\"> \u201cThis part\u201d refers to part 2.8 of title 2, division 3 (\u00a7 12900 et seq.), which comprises the FEHA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b105-10\"> Although the FEHA cites harassment as an unlawful employment practice separate from discrimination (\u00a7 12940, subd. (h)), the regulations and Commission decisions recognize that sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination in employment. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 7286.5, subd. (f)(3), 7287.6, subd. (b), 7291.1, subd. (f)(1); <em>Dept. Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. </em>v. <em>Del Mar Avionics </em>(1985) No. 85-19, FEHC Precedential Decisions 1984-1985, CEB 16, p. 18; <em>Dept. Fair Emp. &amp; Hous. </em>v. <em>Ambylou Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1982) No. 82-06, FEHC Precedential Decisions 1982-1983, CEB 3, pp. 5-6.) We note, however, that as an employer of fewer than five persons, defendant is subject to the prohibitions of the FEHA with respect only to harassment. (\u00a7\u00a7 12926, subd. (c), 12940, subd. (h).)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">The Commission has defined sexual harassment as \u201cverbal, physical, or sexual behavior directed at any individual because of her, or his, gender.\u201d <em>(Ambylou Enterprises, Inc., supra, </em>FEHC Dec. No. 82-06, CEB 3, p. 6; see also <em>Peralta Community College Dist. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com., ante, </em>p. 45, fn. 2 [276 Cal.Rptr. 114, 801 P.2d 357].) Concerning harassment as discrimination, the Commission has stated: \u201cSexual or racial harassment deprives its victim of a discrimination-free work environment, within the meaning of the Act and our regulations, when the harassment creates an intimidating, oppressive, hostile or offensive work environment or otherwise interferes with the victim\u2019s emotional well-being or her ability to perform her work.\u201d <em>(Del Mar Avionics, supra, </em>FEHC Dec.

Some courts have extended the <em>Strauss </em>rationale to apply to other kinds of discrimination.
