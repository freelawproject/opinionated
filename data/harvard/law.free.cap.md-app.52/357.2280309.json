In 1981 the Commission filed a Statement of Charges against the Association. Charging that the complaint failed to meet certain statutory requirements, the Association moved to dismiss. The Commission\u2019s hearing examiner denied the motion, and a public hearing was scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">An action for declaratory and injunctive relief was then filed by the Association in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The Commission filed a demurrer which was subsequently overruled. This appeal arises from that order of the circuit court (Haile, J.). For the reasons stated we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">A letter of complaint dated August 5, 1976, signed by four commissioners of the Maryland Commission on Human Relations, was sent to the Baltimore County Savings &amp; Loan Association, stating that the Commission had evidence that the Association was engaged in unlawful employment discrimination practices against blacks and women. The Commission was acting pursuant to its authority under Article 49B, \u00a7 12 (b) (now \u00a7 9 (b)) of the Annotated Code of Maryland. Thereafter, the Commission\u2019s staff attempted to resolve the complaint by \"conference, conciliation, and persuasion.\u201d See Md. Ann. Code art. 49B, \u00a7 10 (b) (1957, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>1979 Repl. Vol.). No agreement was reached, however, between the Commission and the Association and a \"Statement of Charges\u201d was filed against the Association in April 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The Association moved to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that the complaint was invalid because it was not under oath, and generally failed to meet the requirements of \u00a7 9 (b). The Commission then filed, as an \"Amendment to Commission Complaint,\u201d sworn statements of each of the commissioners who had signed the August 1976 complaint. The examiner found that the complaint fulfilled the statutory prerequisites and, consequently, a public hearing was scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">On September 2, 1981, the Association filed a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief requesting that the complaint be declared invalid and the Commission enjoined from holding a public hearing. A demurrer was filed by the Commission alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court was precluded from exercising jurisdiction because of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. The circuit court overruled the demurrer and enjoined the Commission from conducting a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">On appeal, the principal question is whether the Association was required to exhaust the appropriate administrative procedures before seeking judicial review. The secondary issue is whether the overruling of the Commission\u2019s demurrer is an appealable interlocutory order.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">In <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 283, 418 A.2d 1155, 1160 (1980), the Court of Appeals observed that in the past four or five decades few legal tenets have received greater acceptance in Maryland than the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. That doctrine is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-9\">\"[A] claimant ordinarily must seek to redress the wrong of which he complains by using the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>procedure the legislature has established for that kind of case, if it is adequate and available, and if he is unsuccessful and wishes aid from the courts, he must take judicial appeals in a manner the legislature has specified rather than by seeking to invoke the ordinary general jurisdiction of the courts... . <em>[Consequently, we] have held that where a special form of remedy is provided, the litigant must adopt that form and must not bypass the administrative body or official, by pursuing other </em>remedies.\u201dId. at 283-84, 418 A.2d at 1160. (Emphasis added.) (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">The Association argues that the doctrine is inapplicable in this case because there is no \"special form of remedy.\u201d A contrary conclusion was reached by the Court of Appeals on similar facts in <em>Soley v. Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 356 A.2d 254 (1976). We feel that <em>Soley </em>is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">In <em>Soley, </em>the Commission filed an amended complaint against certain apartment owners charging them with racially discriminatory housing practices. When the owners refused to comply with the Commission\u2019s subpoenas <em>duces tecum, </em>the Commission sought a court order to enforce them.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The apartment owners, claiming that the complaint was invalid,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed a separate action for declaratory and injunctive relief to restrain the Commission from enforcing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>the subpoenas. The chancellor, however, sustained the Commission\u2019s demurrers. Affirming the chancellor\u2019s decision, the Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 15 (now \u00a7 12) of Article 49B and \u00a7 255 (a) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of Article 41, part of the Administrative Procedure Act, combined to provide a \"special form of remedy\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3-409 (b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 525, 356 A.2d at 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In an opinion by Judge Levine,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court rejected appellant\u2019s contention that there need be no exhaustion of administrative remedies where the act of the administrative agency is alleged to be ultra vires or illegal, and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">\"Accordingly, we hold that the chancellor was correct in his conclusion that where a statute provides a special form of remedy for a specific type of case, that statutory remedy shall be followed in lieu of a proceeding under the declaratory judgment act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528, 356 A.2d at 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">That special form of remedy is present in \u00a7 12. The Association\u2019s argument that <em>Soley </em>is distinguishable is unpersuasive. It states that the proceedings in <em>Soley </em>were confined to the confidential investigative stages,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> whereas in this case a public hearing has been scheduled. This factual distinction, however, does not extinguish the remedy contemplated in \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>The Association also hypothesizes that it will be deprived of a special form of remedy if the Commission, after making findings of fact detrimental to its interest, does not seek to enforce a final order <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> either because the underlying complaint was invalid, or for any other reason. First, the Association incorrectly assumes the complaint\u2019s invalidity. See discussion <em>infra. </em>Secondly, the decision whether to seek a court order, regardless of the reason, lies within the discretion of the Commission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In essence, appellant\u2019s lament concerns the nature of the statutory administrative process, and is beyond redress in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The Association alternatively contends that two of the five exceptions- to the administrative exhaustion rule enumerated in <em>Blumberg, </em>288 Md. 275, 284-85, 418 A.2d 1155, 1161 (1980), are applicable. These two exceptions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">\"3. When an agency requires a party to follow, in a manner and to a degree that is significant, an unauthorized procedure. <em>Stark v. Board of Registration, </em>179 Md. 276, 284-85, 19 A.2d 716, 720 (1941).\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">\"5. When the object of, as well as the issues presented by, a judicial proceeding only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>tangentially or incidentally concern matters which the administrative agency was legislatively created to solve, and do not, in any meaningful way, call for or involve applications of its expertise. <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. v. Wash. Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 594-604, 386 A.2d 1216, 1222-27 (1978).\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Under the third <em>Blumberg </em>exception, the Association asserts that the Commission is forcing it to undergo public hearing without a validly issued, <em>i.e., </em>(sworn) complaint and this constitutes an \"unauthorized procedure.\u201d In claiming that the procedure is unauthorized, the Association has placed a disingenuous degree of reliance on <em>Equitable Trust Co. v. Commission on Human Relations, </em>287 Md. 80, 411 A.2d 86 (1980). The Court of Appeals there ordered that the Commission\u2019s petition for a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>be dismissed, on remand, because the underlying complaint was not under oath as required by Article 49B, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The rationale of the decision was that the legislature intended to assure that those against whom the Commission brought complaints <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> would not be subjected to charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>lightly made or issued upon the \"whim, fantasy or prejudice of certain of the commissioners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 411 A.2d at 91. The Court of Appeals in <em>Equitable Trust </em>did not invalidate all unsworn complaints, but simply held that where a complaint is not issued under oath a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>could not be enforced.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nothing in the decision suggests that such a defect could not be cured by amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Article 49B, \u00a7 11 (c) expressly permits \"reasonable amendment to be made to any complaint or answer.\u201d Furthermore, regulations adopted by the Commission specifically state that, \"a complaint may be amended to cure technical defects or omissions, <em>including failure to swear to the complaint, . </em>.. All of these amendments will relate back to the the original filing date.\u201d COMAR 14.03.01.02D(3)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (emphasis added). Sworn statements of the four signing commissioners, in this case, were added to the original complaint as an amendment. Thus, the protection afforded by the oath requirement, contemplated in <em>Equitable Trust, </em>was present here; therefore, there was no unauthorized procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The second exception upon which appellee relies, the so-called fifth <em>Blumberg </em>exception, appears to have been raised for the first time on appeal and is supported only by the argument in appellee\u2019s brief that the determination of the complaint\u2019s validity is a question of law which does not involve the administrative agency\u2019s expertise.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Preliminarily, we believe it appropriate to point out that this \"exception\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was found in <em>Blumberg </em>to derive from <em>Maryland-National Capital Park &amp; Planning Commission v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>Washington National Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 594-604, 386 A.2d 1216, 1222-27 (1978);<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that a careful reading of Judge Levine\u2019s opinion makes it clear that the decision was governed by the doctrine of \"primary jurisdiction.\u201d This was defined as a \"judicially created rule designed to coordinate the allocation of functions between courts and administrative bodies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 386 A.2d at 1225-26, and applicable only where there is concurrent jurisdiction between court and administrative agency. Indeed, the court was careful to emphasize that primary jurisdiction \"is <em>distinguishable from the doctrine requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 602, 386 A.2d at 1226, (noting <em>Soley v. Commission on Human Relations, </em>277 Md. 521, 526-27, 356 A.2d 254 (1976), for an explanation of the policies underlying the exhaustion rule). Therefore, as previously suggested,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> whether the fifth <em>Blumberg </em>\"exception\u201d is, indeed, an exception is open to question.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">At all events, the determination of the validity of the complaint under \u00a7 9 (b) was a matter within the administrative expertise of the Commission. The issue was not one that only tangentially concerned matters the Commission was created to solve, but rather arose directly under the statute authorizing the Commission to issue complaints. The Association\u2019s argument, carried to its logical conclusion, suggests that any \"legal\u201d challenge to an administrative agency\u2019s action under a statute automatically invokes an exception to the exhaustion doctrine. Such a view is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The Association argues that the lower court\u2019s overruling of the Commission\u2019s demurrer is not an appealable interloc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>utory order. An order overruling a demurrer is not appealable except when it falls within one of the provisions of Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 12-303 (1980), permitting direct appeals from certain interlocutory orders. Section 12-303 (c) of that article provides that an appeal may be taken from \"[a]n order: granting or dissolving an injunction, but if the appeal is from an order granting an injunction, only if the appellant has first filed his answer in the cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although no answer was filed in this case, the Commission did file a demurrer to the Association\u2019s suit for declaratory and injunctive relief. A demurrer to a bill or petition for an injunction is regarded as an answer within the meaning of this section. <em>See, e.g., Stockham v. Knollenberg, </em>133 Md. 337, 105 A. 305 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\n<em>Order reversed; case remanded to Circuit Court for Baltimore County for entry of an order vacating injunction and for remand to Maryland Commission on Human Relations for hearing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\">.

Even if a procedure is unauthorized, there is substantial doubt that the third exception listed in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Blumberg, supra, </em>remains viable. .

In addition, the court noted that, \"[a]mong the grounds on which the decision of an administrative agency may be attacked on judicial review are \"excess of... statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; ... unlawful procedure; [or] other error of law....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at n.3 (citing Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 255 (g) (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.)). Our research has revealed no cases in which the <em>Stark </em>exception, as cited in <em>Blumberg, </em>has been successfully applied. However, some vitality may inhere in the <em>Stark </em>exception with reference to appeals from decisions by county agencies to which the Administrative Procedure Act is not applicable. Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 244 (1957, 1979 Repl. Vol.); Urbana Civic Association v.

As discussed <em>infra, </em>that case concerned the doctrine of \"primary jurisdiction\u201d as distinguished from the administrative exhaustion doctrine.
