Wasserman sought to create in her will is a valid charitable trust. Because our answer is affirmative, we need not consider the second question \u2014 whether the doctrine of <em>cypres, </em>Md. Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 14-302 (1974), would apply. Our decision requires reversal of the decree of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Brizendine, J.) and means that two thirds of Mrs. Wasserman\u2019s estate will be used to publish and disseminate her book entitled, \"Linda,\u201d which concerns her only daughter who died of cancer at the age of eight in 1950.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Mrs. Wasserman died in December 1978, five years after her husband, Earl B. Wasserman, who had left her all of his estate. Her will, whose validity is not at issue, was dated October 11, 1971, 21 years after her daughter\u2019s death. Prepared by attorney Thomas J. Grogan, Jr., it bequeathed one third of her estate to her husband,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> specific items to relatives,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the rest, residue and remainder to three named trustees <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who were directed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">\n<em>''[A]pply the net income therefrom and whatever portion of the corpus of this trust estate which may </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\n<em>be required to preserve and protect the manuscript and illustrations and copyrights of my book entitled Linda\u2019, and in their discretion insofar as said Trustees find this procedure practicable to have said book widely published in expanded and revised form, if this should be helpful, in as many editions as may be deemed necessary and to have the material used in whatever form and by whatever method it appears to them to be most feasible.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">\"It is my wish and desire that the entire corpus of this trust estate, together with any accumulated income therefrom bq used by my said Trustees to carry out the above trust with respect to my said book entitled 'Linda\u2019 and the second edition thereof, which I am about to publish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">\"If I shall die before I publish the second edition, I authorize my Executors to employ some Christian Writers to complete the work.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">Following his appointment as personal representative, Mr. Grogan, now deceased, sought a declaratory judgment, pursuant to Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 3-406 and 3-408 (1980 Repl. Vol.) and Md. Est. &amp; Trusts Code Ann. \u00a7 14-301 (a) (1974), requesting the court to instruct him as to whether the will created a valid trust. Thomas E. Rosser, trustee and appellant here, filed an answer, averring that the trust was valid. At a hearing before a master on August 11,1980, \"Linda,\u201d a bound, copyrighted, and illustrated volume of 102 pages, was admitted into evidence, along with letters from two experts, Carol Abromaitis, an associate professor of English at Loyola College, Baltimore, and Eleanor Merryman Roszel, an author\u2019s representative. The former testified that the book \"Linda\u201d was \"without aesthetic merit,\u201d being structurally flawed by \"a mishandling of point of view\u201d and stylistically flawed by \"grammatical errors.\u201d Ms. Roszel passed on the book\u2019s \"publishability,\u201d concluding that \"Linda\u201d had \"no ready-made audience and therefore no marketability.\u201d Mr. Grogan, the author of the will, testified that had he seen a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>copy of the book before drawing up the will, he would have tried to discourage Mrs. Wasserman. His assessment of \"Linda\u201d was: \"ungodly bad.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYGj\">The master concluded that Mrs. Wasserman\u2019s will did not create a valid trust, stating in his memorandum opinion: \"The book 'Linda\u2019 sets forth no doctrine. It advocates nothing. It promotes no matter of special interest to the community. It certainly is not a literary gem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Appellant excepted, but before the circuit court hearing, Mr. Grogan died. He was replaced by Robert C. Prem, appellee here. On October 8, 1981, the circuit court determined that the trust was invalid on two grounds: first, as a private trust, it lacked ascertainable beneficiaries;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>as a charitable trust, it lacked the necessary elements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result, the net residuary estate was ordered distributed to the heirs at law. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Charitable trusts in Maryland have attracted little appellate attention in recent years although the legacy of cases prior to the adoption of \u00a7 14-301 <em>et seq. </em>in 1974 is ample.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1888, the legislature enacted a statute that no bequest for charitable uses would be void for uncertainty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>beneficiaries, provided a corporation existed to take the same. See Md. Ann. Code Art. 93, \u00a7 357 (1957). The statute was amended in 1908 to remove the bar of perpetuities from charitable trusts, but not until 1931 were the principles of the statute of 43 Elizabeth Ch. 4 (1601) formally adopted in this State. Code, <em>supra, </em>Art. 16, \u00a7 268A (1935 Supp.). <em>See </em>Howard, C., <em>\"Charitable Trusts in Maryland,\u201d </em>1 Md.L.Rev. 105 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">As the Court of Appeals noted in <em>Second National Bank v. Second National Bank, </em>171 Md. 547, 556-7, 190 A. 215, 219 (1937), this statute, which is the predecessor of \u00a7 14-301, did not mark the beginning of charitable trusts in Maryland, for courts of equity had exercised jurisdiction over charitable trusts from antiquity. Many, of course, had failed for uncertainty or perpetuities, <em>see </em>cases collected in <em>Howard, supra, </em>n.36 at 117. These trusts would be valid and enforceable under Art. 16, \u00a7 268A. The court pointed out that courts in states with the statute have upheld as charities many objects of benevolence which the statute neither mentions nor implies. Similarly in this State, a trust to establish a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>home for \"unfortunate girls\u201d was held to be charitable, <em>Second National, supra, </em>and more recently, <em>Register of Wills v. Cook, </em>241 Md. 264, 216 A.2d 542 (1966), held that a trust to help further the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and assist women suffering from the effects of sexual discrimination in the laws of Maryland and the United States was essentially charitable in nature, \"[wjhatever may be the views of individuals, laymen or judges. . ..\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278. Because we have found no Maryland case concerning a charitable trust to publish a book, we begin our analysis on common ground with the appellant and appellee concerning the definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\"A charitable trust is a fiduciary relationship with respect to property arising as a result of a manifestation of an intention to create it, and subjecting the person by whom the property is held to equitable duties to deal with the property for a charitable purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 348 at 210 (1959). Both sides also agree that \u00a7 368 of the <em>Restatement </em>sets forth the permitted charitable purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">(a) the relief of poverty;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">(b) the advancement of education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-9\">(c) the advancement of religion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">(d) the promotion of health;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-11\">(e) governmental or municipal purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-12\">(f) other purposes the accomplishment of which is beneficial to the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-13\"><em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 368 at 246. These purposes, derived from the Statute of Elizabeth, <em>supra, </em>were broadened in \u00a7 14-301 (b) to include \"purposes within either the spirit or letter\u201d of the venerable statute.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It is likewise undisputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>that a charitable trust can be created without a definite or definitely ascertainable beneficiary designated, <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 364 at 243, and is not invalid although continuing for an indefinite or unlimited period, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 365 at 244; \u00a7 14-301 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Appellant argues that the trust created by Mrs. Wasserman qualifies as a charitable trust on two grounds: first, it would advance education through \"the dissemination of knowledge or of beliefs by the publication of books and pamphlets . . .,\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, comment </em>a to \u00a7 370 at 251; second, it would advance religion by disseminating \"religious beliefs or doctrines; . ..\u201d <em>id., comment </em>a to \u00a7 371 at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Appellee states that \"publication of the book 'Linda\u2019 falls short of a charitable purpose\u201d because it is of little or no value to the community in advancing either education or religion. The test, according to appellee, is stated by Professor Bogert: \"[I]f the court comes to the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>it would be irrational to regard the trust as bringing about any public benefits, but rather that the trust would be useless to society, the court will hold the trust noncharitable... Bogert, <em>Trusts and Trustees </em>\u00a7 368 at 58 (2d ed. rev. 1977). Appellee relies on the <em>Restatement\u2019s </em>no-nonsense <em>comment </em>m to \u00a7 374 that \"a trust to publish and distribute the writings of the testator is not enforceable if his writings are of no value.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Professor Scott echoes this flat prohibition: \"A trust to publish worthless writings is not valid, either as a charitable trust or as a private trust.\u201d II <em>Scott on Trusts </em>\u00a7 124 at 963-4 (3d. ed. 1967), <em>citing, Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Clyde, </em>121 A.2d 625 (Conn. 1956). Professor Bogert, whom appellee quotes extensively, is somewhat scathing in his view of \"educational trusts [that] seek to propagate eccentric ideas,\u201d producing no substantial advantages to society, Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 375 at 134, and whimsical or irrational trusts, made out of mere sentiment, that have no practical effect except to satisfy the whim of the testator and waste the assets of the estate. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 379 at 204.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Appellee\u2019s position seeks to put this Court in the unaccustomed role of literary critic, but before we review the lower court\u2019s decision that the book \"Linda\u201d \"wasn\u2019t much good\u201d and therefore failed as a charitable trust,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we will consider whether the other required elements of a charitable trust, as set forth in the comments to \u00a7 348 of the <em>Restatement </em>at 210-11, are present. These elements are:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">a. fiduciary relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>b. duties of trustees</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">c. trust property</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">d. manifestation of intention</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">e. charitable purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The first three elements give us little pause. The fiduciary relationship in a charitable trust is between the trustee and unknown beneficiaries who will come forward upon operation of the trust. The trustee of a charitable trust is subject to equitable duties as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 169-185 of the <em>Restatement. </em>In this case, these duties might include hiring an editor, publisher, and distributor for Mrs. Wasserman\u2019s book. The trust property \u2014 two thirds of the estate \u2014 is obviously a proper subject of the trust, as is the object of the trust \u2014 the book.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The fourth element requires some analysis. Mrs. Wasserman\u2019s intention to create a trust is evident in the will. <em>See Waesche v. Rizzuto, </em>224 Md. 573, 583, 168 A.2d 871, 875 (1961). Whether she meant to create a charitable trust is not immediately apparent from the language of the will itself, which mentions neither the word \"charity\u201d nor any of its synonyms or variations. However, that omission is not dispositive. <em>See Second National Bank, supra, </em>171 Md. 550-1, 190 A. at 216-7; <em>cf. Woman\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society v. Mitchell, </em>93 Md. 199, 48 A. 737 (1901) (bequest to educate six girls in India as Bible readers held valid gift with a condition, despite words \"in trust\u201d used in will). Section 358 of the <em>Restatement </em>tells us that the intention to create a charitable trust may be ascertained:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">(a) from the will itself; or</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">(b) from an existing instrument properly incorporated in the will by reference; or</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">(c) from facts which have significance apart from their effect upon the disposition of the property devised or bequeathed by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\"><em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 358 at 223-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">The published book \"Linda,\u201d the object of the trust, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>tains an introduction, <em>see </em>n.l, <em>supra, </em>that manifests Mrs. Wasserman\u2019s intention \"to help others believe as I had been shown how to believe, particularly parents.\u201d The preface, written by James S. Cox, then Dean of St. Andrew\u2019s Cathedral in Honolulu, Hawaii, expands upon this intent and alludes to the intended beneficiaries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-5\">\"When the author first came to me some time after the death of her daughter, I knew her to be struggling with a grief too great to bear without some effort on her part to justify the bitter pain of bereavement \u2014 to find some working answer to the enigma of human existence. Her quest led her over a curious path but through the same valley of decision and faith countless others have encountered and will encounter. It is to help the latter that she was led to write her book.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Manifestation of Mrs. Wasserman\u2019s intent is thus externally expressed \u2014 she wanted to publish and disseminate the book \"Linda\u201d and two others, then and still not completed, to offer solace and spiritual guidance to parents plunged into the unimaginable mental anguish produced by the loss of a young child.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Appellees do not contend that any of the first four elements are lacking: they simply assert that there is no charitable purpose <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> because \"Linda\u201d has no literary value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and its dissemination will produce no public benefit. Therefore, they contend, the trust is invalid and unenforceable. The testimony before the master amply demonstrates the book\u2019s shortcomings, appellees point out, citing authority dealing with other writings deemed \"worthless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Thus, in <em>Wilber v. Asbury Park National Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>59 A.2d 570 (1948), <em>affd sub nom, Wilber v. Owens, </em>65 A.2d 843 (N.J. 1949), the testator directed that $15,000 be spent to type, edit, and distribute his manuscript entitled, \"Random Scientific Notes Seeking the Essentials in Place and Space.\u201d The lower court refused to do so, finding the writings \"irrational, unintelligible, and of no scientific or other value,\u201d and their publication \"a waste of money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 578. The court did apply the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine, however, because the will showed general charitable intent, and the judgment was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We distinguish the <em>Wilber </em>case on three grounds. First, the will had no friends \u2014 all counsel-agreed that the express purpose of the will was \"impossible of performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579. That is not so in this case. Second, the testator, according to the trial judge, was \"eccentric, egotistical, pompous, and had an exaggerated idea of his own importance\u201d; he was \"touched with megalomania,\u201d and \"evidently obsessed with the idea that he was under an obligation and duty to do something magnificent for mankind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584. We have no such testator here. Third, several of the institutions named as beneficiaries refused to accept the gift on the testator\u2019s terms that his \"Notes\u201d be published. That is not the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s application of the <em>cy pres </em>doctrine, the Supreme Court of New Jersey dealt more gently with the quality of the testator\u2019s work, and its observations are apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-10\">\"He sought to add 'a small bit to the sum-total of desirable human knowledge, for the use and benefit of mankind.\u2019 This we find in the 'Introduction\u2019 to the first volume of his Notes. True, his Notes contributed nothing to the sum of human knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>edge; and their development would not add to wisdom. Indeed, they have been termed 'irrational and incoherent.\u2019 Dr. Scoon said a part was understandable and a part not. Yet to the testator the test was real and vital and entirely reasonable in keeping with his own meager understanding of the subject.... He conceived that his reflections and conclusions would provide the basis and the impetus for philosophic research that would in the end be socially constructive and otherwise serve the common good; but the <em>charitable intent does not depend upon the scientif\u00edc validity of his views or the depth of his understanding. We are not concerned with his philosophic or sociologic orthodoxy or rationality. </em>Whatever the utility of his contribution, his undoubted aim was the use of his Notes as the beginning of an understanding that would in scientific hands redound to the advantage of mankind. That was his avowed purpose.\u201d 65 A.2d at 846. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In support of his view that the book \"Linda\u201d is worthless, appellee refers us to a case cited by Professor Scott, IV <em>Law of Trusts, supra, </em>n.5 at 2872. <em>Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Clyde, </em>121 A.2d 625 (Conn. 1956) held that a trust to publish a deceased attorney\u2019s writings was invalid as contrary to public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 629. A sampling of the titles of the pamphlets proposed to be published supports the court\u2019s reaction of repugnance to this so-called \"educational trust for charitable purposes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>While the case is completely distinguishable, we <em>agree </em>with the court\u2019s statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\"where the purpose for which the trust was created constitutes a valid charitable use, the educational value of the books or pamphlets to be distributed is ordinarily of no concern to the court, nor is the literary merit of the material a proper subject of judicial inquiry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Appellee also refers us to 12 ALR2d, Annot. Charitable Trust \u2014 Validity \u00a7 2 at 861 (1950), but the cases found there tend to support the theory expressed in \u00a7 2, which is at variance with appellee\u2019s position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">\"Broadly speaking, the publication of writings is regarded as a furtherance of education and, therefore, a valid charitable object. Excluding advocacy of immorality or crime, no inquiry is made into the rightness or wrongness of the views expressed . . . [I]t is required that the writer be rational. The writings may espouse an unpopular doctrine; ... In modern times, the author may take any view he pleases respecting the forms of religion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">The case of <em>In re Hamilton-Grey, </em>38 New So.W.St. 262 (1938), discussed in the annotation at 862, is instructive. The testatrix left all her property in trust to disseminate her three published books on the life and poetry of Henry Kendall, the \"Australian Wordsworth.\u201d Expert and lay witnesses testified that her books were worthless as literary criticism and had little biographical value. Nonetheless, the court refused to hold publication and distribution of the books noncharitable. \"Judicial inspection of the books was confined to a search for contravention of law and morals, and, they being cleared on this score, their object of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>awakening interest in the poet was educational.\u201d Annotation, <em>supra, </em>at 863.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The one case supportive of appellee\u2019s position, <em>State exr el. Emmert v. Union Trust Co., </em>86 N.E.2d 450 (Ind. 1949), is disparaged by the author of the annotation as an unfortunate result that \"flows upstream in the current of authority.\u201d Annotation, <em>supra, </em>at 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The court held that a will directing the executors to publish and distribute the diaries of the testator\u2019s grandfather, admittedly of educational value, was not a valid charitable trust because the will evidenced no charitable intent or purpose. Chief Justice Gilkison\u2019s stinging dissent noted that: \"A gift to the use of the general public is always construed to be a public charitable trust.\u201d <em>Emmert, supra, </em>86 N.E.2d at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The one caveat espoused by both Scott and Bogert is that a charitable trust must provide some societal benefit. Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 361 at 3; Scott, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 374.7 at 2920; <em>see Restatement, supra, comment m </em>to \u00a7 374 at 261.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">\"The question is not whether the trust is in harmony with the prevailing public views as to what purposes are of advantage to society. The court sanctions the advancement of many minority causes, for example, aid to religious sects which have few followers and trusts to promote governmental changes which are not popular.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-9\"><em>The court should not hold the trust to be noncharitable merely because it does not approve of the objectives of the settlor and does not consider that his trust will bring about social benef\u00edts. If, notwithstanding its disapproval, the court finds that the settlor and rational men in general might reasonably believe that public advantages would accrue, it may hold the trust to be charitable, for example, in the case of a trust to promote </em>vegetarianism.\u201d Bogert, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 368 at 56-7. (Emphasis added.) (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>An excellent example of a \"minority cause\u201d is found in <em>In re Estate of Kidd, </em>467 P.2d 770 (Ariz.App. 1970), which involved a holographic will that left the balance of the estate to fund \"research or some scientific proof of a soul of the human body which leaves at death. I think in time their [sic] can be a Photograph of soul leaving the human at death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771. The case attracted much publicity for the seemingly impecunious gentleman had left $174,000 in stocks and bonds. The court did not hesitate to find a charitable trust. <em>Id. </em>at 774. <em>See also </em>the early case of <em>Thornton v. Howe, </em>31 Beaver 14, 54 Eng. Reprint 1042 (1862), discussed in annotation, <em>supra, </em>at 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">A charitable purpose may be found in \"almost anything that tends to promote the well-doing and well-being of social man,\u201d <em>Ould v.

They all wanted to listen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-15\">But, after awhile, like Coleridge\u2019s Ancient Mariner, I grew exhausted. I began to leave things out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-16\">I still felt, however, the tremendous impulse to tell it. I was impelled to tell it, for I could not hold it within me. I wanted to help others believe as I had been shown how to believe, particularly parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-17\">When I was granted, quite suddenly, a voice scholarship at the Music Academy of the West, in Santa Barbara, California, with the great artists John Charles Thomas, and Madame Lotte Lehmann, in the summer of 1951, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>I rode out on the Atchison, Topeka and Sante Fe and returned by the Northwest Passage on the Milwaukee Road, the train company kindly rerouting my ticket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">In Seattle, Washington, I had a sister, Celeste, whose husband is Dr. Morton E. Bassan. He arranged that I tell the story into a dictaphone and he had his secretary type it. He tested me for extra-sensory perception, at the same time. He is interested in ESP, as many people are today. Nothing significant was found.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">Thus the twenty-two pages, the nucleus of a book, suddenly were there in my hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">From this, all the writing has stemmed and has grown into three separate books, the first one completed being \"LINDA\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-11\">Eleanor B. Wasserman</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-12\">The \"miraculous vision\u201d to which Mrs. Wasserman refers is explained by James S. Cox, then Dean of St. Andrew\u2019s Church in Honolulu, Hawaii, in the Preface to \"Linda.\u201d We quote from it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-13\">Some may have some difficulty in accepting the author\u2019s interpretation of the events after her daughter\u2019s death. I do myself, although I was to some extent involved in them. I still remember my astonishment when she produced the crayon sketch of the Church seen in her dream. It was the pre-restoration Church of which I was then Rector and which she could never have seen. Whatever the valuation placed on this incident, it was the turning point in her life, but it does not in any way affect the validity of the Christian position she reached through her Judeo-Christian background.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b393-14\">.

Although now outdated, several early cases are worth noting:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\"><em>Isaac v. Emory, </em>64 Md. 333, 1 A. 713 (1885), cited by the master in his memorandum opinion, involved a deed of land to be used as a place of worship by the Methodist Episcopal Church. The gift failed because of indefinite beneficiaries and the appeal was dismissed. The case stated the familiar premise, now discounted in the case of charitable trusts: \"According to the uniform course of decisions in this State, a trust cannot be upheld unless it be of such a nature that the <em>cestuis que trust </em>(beneficiaries) are defined, and capable of enforcing its execution by proceedings in a Court of Chancery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-14\"><em>Bennett v. Baltimore Humane Impartial Society, </em>91 Md. 10, 45 A. 888 (1900), involved a bequest to a home for aged men and women. The court held that no trust was created because of the uncertainty of the beneficiaries and creation of a perpetuity but that the gift was valid, subject to the condition subsequent. The next of kin had claimed that the will created a trust and it was void; therefore, they inherited. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>remarked: \"Courts are not, or ought not to be, astute in searching for a construction which nullifies a will if there are other equally reasonable interpretations which uphold it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18, 45 A. at 889. <em>See </em>Emmert v.

The Court applied the statute removing indefinite beneficiaries as an objection to the validity of a gift and held that the trustees had the power to choose appropriate institutions in effectuating the intent of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\"><em>Salem Church of the United Brethren v. Numsen, </em>191 Md. 43, 59 A.2d 757 (1948), involved a deed of land to an unincorporated religious association. The trust failed because designation of the beneficiaries was too vague and indefinite, a failing since cured by \u00a7 14-301 (c). The holding in the case was that the religious society did not acquire title by adverse possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\"><em>Second National Bank v. Second National Bank. </em>171 Md. 547. 190 A. 215 (1937), involved the construction of Md. Ann. Code Art. 93, \u00a7 337, the predecessor of \u00a7 14-301 (c), which then provided, in addition, that a corporation had to be formed to take the gift. The court held that a gift for an indefinite class, in this case \"unfortunate girls,\u201d will be upheld if the object is for a purpose commonly understood as charitable. <em>Id. </em>at 558, 190 A. at 221.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b398-14\">. Charitable purposes beyond the confines of the first five categories mentioned in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts </em>\u00a7 368 at 246 (1959), are explained in the comments to \u00a7 374 at 257. Comment 1 discusses \"unpopular causes,\u201d for which the publication of \"Linda\u201d qualifies, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>view of the late Mr. Grogan, appellees, the chancellor, and the master. We quote from comment 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">\"1. <em>Unpopular causes. </em>If the general purposes for which a trust is created are such as may be reasonably thought to promote the social interest of the community, the mere fact that a majority of the people and the members of the court believe that the particular purpose of the settlor is unwise or not adapted to the accomplishment of the general purposes, does not prevent the trust from being charitable. Thus, a trust to promote a religious doctrine is charitable although the doctrine has few adherents. So also, a trust to publish books or pamphlets or to give lectures advocating the doctrine of the single tax is charitable, even though the doctrine may have few adherents. <em>One of the great advantages resulting from charitable trusts is in the fact that they permit experimental tests of ideas which have not been generally accepted.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">The courts do not take sides or attempt to decide which of two conflicting views of promoting the social interest of the community is the better adapted to the purpose, even though the views are opposed to each other. Thus, a trust to promote peace by disarmament, as well as a trust to promote peace by preparedness for war, is charitable.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">The experimental idea alluded to by Mrs. Wasserman in \"Linda\u201d is extra-sensory perception, in which she had an interest, and of which, according to the book, she had several personal experiences.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. What is thought irrational varies with time and place. <em>See </em>State Tax Commission v.

Lounsberry, 111 N.W.2d 638 (Iowa 1961) (bequest to promote instruction in vocal music and the proper development of the lungs of young children held charitable). The determination of rationality is sometimes difficult, as in the case of an idea born before its time. What court in 1400 would have enforced a trust to publish the writings of one who believed the world was round? What court today would not uphold a trust to publish the writings of those who believe the earth is flat?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Among the whimsical or irrational trusts noted by Professor Bogert is a gift to provide a band to march to the testator\u2019s grave on his birthday and play dirges. Bogert, <em>Trusts and Tjrustees </em>\u00a7 379 at 204 (2d ed.rev.1977). Professor Scott points out that \"it is not always easy to draw the line between purposes believed to be irrational and those believed to be merely unwise. The test is not what the court believes, and not what the majority believe, but what rational persons may believe.\u201d <em>IV Scott On Trusts </em>\u00a7 374.7 at 2920-1 (3d. ed. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In <em>National City Bank v. Case Western Reserve University, </em>369 N.E.2d 814 (Ct.C.P. Ohio 1976), the testatrix ordered her beautiful home razed. Witnesses testified that she felt it had no future as a residence because of its expensive Upkeep, and that she would rather have the home destroyed than see it used commercially as had so many of the once-fine residential tracts surrounding her property. The court decided that while her purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>was impelled by sentiment, her real desire that her home endure as a residence was not capricious or irrational, and that desire could be effectuated by selling the property to an historical society that would maintain it for the use of the public. <em>Id. </em>at 818-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Two other recent cases involving the razing of property were decided on a different ground. <em>In re Will of Pace, </em>400 N.Y.S.2d 488 (Sur.Ct. 1977) held that a testatrix\u2019s direction to level her property was clearly destructive, produced no benefit to offset the waste of the asset, was purely capricious in that the testatrix\u2019s wish was not something she would have done while alive, and would not be upheld because the result would be absurd and abhorrent to public policy. <em>Id. </em>at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The razing of a home in <em>Eyerman v. Mercantile Trust Co., </em>524 S.W.2d 210 (Mo.Ct.App. 1975) was also held to violate public policy in that it was \"senseless destruction serving no apparent good purpose....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. The case cited the <em>Restatement\u2019s </em>examples of capricious purposes \u2014 the testator who directed that his money be thrown into the sea and the testatrix who ordered her home boarded up for 20 years. <em>Id. </em>at 216. The dissent stated acidly that the majority had allowed \"wispy public policy\u201d and \"aesthetic sympathies\u201d to interfere with legal judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 218. <em>In re Estate of Coleman, 317 </em>A.2d 631 (Pa. 1974) held that the testator\u2019s direction that all trustee successors be Protestant was a personal vagary and unrelated to the proper trust purpose. \"I Judicial significance need not attach to all manifestations of a settlor\u2019s whimsy ... and not every notion of a settlor is entitled to judicial vindication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 634.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">.
