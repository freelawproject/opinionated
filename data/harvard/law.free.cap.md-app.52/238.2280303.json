J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATS\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u2014 <em>THE ISSUE </em>\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The important question put to us by the State in the instant case is whether the State Prosecutor possesses the power to obtain a wiretap order so as to intercept telephone messages between persons suspected of bribery. If the answer to the interrogatory is in the affirmative, we will be required to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County and remand the case for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Should the State Prosecutor be excluded from the narrowly restricted class of persons permitted to apply for and obtain wiretap orders, Thomas M. McGhee, the appellee, his culpability, if any, notwithstanding, will walk away untried, much less unconvicted. This is so because the illegally-gathered evidence must be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\u2014 <em>THE FACTUAL PREDICATE \u2014</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">The attempted bribery of Annapolis Police Officers, Sgt. Russell Hall and Det. William Powell, led Chief John C. Schmitt to seek the assistance of the Maryland State Police. The involvement of the State Police, and particularly Sgt. Peter F. Edge, led to the party Edge considered to be the most likely to furnish legal guidance and ultimate prosecution, the State Prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">Using a \"body wire,\u201d the police recorded incriminating statements made by Richard E. Lomax. Unfortunately, efforts to learn from Lomax the identity of the \"Boss man\u201d fell short of the mark. Apparently because the \"body wire\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>failed to produce the desired result, the State Prosecutor made an application for an order sanctioning a wiretap on certain listed telephones. The application was supported by the affidavit of Sgt. Edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The substantive sufficiency of the affidavit or application is not under attack, and no useful purpose will be served by detailing the allegations contained in the application or the affidavit. It is enough to know that the warrant and documents in support thereof were legally sufficient if the State Prosecutor is a proper person to obtain a wiretap order.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">As a result of the information obtained through the \"body wire\u201d and the ultimate telephone \"taps,\u201d the appellee and 10 other defendants were charged in a 17-count indictment including nine counts of bribery, one count of conspiracy to violate the bribery laws, one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of conspiracy to obstruct justice, one count of misconduct in office, one count of possession of lottery paraphernalia, one count of keeping a place for operation of a lottery, and one count of conspiracy to violate lottery laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The appellee moved, pursuant to Md. Rule 736, to suppress the evidence obtained \"as a result of an illegal search and seizure and the use of a wiretap and electronic eavesdropping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Following a hearing, the judge granted the motion to suppress the wiretap evidence and also granted appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">\u2014 <em>THE LAW \u2014</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Before the creation of the office of the State Prosecutor there was no single prosecutorial official cloaked with the authority to initiate and conduct multi-county investigations into criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">State\u2019s Attorneys, historically, have been limited in their powers to the prosecution of crimes perpetrated within the territorial confines of the particular county, or the City of Baltimore, that the State\u2019s Attorney is elected to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The Attorney General of the State, even though a State-wide official, is subject to severe constitutional restrictions as far as criminal investigations are concerned. The State Constitution, Article V, \u00a7 3, limits the Attorney General\u2019s venture into criminal investigations to two instances: 1) when he has been directed by an act of the General Assembly or a joint resolution of that body to conduct such an investigation; 2) when ordered by the Governor to conduct the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Recognizing that some prosecutorial arm with State-wide power was needed, the Executive and Legislative Branches of Government submitted to the voters of Maryland a Constitutional Amendment \"clarifying the authority and duties of the Attorney General.\u201d Laws 1976, Ch. 545. The voters adopted the amendment at the General Election of November 2, 1976.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Laws 1976, Ch. 612, enacted in anticipation of the favorable voter reaction to the clarification of the authority of the Attorney General,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> now codified as Md. Ann. Code art. 10, \u00a7 33A-33F, set out with particularity the qualifications, duties, appointment, and removability of the State Prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Md. Ann. Code art. 10, \u00a7 33B (a) conferred upon the State Prosecutor, <em>inter alia, </em>the following \"duties, powers, and responsibilities ...[:]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">(b) ... Except with respect to offenses alleged to be committed by himself or members of his staff, he may, on his own initiative, or at the request of the Governor, the Attorney General, the General Assembly, The State Ethics Commission, or a State\u2019s attorney, investigate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">(1) Criminal offenses under the State election laws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>(2) Criminal offenses under the State Public Ethics Law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-5\">(3) Violations of the State bribery laws in which an official or employee of the State or of a political subdivision of the State or of any bicounty or multicounty agency of the State was the offeror or offeree, or intended offeror or offeree, of a bribe;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">(4) Offenses constituting criminal malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office committed by an officer or employee of the State or of a political subdivision of the State or of any bicounty or multicounty agency of the State.

At the request of either the Governor, Attorney General, General Assembly or a State\u2019s attorney, the State Prosecutor may investigate criminal activity conducted or committed partly in this State and partly in another jurisdiction, or which is conducted or committed in more than one political subdivision of the State.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Pursuant to the provisions of Md. Ann. Code art. 10, \u00a7 33B (c), Governor Harry Hughes, on July 13, 1981, directed the State Prosecutor to investigate \"allegations of bribery related to the payment of monies to members of the Annapolis City Police Department, which payments were allegedly made for the purpose of protecting participants in a multi-jurisdictional illegal lottery operation being conducted between Baltimore City, Maryland and Annapolis City, Anne Arundel County, Maryland.\u201d Patently, the alleged offenses, because of their multi-political sub-divisional nature, fell within the ambit of the State Prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Ten days after the Governor had directed that the State Prosecutor investigate the matter, the State Prosecutor presented to a judge of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, an application for a wiretap order. The application recited in part that the State Prosecutor had \"authority to make this Application for an Ex Parte Order authorizing a Wiretap pursuant to Article 10, Section 33B (g) of the Annotated Code of Maryland.. . .\u201d Whether the State Prosecutor actually had that authority is the precise issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We observe that before the General Assembly enacted the present wiretap and electronic surveillance law, Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 10-401 \u2014 10-413, wiretaps in Maryland were governed by three distinct statutes, one federal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and two State.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>State v. Siegel, </em>13 Md. App. 444, 285 A.2d 671, <em>aff'd, </em>266 Md. 256, 292 A.2d 86 (1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The current Maryland Wiretap Law tracks the federal act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We look then to the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 for guidance in interpreting Maryland law, when the Court of Appeals or this Court has not heretofore addressed the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The United States Code, <em>Congressional and Administrative News, </em>90th Congress, Second Session (1968), Vol. 2, Legislative History, p. 2187, in speaking of the proposed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 (2), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b267-7\">\"No application [for wiretap or electronic surveillance orders] may be authorized unless a specific State statute permits it. The State statute must meet the minimum standards reflected as a whole in the proposed chapter. The proposed provision envisions that States would be free to adopt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>more restrictive <footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark> legislation, or no legislation at all, but not less restrictive legislation. State legislation enacted in conformity with this chapter should specifically designate the principal prosecuting attorneys empowered to authorize interceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">\"The principal prosecuting attorney of any State, or the principal prosecuting attorney of any political subdivision thereof, if such attorney is authorized by a statute of that State to make application to a State court judge of competent jurisdiction for an order authorizing or approving the interception of wire or oral communications .. . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">The Maryland statute concerned with the identity of the person authorized to make application for a wiretap order is Courts Art. \u00a7 10-406. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-8\">\"The <em>Attorney General or any State\u2019s attorney </em>may apply to a judge of competent jurisdiction, and the judge, in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 10-408 of this article, may grant an order authorizing the interception of wire or oral communications by investigative or law enforcement officers when the interception may provide or has provided evidence of the commission of the offense of murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, bribery, extortion, or dealing in controlled dangerous substances, or any conspiracy to commit any of the foregoing offenses. No application or order shall be required if the interception is lawful under the provisions of \u00a7 10-402 (c) of this subtitle.\u201d (emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The argument in support of the hearing judge\u2019s action in dismissing the indictment is that the State Prosecutor is neither the Attorney General nor a State\u2019s Attorney. Hence, using that reasoning, the State Prosecutor was without authority to seek a wiretap order, any order granted to him is a nullity, and the evidence gleaned by and through such an order is inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">While it may be argued that the State Prosecutor is the \"principal prosecuting attorney\u201d for the purpose of investigating \"[v]iolations of the State bribery laws,\u201d Md. Ann. Code art. 10, \u00a7 33B (b) (3), the State Prosecutor is neither the Attorney General nor a State\u2019s Attorney. The State legislation, Courts Art. \u00a7 10-406, enacted in conformity with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, does not \"specifically designate\u201d the State Prosecutor as an attorney \"empowered to authorize interceptions.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">We think, therefore, that Judge Wolff was correct in dismissing the indictment against the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing indictment af\u00f1rmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Anne Arundel County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\">.
