J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AEo\">delivered the opinion of the Court. Lerner, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">We herein extend the ambit of <em>Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. 359, 424 A.2d 755 (1981) and declare that the proceedings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>in the Circuit Court for Cecil County amounted to the \"functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Ergo, </em>because the plea did not comply with Md. Rule 731 c, we shall reverse the judgments of the trial court and remand the matter for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The factual setting from which this case arose is unique. Christopher Duran Yanes, appellant, appeared in the circuit court where he was charged with \"attempted\u201d forgery,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \"attempted\u201d causing to be forged,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> attempted uttering,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> breaking and entering a storehouse with intent to steal goods of a value of $300 or more,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> breaking a storehouse with intent to steal goods of $5.00 or more,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> theft of property of a value of $300 or more,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> theft of property having a value of less than $300,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and being a rogue and vagabond.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The appellant\u2019s attorney <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> informed the trial judge that a \"plea bargain\u201d had been made with the State. The appellant\u2019s attorney then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-7\">\"The plea bargain is as follows: The State is making the offer that they would permit the entry and submission of facts stated to the Court under a count of breaking and entering. A sentence on breaking and entering would not exceed the ten years; in other words, the maximum he could receive on breaking and entering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Counsel went on to explain that the forgery charge</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">\"would be submitted to the Court ... fon a statement of facts as to] one count.. .. And the punishment is not less than two years and not more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>than ten years for that. And . .. the . .. [appellant] would be responsible for restitution in all of the various matters in which he is charged, although the statements [of facts] are being submitted on two counts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The trial judge inquired whether \"[t]hese are guilty pleas....\u201d Defense counsel responded, \"Submit an agreed statement of facts. It is essentially that, yes, sir. . . . We would elect a trial by this Court without a jury and submit a statement to the Court concerning the factual basis for these charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Thereafter, the judge made certain inquiries of the appellant as to the appellant\u2019s understanding that the matter would be submitted to the judge on an agreed statement of facts, and \"based on those facts,\u201d the judge would determine whether the appellant was guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Appellant\u2019s trial attorney then entered the following \"stipulation:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-8\">\"On the 2nd day of July, 1981, at the premises which belong to Society Chabert Duval, Limited, which is a corporate entity, the premises is located 555 Blue Ball Road, Elkton, Maryland, which is in Cecil County. During the early morning hours, Christopher Yanes, who is, in fact, before the Court this morning, approached the premises. He actually did break into the premises by breaking the handle off a side door in the building and he entered the building with the intent to take property belonging to Society Chabert Duval, having a value of greater than $300.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-9\">After breaking in, in fact, property was taken from the premises. That was the property of the victim corporation. The property was taken without the permission of the corporation removed from the premises with the intent to permanently deprive the owner thereof of the property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">A second \"stipulation\u201d read into the record was that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\"Later on during the daytime hours of the second day of July of 1981, at the premises of the A &amp; P market in Elkton, Maryland, the Defendant, who is in fact, before the Court this morning, Christopher Yanes, did appear to one of the employees of the A &amp; P market and he had in his possession a check which was drawn on the account of Society Chabert Duval, Limited. That account was with the First National Bank of Maryland. The check had been made out with an amount that was not correct and not authorized by the owner of that particular account. Again, the victim, Society Chabert Duval, Society Chabert Duval, Limited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">The Defendant, Mr. Yanes, knowing that the document was incorrect and that false writings were upon it, did try to pass, utter and offer that document to the employee of the A &amp; P market in return get goods or cash therefore [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">The document did, in fact, bear false, incorrect information on it and it was, in fact, Mr. Yanes who attempted to offer the document to A &amp; P market and attempted to gain cash or other goods as a result of offering or uttering the document.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Following each recital of facts, appellant admitted that the statements were true. In addition, appellant agreed to incorporate a list of stolen items into the \"stipulation\u201d and further agreed that he would pay for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Having made a full and complete in-court confession, appellant should not then have been surprised when the trial judge handed down verdicts of guilty as to both counts to which appellant had, through his counsel, \"stipulated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The appellant was sentenced to concurrent ten year terms, with the last year of each term \"suspended,\u201d and the direction that appellant be \"placed upon five years probation to begin upon his release on parole, upon the condition that he make restitution in the amount of $1,601.92, plus some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>other damage to the building doors or something additional.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">On appeal to this Court, the appellant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\"I. The matter was submitted below on 'the functional equivalent of a guilty plea\u2019 without compliance with Maryland Rule 731 c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">II. The indictment did not allege an intent to defraud and thus did not allege the commission of a crime</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">III. The docket entries and commitment papers are erroneous and the amount of restitution is in error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The \"new specie of plea\u201d that we have observed to be one occurring with increasing frequency, <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>37 Md. App. 635, 636, 378 A.2d 209, 210 (1977), is the \"not guilty upon an agreed statement of facts.\u201d That \"hybrid plea\u201d finds no support in the Md. Rules relative to criminal causes. Indeed, the plea is one of expediency and ofttimes is employed as a \"back handed\u201d plea of guilty. In <em>Stevenson, </em>37 Md. App. at 637, 378 A.2d at 210, n. 5, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">\"There is a variety of reasons why counsel use such a plea, <em>e.g., </em>it is less time consuming than a plea of guilty, minimizes post conviction attack on counsel, and provides the possibility that if an essential element of a charged offense is omitted from the statement that the 'evidence\u2019 will be insufficient to convict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-12\">We paraphrase Chief Justice Warren in <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 472, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1174, 22 L.Ed.2d 418, 428-29 (1969), and opine that we do not think it is too much of an imposition upon trial judges, before sentencing defendants to lengthy terms of imprisonment, to take a few minutes to inform the defendants of their rights and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>determine, on the record, that the defendants understand those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">If counsel attempts to use the plea as the functional equivalent of a guilty plea, the trial judge should make absolutely certain that there is compliance with Md. Rule 731 c. That rule mandates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">\"The court may not accept a plea of guilty without first questioning the defendant on the record to determine that the plea is made voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. The court may accept the plea of guilty even though the defendant does not admit that he is in fact guilty if the court is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea. If the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">A plea of guilty, if accepted by the trial court, leaves nothing to be done but the imposition of sentence. <em>Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. at 364, 424 A.2d at 758 (1981); <em>Stevenson v. State, </em>37 Md. App. at 637-38, 378 A.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\"><em>Sutton </em>dealt with a plea that \"was entered at the direction of the trial court\u201d and the Court of Appeals held that under the \"particular circumstances, the petitioner\u2019s plea was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.\u201d 289 Md. at 366, 424 A.2d at 759. <em>Sutton </em>differs from the matter <em>subjudice </em>in that the trial court did not direct the entry of the plea. Nevertheless, the \"plea of not guilty on an agreed statement of facts,\u201d as employed by trial counsel for the appellant, cannot, under the particular circumstances, be construed as anything short of a plea of guilty, irrespective of what counsel chose to call it. A mutt called \"Duke\u201d is not <em>ipso facto </em>noble. One must look to performance, and the performance in the case is that the appellant\u2019s not guilty on an agreed statement of facts was a judicial confession. How any trier of fact could have arrived, after hearing defense counsel\u2019s narration, at any verdict except one of guilt defies the imagination.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Turning briefly to the second issue raised by the appellant, we observe that the indictment read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\"CHRISTOPHER DURAN YANES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">on the said day, in the said year, at the County, aforesaid, <em>with intent </em>then and there <em>to defraud, </em>feloniously did attempt to utter and publish as true a certain false, forged, altered and counterfeited ......certain Chesks [sic] (emphasis supplied.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">We think appellant\u2019s attack on the indictment to be no more than \"whistling in the wind.\u201d It is devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Appellant\u2019s third issue shall not be addressed inasmuch as the reversal of this case will <em>ipso facto </em>cure that defect.</p>\n<p id=\"Aba\">Lerner, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\n<em>Case remanded for trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Cecil County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-10\">.
