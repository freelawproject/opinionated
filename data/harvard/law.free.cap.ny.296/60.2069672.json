In such circumstances, section 603 of the Civil Practice Act requires us to presume that the contrary is the fact. The appeals must therefore be dismissed, without costs on the ground that the question of law certified is not decisive of the correctness of the order appealed from (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 589, subd. 3, cl. [b] <em>Braunworth </em>v. <em>Braunworth, </em>285 N.
