The offense charged against petitioners occurred on August 5,1946, when Federal price control regulations were in force and hence the War Emergency Court of the City Magistrates\u2019 Courts is vested, with jurisdiction of the charge. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>295 N.

In this proceeding to obtain an order in the nature of prohibition against the War Emergency Court, petitioners urge that Local Law No. 34 of the Laws of 1945, which enacted the section of the Administrative Code of the City of New York which they are charged with having violated, had expired on June 30, 1946, and was not in effect on .the day the offense was alleged to' have been committed. This question turned upon a construction of the local law. In our view, the Magistrate was not without jurisdiction to determine that question and to dismiss the proceeding or proceed with the trial accordingly. The .aggrieved party by the ordinary process of appeal may secure adequate relief from error, if such error should develop (cf. <em>People ex rel. Hummel </em>v. <em>Trial Term, </em>184 N. Y. 30; <em>People ex rel. Ballin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>184 N. Y. 96). Solely on the ground that an order in the nature of prohibition is not available to petitioners, the determination of the courts below denying the application is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Loughran, Ch.
