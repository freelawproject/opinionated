Since the order appealed from did not direct a new hearing on the merits, the appellants could not. appeal as of right by stipulation for order absolute. Moreover, all of the charges having been sustained, such a stipulation, even if authorized, would be contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>to public policy. <em>(Matter of Bolani </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>271 App. Div. 850; <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>240 N.

In a proceeding brought to review that determination, the Appellate Division, though sustaining the charges, annulled the determination and remitted the proceeding to the Liquor Authority to receive certain additional evidence, excluded at the hearing, which, in the opinion of the Appellate Division, was relevant \u20186 in mitigation of the of\u00edense and in consideration of the penalty to be imposed.\u201d The Liquor Authority has appealed to this court by permission of the Appellate Division, without filing a stipulation for order absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The appeal must be dismissed. Though the new hearing ordered by the Appellate Division was limited to the issue of the penalty to be imposed, its order was nonetheless an order granting a new hearing from which an appeal lies only upon the filing of a stipulation for order absolute, as provided in the Constitution <em>(N. </em>Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 7) and in the Civil Practice Act (\u00a7 588, subd. 3). (Cf. <em>Mundt </em>v. <em>Glokner, </em>160 N. Y. 571; <em>Flagg </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>248 N.
