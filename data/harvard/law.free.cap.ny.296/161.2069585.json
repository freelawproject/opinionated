The appeal taken by the police commissioner should have been dismissed because he was not an aggrieved party. <em>(Hooper </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>109 N. Y. 609.) II.

The police commissioner was aggrieved by the order at Special Term and his appeal to the Appellate Division was proper. <em>(Matter of Electrolux Corp., </em>286 N.

The evidence overwhelmingly supports findings to the effect that petitioner was using his telephone to a large extent for unlawful activities in violation of Penal Laws (\u00a7\u00a7 986, 991) and to further illegal gambling operations. Defendants\u2019 refusal to approve the restoration of or to restore telephone service under such circumstances was fully justified. <em>(Pocket Books, Inc., </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>292 N.

On the undisputed facts petitioner\u2019s use of his telephone was for activities in violation of the Penal Law and he has no clear legal right to compel the furnishing of telephone service to.be so used. <em>(Matter of Leitner </em>v. <em>New York Telephone Co., </em>277 N.

The determination by the Appellate Division that respondent police commissioner was entitled to a final order dismissing the petition as against him on the merits furnishes no ground for reversal. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Manufacturers Trust Co., </em>278 N.

Under the circumstances of this case, there was no warrant for compelling the telephone company to reinstate its service for petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">In our view, however \u2014 though the Police Commissioner may have a deep and real interest in law enforcement \u2014 neither he nor any other law enforcement agent may, by reason thereof, be regarded as an indispensable, necessary or proper party or one permitted to intervene in a proceeding such as the present (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7\u00a7 193, 193-b, 211).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Neither the Police Commissioner nor the Police Department is given any authority by statute to pass upon or regulate applications for telephone service, or to require a telephone company to withhold or discontinue its service. Approval of the commissioner is not a statutory condition precedent to the granting of the relief sought by appellant, and there is no warrant or need for any direction to him in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Whether or no service should be terminated or discontinued, is a decision that must be made by the telephone com-, pony. That power \u2014 as well as duty \u2014 rests with' the public utility, and it may not delegate the one or avoid the other. True, the company is free to consult with the Police Department or with- any other law enforcement agency, and may be guided in its action by the advice received. But whether the action is justified or warranted must be determined by the telephone company upon the facts presented. That being so, the telephone company is the only indispensable, necessary or proper party in a proceeding such as that before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The order should be affirmed, with costs to the respondent New York Telephone Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">Loughban, Ch. J., Lewis, Desmond, Thacheb, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concurConway, J., taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">Order affirmed, etc, [See 296 N. Y. 857.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
