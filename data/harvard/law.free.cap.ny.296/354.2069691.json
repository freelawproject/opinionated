Y. 469; <em>Matter of Kane </em>v. <em>Necci, </em>269 N. Y. 13; <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>270 N. Y. 188; <em>Matter of Drake </em>v. <em>Horan, </em>173 Misc. 424; <em>Hodson </em>v. <em>Hoff, </em>291 N. Y. 518; <em>People </em>v. <em>Geffin, </em>245 N. Y. 75; <em>People </em>v. <em>De Laney, </em>244 N. Y. 529; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, </em>137 App. Div. 763.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b397-5\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">Charging that defendant was the father of her child, complainant instituted filiation proceedings against him, pursuant to the Domestic Relations Law and the Children\u2019s Court Act (L. 1922, ch. 547, as amd.), in the Children\u2019s Court of Ulster County. An order was entered adjudging defendant to be the father and-directing him to pay $5 a week for the child\u2019s support. Upon appeal to the Appellate Division, that court affirmed, one justice dissenting on the ground that certain evidence had been improperly rejected. From that nonunanimous affirmance, defendant has appealed to this court without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Contrary to defendant\u2019s assumption, the appeal does not lie as of right; accordingly, it must be dismissed. That being so, it becomes pertinent to inquire whether leave to appeal must be obtained from a court or from a judge \u2014 whether the appeal is controlled by provisions applicable to civil or criminal proceedings, by Civil Practice Act or Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">A filiation proceeding initiated \u2014 as the present was \u2014 in a children\u2019s court, pursuant to the Domestic Relations Law, is civil and noncriminal in nature. Confirmation is furnished by the definition of a \u201c crime \u201d as well as by the inherent character of a criminal prosecution (Penal Law, \u00a7 2; see, also, <em>Hodson </em>v. <em>Hoff, </em>291 N. Y. 518). Although we have held that a paternity suit is criminal in form <em>(Commissioner of Public Welfare </em>v. <em>Simon, </em>270 N. Y. 188, 191; <em>Hodson </em>v. <em>Hoff, supra), </em>it must he observed that such statements were made, such rulings announced, in cases brought in the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Sessions of the City of New York tinder the Inferior Criminal Courts Act \u2014 now known as the New York City Criminal Courts Act (L. 1910, ch. 659, as amd.) \u2014and were regulated by the Code of Criminal Procedure. Civil in essence, the proceeding assumes a \u201c criminal \u201d form from its surroundings\u2014 from the fact that it is tried in a court of criminal jurisdiction. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>260 N. Y. 171.) The <em>Lewis </em>case is illuminative. We there held that, while a juvenile delinquency proceeding commenced, in a children\u2019s court under the Children\u2019s Court Act is noncriminal, it is to be regarded as <em>\u201c </em>criminal \u201d if instituted in a tribunal vested with \u201c criminal jurisdiction\u201d \u2014 such as, for example, the Buffalo City Court or the New York City Special Sessions Court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>pp. 174-176, 177, 178; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>244 N. Y. 307, 309-311.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">It follows from what we have said that, while a defendant would be required to procure permission from a judge \u2014 in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u00a7 520, subd. 3) \u2014if the filiation proceeding were tried in a court of criminal jurisdiction, defendant in the present case was called upon to obtain leave from the Appellate Division\u2014 in compliance with the Civil Practice Act (\u00a7 589, subd. 1, cl. [b]) \u2014 because the proceeding had originated in the children\u2019s court. The circumstance that it was the county judge who presided does not render the children\u2019s court a county court, or a part thereof \u2014 in which case there could be an appeal as of right (Civ. Prac. Act, \u00a7 588, subd. 1, cl. [b]) \u2014 for, in Ulster County, the Children\u2019s Court was established, under Constitution and by statute, as a separate and distinct tribunal. (N. Y. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 18; Children\u2019s Court Act, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The appeal should be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Loughkan, Ch. J., Lewis, Conway, Desmond, Thacher and Dye, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
