The defendant contends that such a conclusion is in conflict with <em>People </em>v. <em>Lindloff </em>(259 App. Div. 749). We do not think the statute can be so narrowly construed as to exclude from its terms the indecent treatment to which the child was subjected in this case, and if the decision in the <em>Lindloff </em>case <em>(supra) </em>is to the contrary we disapprove it. The defendant in this ease was also charged in the third and fourth counts with assault in the third degree. These counts were sufficient and were amply sustained by the evidence <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>232 N. Y. 458).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The first count of the information charged a violation of subdivision 1- of section 483 of the Penal Law alleging that the defendant caused the morals of the child \u2018 \u2018 to become depraved \u2019 \u2019. There was no evidence that the child\u2019s morals actually did become depraved, and accordingly the evidence was not sufficient to warrant conviction under this count <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>20App. Div. 438). The sentence was authorized and there is no reason for remitting the case to Special Sessions for review thereof (Correction Law, \u00a7 203, subds. [a], [b]).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Lotjghban, Oh.
