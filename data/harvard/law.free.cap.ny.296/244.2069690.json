The agreement to \u201c reduce \u201d the $500,000 trust under article seventh of the will to $400,000 was void as ag\u00e1inst public policy. <em>(Matter of Wentworth, </em>190 App. Div. 829, 230 N.

Investment in 1937 in railroad bonds which did not meet the test contained in subdivision 7 of section 235 (formerly \u00a7 239) of the Banking Law were investments in nonlegal securities notwithstanding the fact that such bonds could and did meet the test contained in subdivision 7-a of that law as it existed in 1937. (L. 1938, chs. 352, 356; <em>Hassett </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>303 U. S. 303; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co., </em>144 Misc. 53, 237 App. Div. 334, 262 N. Y. 575; <em>People ex rel.

The 1937 decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court was conclusive on all the parties herein and may not be the subject of collateral attack. <em>(Herring </em>v. <em>N. Y. L. E. &amp; W. R. R.

The \u00e1greement of all interested parties, followed by the 1937 decree made in conformity therewith, was not in contravention of Personal Property Law, section 15, or Real Property Law, sections 103, 105, and void as against public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>as constituting a partial destruction of'the trust. <em>(Matter of Rogers, </em>153 <em>N. </em>Y. 316; <em>Matter of Kohler, </em>231 N.

All railroad securities involved were \u201c leg\u00e1is \u201d and the appellants having stipulated that the' trustee was not negligent in the acquisition, retention or disposition if such securities were leg\u00e1is \u201d, the objections thereto cannot be sustained. <em>(Mills </em>v. <em>Bluestein, </em>275 N. Y. 317; <em>Matter of Smith, </em>279 N. Y. 479.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AuU\">Though the compromise agreement of January 7,1937, was made in violation of section 15 of the Personal Property Law and section 103 of the Real Property Law, the Surrogate\u2019s decree of January 14, 1937, approving that agreement was nevertheless a conclusive adjudication of the validity thereof. The decree of January 14, 1937, was consented to by all parties in interest and no appeal therefrom was ever taken. Hence that decree was not open to the collateral attack that was made upon it by the appellants in this independent proceeding. (See <em>Crouse </em>v. <em>McVickar, </em>207 N. Y. 213, 217; <em>Schacht </em>v. <em>Schacht, </em>295 N. Y. 439; 1 Freeman on Judgments [5th ed.], \u00a7 357.) <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Cruger </em>(80 N. Y. 15) is not authority for a contrary view. The determination that was under attack in the <em>Douglas </em>case was an order which had none of the attributes of a final adjudication. The relevant distinction is pointed out in <em>Bannon </em>v. <em>Bannon </em>(270 <em>N. </em>Y. 484). (See 2 Freeman on Judgments [5th ed.], \u00a7 667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">We think the Appellate Division was right in its refusal to surcharge the trustee for the losses that resulted from the acquisition or retention of the railroad bonds in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The challenge to the allowances that were awarded to the referee and to the special guardian does not present any question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">The order should be affirmed, with costs to the respondent, payable out of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Loughran, Oh. J., Conway, Desmond, Thaoher, Dye and Fuld, JJ., concur; Lewis, J., taking no park</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
