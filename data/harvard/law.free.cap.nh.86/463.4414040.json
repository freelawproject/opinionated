H. 71; Beale, \u201cThe Status of the Child and the Conflict of Laws,\u201d 1 U. Chi. Law Rev., 13, 26, and cases cited. Moreover, upon proof that a custodian is unfit, \u201cthe child may be taken from him and be given to another person by the courts of any state into which the child may have come.\u201d <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>83 N. H. 413, 415. See also <em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Cowles, </em>80 N. H. 530, 532; <em>White </em>v. <em>White, </em>77 N. H. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Different courts not infrequently hold different views as to what constitutes fitness for guardianship and what best conserves the interests of a child, and though the facts upon which an award of custody is based are so far <em>res adjud\u00edcala </em>that they cannot be reexamined in another jurisdiction, \u201cthis estoppel extends only to conditions which existed at the time of the original decree.\u201d 1 U. Chi. Law Rev. 24. Changed circumstances make new or modified orders necessary, and it is significant that the superior court has twice changed the original order of custody in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u201cThe utmost which is asserted for the extraterritorial effect of such orders is that they should, in the exercise of the customary comity of States and nations, be recognized and enforced ... so long, and only so long, as the circumstances attending their adoption remain unchanged ... As a finding of changed conditions is one easily made when a court is so inclined, and plausible grounds therefor can quite generally be found, it follows that the recognition extraterritorially which custody orders will receive or can command is hable to be more theoretical than of great practical consequence.\u201d <em>Morrill </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>83 Conn. 479, 492, 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The fact that the libelee has already attempted to take her son to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>France without leave of court cannot but cast doubt upon her professed willingness to conform to such terms and conditions as the court may now impose. The libelant\u2019s right to have access to his son is an important right <em>(Butler </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>83 N. H. 413, 416), and should not be jeopardized except for reasons touching the welfare of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">On the reported facts the motion should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-7\">Branch, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
