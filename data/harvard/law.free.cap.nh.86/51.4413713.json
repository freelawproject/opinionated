J.</author>\n<p id=\"AV\">A payment in advance for the aid furnished would have been a legal transaction supported by a sufficient consideration. <em>Amazeen </em>v. <em>New Castle, </em>76 N. H. 250; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>78 N. H. 108. It is not perceived why a promise to repay in the future is not equally valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">The contention that the wife\u2019s promise is void as an undertaking on behalf of her husband (P. L., c. 288, <em>s. </em>2) mistakes the nature of the transaction. It was an original undertaking by both, entered into to obtain family support. The wife may bind herself by such a promise. <em>White Mountain National Bank </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>81 N. H. 285, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">No question has been made of the propriety of an action by the overseer of the poor in his official capacity rather than in the name of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-16\">The plaintiff is entitled to recover against both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-18\">All concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-19\">MEMORANDUM.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-20\">Mr. Justice Snow, having attained the age of seventy years on October 19, 1932, retired under the constitutional limitation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
