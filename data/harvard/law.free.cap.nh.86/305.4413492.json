Such is not the law in this jurisdiction. \u201cIn so far as the approaches to the premises are concerned, it is his [the landlord\u2019s] duty to do whatever the ordinary man would do to enable them [his tenants] to enter and leave the premises in safety.\u201d <em>Young, </em>J., in <em>Kambour </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>77 N. H. 33, 46; <em>Gobrecht </em>v. <em>Beckwith, </em>82 N. H. 415, 418. Cases illustrative of this principle are <em>Saad </em>v. <em>Papageorge, </em>82 N. H. 294; <em>Burette </em>v. <em>Pienkofski, </em>84 N. H. 200; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Resnik, </em>85 N. H. 413; <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Company, ante, </em>127. In <em>Gobrecht </em>v. <em>Beckwith, supra, </em>the defendant was specifically held liable for a defective type of construction, and structural defects were in part made the basis of liability in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Resnik, supra </em>and <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Company, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">In regard to the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the iron railing was defective and insufficient, the case of <em>Saad </em>v. <em>Papageorge, supra, </em>is decisive. \u201cThe construction of the stairway was such that its use by very young children as a stairway might be found to be contemplated, and so some protection for use for that purpose would be required. The duty of care may therefore be found to be owing . . . . \u201d <em>lb., </em>296.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">In regard to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of negligence in the construction of the piazza roof, this case is governed by the decision in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Resnik, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">\n<em>Judgments on the verdicts.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b334-11\">Woodbury, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
