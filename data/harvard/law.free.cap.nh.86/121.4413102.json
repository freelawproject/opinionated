She approached Spruce street from Fifth avenue lane and before crossing the street looked west. To quote her own words, the defendant\u2019s car was then two or three \u201cstores or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>doors\u201d away (a distance of about ninety-five feet), and she considered this to be \u201cfar\u201d away. After starting to cross the street she looked to the east, and was struck by the automobile at a point about sixteen feet from the southeasterly curb. According to Bureau\u2019s testimony his speed did not exceed fifteen miles an hour. With due allowance for the plaintiff\u2019s age <em>(Charbonneau </em>v. <em>MacRury, </em>84 N. H. 501, 507, 508, and cases cited), it cannot be said as a matter of law that she was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The jury were not obliged to accept Bureau\u2019s statement that a truck blocked his view of the intersection and that the plaintiff \u201cwith her head turned back\u201d toward another girl, who was chasing her, \u201cran right into the car.\u201d On his own admission he did not see the corner and could not have avoided hitting an automobile if one \u201chad come out of that lane suddenly.\u201d He could not remember that he sounded his horn as he approached the intersection, and there was evidence that he did not do so. His attention was centered on finding a place to park his car, and the jury were entitled to find that he was heedless of other matters. The motions for a nonsuit and directed verdict were properly denied. <em>Gosselin </em>v. <em>Lemay, </em>85 N. H. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Spruce street and Fifth avenue lane are public highways. The court denied the following request for instructions: \u201cThe defendant did not owe the plaintiff the duty of blowing his horn as he approached Fifth Avenue Lane until he had notice she was going out into Spruce Street.\u201d Such an instruction would have constituted error. If the jury believed Bureau\u2019s testimony, the plaintiff did not attempt to cross Spruce street until Bureau had reached the corner. Section 10 of chapter 103 of the Public Laws provides that \u201cUpon approaching any intersecting way or a curve or corner in a way, every person operating a motor vehicle shall slow down and give timely signal with his bell,' horn or other device for signaling.\u201d Assuming that Bureau\u2019s account of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct was correct, compliance with this statutory requirement on his part might have prevented the accident. The jury were instructed, without exception, in accordance with P. L., <em>c. </em>103, <em>s. </em>13, requiring the driver of a motor car to give \u201ctimely signal\u201d upon approaching \u201ca pedestrian who is upon a traveled part of a highway and not upon a sidewalk.\u201d Certainly the defendant was not prejudiced by this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">But defendant\u2019s counsel state that the intended meaning of the request was that if the plaintiff saw the defendant\u2019s car, no duty devolved upon the driver to warn her of his approach. The language of the request is not fairly susceptible of such a construction. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>even if it were, the law would be incorrectly stated. It was the driver\u2019s duty to obey the statute, and the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge that the car was approaching, though material on the issue of proximate cause, would not absolve the driver from his statutory duty as a matter of law. <em>Morier </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>81 N. H. 48, 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">At the conclusion of the charge, the defendant excepted to such portion of the charge as allowed the jury \u201cto give damages for future medical expenses\u201d; whereupon the presiding justice said: \u201cThat was under your agreement that the father was going to recover here whatever he is entitled to recover. It is understood by Court and counsel that the father is entitled to recover here in this action under the agreement which was made between counsel earlier in the case, just the same as he would have been if he was here in a separate suit in his own name. That is the agreement?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Defendant\u2019s counsel conceded that there had been such an agreement, and made no further objection. Obviously the exception was waived. Moreover, there was a definite expression of opinion by a physician who testified for the plaintiff that the scars which the plaintiff received constituted \u201ca potential danger to ulceration\u201d and would be a source of trouble to her for a few years.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">All concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
