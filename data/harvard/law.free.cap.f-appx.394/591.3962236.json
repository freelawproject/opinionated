Shar-ma\u2019s convictions stem from events that occurred at the Coleman Federal Correctional Institution where she worked as a corrections officer. Specifically, in 2005, an inmate named John McCullah assaulted his cell mate Richard Delano and Delano subsequently died from his injuries. At trial, the government presented evidence that Sharma and another corrections officer intentionally moved Delano into McCullah\u2019s cell, anticipating that McCullah would assault Delano.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sharma raises three issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">First, Sharma argues that the district court erred by denying her motion for a judgment of acquittal and not finding that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Sharma was the proximate cause of the federal prison inmate\u2019s death. In making this argument, Sharma does not contest her convictions. Instead, she asserts that she should only have been subjected to a maximum ten-year sentence, rather than a life sentence, because the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Delano\u2019s death was a natural and foreseeable consequence of her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for acquittal <em>de novo. United States v. Evans, </em>473 F.3d 1115, 1118 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWhen the motion raises a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the sufficiency of the evidence de novo, drawing all reasonable inferences in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cTo affirm the denial, we need determine only that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">Section 241 of Title 18 of the U.S.Code provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-13\">If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person ... in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-14\">They shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section ... they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241. Furthermore, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242 states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Whoever, under color of any law, ... willfully subjects any person ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, ..., shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if bodily injury results from the acts committed in violation of this section ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and if death results from the acts committed in violation of this section ... shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned for any term of years or for life, or both, or may be sentenced to death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">In <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>589 F.2d 811, 815, 820 (5th Cir.1979),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant, a chief of police, claimed that he was not responsible for the victim\u2019s death because he did not intend the victim\u2019s death. In that case, the defendant took the victim to a deserted gravel road, hit the victim with the butt and the barrel of a loaded shotgun, and claimed that the shotgun accidentally discharged when the victim pushed the gun aside. <em>Id. </em>at 815-16. In interpreting \u00a7 242, our predecessor court held that in order for a defendant to be liable for a resulting death, the government needs to prove \u201cthat death ensued as a proximate result of the accuseds\u2019 willful violation of a victim\u2019s defined rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 820. Moreover, the court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az4\">[ a] fundamental principle of criminal law is that a person is held responsible for all consequences proximately caused by his criminal conduct. Thus, where events are foreseeable and naturally result from one\u2019s criminal conduct, the chain of legal causation is considered unbroken and the perpetrator is held criminally responsible for the resulting harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Consequently, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that \u00a7 242 required that the victim\u2019s death be intentional, because \u201c[n]o matter how you slice it, \u2018if death results\u2019 does not mean \u2018if death was intended.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 821. Thus, \u201cthe more severe punishment prescribed for those Section 242 violations resulting in death is clearly designed to deter the type of conduct that creates an unacceptable risk of loss of life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 821. Accordingly, the court held that the defendant was properly held accountable for the victim\u2019s death because the risk of death resulting from being struck in the stomach with a loaded shotgun was precisely such an unacceptable risk, given that \u201c[ljoaded guns are designed to injure and kill.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">In the present case, drawing all inferences in the government\u2019s favor, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that Sharma\u2019s criminal violations of \u00a7\u00a7 241 and 242 were the proximate cause of Delano\u2019s death. Accordingly, even though McCullah committed the physical murder after Sharma moved Delano to his cell, drawing all inferences in the government\u2019s favor, his criminal act was foreseeable and it did not sever Sharma\u2019s criminal liability. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Second, Sharma argues that the district court plainly erred by failing to find that she was denied a fundamentally fair trial. As part of this argument, Sharma first asserts that the court should have disqualified Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Adams and the entire U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida from participating in her prosecution. Specifically, Sharma contends that it was foreseeable before trial that the government would call Adams as a witness, yet the government still proceeded under the indictment that Adams obtained. Consequently, Sharma concludes that this denied her a fair trial because a lawyer may not serve both as a lawyer and a witness in the same case. Second, Sharma argues that the court denied her a fair trial by failing to find that the government improperly cross-examined Sharma. Specifically, Sharma asserts that the government\u2019s questions on cross-examination that asked her 25 times whether Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent James Raby, Jr., was lying were improper because an attorney cannot ask a witness to comment on the veracity of another witness\u2019s testimony. Third, Sharma argues that it was error for the government to improperly vouch for Adams\u2019s testimony in its closing argument by noting Adams\u2019s 29 years of service with the Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">When a defendant fails to preserve an evidentiary ruling by contemporaneously objecting, our review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1275 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cAbsent a contemporaneous objection, the propriety of the Government\u2019s closing argument and alleged prosecutorial misconduct in improperly vouching for a witness\u2019 credibility are reviewed under a plain error standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Newton, </em>44 F.3d 913, 920 (11th Cir.1995). Under the plain-error standard of review,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV8\">the defendant must show that there is (1) error, (2) that is plain and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-6\"><em>Turner, </em>474 F.3d at 1276 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, where neither the Supreme Court nor our court has addressed an issue, any alleged error cannot be \u201cplain\u201d error. <em>United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">\u201c[T]he cumulative effect of several errors that are harmless by themselves could so prejudice the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial that a new trial might be necessary.\u201d <em>United States v. Preciado-Cordobas, </em>981 F.2d 1206, 1215 n. 8 (11th Cir.1993). \u201cIn addressing a claim of cumulative error, we must examine the trial as a whole to determine whether the appellant was afforded a fundamentally fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1333 (11th Cir.1997). Nevertheless; when a defendant cannot demonstrate any individual errors, \u201cno cumulative errors can exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Waldon, </em>363 F.3d 1103, 1110 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">A. Whether the district court plainly erred by not disqualifying Adams and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">\u201cIt is clear that a prosecutor must not act as both prosecutor and witness.\u201d <em>United States v. Hosford, </em>782 F.2d 936, 938 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cThis is a part of the general \u2018advocate-witness\u2019 rule that counsel should avoid appearing as both advocate and witness except under extraordinary circumstances.\u201d Id.; see <em>also United States v. Crockett, </em>506 F.2d 759, 760 (5th Cir.1975) (\u201cAs a general rule, a party\u2019s attorney should not be called as a witness unless his testimony is both necessary and unobtainable from other sources.\u201d). In general, the Ninth Circuit has stated that \u201c[t]he advocate-witness rule generally ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>mits of only one solution to avoid the improprieties inherent in advocate testimony. Attorneys must elect in which capacity they intend to proceed, either as counsel or as a witness, and promptly withdraw from the conflicting role.\u201d <em>United States v. Prantil, </em>764 F.2d 548, 553 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">While we have not addressed in a published opinion the circumstances of when it might be necessary to disqualify an entire U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office from representing the government, the Tenth Circuit has stated that \u201c[disqualifying the entire [U.S. Attorney\u2019s] office from representing the government raises important separation of powers issues.\u201d <em>United States v. Bolden, </em>353 F.3d 870, 875 (10th Cir.2003). Furthermore, because \u201cthe disqualification of Government counsel is a drastic measure,\u201d the court stated that it could \u201conly rarely-if ever-imagine a scenario in which a district court could properly disqualify an entire United States Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Similarly, the Second Circuit has stated that \u201c[w]hile a private attorney\u2019s conflict of interest may require disqualification of that attorney\u2019s law firm in certain cases, such an approach is not favored when it comes to the office of a United States Attorney, or, a <em>fortiori, </em>to the Department of Justice as a whole.\u201d <em>United States v. Hasarafally, </em>529 F.3d 125, 128 (2d Cir.2008) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Here, we conclude from the record that Sharma has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred by failing to disqualify Adams and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida. In general, Sharma fails to cite any controlling authority to support her assertions of error and, because Adams did not represent the government at trial, the court could hardly disqualify her from participating as counsel. Accordingly, Sharma has failed to show error, much less plain error, in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">B. Whether the district court plainly erred by failing to find that the government engaged in improper cross-examination of Sharma</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Several other circuits have held that, because \u201c[determinations of credibility are for the jury, not for witnesses,\u201d it is an \u201cerror for a prosecutor to induce a witness to testify that another witness, and in particular a government agent, has lied on the stand.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>54 F.3d 868, 871 (D.C.Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, in general, these courts hold that \u201casking one witness whether another is lying is inappropriate.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>471 F.3d 507, 511 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">As both parties concede, neither we nor the Supreme Court has addressed the propriety of counsel asking a witness to comment on another witness\u2019s veracity at trial. Accordingly, because there is no controlling precedent from either this Court or the Supreme Court on the issue, the district court did not plainly err by failing to find that the government\u2019s questions on cross-examination were improper. Accordingly, Sharma has not shown plain error in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">C. Whether the district court plainly erred by failing to find that the government improperly vouched for Adams in its closing argument</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">\u201cAttempts to bolster a witness by vouching for his credibility are normally improper and error.\u201d <em>United States v. Sims, </em>719 F.2d 375, 377 (11th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). In reviewing a defendant\u2019s vouching argument, we examine \u201cwhether (1) the prosecutor placed the prestige of the government behind the witness by making explicit personal assur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>anees of the witness\u2019 credibility, or (2) the prosecutor implicitly vouched for the witness\u2019s credibility by implying that evidence not formally presented to the jury supports the witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>United States v. Arias-Izquierdo, </em>449 F.3d 1168, 1177-78 (11th Cir.2006). We have recognized that, under an exception to the prohibition against vouching called the fair-response rule, a prosecutor can \u201crespond to arguments advanced by defense counsel in his or her statement to the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>590 F.3d 1238, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted, <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. May 18, 2010 (No. 09-10985))).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Sharma has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred when it failed to find that the government vouched for Adams\u2019s testimony. Even assuming that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Adams had worked for the DOJ for 29 years placed the prestige of the government behind Adams\u2019s testimony, this statement would fall under the fair-response rule because the government made the statement in response to Sharma\u2019s closing argument. Accordingly, we conclude that Sharma has failed to demonstrate that the court erred, much less plainly erred, in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Because Sharma has not demonstrated that the district court committed any individual plain errors, she cannot show that cumulative errors deprived her of a fundamentally fair trial. Accordingly, we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Third, Sharma argues that the court erred in applying the sentencing guideline for second-degree murder, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.2, rather than the guideline for involuntary manslaughter, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.4, to calculate Sharma\u2019s base offense level because \u00a7 2A1.2 requires that the government prove that she intended to kill Delano, and the government concedes that she did not intend to kill Delano. Instead, Sharma argues that \u00a7 2A1.4 applies because a mental state of reckless disregard supports a finding of involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s legal interpretation of the statutes and Guidelines de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1186 (11th Cir.2005). Furthermore, \u201c[w]e review a district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts de novo and all factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1297 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">For offenses involving individual rights, to determine a defendant\u2019s base offense level, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Hl.l(a) requires that a district court apply the greatest of several levels, including the offense level from the guideline applicable to any underlying offense. Under \u00a7 2A1.2, the base offense level for second-degree murder is 38. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A1.2. On the other hand, \u00a7 2A1.4 states that for offenses involving involuntary manslaughter, the base offense level is 12 \u201cif the offense involved criminally negligent conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2A1.4(a)(l). But, the base offense level is 18 \u201cif the offense involved reckless conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2A1.4(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">In general, \u201c[mjurder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111(a). While \u201cwillful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing\u201d is murder in the first degree, \u201c[a]ny other murder is murder in the second degree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, malice aforethought is still an essential element of second-degree murder. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Free, </em>574 F.2d 1221, 1222 (5th Cir.1978). To kill with \u201cmalice aforethought\u201d means an intent to take the life of another person either deliberately or in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tentionally, or to willfully act with callous and wanton disregard for human life. 11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions, Offense Instruction 45.3 (2003). Thus, for second-degree murder, the evidence must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant intended to kill the victim or willfully did acts with callous and wanton disregard for the consequences and the Defendant knew the acts would result in a serious risk of death or serious bodily harm to the victim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Conversely, involuntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being without malice \u201c[i]n the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or1 in the commission in an unlawful manner, or without due caution and circumspection, of a lawful act which might produce death.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(a); see <em>also </em>11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions, Offense Instruction 46.2 (2003) (noting that a defendant can be found guilty of involuntary manslaughter if, among other things, the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the death of the victim occurred as a consequence of and while the defendant was engaged in committing an unlawful act not amounting to a felony or in committing a lawful act in an unlawful manner or with wanton and reckless disregard for human life). For involuntary manslaughter,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-6\">the Government need not prove that the Defendant specifically intended to cause the death of the victim, but it must prove more than mere negligence or a failure to use reasonable care by the Defendant; it must, instead, prove gross negligence amounting to \u201cwanton and reckless disregard for human life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions, Offense Instruction 46.2 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Sharma has not demonstrated that the district court erred by applying the guideline for second-degree murder to calculate her base offense level. At trial the government presented sufficient evidence that Sharma knew that there was a great likelihood that McCullah would assault Delano and cause either serious bodily harm or death. Furthermore, Sharma\u2019s unlawful acts amounted to felonies, making involuntary manslaughter guideline inapplicable. Consequently, we conclude that the district court did not err, and we affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">For the above-stated reasons, we affirm Sharma\u2019s convictions and life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-9\">. While collecting food trays, Sharma had an encounter with Delano, who grabbed her arm and pulled it against his cell. This caused an injury to Sharma's arm. Later, Sharma asked her supervisor if Delano could be moved into McCullah's cell. Sharma knew that McCullah was a violent inmate. The government presented evidence at trial that Sharma asked McCullah to kill Delano, and McCullah told Sharma that he was going to kill Delano.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b617-6\">.
