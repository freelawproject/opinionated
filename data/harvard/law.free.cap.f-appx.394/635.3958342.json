Reversible error has been shown; we reverse and remand for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\">Our review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the decision and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r ofSoc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004). Under this limited standard of review, we may not make fact-findings, re-weigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-17\">A person who applies for Social Security disability benefits must prove her disability. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Social Security Regulations outline a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. The ALJ must evaluate (1) whether the claimant engaged in substantial gainful work; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) whether the severe impairment meets or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>equals an impairment in the Listings of Impairments; (4) whether the claimant has the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform her past relevant work; and (5) whether, in the light of the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience, there are other jobs the claimant can perform. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">On appeal, Barrio argues that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, at step four, that she could return to her past relevant work as an assignment clerk is unsupported by substantial evidence, in part, because the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination was unclear.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A claimant\u2019s RFC is \u201cthat which [the claimant] is still able to do despite the limitations caused by ... her impairments.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2004). In making the RFC determination, the ALJ must consider all the record evidence, including evidence of non-severe impairments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We agree with Barrio that the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination as it pertained to her mental impairments is ambiguous. The ALJ initially indicated in its RFC determination that Barrio was restricted to a low-stress work environment. But the ALJ noted later that it adopted the \u201cmore restrictive\u201d of the two assessments from state agency doctors who evaluated Barrio that Barrio was \u201crestricted to simple routine tasks in a low-stress environment.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of the ALJ\u2019s ambiguous RFC assessment, it is difficult to discern whether the ALJ included a restriction to simple routine tasks in concluding that Barrio could return to her past relevant work.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">In addition to not articulating clearly Barrio\u2019s mental RFC, the ALJ also failed to discuss the specific duties of Barrio\u2019s former job as an assignment clerk and how or whether the RFC determination allowed her to do these tasks. In determining if a claimant can return to her past relevant work, the ALJ must consider the specific duties of the claimant\u2019s past work and evaluate the claimant\u2019s ability to perform them in spite of her impairments. <em>Lucas v. Sullivan, </em>918 F.2d 1567, 1574 n. 3 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">Here, the ALJ simply commented that Barrio was able to fulfill the physical and mental demands of the work based \u201cin part on the claimant\u2019s own description of the work in her hearing testimony.\u201d But Barrio\u2019s testimony about her work included that it required a \u201clot of mental abilities\u201d and that it was \u201cextremely demanding.\u201d She stated that she, among other things, worked on a computer to maintain company records, worked with engineers and outside technicians, and maintained different machines. Other record evidence indicated that her work was highly technical. She also testified that she stopped working, in part, due to anxiety and depression. Thus, because the ALJ failed to explain how, in the light of record evidence and the RFC, Barrio\u2019s job duties were simple and routine or how her former work constituted a low-stress environment, we cannot determine whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion the she could return to her past relevant work. <em>See Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cthe ALJ has a basic duty to develop a full and fair record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">Barrio also argues that the ALJ erred in giving little weight to the opinion of her treating psychiatrist. A treating physician\u2019s testimony \u201cmust be given sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>stantial or considerable weight unless good cause is shown to the contrary.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (citation omitted). Good cause exists to discredit a physician\u2019s opinion when it is contrary to or unsupported by record evidence, or it is inconsistent with the physician\u2019s own medical records; the ALJ must articulate clearly the reasons for giving less weight to the treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Here, Barrio\u2019s treating psychiatrist opined that Barrio could not return to her past relevant work because she would have difficulty maintaining a 40-hour workweek due to her sensitivity to stress, obsessive thoughts, and inability to control her emotions. The ALJ rejected this conclusion because (1) \u201cmuch\u201d of Barrio\u2019s anxiety and depression were situational due to her parents\u2019 illnesses and later deaths, and (2) the \u201csituation ha[d] since resolved with the deaths of her parents, and, after an appropriate amount of grieving, one would not expect continuing significant limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The ALJ\u2019s speculative conclusion that Barrio\u2019s mental health problems had ceased or would likely cease in the future does mot constitute good cause for rejecting the physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 840-41 (11th Cir.1992) (the ALJ \u201cmay not arbitrarily substitute his own hunch or intuition for the diagnosis of a medical professional\u201d). And while the psychiatrist\u2019s treating notes show that the illnesses and deaths of Barrio\u2019s parents contributed to her anxiety and depression, they also reflect many other contributing factors, including continuing complications from her ulcerative colitis and bowel surgery, and her relationships with her husband, brother, and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The ALJ\u2019s analysis fails to discuss meaningfully how Barrio\u2019s anxiety and depression might affect her ability to perform her work as an assignment clerk and impermissibly discredits a treating physician\u2019s opinion. <em>See Vega v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1219-20 (11th Cir.2001) (reversing an ALJ\u2019s finding that a claimant could perform her past relevant work and the ALJ\u2019s decision to reject opinions of treating physicians where the ALJ did not properly consider a diagnosed condition or evaluate the effect the condition\u2019s symptoms had on the claimant\u2019s ability to work). Accordingly, we reverse and remand this case with instructions that it be returned to the Commissioner for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion. <em>See Keeton v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>21 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir.1994) (we must reverse when the ALJ has failed to \u201cprovide the reviewing court with sufficient reasoning for determining that the proper legal analysis has been conducted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-11\">. Disability is the \"inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b661-8\">. The ALJ concluded that Barrio had severe impairments of ulcerative colitis, tom right medial meniscus, bilateral caipal tunnel syndrome, depression, and anxiety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b661-14\">. The ALJ also made assessments about Barrio\u2019s physical capabilities. But on appeal, Barrio challenges the ALJ\u2019s RFC determination only on mental capabilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
