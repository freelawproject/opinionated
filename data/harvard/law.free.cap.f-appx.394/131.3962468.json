Thompson also seeks review of an April 8, 2009, Board decision denying his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In the February 8 order, the Board agreed with the IJ\u2019s determination that Thompson\u2019s 2006 New York conviction for seventh-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) because it corresponds to the recidivist provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) when considered with his May 2004 conviction for the same offense. The Board relied on its precedent in <em>Matter of Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. 382 (BIA 2007), <em>aff'd, Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>570 F.3d 263 (5th Cir.2009), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010) to reject the argument that Thompson\u2019s 2006 conviction should not qualify as an aggravated felony because it was not prosecuted as a recidivist offense under New York law, stating that \u201cFifth Circuit precedent does not presently impose any such requirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Since the Board\u2019s decision, the Supreme Court has held that to qualify as an aggravated felony, \u201cthe conduct prohibited by state law must be punishable as a felony under federal law\u201d and \u201cthe defendant must <em>also </em>have been <em>actually convicted </em>of a crime that is itself punishable as a felony under federal law.\u201d <em>Carachuri-Rosendo, </em>130 S.Ct. at 2589. Accordingly, \u201csecond or subsequent simple possession offenses are not aggravated felonies under \u00a7 1101(a)(43) when ... the state conviction is not based on the fact of a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2580. In this case, though Thompson\u2019s 2006 conviction is a subsequent simple possession offense, the conviction is not a crime punishable as a felony under federal law, nor was the eonviction pursuant to the state recidivist statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, Thompson\u2019s petition for review of the Board\u2019s February 8 order is GRANTED and the order of the BIA is VACATED and REMANDED. Thompson\u2019s petition for review of the Board\u2019s April 8 order is DISMISSED AS MOOT.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
