Gonzalez argues that the imposed sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to provide an adequate explanation for the sentence and because it was greater than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Our review of the transcript shows that the district court\u2019s explanation supporting the imposed sentence was adequate. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Moreover, Gonzalez has failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness afforded to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b76-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
