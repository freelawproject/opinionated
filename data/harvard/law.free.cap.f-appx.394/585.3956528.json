They contend that their 96-month sentences, which are 36 months higher than the 60-month statutory mandatory minimum and 84 months lower than the 180-month statutory maximum, are procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">We review the final sentence imposed by a district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). First, we ensure that the district court did not commit a procedural error, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If we determine that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence only for abuse of discretion, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the-light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). While we ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable, we do not presume that a sentence outside the guidelines range is unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 788; <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">\u201cIf [the sentencing judge] decides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The Supreme Court has instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">[An appellate court] may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We will remand for resentencing based on substantive unreasonableness only \u201cif we are left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Gari\u2019s and Rodriguez\u2019s PSI guidelines calculations were exactly the same. Their base offense level was 12. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Ll.l(a)(3). There was a 6-level increase because the offense involved 25 \u2014 99 aliens. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(B). There was a 2-level increase because \u201cthe offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(6). With a total offense level of 20 and a criminal history category of I, their guidelines range was 33 to 41 months. After applying the statutory mandatory minimum of five years, however, their guidelines sentence became 60 months. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 5Gl.l(b) (\u201cWhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d). Neither defendant objected to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Gari and Rodriguez were originally sentenced in 2007. At that sentence hearing, counsel for Rodriguez pointed out to the district court that the guidelines sentence was 33 to 41 months, which was increased to 60 months because of the mandatory minimum. Rodriguez\u2019s counsel described this as \u201ca run-of-the-mill alien smuggling case\u201d and argued for a 60-month sentence. Counsel for Gari did the same, asserting that a 60-month sentence would \u201ctake[] into consideration the promoting respect for society [sic] and also as a deterrent\u201d factors under \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">The district court commented that eleven alien smuggling defendants in seven different cases had appeared before it for sentencing on that day alone. Based on its docket and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court stated that a sentence was required which would \u201caffordf ] adequate deterrence to others who would contemplate engaging in similar conduct.\u201d The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-11\">The frequency that these [alien smuggling] cases arise and the need for a sentence to promote respect for the law and to provide for adequate deterrence, particularly, I think, in this South Florida community and in the Key West community, in particular has seen an increasing number of these kinds of cases, and accompanied by a flagrant disregard for the law that prohibits this kind of activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-12\">I think people are on notice of this kind of illegal behavior and the consequences of it, and yet they seem to continue this sort of disregard of the law and divert scarce law enforcement resources....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ayn\">After stating that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the PSI, which included the advisory guidelines, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced each of the defendants to 96 months running concurrently on all 34 counts of their convictions. Counsel for both defendants objected to the upward variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-14\">Gari and Rodriguez challenged both their convictions and sentences in an earlier appeal. <em>United States v. Gari, </em>572 F.3d 1352, 1358 (11th Cir.2009). We reversed their convictions on count 4 based on insufficient evidence but affirmed on the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>33 counts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We declined to review the sentences for reasonableness and remanded for resentencing in light of the vacated count. <em>Id. </em>at 1366 (citing <em>United States v. Lail, </em>814 F.2d 1529, 1530 (11th Cir.1987)). We issued this mandate to the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-4\">We commit the decisions as to whether to conduct a resentencing hearing and as to the scope of any such hearing to the discretion of the district court. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>848 F.2d 166, 169 (11th Cir.1988) (recognizing that a district court may properly limit the scope of a resentencing hearing on remand because \u201cit [is] in the interest of judicial economy for the court not to redo that which had been done correctly at the first hearing.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">On October 14, 2009, the district court conducted a resentencing hearing with counsel for Rodriguez present. Gari was not available at that time. The court observed that because the defendants had been convicted on numerous counts and only a single count had been vacated, it was inclined to impose the same sentence. Nonetheless, the court decided to review the transcript from the original 2007 sentence hearing in order to review the arguments made by the parties and its own reasons for imposing an above-the-guidelines sentence, and it instructed the government and defense counsel to submit a copy of the transcript.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The court continued the resentence hearing until October 22, 2009, and at that hearing both Gari and Rodriguez were present, each with his own lawyer. The court explained that it had reviewed the transcript of the original 2007 sentence hearing. It asked the parties why it \u201cshould not reimpose the sentence that was originally imposed\u201d when the nature and scope of the criminal conduct had remained basically unchanged. Even though one count of the defendants\u2019 convictions had been vacated, the advisory guidelines sentence of 60-months was the same. Even so, the court permitted defense counsel to address the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and to present a \u201creasonableness\u201d arguments about the original 96-month sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">Counsel for Rodriguez asked the court to consider the extent of the upward variance, particularly in light of what the guidelines sentence would have been but for the 60-month mandatory minimum. Counsel mentioned that Rodriguez\u2019s mother had become very ill. Counsel also argued that the desire \u201cto remove people, Cuban nationals, from a communist-fascist nation\u201d motivates people in the community in a way that cannot be deterred by sentencing above the mandatory minimum. She downplayed the seriousness of Gari and Rodriguez\u2019s offenses, emphasizing that the court had sentenced other defendants convicted of alien smuggling crimes in cases that had involved more dangerous chases by law enforcement, some of which had resulted in injury or death. She stated that Rodriguez was now prepared to accept responsibility for his actions, that he had been gainfully employed ever since he first came to the United States, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>that he could be a contributing member of society again. The court then heard from Rodriguez\u2019s mother, who said he was hardworking and a good son who helped to support her. Rodriguez addressed the court, apologizing and asking for another chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Counsel for Gari emphasized that the defendants were \u201cmerely workers\u201d and that they had not organized the smuggling trip. She argued that Gari had taken responsibility for his actions and had not been \u201cwritten up for anything\u201d in prison. Gari addressed the court, apologizing and stating that he accepted responsibility for his actions. Even so, he tried to explain away his crimes, stating that he had been \u201cdeceived\u201d by two people who had told him that their relatives were stranded on a boat that had broken down in Cay Sol, and he merely went to pick up those people. When he got there, 34 people were waiting. He asserted that he did not \u201ccharge any money\u201d and did not \u201cderive any benefit\u201d from what he had done. Gari concluded by telling the district court that he and Rodriguez \u201cwere simply puppets of those other people who are out on the streets.\u201d In response to a question from the district court, counsel for Gari admitted that Gari had come to the United States illegally in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The government called as a witness Brian Michael Chapman, a lieutenant in the Coast Guard. Chapman testified about the resources used by the Coast Guard in conducting an interdiction and how that affects the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to perform its other duties. The court commented that one of the reasons \u201cthis type of offense is serious [is] because it takes the Coast Guard away from its other important non-law enforcement missions.\u201d Defense counsel argued that no more law enforcement resources were used here than in the typical case and that use of those resources could not justify an upward variance from the guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The court incorporated its remarks from the original sentence hearing and made some additional comments about the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, the court found that it was inherently dangerous to try to cross the Florida Straits in a 33-foot boat at night without running lights and overloaded with 34 people. In its assessment of the seriousness of the offense, the court emphasized the importance of maintaining the security of the nation\u2019s borders, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">And those who are attempting to come to the United States and cross our borders for whatever reason, for whatever their motivation, whatever their perceived sense of what\u2019s right or wrong, they are penetrating the physical security of the United States and certainly in the straits of Florida. They do it with a brazen impudence that somehow it\u2019s a right that they have to challenge the physical integrity of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">The court concluded that it could not \u201coverstate the seriousness of the offense and the significance of trying to maintain a secure border; ... a punishment should reflect the seriousness of that type ... of offense, and that a punishment is necessary to deter others who might engage in similar kinds of behavior.\u201d The court explained that it had considered the parties\u2019 arguments, the PSIs with their calculation of the advisory guidelines, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. It then reimposed the 96-month sentences that it had ordered at the original 2007 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">The district court properly considered and adequately explained its findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>about the nature and circumstances of the offense, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a)(1), its seriousness, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3558(a)(2)(A), the need to promote respect for the law, <em>see id., </em>and the need for the sentence imposed \u201cto afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). A district court is not required to discuss its consideration of every one of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as long as the sentencing judge \u201cset[s] forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmak-ing authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The court emphasized the need for the sentences to reflect the seriousness of the offense and explained why it considered these offenses to be particularly serious. Emphasizing the large number of alien smuggling crimes in the area and the serious threat they pose to national security, the court focused on the need for general deterrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Gari and Rodriguez contend that an unwarranted sentencing disparity was created because other defendants, who were sentenced on the same day by the same district judge, were sentenced within their guidelines ranges for alien smuggling offenses. At their initial sentencing Gari and Rodriguez argued that there had not been a high speed chase in their case, and no one was seriously put at risk of injury before they eventually pulled over in a marina and stopped their boat. Similarly, at them resentence hearing they argued that the court had seen \u201cdifferent degrees of chase\u201d in other cases: \u201cAnd to be sure, this Court has seen other levels of chase and other levels of endangerment, some involving death. And this case did not present it.\u201d R. Vol. 8 at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">We have explained that \u201c[disparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001). That also holds true for allegations of disparity when the same judge on the same day sentences multiple defendants in different cases on convictions for similar crimes. The information provided in Rodriguez\u2019s brief to this Court about other defendants\u2019 sentences fails to establish that the district court created an unwarranted sentencing disparity when it imposed an upward variance in Gari and Rodriguez\u2019s case. The guidelines range for six of the nine other defendants Rodriguez mentions is listed as unknown, so it is impossible to compare those sentences even in terms of possible variances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the present case, simply comparing the length of other defendants\u2019 sentences for purportedly similar crimes does not establish an unwarranted sentencing disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Taking into account the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing Gari and Rodriguez to 96 months imprisonment, which was 84 months below the 15-year statutory maximum sentence. The district court did not \u201cweigh[] the factors in a manner that demonstrably yields an unreasonable sentence.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-9\">.
