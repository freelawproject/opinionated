He argues that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not supported by empirical data or national experience. Aldana also argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that a sentence below the guidelines is sufficient because he reentered the United States only to find work in order to support his family; the use of his manslaughter conviction to calculate both his criminal history score and his offense level placed undue weight on his prior conviction; and there were mitigating circumstances surrounding his prior conviction for manslaughter because he shot the victim in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">As Aldana concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically-based is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009), and <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008). We have also previously rejected the argument that the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">The district court considered Aldana\u2019s request for leniency, but it ultimately determined that a 51-month sentence was appropriate. The district court did not unreasonably reject Aldana\u2019s argument that he shot the victim in self-defense because the plea colloquy showed that Alda-na approached the passenger window of the car with a gun and fired across the passenger seat striking the victim in the head and chest. Moreover, Aldana\u2019s assertion regarding his motive for reentering the United States is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). Aldana has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable, and he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1930, 176 L.Ed.2d 397 (2010). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
