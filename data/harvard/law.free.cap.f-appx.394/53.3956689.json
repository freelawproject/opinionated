This court affirmed the conviction, ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>in part that Cantu Chapa\u2019s claim that ineffective assistance of counsel rendered her guilty plea involuntary was foreclosed by our precedent. The Supreme Court vacated the decision in this case and remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Padilla v. Kentucky.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Cantu Chapa asserts that her guilty plea was involuntary since her counsel rendered ineffective assistance. She argues that her attorney was ineffective because he failed to inform her that a conviction would almost certainly result in deportation. Cantu Chapa raises this argument for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Cantu Chapa\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is not properly before us. We have explained that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u201cis not reviewable on direct appeal because it has not been addressed by the district court, and the record has not been fully developed.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the <em>Padilla </em>holding shows that Cantu Chapa\u2019s claim may satisfy the constitutional deficiency prong of a <em>Strickland v. Washing</em>ton<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ineffective assistance of counsel analysis, we cannot fully address the claim here, since the record is not sufficiently developed so as to consider the prejudice prong (of the <em>Strickland </em>analysis. We therefore decline to consider this claim without prejudice to Cantu Ghapa\u2019s ability to raise it in a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Cantu Chapa also contends that the magistrate judge and district court committed reversible error by failing to advise her of (1) her right to be represented by counsel, appointed if necessary, at trial and every other stage of the proceedings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) her right to be protected from compelled self-incrimination.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plain error review applies to this issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cantu Chapa has not shown, as required by <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez,</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that these errors affected her substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b77-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
