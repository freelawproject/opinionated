Alvarado contends that his 1998 order of removal is invalid in light of <em>United States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>243 F.3d 921 (5th Cir.2001), and, therefore, should be vacated. Alvarado also contends that this court has jurisdiction over his \u00a7 2241 petition and \u201cthat he is being detained unlawfully by\u201d Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s legal conclusions on jurisdiction. <em>Zolicoffer v. United States Department of Justice, </em>315 F.3d 538, 540 (5th Cir.2003). \u201cFor a court to have habeas jurisdiction under section 2241, the prisoner must be \u2018in custody\u2019 at the time he files his petition for the conviction or sentence he wishes to challenge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The issuance of a detainer does not place Alvarado \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2241. <em>Id. </em>at 540-41. As Alvarado was not in custody, the district court did not have jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241 to challenge the detainer. Furthermore, \u201cthe REAL ID Act has divested federal courts of jurisdiction over \u00a7 2241 petitions attacking removal orders.\u201d <em>Rosales v. BICE, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005). When and if a final order of removal is entered against Alvarado, his sole means of obtaining judicial review of that order would be to file a petition for review in the appropriate court of appeals. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
