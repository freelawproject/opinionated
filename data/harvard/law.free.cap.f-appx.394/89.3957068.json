Cepeda-Rios, </em>530 F.3d 333, 335-36 (5th Cir.2008), which held that even after <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), a second state conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance qualifies as an aggravated felony that supports the imposition of an eight-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Because the arguments were foreclosed at the time, the Government moved for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-22\">After the summary-affirmance motion was filed, the Supreme Court held in an immigration proceeding that \u201cwhen a defendant has been convicted of a simple possession offense that has not been enhanced based on the fact of a prior conviction, he has not been \u2018convicted\u2019 under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) of a \u2018felony punishable\u2019 as such \u2018under the Controlled Substances Act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2577, 2589, 177 L.Ed.2d 68 (2010). The Supreme Court noted that \u201c[t]he mere possibility that the defendant\u2019s conduct, coupled with facts outside of the record of conviction, could have authorized a felony eonvic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>tion under federal law is insufficient....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">Casimiro now moves, without opposition, to vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and to remand for resentencing in light of <em>Car-achuri-Rosendo. </em>Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, in light of <em>Carachuri-Ro-sendo, </em>Casimiro\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence and to remand his case to the district court for resentencing is GRANTED. The motion to issue the mandate forthwith is also GRANTED. The Government\u2019s motions for summary affir-mance and to suspend the briefing notice are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b113-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
