However, Rodriguez\u2019s conduct, which involved threatening moves toward police, amounted to more than mere recklessness, and thus the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) enhancement was plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 356-57 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2814, 174 L.Ed.2d 308 (2009); <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gillyard, </em>261 F.3d 506, 510 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, Rodriguez has not shown that the district court committed clear error. <em>See Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b83-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
