The district court ruled that Campbell\u2019s action failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">Campbell filed an application for a preliminary injunction and asked the district court to compel a Florida court to reopen Campbell\u2019s proceedings to vacate his conviction, Fla. R.Crim. P. 3.850. Campbell argued that the state court, the prosecutor, and defense counsel had denied him due process acting under color of state law, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court dismissed Campbell\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-19\">The district court did not err because Campbell failed to state a claim for any form of cognizable relief. Even if we look \u201cbehind the label of\u2019 Campbell\u2019s application and amendments, his action is not \u201ccognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). Because the state court ruled that Campbell\u2019s motions were barred from review as successive and untimely, he cannot relitigate those issues in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>See Marek v. Singletary, </em>62 F.3d 1295, 1301 (11th Cir.1995). The district court also lacked authority to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the state court and its officers to reinstate his motions to vacate and consider those motions on the merits. <em>See Lamar v. 118th Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>440 F.2d 383, 384 (5th Cir.1971). Campbell also failed to state a claim under section 1983 because his arguments about the denial of his post-conviction motion and constitutional violations committed by state authorities challenged the fact and duration of his confinement. <em>See Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 78, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 1245, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-20\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Campbell\u2019s application.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
