Jiang also seeks review of the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to remand her case to the IJ to consider her application in light of new evidence. After thorough review, we deny her petition and affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">According to Jiang, from May 2003 until August 2005, she had been \u201chiding\u201d in Fuzhou, China because of dealings she describes having with Chinese family planning officials, including two forced abortions and an escape from a hospital to avoid forced sterilization. On August 29, 2005, Jiang, purportedly with the help of a paid smuggler, attempted entry into the United States at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta but was stopped by the Department of Homeland Security. A week later, she was deemed to be subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) for failing to have proper documentation upon entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">To avoid removal, Jiang sought permanent refuge in the United States by filing a Form 1-589, Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. In her application, she claimed that the persecution against her began in 1992 following her marriage to Hui Lin. She testified that although the couple was married according to rural countryside traditions, they could not obtain a formal marriage certificate because Lin was too young. When family planning officials discovered this, they took Jiang from her home, discovered she was pregnant, and forced her to have an abortion. Irate at the government\u2019s actions, Lin got into a bloody altercation with the officials and thereafter fled to the United States to avoid retaliation. After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain asylum,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Lin was deported back to China in early 1994 where he was allegedly detained, fined, and tortured for illegal departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">In 1994, Jiang and Lin had a civil marriage ceremony and received a formal marriage certif\u00edcate. According to her testimony, they had their first child in 1996 and remained eligible to have a second despite China\u2019s one-child policy because they lived in the countryside and their first born was a girl. In 2001, Jiang became pregnant again but suffered a miscarriage. The government, however, believed either that she had given birth and was hiding the baby or that she underwent an abortion because the child would be a girl. When the government could not uncover any evidence to support its beliefs, it inserted an intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) in Jiang rather than force sterilization. Both Jiang\u2019s sister and brother-in-law had been forcibly sterilized and both were able to obtain asylum in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">Jiang claims that when she went for her quarterly checkup with the family planning officials in May 2003,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> they discovered that the IUD was missing and that she was three-months pregnant. Officials then forced Jiang to undergo a second abortion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>and scheduled her for immediate sterilization. Given her weakened condition following the abortion, Jiang persuaded the officials to postpone the sterilization for two days. This gave her time to escape from the hospital before the procedure could be performed. Following her escape, Jiang was afraid to live with her husband and consequently spent time living with her cousins. Later that year or in early 2004, her husband returned to the United States illegally, and in August 2005, Jiang came to the United States to join him. While Jiang\u2019s application for asylum was pending before the IJ, the couple gave birth to their second child. After the IJ\u2019s denial of her application but before the BIA\u2019s decision, the couple gave birth to their third child and Jiang converted to Christianity.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Jiang has applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. An applicant who cannot meet the evidentiary burden to establish she is entitled to asylum generally cannot meet the heavier evidentiary burdens associated with withholding of removal or CAT relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1292-93, 1303 (11th Cir.2001). We thus address Jiang\u2019s claim for asylum first.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A), the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General has the discretion to grant asylum to a \u201crefugee,\u201d defined as an individual who is unwilling or unable to. return to her country of residence \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Persecution on account of \u201cpolitical opinion\u201d includes being subjected to forced abortions, involuntary sterilization, and other coercive population control measures. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The BIA denied Jiang\u2019s application for asylum. Our review of that decision is limited to the BIA\u2019s decision itself and those portions of the IJ\u2019s decision expressly adopted by the BIA. <em>Mohammed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>547 F.3d 1340, 1344 (11th Cir.2008). In its opinion, the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was the sole basis for upholding the denial of Jiang\u2019s application. We therefore review only the credibility determination of the IJ and do not consider Jiang\u2019s challenges to the IJ\u2019s findings regarding corroborating evidence and past and present conditions in Fujian Province, none of which were explicitly adopted by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-12\">The denial of asylum relief may be based solely on an adverse credibility determination. <em>Kueviakoe v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>567 F.3d 1301, 1304-05 (11th Cir.2009). An adverse credibility determination is a finding of fact that we review under the substantial evidence test. <em>See D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004). Under that test, the \u201cburden is on the applicant ... to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005). The test is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and requires us to \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1027 (quoting <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84). We will reverse only if a reasonable trier of fact, based on the record, would be compelled to reach an opposite conclusion than that reached by the IJ. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Because Jiang filed her petition after May 11, 2005, the REAL ID Act requires the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination to be based on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, and all relevant factors.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Kueviakoe, </em>567 F.3d at 1305. The IJ may take into account the demeanor, candor, or responsiveness of the applicant; the inherent plausibility of the applicant\u2019s testimony; the consistency of her testimony with other evidence; or the internal consistency of her testimony. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii). Any inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood may be the basis for an adverse credibility determination, even if it does not go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">After conducting an administrative hearing, the IJ issued an oral decision finding Jiang not credible based on all the evidence before him, namely thirteen exhibits, including her husband\u2019s asylum application in 1992; Jiang\u2019s testimony; and a proffer from counsel as to the testimony that Jiang\u2019s sister could provide regarding what Jiang had said about her two abortions and miscarriage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In particular, the IJ based his adverse credibility determination on (1) Jiang\u2019s account of her escape from the hospital in 2003 to avoid sterilization; (2) inconsistencies regarding when she first met her husband; (3) her account of her miscarriage in 2001; (4) inconsistencies regarding her forced abortion in 1992; and (5) her inability to recall details of being smuggled into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">The BIA found that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous because of \u201cimplausibilities in [Jiang\u2019s] account, particularly with respect to her purported escape from the hospital to avoid sterilization, and inconsistencies within her account as well as between her testimony and her husband\u2019s written statement\u201d from his asylum application in 1992. The BIA did note, however, that the strength of the IJ\u2019s conclusions are \u201cdiminished by the unduly pejorative manner in which they are stated.\u201d On appeal, Jiang attacks each of the five reasons on which the IJ based his credibility determination. We consider each of them in turn, and whether, in the end, the record supports the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">The IJ found Jiang\u2019s account of her escape from the hospital to avoid sterilization in 2003 not only implausible but also filled with inconsistencies. Despite having an abortion the day before that left her in such a weakened condition that the family planning officials agreed to postpone the sterilization for two days, Jiang testified that she ran from the hospital for 10 minutes before catching a bus. Although some confusion appears to have existed regarding whether Jiang meant she was physically running or \u201crunning away\u201d in the sense that she was escaping from the hospital, the IJ specifically asked Jiang during her direct examination whether she ran using her own two feet:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Q. How far did you run?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-5\">A. Two hours bus ride.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">Q: And you ran the entire distance, ma\u2019am?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">A. Took bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">Q. Ma\u2019am, you told me you ran away from the hospital. Did you run on your own two feet away from the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">A. I ran out of the hospital and to the bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-10\">Q. How far did you run from the hospital to the bus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">A. About \u2014 around ten minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">Q. You ran for ten minutes to get to the bus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-13\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">On cross-examination, however, Jiang testified that the first thing she did when she got out of the hospital was to hail a vehicle.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-15\">Q. And then once you got outside, what\u2019d you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-16\">A. When I got out of the hospital, I, I called for a vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-17\">Q. What do you mean called? Did you call on a phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-18\">A. No. Because there are a lot of vehicles outside hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-19\">Q. So you just stopped a random vehicle outside the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-20\">A. Yes, it happened to be a vehicle there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-21\">JUDGE TO MS. JIANG</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-22\">Q. By vehicle, do you mean a cab, something like a cab that you pay to take you somewhere?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-23\">A. A motorcycle and he took me to the bus station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-24\">Q. Well, earlier today you told me you ran to the bus station. Which of the two is true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-25\">A. Yeah. Earlier I was saying I, I called vehicle, I didn\u2019t say I ran to the bus station. I, I took a motorcycle to bus station and went to Fuzhou.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-26\">Q. You never told me you ran away from the hospital to the bus station?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-27\">A. I said I ran out hospital and I went to \u2014 got vehicle and went to the bus station.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-28\">[GOVERNMENT TO MS. JIANG]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-29\">Q. I\u2019m going to ask you again, ma\u2019am. You didn\u2019t say that you ran for ten minutes to the bus station before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-30\">A. And, I, I meant it took around ten minutes to get to bus station.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnE\">Although Jiang presents a tenable argument that the IJ\u2019s perceived inconsistency was merely based on a translation problem or a misunderstanding regarding what she meant when she said she \u201cran\u201d from the hospital, we cannot say that the testimony compels a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ. Neither does the record compel us to find her testimony plausible in light of Jiang\u2019s ability to effectuate her escape despite her admittedly weak condition and the fortuitous events surrounding her escape. The idea that both of the family planning officials guarding her happened to leave her bedside at the same time and that she was able to \u201crun, not walk,\u201d out of the hospital without being intercepted by any other individuals caused the IJ to doubt Jiang\u2019s credibility, and the record does not compel a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-31\">Further undermining Jiang\u2019s credibility was the inconsistency regarding when she met her husband. Jiang testified that she met her husband in 1992, but then when it was revealed she got married in 1992, Jiang testified that she met him in 1991 but began living with him in 1992.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-32\">Q. Ma\u2019am, when did you first meet your husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>A. Early 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-4\">Q. You first met him in early 1992?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Q. Okay. When was the date of your traditional wedding ceremony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">A. I can\u2019t remember, it\u2019s, it\u2019s been a long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">Q. Well, was it in 1991 or 1992?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">A. Ninety-two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">Q. Okay. But you are clear that you first met your husband in 1992?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">A. In 1992, I, I started to live with my husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">Q. No, ma\u2019am, I asked you when you first met your husband.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-13\">A. Ninety-one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">Q. And then you started to live with him in 1992.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-15\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-16\">Q. And the traditional marriage ceremony occurred sometime in 1992?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-17\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-18\">Then, when presented with her husband\u2019s statement in his asylum application that he knew her since childhood, she remembered that she first met him when they were children but that they did not date, talk, or otherwise know each other. Although Jiang presents a tenable argument that her initial answers as to when she \u201cmet\u201d her husband were appropriate given that they were asked in the context of questions regarding her romantic relationship with her husband, it does not compel the conclusion that her testimony was eonsis-tent in light of the direct questions regarding when they \u201cfirst met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-24\">With respect to the additional grounds on which the IJ based its decision \u2014 namely Jiang\u2019s testimony regarding her miscarriage in 2001, her forced abortion in 1992, and her being smuggled into the United States \u2014 they are either largely unsupported by the record or do not provide cogent reasons for finding Jiang incredible. At the outset, we note that the government presents no argument in opposition to Jiang\u2019s argument that neither her story about her miscarriage nor her testimony regarding her smuggling trip are appropriate grounds on which to find her not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-25\">The IJ found Jiang\u2019s account of her miscarriage in the first trimester \u201ctotally implausible and medically improbable.\u201d Specifically, he thought it implausible that Jiang never sought medical attention following the miscarriage and \u201cmedically improbable\u201d that a sonogram, as Jiang testified, could confirm her pregnancy at less than two months. These findings, however, were unsupported by any evidence in the record. Rather, the IJ, based solely on his personal perception regarding the reasonableness of Jiang\u2019s actions, discounted Jiang\u2019s repeated testimony that it was common for women living in her rural village not to seek medical attention except when necessary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-26\">Unlike the IJ, we do not find Jiang\u2019s account inherently implausible. Likewise, the IJ\u2019s determination that it was \u201cmedically improbable\u201d that the sonogram Jiang <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>had could confirm her pregnancy at less than two months was mere speculation<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and persuasively rebutted by a litany of cases cited by Jiang on appeal noting that a sonogram can detect a fetus as early as five weeks into the pregnancy. We therefore reject the IJ\u2019s findings regarding Jiang\u2019s account of her miscarriage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Tang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>578 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cIt is appropriate for us to reverse when a credibility determination is based solely on speculation and conjecture....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">As for the internal inconsistencies in Jiang\u2019s account of her abortion in 1992 and the inconsistencies between her and her husband\u2019s accounts thereof, they are largely based on a misreading of the record. The IJ found Jiang incredible because she initially testified that she was taken from the clinic to the hospital and then when confronted with her husband\u2019s account, she changed her story and said she was taken from her home to the clinic and then to the hospital. The record, however, does not support this finding. Based on our review, Jiang consistently and from the outset testified that she was taken from her home by family planning officials for a checkup and then sent for an abortion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>was taken from her home to the clinic for that checkup and then to the hospital or directly to the hospital appears from the record to be an inconsistency in form but not substance given Jiang\u2019s plausible account that the words \u201chospital\u201d and \u201cclinic\u201d are used interchangeably and her other testimony that family planning was a department within the hospital.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">There is an unexplained inconsistency, however, insofar as Jiang testified that the family planning officials only came once to her house and forced her to have an abortion that day whereas her husband stated in his asylum application that they came twice and scheduled her for an abortion five days after their first visit. When confronted with the inconsistency, Jiang did not deviate from her story and stated: \u201cI can only remember once. But it\u2019s been a while, I, I can\u2019t remember clearly, but what I remember is only once.\u201d The IJ found it incredible that Jiang could not recall whether, fifteen years ago, family planning officials came once or twice to her house, particularly since Jiang found the event so \u201ctraumatic as to trigger an application for asylum.\u201d Although reasonable people could disagree about whether this perceived inconsistency reflects poorly on Jiang\u2019s credibility given the passage of time and that she stuck by her story, we cannot say that it compels a different finding than that reached by the IJ. We thus find this aspect of Jiang\u2019s testimony regarding her abortion in 1992, but not the others, to be a justifiable reason on which the IJ based his credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-13\">Last, the IJ took issue with Jiang\u2019s deliberately \u201cvague and evasive answers\u201d regarding the details of her being smuggled into the United States. In particular, the IJ cited that Jiang could not recall who introduced her to the smuggler and that \u201c[s]he was unsure of the smuggler\u2019s name, did not know the name of the airline she took, the number of airplanes she took to the United States, the country she traveled through, or what document she used in order to effectuate her arrival in the United States.\u201d Some of these findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>are flatly contradicted by the record. Jiang specifically testified that her cousin, Chan Xu Yin, introduced her to the smuggler and that she took three planes to the United States. As for the findings that were supported by Jiang\u2019s testimony, they fail to take into account the totality of the circumstances as required by the REAL ID Act. The IJ\u2019s finding that she did not know the name of the airline fails to take into account that Jiang did not understand English.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Jiang\u2019s failure to know other details in our view, does not reflect negatively on Jiang\u2019s credibility given the circumstances, because this type of information would not necessarily even be known to one whom is being smuggled. For example, Jiang testified that she did not know what documents she used because she was simply following the \u201csnakehead,\u201d and he kept the documents. Thus, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s finding on this aspect of Jiang\u2019s testimony does not constitute a cogent reason for finding her incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Despite our reservations about certain bases for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, we must look at the totality of the circumstances. As a whole, we cannot say that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was insufficiently supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons.\u201d The account of her improbable escape from sterilization and her failure to recall details of traumatic and important events in her life could reasonably be said to reflect poorly on her credibility. Without the benefit of observing Jiang\u2019s demeanor, candor, or responsiveness during the hearing, we must give deference to the IJ\u2019s determinations. We therefore uphold the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s denial of Jiang\u2019s petition for asylum. And to the extent Jiang challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of her application for withholding of removal and for CAT relief, her challenge likewise fails. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93, 1303 (stating that if an applicant is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, she is generally precluded from qualifying for either withholding of removal or CAT relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">Jiang asks us to review the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to remand her case to the IJ for further proceedings. In that motion, Jiang raised a new claim for asylum on the ground of religious persecution and stated that her having given birth to additional children following the IJ\u2019s decision may affect her family planning claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">Because Jiang\u2019s motion to remand \u201cseeks to introduce evidence that has not previously been presented,\u201d we construe it as motion to reopen pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c). <em>Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1301. \u201cA motion to reopen must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material, and it must state new facts that will be proven at a hearing ... if the motion is granted.\u201d <em>Verano-Velasco v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>456 F.3d 1372, 1376 (11th Cir.2006). To that effect, Jiang submitted an affidavit describing her conversion to Christianity, which occurred about a month after the IJ\u2019s adverse ruling and about three months after she first attended a church service. She also substantiated her fear of being persecuted if she were to practice her Christian beliefs in China by including a U.S. Department of State report describing the extent of religious freedom in China and by describing the persecution suffered by her cousin Lin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>While I was in China, my cousin Lin was involved in underground church in my hometown. She and other members of the church were frequently harassed by Chinese authority. Once, I was told her house was ramshackle by the police because she refused to surrender to the authority for the role in the church. The police beat up her husband.

I deeply hated the Chinese authority and would not like to attend the system that is contaminated by the Chinese government. I believe because there is no other choice, I would have to either worship on my own or attend underground church, in case I have to return to China.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">We review for abuse of discretion the BIA\u2019s denial of Jiang\u2019s motion on the ground that her claim was \u201ctoo speculative\u201d to establish a prima facie case of future persecution. <em>Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1145 (11th Cir.1999). To have made out a prima facie case, Jiang must have set forth \u201cdetailed, specific facts\u201d that could establish either a subjective and objective fear of being \u201csingled out\u201d for persecution, <em>see Mohammed, </em>547 F.3d at 1345, or that China has a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecuting a group of persons similarly situated to her, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Putting aside the question of the timing of Jiang\u2019s conversion, her motion fails to make out a prima facie case. Jiang\u2019s affidavit lacks details regarding the persecution faced by her cousin, including when the persecution occurred in Jiang\u2019s hometown, and whether Jiang\u2019s Christian beliefs even coincide with those for which her cousin was persecuted. Furthermore, Jiang merely speculates that she could not practice her Christianity freely in either China\u2019s registered or unregistered churches. She also fails to establish why she could not live in a region where, according to the Department of State report she submitted, government supervision of religious activity is minimal and evenhanded between registered and unregistered churches. Because we agree that Jiang\u2019s claim of future persecution is too speculative, we cannot say that the BIA abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">Jiang also criticizes the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion for failing to consider the birth of two additional children following the IJ\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, we do not believe that Jiang sufficiently raised this issue before the BIA. In her motion, Jiang simply stated that the births of those children \u201cmay also affect\u201d her family planning claim but failed to present any argument whatsoever as to how or to make a clear request for relief on that basis. We therefore lack jurisdiction to hear this aspect of her appeal. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y. Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) and noting that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">For these reasons, Jiang\u2019s petition for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief is DENIED, and the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to remand is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-7\">. Jiang's minor daughter, Bing Ping Lin, is a derivative beneficiary of Jiang's application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">. Lin's application was denied because of an adverse credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">. Jiang presented as evidence a booklet that kept track of her quarterly check-ups with the family planning officials from 1994 through January 2001. The booklet stated that \"[o]ne couple can only have one child!'' Apparently, Jiang was issued another booklet once this one was filled. That second booklet, however, is not part of the record, allegedly because when Jiang escaped the hospital to avoid forced sterilization she left it behind.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b643-8\">. To receive asylum, an applicant must'show a \"well-founded fear of persecution.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). In contrast, a grant of withholding from removal requires the applicant to show that \"her life or freedom would be threatened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b). Relief under the Convention Against Torture requires the applicant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that she would be tortured in the country of removal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">. The court and the government agreed to accept the proffer based on the understanding that Jiang's sister lacked any first-hand knowledge of either the abortions or the miscarriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b646-19\">.

In response to the IJ\u2019s on-the-spot question asking whether Jiang\u2019s counsel was \"aware of any scientific evidence that shows a sonogram will show pregnancy about a month after pregnancy,\u201d Jiang\u2019s counsel responded that she did not \"have any documents at all.\u201d Counsel\u2019s failure to adduce evidence at the moment the question was propounded does not support the IJ\u2019s conclusion of \"medical improbability.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\">. Because the BIA only adopted the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, we do not weigh Jiang's failure to provide corroborating evidence of either her pregnancy or miscarriage.
