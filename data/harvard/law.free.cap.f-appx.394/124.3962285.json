Hodge, Jr. after Hodge did not comply with several verbal warnings from Lieutenant Moore and the Louisiana State University football game day marshal asking him to leave the student disability accessible section in Tiger Stadium, which he did not have a ticket for. Hodge received a summons for remaining after being forbidden and resisting arrest, but was never prosecuted. Hodge filed suit asserting various Constitutional and Louisiana law claims against the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriffs Office; The Board of Supervisors for Louisiana State University; Greg Phares, Sheriff for East Baton Rouge Parish; and Lieutenant Moore.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-20\">The district court dismissed all claims against the defendants or granted them summary judgment. Although Hodge names both Sheriff Phares and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Lieutenant Moore as defendants on appeal, he solely briefs his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim against Lieutenant Moore for false arrest in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Despite our policy of liberally construing briefs of pro se litigants and applying less stringent standards to parties proceeding pro se than to parties represented by counsel, pro se parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the standards of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Only Hodge\u2019s false arrest claim comes close, even though he is a lawyer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We consider all other claims waived, each of which approached the frivolous to begin with. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo and apply the same legal standards as the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u201cThe doctrine of-qualified immunity protects government officials from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, if Lieutenant Moore\u2019s actions were \u201cobjectively reasonable under the circumstances, such that a reasonably competent officer would not have known his actions violated then-existing clearly established law,\u201d immunity attaches.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">Hodge\u2019s only hope is to show his arrest was without probable cause \u2014 and that Lieutenant Moore should have known better.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cProbable cause exists when the totality of the facts and circumstances within a police officer\u2019s knowledge at the moment of arrest are sufficient for a reasonable person to conclude that the suspect had committed or was committing an offense.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Lieutenant Moore had probable cause to believe Hodge was committing the state-law crime of Remaining After Being Forbidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">Louisiana\u2019s criminal trespass statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">No person shall without authority go into or upon or remain in or upon or attempt to go into or upon or remain in or upon any structure, watercraft, or any other movable, or immovable property, which belongs to another, including public buildings and structures, ferries, and bridges, or any part, portion, or area thereof, after having been forbidden to do so, either orally or in writing ... by any owner, lessee, or custodian of the property or by any other authorized person.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">Louisiana State University authorizes game day marshals to handle seating and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ticketing. Hodge did not possess a ticket for the student disability accessible section, and the game day marshal asked Hodge to leave the area. Hodge refused. The game day marshal then told Lieutenant Moore that Hodge would not leave and asked for help removing him from the restricted area. Lieutenant Moore told Hodge to leave the section. He would not. Hodge\u2019s refusal after multiple requests gave Lieutenant Moore probable cause. Lieutenant Moore\u2019s actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances and he is entitled to qualified immunity from Hodge\u2019s Fourth Amendment-based claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b149-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
