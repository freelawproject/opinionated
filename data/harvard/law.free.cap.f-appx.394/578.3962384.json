In his motion, he alleged under oath that on January 13, 2004, federal agents arrested him, searched his home, and seized the following items: (1) an American Tourister Book bag containing accounting books, (2) five gold men\u2019s rings, (3) six gold link chains, (4) six gold bracelets, (5) twelve gold women\u2019s rings, (6) six gold earrings, (7) one gold medallion, (8) one personal gold chain, (9) one personal gold bracelet, (10) one gold tone watch, (11) one gold statue, (12) one big screen TV set, (13) one DVD player, (14) one VCR, (15) one \u201cBoom Box,\u201d (16) three pairs of dress boots, (17) three pairs of dress shoes, (18) one leather jacket, (19) one \u201cdesigned\u201d jacket, (20) one cell phone, (21) two sports jackets, and (22) fourteen \u201cGuallaveras\u201d shirts. Melqu\u00edades maintained that he owned the listed items, and was entitled to their return. Relying entirely on the government\u2019s opposition to this motion \u2014 which in turn cited only to an unpublished Southern District of Texas case, <em>Ezenwa v. United States, </em>No. Civ. A. H-04-3379, 2006 WL 696557 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 16, 2006) \u2014 the district court summarily denied Melquiades\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-16\">Interpreting Melquiades\u2019s briefs liberally,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he makes two arguments on appeal. First, that the district court erred by failing to find, sua sponte, that the government had not properly served Melqu\u00edades with its response to his Rule 41(g) motion. Second, that the district court abused its discretion by placing undue \u201ctrust [in] the arguments of the government,\u201d depriving Melqu\u00edades of the opportunity to reply to this filing when it denied his motion on the merits. For the reasons discussed below, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>we conclude that the district court erred when it relied entirely on allegations made in the government\u2019s response to deny Mel-quiades\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion. Therefore, we reverse and remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Pursuant to Rule 41(g), \u201c[a] person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure of property or by the deprivation of property may move for the property\u2019s return\u201d by filing a motion in the district court where the property was seized. Fed. R.Crim.P. 41(g). Where, as here, the mov-ant \u201cinvokes Rule 41(g) after the close of all criminal proceedings, the court treats the motion for return of property as a civil action in equity.\u201d <em>United States v. Howell, </em>425 F.3d 971, 974 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIn order for an owner of property to invoke Rule 41(g), he must show that he had a possessory interest in the property seized by the government.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 973. We review <em>de novo </em>the legal issues relevant to a district court\u2019s decision to deny a Rule 41(g) motion. <em>Id. </em>\u201cRule 41(g) rulings are based on a balancing of the equities and are reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. De La Mata, </em>535 F.3d 1267, 1279 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Though we have never said it this way, this Court\u2019s precedent indicates that analysis under Rule 41(g) requires a multi-step inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A Rule 41(g) movant who asserts a post-conviction claim must first demonstrate that he is entitled to the property. This showing implicates the threshold requirement set out in <em>Howell, </em>that the movant have a possessory interest in the property. <em>See Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 974. The government may rebut the mov-ant\u2019s allegations with evidence that \u201c \u2018it has a legitimate reason to retain the property,\u2019 \u201d that it does not possess the property, or that the property has been destroyed. <em>See United States v. Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d 1310, 1314 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>192 F.3d 374, 377 (3d Cir.1999)). Where a material issue of fact arises, the plain language of Rule 41(g) requires the court to \u201creceive evidence ... to decide the motion.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 41(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">In this case, the district court denied Melquiades\u2019s motion based solely on the parties\u2019 filings, without holding an eviden-tiary hearing. The government argues on appeal that the district court decision to do so did not amount to error because \u201cMel-qu\u00edades wholly failed to show that the United States ever had seized the asserted property ..., and wholly failed to show that the asserted property belonged to him.\u201d Accordingly, argues the government, Melqu\u00edades failed to establish a pos-sessory interest in the purportedly seized property, as required by <em>Howell. </em>The strength of the government\u2019s argument rests upon its assumptions \u2014 made also by the district court \u2014 that (1) Melqu\u00edades <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>bore the burden of production as to his ownership in the subject property and (2) the district court could decide these disputed factual issues without affording Mel-qu\u00edades an opportunity to present evidence in support of his allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We have held that the government\u2019s bald assertion that it destroyed the subject property is insufficient to overcome a Rule 41(g) movant\u2019s claim, once criminal proceedings have terminated. <em>See Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d at 1314 (\u201cAlthough the government alleges in its pleadings that the property sought by Potes Ramirez was destroyed, ... [tjhere is no evidence in the record that Potes Ramirez\u2019s property was destroyed. Therefore the government has not met its burden in this case, and the district court was incorrect to deny Potes Ramirez\u2019s motion without requiring the government to submit at least some evidence of the property\u2019s destruction.\u201d). In so holding, we noted that \u201c\u2018the person from whom the property was seized is presumed to have a right to its return, and the government must demonstrate that it has a legitimate reason to retain the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Chambers, </em>192 F.3d at 377). Even if the <em>Potes Ramirez </em>Court did not intend this presumption to apply to the logically anterior inquiries of whether the government seized the property from the movant or whether the movant can demonstrate a possessory interest in the purportedly seized goods, the text of Rule 41(g) plainly requires that a court \u201creceive evidence on any factual issue necessary to decide the motion.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(g). Consequently, once a Rule 41(g) movant alleges that property was seized from his home and the government disputes this fact, the district court must at a minimum afford the movant an opportunity to present evidence in support of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Our precedent and the precedent of other circuits support the conclusion that a Rule 41(g) movant is not required to attach to his initial motion evidence in support of its allegations. <em>Potes Ramirez </em>relied on <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>192 F.3d 374 (3d Cir.1999), when setting out this post-prosecution presumption favoring movants. <em>See Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d at 1314. In <em>Chambers, </em>the Third Circuit explained that it derived this presumption from the requirement that a district court hold an evidentiary hearing to resolve material factual disputes between the parties. <em>Chambers, </em>192 F.3d at 377-78 (noting that no evidence was offered or taken in this matter and that in order to refute the mov-ant\u2019s request for return of property, \u201c[t]he government must do more than state, without documentary support, that it no longer possesses the property at issue\u201d); <em>see also Rufu v. United States, </em>20 F.3d 63, 65 (2d Cir.1994) (finding a procedural defect in the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 41(e)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> motion and noting that \u201c[a]t the very least, the district court was required to take evidence and make factual findings to identify any items still in the possession of the Government and any items that might have been lost\u201d); <em>Mora v. United States, </em>955 F.2d 156, 158 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201cResearch has revealed no authority for the proposition that a district court must rely on a representation, made by the government or any other litigant for that matter. Instead, in making a determination, a trial court must rely on the evidence before it.\u201d); 3A Charles Alan Wright, Nancy J. King &amp; Susan R. Klein, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure </em>\u00a7 675 (3d ed. 2010) (\u201cRule 41(g) requires the judge to receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>evidence on any issue of fact necessary to the decision on a motion to return and the same is true on a motion to suppress. An evidentiary hearing need not be set as a matter of course, <em>but only if the motion alleges facts that, if proved, would require the grant of relief\u201d </em>(footnote omitted, emphasis added)). Accordingly, as Mel-qu\u00edades argues on appeal, the district court erred by blindly relying on and placing complete trust in the government\u2019s unsubstantiated allegations. Where, as here, the parties disagree as to a material fact, the district court must receive evidence before ruling on the Rule 41(g) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Despite the government\u2019s contention to the contrary, <em>Howell </em>does not require us to affirm the district court\u2019s order. In <em>Howell </em>we did hold that \u201c[i]n order for an owner of property to invoke Rule 41(g), he must show that he had a possessory interest in the property seized by the government.\u201d <em>Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 974. However, <em>Howell </em>does not stand for the proposition that when the criminal proceedings have reached their conclusion, Rule 41(g) requires that movants attach to their initial motions evidence demonstrating their possessory interest. Neither does <em>Howell </em>allow adverse parties to rest on bare allegations that deny the existence of any such interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">In <em>Howell </em>the movant claimed a right to the return of $140,000 of Official Advanced Funds (\u201cOAF\u201d), money used by a confidential source in a drug bust. <em>Id. </em>at 973. In that case, the confidential source merely showed the $140,000 to Howell before agents arrested him. <em>Id. </em>We noted that \u201c[u]nder the <em>uncontradicted facts </em>in this matter there is no basis for any claim by the defendant of any possessory interest in the $140,000 of OAF.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974 (emphasis added). Because the undisputed facts of the case revealed that the property \u201cnever belonged to the defendant and he never gained ownership or control of the[ ] funds,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 975, it was unnecessary for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing before ruling on Howell\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Howell also asserted a right to return of three firearms seized by the government. Again, there was no need for the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing. First, as to Howell\u2019s possessory interest in the weapons, it was <em>\u201cundisputed </em>that the defendant was the record owner of all three of these firearms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 974 (emphasis added). In the absence of any disputed issue of fact, we progressed to the next step of the Rule 41(g) inquiry and found that, as a matter of law, the firearms could not be returned to Howell. Because Howell was a convicted felon, return of these weapons would have violated the federal statute prohibiting felons from possessing firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 976. In reaching the conclusion that Howell was not entitled to return of the firearms, we cited to <em>United States v. Felici, </em>208 F.3d 667 (8th Cir.2000),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the language of which supports Melquiades\u2019s contention that he is entitled to an opportunity to present evidence in support of his motion. In <em>Felici, </em>the Eighth Circuit held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">Rule 41(e) compels a district court to afford such persons an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>submit evidence in order to demonstrate that they are lawfully entitled to the challenged property.... <em>When it is apparent that the person seeking a return of the property is not lawfully entitled to own or possess the property, the district court need not hold an evidentiary hearing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><em>Felici, </em>208 F.3d at 670 (emphasis added). Because Howell sought money that unquestionably \u201cbelonged to the government at all times throughout the drug transaction,\u201d <em>Howell, </em>425 F.3d at 975, and sought the return of weapons which, as a matter of law, he could not possess, <em>id. </em>at 976-77, no evidentiary hearing was required. By comparison, in this case the parties dispute what property was seized from Mel-quiades\u2019s home. Furthermore, the government has not claimed that, as a matter of law, Melqu\u00edades would not be entitled to the property listed, if he can prove that it was in fact seized from his home. Therefore, we conclude that once a Rule 41(g)-movant alleges facts sufficient to sustain his claims, which are neither barred by law nor frivolous, the district court must collect some evidence<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to resolve material factual issues.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-15\">This conclusion is also consistent with <em>Howell\u2019s </em>observation that courts treat post-prosecution motions for return of property as civil actions in equity. <em>See id. </em>at 974. Our sister circuits have incorporated federal civil procedural standards when analyzing Rule 41 motions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Ritchie, </em>342 F.3d 903, 907-08 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that the mov-ant had alleged facts sufficient to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>a motion for return of property, and evaluating the government\u2019s opposition as it would have a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, </em>264 F.3d 1195, 1203-04 (10th Cir.2001) (considering a Rule 12(b)(1) standing challenge to a Rule 41(e) motion). Construing the government\u2019s opposition to be a facial attack on the plaintiffs\u2019 standing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the <em>Rodriguez-Aguirre </em>Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\">In a Rule 41(e) proceeding, a claimant must allege \u201ca colorable ownership, pos-sessory or security interest in at least a portion of the defendant property\u201d to satisfy the standing requirements. When the claimant alleges such an interest in the seized property, the standing requirements are satisfied \u201cbecause an owner or possessor of property that has been seized necessarily suffers an injury that can be redressed at least in part by the return of the seized property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1204 (quoting <em>United States v. $515,06042 in U.S. Currency, </em>152 F.3d 491, 497 (6th Cir.1998)). In <em>Rodriguez-Aguirre </em>the movants listed a number of items that they alleged had been \u201cseized from them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1205 (emphasis omitted). The Tenth Circuit deemed \u201cnot dis-positive of the standing inquiry\u201d the government\u2019s concerns (1) that the motion inadequately described the purportedly seized items, and (2) that the movants were not themselves the true owners \u2014 two arguments similar to those made in opposition to Melquiades\u2019s motion. <em>See id. </em>at 1206 n. 7. Rather than resolve these issues at an early stage in the proceedings, the <em>Rodriguez-Aguirre </em>Court concluded that \u201c[wjhether some of the listed property does not, in fact, belong to Appellants is a matter better dealt with on summary judgment or at trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">Similarly, in this case, Melqu\u00edades needed only to allege facts sufficient to demonstrate his possessory interest in the seized goods. Despite the government\u2019s arguments to the contrary, he was not burdened with \u201cshowing] that the United States ever had seized the asserted property, most of which he described in extremely vague terms,\u201d or \u201cthat the asserted property belonged to him.\u201d Rather, when evaluating whether the district court correctly denied Melquiades\u2019s motion based solely on the party\u2019s pleadings, \u201cwe are concerned only with the allegations contained in [the motion] and not with actual evidence.\u201d <em>See Rodriguez-Aguirre, </em>264 F.3d at 1206. To hold otherwise and \u201c[r]equir[e] evidence of ownership, as opposed to allegations of ownership, [would be] antithetical to the standards for reviewing 12(b)(1) motions to dismiss for lack of facial standing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Construing Melquiades\u2019s Rule 41(g) motion \u2014 the functional equivalent of a civil complaint \u2014 in Melquiades\u2019s favor, and interpreting his <em>pro se </em>filings liberally, Mel-qu\u00edades alleged that when federal law enforcement agents searched his home on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>January 13, 2003, they confiscated certain, specifically listed items. Melqu\u00edades clearly stated that, \u201cin this case the Movant is the owner of the property.\u201d He also asserted entitlement to its return. Thus, Melqu\u00edades has alleged facts sufficient to show that he has a possessory interest in some property, that the government seized these items, and that they were not returned. Accordingly, it was error to deny Melquiades\u2019s motion without collecting evidence to resolve the parties\u2019 factual disputes. <em>See Potes Ramirez, </em>260 F.3d at 1314.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">For these reasons, we conclude that once a Rule 41(g) movant alleges facts sufficient to sustain his claims \u2014 claims that are neither barred by law nor frivolous\u2014 the district court must collect some evidence to resolve the material factual issues disputed by the parties. Therefore, we REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-14\">. \"Courts do and should show a leniency to <em>pro se </em>litigants not enjoyed by those with the benefit of a legal education.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v.

Melqu\u00edades also relies on an Eighth Circuit opinion, <em>Blade v. United States, </em>256 Fed.Appx. 24 (8th Cir.2007), to support his argument that the district court erred by placing its trust in the government\u2019s assertions, without affording him an opportunity to present responsive arguments and supporting evidence. In <em>Blade, </em>a Rule 41(g) movant, a federal inmate, requested the return of nine specific items that the government had allegedly seized from him without notice. <em>Id. </em>at 25. The <em>Blade </em>Court cited to a string of Eighth Circuit opinions, including <em>Felici, </em>that suggest it is error to deny a Rule 41(g) motion before accepting evidence necessary for resolution of \"factual issues related to whether [the mov-ant] was entitled to the return of his property.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b607-6\">. It is worth noting that Department of Justice regulations appear to require the retention of such documents. Pursuant to 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 128-50.101:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">Each bureau shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining inventory records of its seized personal property to ensure that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">(a) The date the property was seized is recorded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">(b) All of the property associated with a case is recorded together under the case name and number;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">(c) The location of storage of the property is recorded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">(d) A well documented chain of custody is kept; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">(e) All information in the inventory records is accurate and current.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">41 C.F.R. \u00a7 128-50.101. The government's response to Melquiades\u2019s motion references just such an inventory. In addition, it discusses Special Agent Scott Oliver's Report of Investigation and his oral confirmation of what items were seized on January 13, 2003. However, the government did not attach the inventory, the Report, or the agent\u2019s statement to its response; it did not include these documents in the record on appeal; and it did not cite to any portion of the record where this evidence could be found.</p>\n<p id=\"ANR\">It is entirely possible that on remand the government will present evidence that it never seized the goods listed by Melquiades\u2019s motion. However, the district court cannot shirk its duty to collect such evidence in the face of disputed material issues of fact. <em>See Chambers, </em>192 F.3d at 378 (\u201cBecause no evidence was offered or taken in this matter, the government did not meet its burden and the District Court did not discharge its duty under Rule 41(e).\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b607-17\">. <em>Howell </em>is also distinguishable from this case because in <em>Howell </em>the government actually did attach significant evidence to its Rule 41(g) opposition. In response to Howell's motion, the government submitted seven exhibits: an FBI report on the arrest of Howell and search of the relevant premises (N.D. Ga. 4:00-cr-65-HLM-GGB, Doc. No. 93, Ex. 1, at 13); a DEA investigation report <em>(id., </em>Ex. 2, at 18); a second FBI report <em>(id., </em>Ex. 3, at 22); an FBI receipt for property received <em>(id., </em>Ex. 4 at 25); an FBI consent to search form <em>(id., </em>Ex. 5, at 28); an FBI report itemizing documents seized in the search <em>(id., </em>Ex. 6, at 30); and an FBI report describing a weapon found in Howell\u2019s vehicle <em>(id., </em>Ex. 7, at 33).

Gov\u2019t of Augusta-Richmond County, </em>501 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir.2007)). Because the government has not referred this Court to any extrinsic material, we also construe its attack on Melquiades\u2019s motion as facial in nature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
