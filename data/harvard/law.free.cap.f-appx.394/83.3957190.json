He argues that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance due to an actual conflict of interest stemming from the payment of legal fees by Jason Schillings, a former client and a government witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>We have carefully reviewed the record and the appellate arguments and conclude that the district court did not err in finding that Barth failed to establish an actual conflict of interest which adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>526 F.3d 852, 856-57 (5th Cir.2008). The conflict here remained purely hypothetical. <em>See id. </em>Barth\u2019s attorney represented Schillings in an unrelated civil matter; the representation had been unequivocally terminated prior to trial; and the facts and issues of the previous representation had no relation to the criminal charges against Barth. <em>See id. </em>Moreover, the payment of legal fees by one client for another does not establish, by itself, an actual conflict of interest. <em>See United States v. Corona, </em>108 F.3d 565, 575 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b107-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
