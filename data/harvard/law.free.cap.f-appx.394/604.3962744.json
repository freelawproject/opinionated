On appeal, Ozona-Rodriguez argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>cally, he asserts that his sentence fails to achieve the goals enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) by failing to: provide just punishment; reflect the seriousness of the offense; promote respect for the law; and deter others in the community from committing similar offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Where appropriate, we review a final sentence imposed by the district court for \u201creasonableness\u201d under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1273 n. 25 (11th Cir.2008). The standard is deferential, and we must take into account the totality of the circumstances in reviewing the district court\u2019s sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">A sentence is substantively unreasonable \u201cif it does not achieve the purposes of sentencing stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary,\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment for the offense, deterring criminal conduct, protecting the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). We defer to the district court\u2019s judgment regarding the weight given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, unless the district court has made \u201ca clear error of judgment\u201d under the facts of a particular case. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. A district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor individually. <em>Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324. Rather, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). A sentencing court also \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that [it] ... has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). Finally, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Upon review of the record, and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. Although Ozona-Rodriguez\u2019s 24-month sentence reflected the statutory maximum, it was nonetheless at the bottom of the applicable guideline range. The district court based its decision on two major observations: first, that Ozona-Rodriguez had not been punished the first time he had been deported, and therefore he required more serious punishment for this offense; and second, that his criminal history, consisting mainly of shoplifting offenses, was \u201cimpressive.\u201d Based on his history of repeated offenses for which he had yet to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>receive any significant consequences, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a 24-month sentence in order to serve \u00a7 S553(a)\u2019s goals of deterrence, protecting the public, and promoting respect for the law. Accordingly, we hold that the district court imposed a substantively reasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">. Ozona-Rodriguez's brief mentions procedural reasonableness in passing but argues only that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Therefore, he has abandoned any challenge that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable, and we do not address that issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that issues not raised \"plainly and prominently\u201d in the initial brief are abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
