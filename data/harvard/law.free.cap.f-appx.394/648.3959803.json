He now appeals his convictions raising one issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">Whether the district court committed legal error and misled the jury as to the Government\u2019s burden of proof when it defined \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 subjectively\u2014 that is, when it described the proof required in terms of what a juror would rely upon in his or her own affairs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The district court instructed on reasonable doubt in accordance with the Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">[ A] real doubt, based on your reason and common sense after you\u2019ve carefully and impartially considered all the evidence in the case. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof so convincing that you would be willing to rely and act on it without hesitation in the most important of your own affairs. If you are convinced that the Defendant has been proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, say so. If you are not convinced, say so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">11th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions 3. We have repeatedly approved of this definition of reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hansen, </em>262 F.3d 1217, 1249-50 (affirming jury instructions that defined reasonable doubt as \u201cproof of such a convincing character that you would be willing to rely or act upon it without hesitation in a decision involving the most important of your affairs.\u201d); <em>United States v. Daniels, </em>986 F.2d 451, 457-58 (11th Cir.1993), <em>op. readopted on reh\u2019g, </em>5 F.3d 495, 496 (11th Cir.1993) (rejecting a defendant\u2019s argument that the \u201cwilling to act\u201d language in this Circuit\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction impermissibly lowers the government\u2019s burden of proof); <em>United States v. Clayton, </em>643 F.2d 1071, 1074-75 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Since this panel is bound by these prior decisions, <em>United States v. Steele, </em>147 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.1998) <em>(en banc), </em>we are obliged to sustain the challenged jury instruction and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
