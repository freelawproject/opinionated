In this opinion, we direct the district court to identify in the judgment of conviction 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(a)(2) as the statutes of conviction for Count 1, rather than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and 924(e), as we had instructed in the original opinion. Accordingly, Plaintiff-Appellee\u2019s petition for panel rehearing is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Hayward Feaster appeals from his convictions and sentences for (1) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2); (2) possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C); and (3) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Feaster argues: (1) for the first time on appeal, that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(c) are unconstitutional; (2) that his 262-month sentence was unreasonable; and (3) that the judgment improperly reflects the statutes on which he was convicted. After thorough review, we affirm in part, and vacate and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the constitutionality of a statute as it is a question of law. <em>United States v. Cespedes, </em>151 F.3d 1329, 1331 (11th Cir.1998). We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">First, we reject Feaster\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred in convicting him of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(c) due to the provisions\u2019 unconstitutionality.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a convicted felon \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). We have held that section 922(g)(1) is not a facially unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that \u201cthe jurisdictional element of the statute, <em>ie., </em>the requirement that the felon \u2018possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u2019 immunizes \u00a7 922(g)(1) from [a] facial constitutional attack\u201d). Further, we have held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) was not unconstitutional as applied to a defendant who only possessed a firearm intrastate because \u201c \u00a7 922(g) is an attempt to regulate guns that have a connection to interstate commerce\u201d and the government showed that the firearm in question \u201chad traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 390 (11th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Here, the district court did not plainly err in convicting Feaster of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1). For starters, Feaster\u2019s argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is an unconstitutional extension of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power is foreclosed by our prece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>dent. <em>See Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1273; <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390; <em>Dupree, </em>258 F.3d at 1259-60; <em>see also United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2825, 174 L.Ed.2d 556 (2009) (holding that our prior precedent is binding \u201cunless and until it is overruled by this [C]ourt <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court\u201d). As for Feaster\u2019s claim that \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s reach is not limited to constitutional applications because \u201ccommerce\u201d could encompass only intrastate commerce, this argument also fails because <em>we </em>have held that \u00a7 922(g)(l)\u2019s jurisdictional element, <em>\u201ci.e., </em>the requirement that the felon \u2018possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u2019 immunizes \u00a7 922(g)(1) from [a] facial constitutional attack.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>263 F.3d at 1273; <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"AtM\">Feaster\u2019s as-applied challenge to \u00a7 922(g)(1) is likewise unavailing, because Feaster waived the issue of the sufficiency of the government\u2019s proof as to the interstate-commerce element by virtue of his knowing and voluntary guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Cunningham, </em>161 F.3d 1343, 1344, 1346 &amp; n. 2 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that we have held that an as-applied constitutional challenge to the sufficiency of the government\u2019s evidence on the connection-with-commerce element, similar to that in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(8), was nonjurisdictional, and that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea, therefore, waived the issue on appeal). Feaster\u2019s as-applied challenge further fails because he admitted during the plea hearing that the firearms had been transferred across state lines into Florida, and the government need only demonstrate that the firearm in question \u201ctraveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390; <em>Dupree, </em>258 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">Nor has Feaster shown that \u00a7 924(c) is unconstitutional. Section 924(c)(1)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">[ A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">We have \u201csquarely rejected\u201d the argument that a \u00a7 924(c) conviction \u201ccannot stand because Congress lacked the power under the Commerce Clause to enact [\u00a7 924(c) ].\u201d <em>United States v. Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d 1020, 1028 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that nothing in recent Supreme Court decisions altered our prior conclusion that \u00a7 924(c) is not an unconstitutional extension of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power); <em>United States v. DePace, </em>120 F.3d 233, 235 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997) (agreeing with the courts that have rejected the contention \u201cthat [ ] \u00a7 924(c) is an unconstitutional effort to regulate intrastate, non-economic activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-13\">As applied here, Feaster\u2019s challenge to \u00a7 924(c) as an unconstitutional extension of Congress\u2019s Commerce Clause power is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See Ferreira, </em>275 F.3d at 1028; <em>DePace, </em>120 F.3d at 235 n. 2. The district court therefore did not plainly err in convicting Feaster of violating \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">Feaster has also failed to show that the district court plainly erred in convicting him of violating \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) or 924(c) on the ground that the statutes unconstitutionally infringe on Feaster\u2019s Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Amendment states that \u201c[a] well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. II. In <em>District of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>Columbia v. Heller, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted this language to \u201cguarantee [an] individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation.\u201d 554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 2797,171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008). The <em>Heller </em>Court held that the District of Columbia\u2019s ban on handgun possession in the home by law-abiding citizens violated the Second Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 2821. The Court reasoned that \u201cthe inherent right of self-defense has been central to the Second Amendment right\u201d and that \u201c[t]he handgun ban amounted] to a prohibition of an entire class of \u2018arms\u2019 ... overwhelmingly chosen by American society for that lawful purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2817. The Court qualified the right to bear arms: \u201c[l]ike most rights, [it] is not unlimited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2816. \u201c[N]othing in <em>[Heller </em>] should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2816-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">After <em>Heller, </em>we held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is a \u201cconstitutional avenue to restrict the Second Amendment right of\u2019 convicted felons. <em>United States v. Rozier, </em>598 F.3d 768, 771 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Apr. 30, 2010) (No. 09-10590). Since <em>Heller </em>expressly disclaimed any erosion of the \u201clongstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons,\u201d we held that \u201cstatutes disqualifying felons from possessing a firearm under any and all circumstances do not offend the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we have not, nor has the Supreme Court, addressed whether \u00a7 924(c) violates the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Because we have held that the circumscription of a convicted felon\u2019s right to bear arms, as found in \u00a7 922(g)(1), does not violate the Second Amendment, Feast-er\u2019s argument that his \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction violated the Second Amendment is without merit. <em>Id. </em>Indeed, any infringement on Feaster\u2019s \u201cinherent right of self-defense\u201d is irrelevant because statutes, such as \u00a7 922(g)(1), \u201cdisqualifying felons from possessing a firearm under any and all circumstances do not offend the Second Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 770-71. In addition, the Supreme Court has not decided the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s penalty provisions, we have not determined whether \u00a7 924(c) violates the Second Amendment, and the other circuits are split on the issue. Thus, the issue is not \u201cclear under current law,\u201d and there can be no plain error. <em>See Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d at 588. Accordingly, if there was any error by the district court in convicting Feaster of violating \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(c), it could not have been plain.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Feaster has also failed to show that his sentence was unreasonable. In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. There is a \u201crange of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and the burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">We will remand for resentencing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted). We \u201cordinarily ... [will] expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Moreover, comparing the sentence imposed against the statutory maximum sentence is one indication of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 751-52 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">The record demonstrates that Feaster\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable. First, there is no dispute that the district court accurately calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, and based the sentence on facts that were not clearly erroneous. Feaster\u2019s ai'gument that the district court only provided a \u201ctalismanic recitation\u201d of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is not supported by the record, which shows that the district court considered and rejected Feaster\u2019s arguments for a downward departure or a downward variance and explicitly found that the sentence imposed was both sufficient to satisfy the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a) and necessary to address the seriousness of the offense. Further, the district court adequately explained the 262-month sentence when it stated that it had: (1) considered Feaster\u2019s arguments, which included his financial support of his eight children, the absence of his father, and his stepfather\u2019s drug-related activities; (2) Feaster\u2019s personal statement; (3) the information contained in the PSI; and (4) the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456 (stating that a district court\u2019s rationale is legally sufficient where the record makes clear that it has considered the evidence and the arguments). Thus, Feaster has not shown that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Nor has he shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. As the record shows, the district court determined that the sentence was in accord with the seriousness of the offense and the need to provide Feaster with drug treatment and medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A) and (2)(D). Further, the court found that there were no mitigating circumstances warranting a below-guideline-range sentence and that the sentence imposed was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of sentencing.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Taking the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the discretion the district court is afforded in weighing those factors, the 262-month sentence, which was at the lowest point of the guideline imprisonment range and within the statutory-maximum sentence, was not \u201coutside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted); <em>see also Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788; <em>Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 751-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Finally, we do agree, however, with Feaster\u2019s claim that the judgment improperly reflects the statutes on which he was convicted. While a court fundamentally errs when it enters \u201ca judgment of conviction against a defendant who has not been charged, tried or found guilty of the crime recited in the judgment,\u201d we may correct the error by vacating the judgment and remanding \u201cthe case to the district court for entry of a judgment in accordance with the charge and the jury verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>190 F.3d 1247, 1252 (11th Cir.1999); <em>see United States v. Anderton, </em>136 F.3d 747, 751 (11th Cir.1998) (remanding with directions to the district court to correct clerical errors when the statute cited in the judgment and commitment order was incorrect). Such a remedy is appropriate \u201conly if the erroneous entry of the judgment was considered a clerical error, and the correction of the judgment would not prejudice the defendant in any reversible way.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>190 F.3d at 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Because the judgment misidentifies the statutes of conviction relevant to Count 1, and Feaster does not contend that the error in the judgment is anything more than a clerical error, we vacate and remand with instruction to identify 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 924(a)(2) as the statutes of conviction for Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">AFFIRMED in part and VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\">. Where, as here, a party fails to raise an issue before the lower court, we review the issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>459 F.3d 1276, 1282-83 (11th Cir.2006). Plain error occurs if (1) there was error, (2) that was plain, (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, and (4) seriously affected the \u201cfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283 (quotation omitted). An error cannot be \"plain\u201d unless it is \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b589-6\">.
