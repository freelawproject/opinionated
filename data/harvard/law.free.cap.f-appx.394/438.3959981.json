MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b463-17\">This case involves the constitutionality of Colorado\u2019s requirement that independent candidates for partisan public office be registered as unaffiliated with- a political party for nearly seventeen months before the general election if they wish to appear on the general-election ballot. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 l-4-802(l)(f)(I), (g) (2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff Kathleen Curry, an incumbent member of the Colorado House of Representatives, changed her registration to unaffiliated eleven months before the November 2010 general election and, therefore, is barred from the ballot on any basis other than as a write-in candidate. She and the other Plaintiffs (voters eligible to cast ballots for Representative Curry if she qualified for the 2010 ballot) brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Colorado Secretary of State, Bernie Buescher, to overturn the statutory registration period. The district court granted the Secretary summary judgment. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Representative Curry is presently the State Representative for Colorado State House District 61. She was first elected to that office as a member of the Democratic Party of Colorado in 2004, and was re-elected as a Democrat in 2006 and 2008. In December 2009, however, she changed her party affiliation to unaffiliated, hoping to seek re-election as an independent candidate on the November 2010 general-election ballot. She explains that her \u201cpolitical philosophy and beliefs\u201d caused her to \u201cclash[ ]\u201d with Democratic party leaders on several issues. Aplt.App. at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Under Colorado law, unaffiliated candidates for partisan public offices in general elections must be nominated by a petition signed by eligible electors. Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 l-4-802(l)(c). The petition must be filed no later than 140 days before the general election. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lA-802(l)(f)(I). No person, however, may be nominated by petition as an unaffiliated candidate \u201cunless the person was registered as ... unaffiliated ... for at least twelve months pri- or to the last date the petition may be filed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 l-4-802(l)(g). Consequently, a person must have registered as unaffiliated at least one year and 140 days before the upcoming general election, i.e., sixteen-and-three-fifths months. So long as the petition is timely, in the proper form, and bears the requisite number of signatures, and the petitioner is sufficiently disaffiliated, the petitioner qualifies for the general-election ballot without further obstacles.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">For the 2010 election, Representative Curry needed to register as unaffiliated by June 15, 2009. She missed that date, however, by six months, because she was unaware of Colorado\u2019s disaffiliation laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In developing her constitutional challenge, Representative Curry contrasts the laws applicable to unaffiliated candidates with those applicable to partisan candidates, all ultimately seeking general-election ballot access.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">A person seeking a party\u2019s nomination to run in the general election must first win the party\u2019s primary election. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1-4-101(1), (3). In order to compete in the primary, however, the person must either be selected during the party\u2019s assembly process or file a petition. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 lAt-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>If access to the primary-election ballot is through the party\u2019s assembly process, the person must have been affiliated with that party during the twelve-month period before the assembly, which must be held at least 70 days before the primary election. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1-4-601(1), (4)(a). The primary is held three months before the general election. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 1-4-101(1), -104(17). The twelve-month period prior to the assembly, however, may be shortened by major party rules or minor party constitutions and by-laws. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 \u00a7 1-4-601(4)(a), \u20141304(2)(b), (c). For instance, the Democratic Party of Colorado has essentially cut nearly six months from that period. <em>See </em>Aplt.App. at 74 (Democratic Party rule stating that \u201c[a] person shall be eligible for designation by an assembly ... if that person has been a registered Democrat for a period of at least 12 months immediately preceding the date of the General Election\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">On the other hand, if the person seeks to be placed on the party\u2019s primary-election ballot through petition, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-4-801(1), -802(l)(a), the petitioner must have been affiliated with the party for at least twelve months before filing the petition, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-4-801(3), -802(l)(g), which can be \u201cno later than seventy-five days before the primary election,\u201d \u00a7\u00a7 1-4-801(5), 802(l)(f)(II). Unlike the political-party assembly-nomination process, there is no statutory provision allowing the affiliation period for the petition-nomination process to be shortened. Consequently, a political-party petitioner must be affiliated with the party for seventeen-and-one-half months before the general election.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">Plaintiffs sued Secretary Buescher in March 2010.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They alleged that the disaffiliation requirement in section 1-4-802(l)(g) violates their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, and equal protection. The parties stipulated that the requirement was intended \u201cto prevent partisan candidates from entering races as unaffiliated candidates in order to circumvent the party primary process or to bleed off votes from another candidate, and as part of a more general statewide policy intended to promote political stability and protect the integrity of Colorado\u2019s political process.\u201d ApltApp. at 193.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>court reviewed the stipulation, considered the parties\u2019 arguments, and granted the Secretary summary judgment, prompting this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u201cWe review de novo the grant of summary judgment to determine whether any genuine issues of material fact were in dispute and, if not, whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law at issue.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Commerce Constr. Servs., Inc., </em>531 F.3d 1190, 1193 (10th Cir.2008). \u201cBecause the parties do not dispute the facts, we have before us a purely legal question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">II. Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Association</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The First Amendment, made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, bars government from passing laws that \u201cabridg[e] the freedom of speech.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. I. Freedom of association is \u201can indispensable means of preserving\u201d free speech, <em>Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 618, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984), and is protected by the First Amendment, <em>see Healy v. James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 181, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">To determine whether a state\u2019s ballot-access restrictions comport with the First Amendment, we must weigh the alleged constitutional injury against the state\u2019s justifications for restricting' ballot access:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">[ We] must first consider the character and magnitude of the asserted injury to the rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments that the plaintiff seeks to vindicate. [We] then must identify and evaluate the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed by its rule. In passing judgment, [we] must not only determine the legitimacy and strength of each of those interests; [we] also must consider the extent to which those interests make it necessary to burden the plaintiffs rights. Only after weighing all these factors [will we be] in a position to decide whether the challenged provision is unconstitutional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-13\"><em>Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. 780, 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-14\">A. Character and Magnitude of the Constitutional Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">Plaintiffs argue Colorado\u2019s requirement that Representative Curry disaffiliate 12 months before the deadline for filing a nominating petition results in a significant constitutional injury, as she is now denied the opportunity to otherwise qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>for appearance on the general-election ballot as an independent candidate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We note Representative Curry\u2019s acknowledgment that her untimely disaffiliation was due to her lack of awareness of the requirements of Colorado law, rather than any component of the disaffiliation statute. Aplt. App. at 188. Plaintiffs do not identify any practical impediment to Representative Curry meeting the requirements of section l-4-802(l)(g) and disaffiliating twelve months before the deadline for filing a nominating petition. Indeed, she concedes that she had become \u201cincreasingly disenchanted with party politics over a period of five years\u201d before she eventually disaffiliated. Aplt.App. at 187. Nor do Plaintiffs contend that the disaffiliation deadline would have burdened their efforts to gather signatures for a nominating petition. <em>Cf. Anderson, </em>460 U.S. at 792, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (noting that a state\u2019s deadline for independent candidates to file a nominating petition burdened the candidate\u2019s signature-gathering efforts in the context of a nationwide campaign). Thus, the sole constitutional injury Plaintiffs present is the denial of ballot access.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Denial of ballot access to a prospective candidate intrudes upon \u201cimportant [constitutional] rights,\u201d <em>Rainbow Coalition of Okla. v. Okla. State Elec. Bd., </em>844 F.2d 740, 743 (10th Cir.1988), held by both the candidate and her supporters, <em>see Anderson, </em>460 U.S. at 786-88, 103 S.Ct. 1564. Accordingly, we must address whether Colorado\u2019s interests in imposing its disaffiliation requirement justify, excluding Representative Curry\u2019s name from the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">B. The Weighing Process</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">\u201c[N]ot all restrictions imposed by the States on candidates\u2019 eligibility for the ballot impose constitutionally-suspect burdens on voters\u2019 rights to associate or to choose among candidates.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>460 U.S. at 788, 103 S.Ct. 1564. \u201c \u2018[A]s a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Storer v. Brown, </em>415 U.S. 724, 730, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974)).\u2019 Thus, \u201cthe State\u2019s important regulatory interests are generally sufficient to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions\u201d on election procedures. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\"><em>Storer v. Brown </em>is the seminal Supreme Court decision addressing a state\u2019s disaffiliation requirement for independent candidates. There, faced with a First Amendment challenge from independent candidates and their supporters, the Court upheld a California statute that required independent candidates to be disaffiliated from political parties for the twelve-month period before the primary election. 415 U.S. at 728, 94 S.Ct. 1274.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>explained that a disaffiliation requirement maintains \u201cthe integrity of the various routes to the ballot\u201d by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6Z\">refusing to recognize independent candidates who do not make early plans to leave a party and take the alternative course to the ballot. It works against independent candidacies prompted by short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel. It is also a substantial barrier to a party fielding an \u2018independent\u2019 candidate to capture and bleed off votes in the general election that might well go to another party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 735, 94 S.Ct. 1274. Accordingly, the Court declared that the twelve-month disaffiliation period furthered California\u2019s interest in the stability of its political system, and that the state\u2019s interest was compelling, \u201coutweighing the interest the candidate and his supporters may have in making a late rather than an early decision to seek independent ballot status.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274. And while other methods might suffice, the Court indicated that the Constitution did not require California to sacrifice the political stability of its election system, \u201cwith profound consequences for the entire citizenry, merely in the interest of particular candidates and their supporters having instantaneous access to the ballot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The decision in <em>Storer </em>led both this court and the Colorado Supreme Court to declare Colorado\u2019s twelve-month disaffiliation period constitutional. In <em>Thournir v. Meyer, </em>909 F.2d 408 (10th Cir.1990), this court viewed Colorado\u2019s disaffiliation period<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as a reasonable restriction intended \u201cto protect the integrity of the party system and to prohibit frivolous candidacies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. As such, the disaffiliation requirement did not unduly burden the First Amendment rights of an unaffiliated candidate. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Storer, </em>415 U.S. at 733, 94 S.Ct. 1274).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In <em>Colorado Libertarian Party v. Secretary of State of Colorado, </em>817 P.2d 998 (Colo.1991), the Colorado Supreme Court cited <em>Thoumir </em>with approval, quoted extensively from <em>Storer, </em>extended the disaffiliation requirement to candidates of \u201cpolitical organizations,\u201d and concluded that \u201cColorado\u2019s one-year unaffiliation requirement preserves the state\u2019s compelling interest in maintaining the integrity of its ballot access system, and thus promotes the overall stability of the state\u2019s election process, without unfairly or unnecessarily impinging upon the [political organization\u2019s] associational rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1004 (quotations and citation omitted). The court also observed that while \u201ca disaffiliation provision may preclude ... voters from supporting a particular ineligible candidate, they remain free to support and promote other candidates who satisfy the State\u2019s disaffiliation requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Plaintiffs urge us to disregard <em>Storer, Thoumir, </em>and <em>Colorado Libertarian Party. </em>They argue that in <em>Storer, </em>the challenged disaffiliation statute did not discriminate between independent candidates and party candidates. Similarly, they contend that Colorado\u2019s \u201caffiliation require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ments for independent candidates and candidates for political parties were essentially] the same\u201d when those cases were decided, but is no longer true today. Aplt. Opening Br. at 26 n. 4; <em>see also </em>Reply Br. at 10 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">To be sure, in <em>Storer </em>the Supreme Court observed that California\u2019s disaffiliation statute \u201cinvolve[d] no discrimination against independents,\u201d as the statute required independents to \u201cbe clear of political party affiliations for a year before the primary\u201d and party candidates to be disaffiliated from other parties a year before filing a declaration of candidacy. 415 U.S. at 733-34, 94 S.Ct. 1274. Both <em>Thoumir </em>and <em>Colorado Libertarian Party </em>addressed Colorado\u2019s disaffiliation statute before political parties were permitted to vary the disaffiliation period by a major party\u2019s rules or a minor party\u2019s constitution or bylaws. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 \u00a7 1-4-601(4)(a), -1304(2)(b), (c). As we indicated earlier, however, the ability of major and minor parties to vary an affiliation/disaffiliation period applies only when the putative candidate seeks nomination through the assembly process. When the road to the ballot involves a nominating petition, all hopeful candidates are subject to an invariable twelve-month period. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-4-801(3), -802(g). Consequently, the burdens of the twelve-month disaffiliation requirement are shared equally by petitioning independents and petitioning party members.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Granted, an individual like Representative Curry, whose political philosophy motivates her to run as an independent rather than as a member of a political party, has no way to invoke a shortened disaffiliation period. The First Amendment, however, does not require Colorado to so \u201cprecisely draw[]\u201d its election statutes as to eliminate every disparity between independent and party candidates, at least in cases involving disaffiliation requirements whose effects are felt \u201cwholly within the boundaries of [the state].\u201d <em>See Anderson, </em>460 U.S. at 804, 805, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (stating that a state\u2019s justification for imposing filing restrictions that \u201cdiscriminate against independents\u201d is weaker in \u201cnationwide Presidential election[s]\u201d). It is enough that Colorado\u2019s disaffiliation statutes are \u201cgenerally[ Applicable and evenhanded\u201d for all petitioning candidates. <em>See id. </em>at 788 n. 9, 103 S.Ct. 1564.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Further, the Secretary has suggested valid reasons for treating petitioning individuals differently than assembly-bound individuals in terms of the rigidness of disaffiliation periods. For instance, individuals \u201cwho subject themselves to the assembly process face scrutiny by those who are active within their party and who are likely to have greater allegiance to the party. These [prospective] candidates must obtain support at the precinct, county and state levels.\u201d Aplee. Br. at 22. Consequently, the assembly process can winnow out those prospective candidates motivated by \u201cshort-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel,\u201d <em>Storer, </em>415 U.S. at 735, 94 S.Ct. 1274, notwithstanding a truncated disaffiliation period. In contrast, petitioning independent candidates proceed directly to the general-election ballot without being subjected to a similar winnowing process.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Plaintiffs also argue that the General Assembly\u2019s recent change of the disaffiliation period from \u201cat least twelve months prior to the last date the [nominating] petition may be filed,\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>4-802(l)(g), to \u201cthe first business day of the January immediately preceding the general election,\u201d 2010 Colo. Legis. Serv. ch. 824, \u00a7 5 (effective for the 2012 general election), shows that the state\u2019s interests can be served by a less burdensome disaffiliation requirement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While that may be true, the United States Supreme Court has not declared the presence of a \u201cless drastic way of satisfying [the state\u2019s] legitimate interests\u201d determinative in a disaffiliation case. <em>See Anderson v. Celebrezze, </em>460 U.S. at 806, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (quotation omitted). Moreover, in <em>Thoumir, </em>this court closed the door to any inquiry into whether the state is pursuing its interests regarding disaffiliation in the least restrictive means possible. 909 F.2d at 409 n. 4 (citing <em>Rainbow Coal. of Okla. v. Okla. State Elec. Bd., </em>844 F.2d 740, 742 (10th Cir.1988), and declining to subject disaffiliation statute to strict scrutiny). Thus, the Colorado Assembly\u2019s decision to truncate the disaffiliation period, starting in 2012, does not warrant the conclusion that the longer period applicable to Representative Curry is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Plaintiffs next contend that Colorado\u2019s justifications for requiring disaffiliation do not apply to Representative Curry because she is a legitimate candidate, having already served three terms in office and run unopposed in the past two elections. There is absolutely nothing in the election statutes, however, that allows a case-by-case inquiry into whether operation of the disaffiliation requirement is warranted. It is beyond cavil that we are without authority to legislate such an inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As we noted earlier, the Supreme Court in <em>Storer </em>held that California\u2019s interest in \u201cmaintaining the integrity of the various routes to the ballot,\u201d achieved through a twelve-month disaffiliation provision, outweighed independent candidates\u2019 interest in making a late \u201cdecision to seek independent ballot status.\u201d 415 U.S. at 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274. Colorado\u2019s interest is no less compelling in this case, and is achieved through a similar disaffiliation requirement. Plaintiffs have failed to convince us that we should weigh the pertinent interests any differently than the Supreme Court did in <em>Storer. </em>Nor have they identified a principled basis on which to distinguish this case from <em>Thoumir </em>and <em>Colorado LibeHarian Party, </em>both of which upheld Colorado\u2019s disaffiliation requirement against similar FirsU-Amendment challenges. Thus, we conclude that Colorado\u2019s compelling interest in political stability, which required Representative Curry to disaffiliate from the Democratic Party twelve months before filing a nominating petition, outweighs her interest in pursuing an independent candidacy after the statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Consequently, the twelve-month disaffiliation requirement in section l-4-802(l)(g) does not violate the Plaintiffs\u2019 First-Amendment rights. <em>See ACLU of N.M. v. Santillanes, </em>546 F.3d 1313, 1322 (10th Cir.2008) (\u201cRestrictions that are generally applicable, even-handed, politically neutral, and which protect the reliability and integrity of the election process are generally not considered severe restrictions and are upheld.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">III. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause provides that \u201c[n]o state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. \u201cEqual protection is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>be treated alike.\u201d <em>Abdulhaseeb v. Calbone, </em>600 F.3d 1301, 1322 n. 10 (10th Cir.2010) (quotation omitted). Conversely, while a state \u201cmust treat like cases alike,\u201d it \u201cmay treat unlike cases accordingly.\u201d <em>Coalition for Equal Rights, Inc. v. Ritter, </em>517 F.3d 1195, 1199 (10th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">For persons to be similarly situated, they must be alike \u201cin all relevant respects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs cursorily assert that Representative Curry is similarly situated to \u201cpolitical party candidates,\u201d but is treated worse because political parties can, and have, shortened the disaffiliation periods for their members. Aplt. Opening Br. at 46.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As we have already pointed out, however, only those persons who pursue the assembly path toward their party\u2019s nomination are eligible for shortened disaffiliation periods. Independents, like Representative Curry, do not have to participate in assemblies or even a subsequent primary election. Instead, once independents have the requisite number of signatures on a nominating petition, they go straight to the general election ballot. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 1-4-802. Thus, Representative Curry is not similarly situated to persons in a political party seeking to be designated at an assembly so they can compete for their party\u2019s nomination in a primary election.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Nor is Representative Curry similarly situated to party members whose political course starts by petition, because a qualifying petition in a contested party race only gets that individual onto a primary ballot. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-4-801(1) (major parties), -1304(1.5)(a) (minor parties). Unlike independents then, a qualifying political-party petitioner does not necessarily qualify for the general-election ballot. A qualifying political-party petitioner will appear on the general-election ballot only after winning her party\u2019s primary or having no primary challenger. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-4-104.5(2) (major parties), -1304(1.5)(d) (minor parties); <em>see also Storer, </em>415 U.S. at 745, 94 S.Ct. 1274 (recognizing that \u201cthe political party and the independent candidate approaches to political activity are entirely different and neither is a satisfactory substitute for the other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Even if we were to conclude that Representative Curry is similarly situated to petitioning-party members, she would be unable to establish an equal-protection violation. Colorado\u2019s election statutes prescribe the same period for <em>all </em>petitioning plaintiffs whether they are independents or members of a political party, i.e., twelve months before filing a nominating petition. <em>See </em>Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-4-801(3) (major parties), -802(l)(g) (independents and minor parties). Moreover, these statutes treat independents <em>better </em>than party petitioners when the affiliation/disaffiliation periods are measured from the date of the general election.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection challenge fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The motion for leave to file an amicus brief, submitted by Jacqueline Salit and Joelle Riddle, is GRANTED. The Secretary\u2019s motion requesting that we supplement the record and take judicial notice of Representative Curry\u2019s pursuit of a write-in candidacy is DENIED.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b463-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.

In May 2010, the Colorado General Assembly changed the requirement, starting with the 2012 general election, to require unaffiliated registration \"no later than the first business day of the January immediately preceding the general election for which the person desires to be placed in nomination.\u201d 2010 Colo.

For convenience, we refer to the Colorado law as a disaffiliation law, as it certainly is in this case. The law, however, may be broader than disaffiliation and, if so, apply to those seeking ballot access who have never formally affiliated with a political party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b465-6\">. Specifically, Plaintiffs joined litigation brought several months earlier by La Plata County Commissioner Joelle Riddle and several electors who supported her. Like Representative Curry, Commissioner Riddle had untimely switched her party affiliation to unaffiliated and was barred by section 1-4-802(l)(g) from having her name placed on the ballot. Commissioner Riddle has since decided not to seek re-election, and thus has not appealed the district court\u2019s decision. Nevertheless, she seeks leave to file an amicus brief along with Jacqueline Salit, a New York resident and President of the Committee for a Unified Independent Party, Inc.

In more detail, the parties agreed that the statute serves Colorado's interests</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">by thwarting frivolous or fraudulent candidates, avoiding voter confusion, preventing the clogging of election machinery required to administer an election, maintaining the integrity of the various routes to the ballot (i.e., preventing a potential candidate defeated in a primaiy from petitioning onto the ballot, thereby defeating the purpose of the primary system), presenting the people with understandable choices between candidates who have not previously competed against one another in a primary, refusing to recognize independent candidates who do not make early plans to leave a party and take the alternative course to the ballot, working against independent candidacies prompted by short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel, providing a substantial barrier to a party fielding an \"independent\u201d candidate to capture and bleed off votes in the general election that might well go to another party, ensuring that voters are not presented with a laundry list of candidates who have decided on the eve of a major election to seek public office, reserving'the general election ballot for major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>straggles and not allowing it to be used as a forum for continuing intraparty feuds, and limiting the names on the ballot to those who have won the primaries and those independents who have properly qualified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWW\">Aplt.App. at 193-94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\">. In <em>Crawford v. Marion County Election Board, </em>553 U.S. 181, 190 n. 8, 128 S.Ct. 1610, 170 L.Ed.2d 574 (2008), the Supreme Court per Justice Stevens (who had also authored Anderson) described <em>Anderson's </em>test as a \u201cflexible\u201d approach, and indicated that strict scrutiny does not apply \"to all laws imposing a burden on the right to vote.\u201d In <em>ACLU of New Mexico v. Santillanes, </em>546 F.3d 1313, 1321 (10th Cir.2008), this court seemingly approved the district court's characterization of the <em>Anderson </em>test as a form of \"intermediate scrutiny.\u201d In <em>Rainbow Coalition of Oklahoma v. Oklahoma State Election Board, </em>844 F.2d 740, 742 (10th Cir.1988), we applied <em>Anderson </em>and suggested that strict scrutiny was not an option in ballot-access cases, a position followed by the district court in this case. In any event, it is clear that <em>Anderson's </em>formulation of the test governs, and we, like the district court, apply it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b467-6\">. Plaintiffs purport to challenge Colorado\u2019s disaffiliation period both on its face and as applied to Representative Curry. As the district noted, however, they essentially advance only an as-applied challenge, ultimately focusing their arguments on the effect the election statutes have when applied to their particular circumstances. Thus, we address the disaffiliation period's constitutionality only as applied. In so doing, we note that \"[fjacial challenges are disfavored[,]\u201d <em>Washington State Grange </em>v. <em>Washington State Republican Party, </em>552 U.S. 442, 450, 128 S.Ct. 1184, 170 L.Ed.2d 151 (2008), and generally fail if any \u201cset of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 449, 128 S.Ct. 1184. Our conclusion that the disaffiliation period is not unconstitutional as applied to Representative Curry is one such set of circumstances that would prove fatal to a facial challenge of section 1 \u2014 4\u2014802(l)(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b467-12\">. In contrast, Colorado\u2019s twelve-month disaffiliation-period is tied to \"the last date the [nominating] petition maybe filed,\u201d Colo.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1-4-802(1 )(g). If, however, the disaf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>filiation periods in <em>Storer </em>and this case are equalized, connecting them to the November general elections, it results in a seventeen-month disaffiliation period in <em>Storer </em>and a sixteen-and-three-fifths months period in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\">. When <em>Thoumir </em>was decided, Colorado\u2019s disaffiliation requirement was contained in section l-4-801(l)(i) (1980), and was worded much like the current version: \"[n]o person shall be placed in nomination by petition unless the person ... was registered as unaffiliated ... for at least twelve months prior to the date of filing of the petition.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b469-7\">. This fact alone \u2014 that both independent and party candidates who seek the ballot by petition are bound to an unalterable disaffiliation period \u2014 defeats Plaintiffs argument that Colorado\u2019s disaffiliation statute discriminates on the basis of an individual's political beliefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b470-6\">. We note that Representative Curry sponsored the bill in the House. In its middle stages, the bill would have had immediate effect. Aplt.App. at 224-25, 230.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\">. We need not address whether Plaintiffs Richard Murdie, Linda Rees, and Gary Haus-ler have standing to challenge the section 1-4-802(l)(g) bar to Curry\u2019s candidacy on equal-protection grounds because Representative Curry clearly has standing to invoke our jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\">. Independents have a shorter period because their petitions are due no later than 140 days before the <em>general </em>election, whereas major and minor party members\u2019 petitions are due no later than seventy-five days before the <em>primary </em>elections. Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1-4-802(f)(1) (independents), -801(5) (major parties), -802(f)(II) (minor parties). As noted earlier, this works out to seventeen-and-one-half months leading up to the general election for party members, but only sixteen-and-three-fifths months preceding the general election for independents.</p>\n<p id=\"ALd\">To avoid this fact, Plaintiffs contend that \"Colorado cannot impose any affiliation requirements on political parties, np matter which method a particular candidate seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>obtain access to the primary ballot.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 56. The import of this contention, however, is not apparent in the context of an equal-protection challenge. Additionally, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated how they have standing to assert the constitutional rights of political parties. Moreover, the Supreme Court has not declared affiliation/disaffiliation periods per se unconstitutional. <em>See Storer, </em>415 U.S. at 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274; <em>cf. Tashjian v. Repub. Party of Conn., </em>479 U.S. 208, 224, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986) (holding, in a First-Amendment case, that Connecticut could not prevent a political party from opening its primary election to unaffiliated voters, and distinguishing <em>Storer </em>on the basis that Connecticut was essentially trying to \"protect[] the integrity of the Party against the Party itself\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"AmN\">. Anticipating the possibility that her appeal of the district court\u2019s order might not succeed, Representative Curry has begun the steps necessary to appear on the general-election ballot as a write-in candidate.
