He contends his sentence, which incorporated a 16-level enhancement under advisory Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iii) based on his previous deportation after a felony firearms offense, is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He also contends the ordinary presumption of reasonableness for within-guidelines sentences is inapplicable because Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 is <em>not </em>empirically based.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-24\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005). Tena does not claim procedural error. When, as here, the district court imposes a sentence within a properly-calculated guidelines range, we accord great deference to the sentence and apply a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-25\">In district court, as he concedes, Tena failed to object specifically to the reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>ableness of his sentence; therefore, the standard of review could be plain-error. <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Our court has not yet determined whether a defendant\u2019s failure to object at sentencing to the reasonableness of his sentence triggers such review. <em>Id. </em>at 391. Nevertheless, we need not decide that issue because Tena is not entitled to relief even under the more deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Orozco, </em>332 Fed.Appx. 968, 969 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 477, 175 L.Ed.2d 320 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Tena failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his within-guidelines sentence. The district court heard Tena\u2019s contentions and rejected the assertion that his criminal history was overstated, noting that Tena\u2019s criminal history reflected \u201ca solid involvement in drug trafficking\u201d. Moreover, the district court considered Tena\u2019s prior imprisonment of 60 months and stated it was an inadequate deterrent. The district court made an individualized sentencing decision in the light of the sentencing factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586. Accordingly, there is <em>no </em>reason to disturb the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose a within-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Tena further maintains that the presumption of reasonableness is inapplicable because advisory Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 (increasing offense level for unlawfully entering or remaining in the United States following prior convictions) is <em>not </em>empirically based. Conceding that our court\u2019s precedent forecloses this contention, he raises it in order to preserve it for possible further review. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mon-dragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b161-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
