On appeal, Hernandez contends that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint for abuse of the judicial process because it erred in finding that he committed perjury with respect to his response to the question on the complaint form asking whether other federal lawsuits had been dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>briefs. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). In liberally construing a litigant\u2019s arguments, however, we will not act as <em>de facto </em>counsel for the litigant. <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, </em>182 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). Thus, arguments not raised on appeal by <em>pro se </em>litigants are deemed abandoned. <em>Timson, </em>518 F.3d at 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the party\u2019s brief, we affirm. Even construed liberally, Hernandez\u2019s brief still fails to address the district court\u2019s alternative basis for dismissing the complaint \u2014 failure to comply with Rules 8(a) and 10(b). On this independent ground for the district court\u2019s dismissal, which Hernandez has abandoned, we affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing the complaint and need not address Hernandez\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
