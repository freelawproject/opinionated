We disagree and therefore affirm the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>court\u2019s denial of Stanford\u2019s motion for pretrial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The background facts and procedural history of Stanford\u2019s case are thoroughly explained in our prior decisions; we have no need to repeat those facts here. <em>See United States v. Stanford (Stanford II), </em>367 Fed.Appx. 507 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Stanford (Stanford </em>I), 341 Fed.Appx. 979 (5th Cir.2009). On May 19, 2010, Stanford moved the district court to be released from custody, arguing that his continued detention violated various constitutional protections. The district court denied that motion in an memorandum order entered July 7, 2010. As to Stanford\u2019s Fifth Amendment argument, the district court applied the factors articulated in <em>United States v. Hare, </em>873 F.2d 796 (5th Cir.1989), and concluded that Stanford\u2019s continued detention served regulatory purposes and thus comported with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on punitive pretrial detention. The district court further concluded that Stanford\u2019s continued detention does not so interfere with his ability to participate in trial preparation that it results in a deprivation of his Sixth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u201cWe review questions of constitutional law <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Guidry, </em>456 F.3d 493, 506 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Romero-Cruz, </em>201 F.3d 374, 377 (5th Cir.2000)); <em>see also De Zavala v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 879, 883 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cWe review due process challenges <em>de novo.\u201d). </em>In reviewing the district court\u2019s resolution of the legal questions <em>de novo, </em>we defer to the district court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Abbott, </em>495 F.3d 151, 160 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cTo the extent relevant to the constitutional question, subsidiary facts are reviewed for clear error.\u201d); <em>see also United Stats v. Millan, </em>4 F.3d 1038, 1043 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201c[W]e review the district court\u2019s findings of historical fact in this case for clear error, but review its ultimate resolution of the constitutional due process [pretrial detention] issue <em>de novo.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment forbids pretrial detention that is punitive, rather than regulatory, in nature. <em>See United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 747-48, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987). The Supreme Court has generally upheld the constitutionality of the Bail Reform Act, under which the district court here has ordered Stanford\u2019s pretrial detention, as serving regulatory and not punitive ends. <em>See id. </em>In doing so, however, the Court intimated that pretrial detentions may \u201cbecome excessively prolonged ... in relation to Congress\u2019s regulatory goal\u201d as to be punitive in nature. <em>See id. </em>at 747 n. 4, 107 S.Ct. 2095. To determine whether pretrial detention becomes excessively prolonged and violates due process \u201crequires assessment on a case-by-case basis, for the clause establishes no specific limit on the length of pretrial confinement.\u201d <em>Hare, </em>873 F.2d at 801. We explained in <em>Hare:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-9\">In determining whether due process has been violated, a court must consider not only factors relevant in the initial detention decision, such as the seriousness of the charges, the strength of the government\u2019s proof that the defendant poses a risk of flight or a danger to the community, and the strength of the government\u2019s case on the merits, but also addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tional factors such as the length of the detention that has in fact occurred or may occur in the future, the non-speculative nature of future detention, the complexity of the case, and whether the strategy of one side or the other occasions the delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Stanford has presented no new evidence that called for the district court to reevaluate its conclusions on the factors relevant in the initial detention decision. Those factors, as we have previously concluded, quite compellingly call for Stanford\u2019s pretrial detention.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">Stanford has the means, the motive, and the money to flee. He faces a potential sentence of 375 years in prison, has access to an international network of contacts, has previously concealed his travels, has demonstrated an ability to access funds from acquaintances even if his own assets are frozen, has established his primary residence in Antigua and Barbuda for the past fifteen years, and has little family ties in Houston, Texas, having only recently established some of those connections for purposes of his impending trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\"><em>Stanford I, </em>341 Fed.Appx. at 983-84. Stanford has also not demonstrated a change in circumstances warranting reconsideration of those findings in the past, instead refashioning previously known information as new facts. <em>See Stanford II, </em>367 Fed.Appx. at 510-11. We agree with the district court that the factors that so firmly supported the initial denial of pretrial bail also firmly support Stanford\u2019s continued detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The district court undertook a thorough and accurate analysis of the additional factors we articulated in <em>Hare. </em>To date, Stanford\u2019s detention has lasted just over twelve months and his trial will begin in January 2011. Even assuming- that his trial will last six months, as Stanford speculates, he has pointed to <em>no </em>court decision declaring that the length of such a detention violates the Fifth Amendment; indeed, courts have routinely upheld longer pre-detentions in the face of constitutional attacks. <em>See, e.g., United States v. El-Hage, </em>213 F.3d 74, 77-79 (2d Cir.2000) (considering a thirty- to thirty-three-month pretrial detention); <em>United States v. Millan, </em>4 F.3d 1038, 1044 (2d Cir.1993) (considering a thirty-month pretrial detention). Moreover, the length of Stanford\u2019s pretrial detention is not speculative, nor is it indefinite. The district court is committed to beginning his trial in January 2011 and, in any event, Stanford\u2019s detention is necessarily limited by the mandates of the Speedy Trial Act. <em>See Salerno, </em>481 U.S. at 747, 107 S.Ct. 2095 (explaining that the \u201cmaximum length of pretrial detention is limited by the stringent time limitations of the Speedy Trial Act\u201d). As to the third additional factor, Stanford concedes that \u201cthere is no question that this case is one of extraordinary complexity, involving both an enormous volume of discovery documents and a staggering number of transactions.\u201d Finally, our review of the record in this case supports the district court\u2019s determination that much of the delay in Stanford\u2019s trial is attributable to his own tactical and strategic choices, including countless changes to his choice of trial counsel. It does not appear that any delay in beginning the trial of this matter (and we do not mean to imply that a trial beginning eighteen months from indictment in a case as complex as this must be the product of \u201cdelay\u201d) is attributable to the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">Accordingly, each of the <em>Hare </em>factors leads to the conclusion that Stanford\u2019s continued pretrial detention serves only regulatory goals and has not crossed the due process boundary of impermissible punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">Stanford argues the district court \u201cmistook the nature of [his] Sixth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>ment argument\u201d by \u201ctreating it as a freestanding due process argument rather than as a factor that should be weighed\u201d as part of <em>Hare\u2019s </em>Fifth Amendment analysis. Our review of the record reveals that Stanford in fact presented a free-standing Sixth Amendment claim to the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; because Stanford does not object to the district court\u2019s treatment of his independent Sixth Amendment claim, we now deem it waived. <em>See Miller v. Texas Tech Univ. Health Sciences Ctr., </em>421 F.3d 342, 348-49 &amp; n. 17 (5th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">To the extent that <em>Hare </em>may allow consideration of how pretrial detention affects the defendant\u2019s ability to participate in his own defense, Stanford has not shown that this factor would call for his release, particularly in light of the other factors supporting his continued detention. And, as the district court found, both in addressing this motion and in connection with Stanford\u2019s various other challenges to his pretrial detention,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the reasonable restrictions imposed by the circumstances of his custody do not \u201cimpede his ability to prepare for trial or personally assist his counsel in such preparation.\u201d There was more than adequate evidence to support the district court\u2019s findings. Moreover, Stanford has not shown an absence of evidence supporting the district court\u2019s findings of historical fact, nor has he pointed to evidence calling for the contrary conclusion. <em>See Guerra v. Johnson, </em>90 F.3d 1075, 1078 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201c[A] factual finding is clearly erroneous \u201cwhen although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985))). We therefore find Stanford\u2019s argument that his pretrial detention is im-permissibly punitive because of the reasonable limitations placed on his ability to participate in his defense to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s July 7, 2010 order denying Stanford\u2019s motion for release from pretrial detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b97-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The district court also rejected Stanford's argument that continued detention violates the Eight Amendment\u2019s prohibition on excessive bail, reasoning that the Eighth Amendment does not require bail in all cases-and that this was, as it had previous found, a case warranting the denial of pretrial release.
