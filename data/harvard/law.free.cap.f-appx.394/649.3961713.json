Ta-marit argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution barred a second trial after his first trial ended in a mistrial and the government failed to prove that he carried or possessed a firearm in relation to or in furtherance of his drug, crime. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">\u201cWe \u2018review <em>de novo, </em>as a pure question of law, any possible violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause,\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. McIntosh, </em>580 F.3d 1222, 1226 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Thurston, </em>362 F.3d 1319, 1322 (11th Cir.2004)), and we examine findings of fact related to that issue for clear error, <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir.2002). We also review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a judgment of acquittal, and we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Demarest, </em>570 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-17\">The district court did not err when it ruled that Tamarit\u2019s second trial was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Double jeopardy does not bar a retrial unless the government \u201cintended to \u2018goad\u2019 the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2089, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Tamarit argues that the government intentionally violated a ruling <em>in limine </em>prohibiting testimony about Tamarit\u2019s prior \u201cmarijuana grows,\u201d but the district court found that the government \u201cwas negligent in\u201d failing to \u201cproperly instruct[ ] its witnesses and [was] careless in its questioning.\u201d The record supports that finding. The government interrupted its first witness before he could explain that Tamarit had sold marijuana on another occasion. After a second witness stated that Tamarit had \u201cgrown marijuana previously,\u201d the government apologized and asked for a curative instruction. The record does not suggest that \u201cthe Government actually <em>intended </em>to provoke a mistrial.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelley, </em>405 F.3d 1195, 1200 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The district court also did not err by denying Tamarit\u2019s motion to acquit him of his firearms charge. Agents seized from Tamarit\u2019s waistband a pistol that was fully loaded and had one bullet chambered, and Tamarit told agents that he carried a pistol for \u201cprotection\u201d and he \u201cknew that either he was going to be robbed or the police were going to show up at his house.\u201d <em>See United States v. Timmons, </em>283 F.3d 1246, 1251-52 (11th Cir.2002). The government proved Tamarit possessed the gun \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 or \u201cin relation to\u201d his marijuana operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We AFFIRM Tamarit\u2019s convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
