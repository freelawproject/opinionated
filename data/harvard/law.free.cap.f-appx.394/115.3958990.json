The Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissed Kamodjou\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision. Kamodjou petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-21\">The government argues that the petition for review should be dismissed because this court lacks jurisdiction to review Ka-modjou\u2019s challenge to the order of dismissal.. Kamodjou asserts that we have jurisdiction over all of his arguments because they are based in law and because refusal to consider them will result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-22\">This court reviews its jurisdiction <em>de novo. Lopez-Elias v. Reno, </em>209 F.3d 788, 791 (5th Cir.2000). Kamodjou\u2019s prior conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude bars us from exercising jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). In addition, we are barred from exercising jurisdiction because Kamodjou challenges the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-23\">Because this court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b139-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstanc.es set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
