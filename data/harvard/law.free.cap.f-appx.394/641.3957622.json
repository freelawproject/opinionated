Saingerard argues that the district court judge who presided over his revocation hearing <em>sua sponte </em>should have held a hearing to determine his competency, even though another district court judge had found Saingerard competent to stand trial for the underlying substantive offense that resulted in the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-23\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>order a competency hearing. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>468 F.2d 819, 820 (5th Cir.1972) (per curiam).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 4241(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjB\">At any time after the commencement of a prosecution for an offense and prior to the sentencing of the defendant, or at any time after the commencement of probation or supervised release and pri- or to the completion of the sentence, the defendant or the attorney for the Government may file a motion for a hearing to determine the mental competency of the defendant. The court shall grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>the motion, or shall order such a hearing on its own motion, if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">The standard for determining competence to stand trial is whether the defendant \u201chas sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Medina v. Singletary, </em>59 F.3d 1095, 1106 (11th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 789, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960)) (quotation marks omitted). A trial court must <em>sua sponte </em>conduct a competency hearing when the information known to the court is \u201csufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendant\u2019s competence.\u201d <em>Tiller v. Esposito, </em>911 F.2d 575, 576 (11th Cir.1990) (citations omitted). The defendant\u2019s competency is an ongoing inquiry, and \u201cthe defendant must be competent at all stages of trial,\u201d including sentencing. <em>See United States v. Rahim, </em>431 F.3d 753, 759 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">We focus on three factors in deciding whether a trial court has violated a defendant\u2019s rights by failing <em>sua sponte </em>to hold a competency hearing: (1) evidence of the defendant\u2019s irrational behavior, (2) the defendant\u2019s demeanor at trial, and (3) prior medical opinions regarding the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. <em>Medina, </em>59 F.3d at 1106 (citation omitted). This analysis focuses on what the trial court did in light of what it knew at the time of the trial or hearing. <em>Tiller, </em>911 F.2d at 576 (citation omitted). \u201cBecause legal competency is primarily a function of defendant\u2019s role in assisting counsel in conducting the defense, the defendant\u2019s attorney is in the best position to determine whether the defendant\u2019s competency is suspect.\u201d <em>Watts v. Singletary, </em>87 F.3d 1282, 1288 (11th Cir.1996) (finding that counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue of competency is evidence that competency was not in doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">We have applied the same due-process standards for competency at a probation-revocation hearing as provided at a criminal trial. <em>See United States v. Gray, </em>421 F.2d 316, 317-18 (5th Cir.1970). Because probation and supervised release are conceptually identical, courts treat revocations the same, whether they involve probation or supervised release. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 113-14 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">As an initial matter, the district court did not appear to make explicit findings on whether a competency hearing was necessary, and Saingerard\u2019s counsel did not request a competency review during the revocation hearing. Because the issue is whether the district court should have <em>sua sponte </em>ordered a competency hearing, such court findings were not necessary. The first <em>Medina </em>factor is evidence of irrational behavior. <em>Medina, </em>59 F.3d at 1106. The district court was presented with information that Saingerard violated the conditions of his supervised release by assaulting a corrections officer, allegedly because he was afraid of being placed in general population. However, the court also knew that, despite this irrational behavior, Saingerard had been found legally competent to assist in his defense and stand trial for the same conduct on the underlying substantive offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 111(c). Another piece of potential evidence of irrational behavior is that Saingerard\u2019s counsel stated that, in their conversations, Saingerard believed he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>was at risk because he was a government informer. The government, moreover, pointed out to the district court that Saing-erard had \u201cspit water in the face of his defense attorney. He\u2019s thrown feces \u2014 .\u201d D.E. 52 at 4. However, not even bizarre, volatile, or irrational behavior can be equated conclusively with mental incompetence to assist in the defendant\u2019s own defense. <em>Medina, </em>59 F.3d at 1107. Finally, Saingerard\u2019s counsel repeatedly stated that he had never had a meaningful conversation with his client. <em>See Watts, </em>87 F.3d at 1288. However, counsel presented no specifics beyond Saingerard\u2019s belief that he was a government informant, nor did counsel present new evidence, in the form of testimony or reports, indicating that Saingerard was no longer competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The second <em>Medina </em>factor is the defendant\u2019s demeanor. <em>Medina, </em>59 F.3d at 1106. Saingerard gave arguably nonsensical answers to the questions the court asked him. Saingerard talked about how his life was in danger, and how his wife fled to the Bahamas. When asked by the court what he thought should be done, Saingerard\u2019s rambling response was, \u201cI know you are the Judge. And they trying to be judging me for something I didn\u2019t do, and the Judge is judging me.\u201d D.E. 52 at 13. Further, Saingerard\u2019s overall demean- or at the hearing was calm.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The third <em>Medina </em>factor is prior medical opinions regarding the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. <em>Medina, </em>59 F.3d at 1106. There were only a few brief mentions of the prior psychological evaluations of Saingerard. Defense counsel pointed out that \u201cDr. Holmes who saw him at the request of the Public Defender\u2019s office found him to be an Axis 1, truly psychotic.\u201d D.E. 52 at 8. Defense counsel further stated that \u201c[Saingerard\u2019s] story has been totally consistent from 2001 up until the present based on my conversations with previous attorneys involved with Mr. Saingerard as well as Dr. Holmes\u2019 report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, defense counsel noted- that the Bureau of Prisons had made \u201csome observations that they believe that he\u2019s possibly malingering.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defense counsel also noted to the district court that he understood \u201cJudge Martinez\u2019s ruling on the competency hearing,\u201d but that he believed that \u201cDr. Holmes\u2019 report is more consistent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Thus, the court knew that counsel understood the previous competency ruling but that counsel thought that one of the earlier pieces of evidence, Dr. Holmes\u2019s diagnosis, was more reliable. Such argument is not new evidence that a <em>bona fide </em>doubt exists that Saingerard is no longer competent. Because the district court at the revocation hearing had knowledge that Saingerard had earlier been found competent to stand trial on charges that involved the same bizarre behavior, and Saingerard presented no new evidence at the revocation hearing to warrant a <em>sua sponte </em>grant of a new competency hearing, we affirm the revocation of Saingerard\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-16\">.
