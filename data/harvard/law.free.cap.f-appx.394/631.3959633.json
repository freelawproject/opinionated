On the discriminatory termination claim, because the actions and statements of the decision-makers did not demonstrate race discrimination without inference, they did not constitute direct evidence. Diaz also failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of race discrimination with circumstantial evidence: he did not show he was qualified for the jobs he held, and he did not identify a similarly situated comparator who was treated more favorably. Moreover, even if he had established a <em>prima facie </em>case, he did not show that the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons his employer proffered for terminating him were pretextual. As for his retaliation claim, even if Plaintiff showed a <em>prima facie </em>case, Diaz still failed to show that the legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating him were pretextual and that the true purpose was retaliatory. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting the employer summary judgment on Diaz\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
