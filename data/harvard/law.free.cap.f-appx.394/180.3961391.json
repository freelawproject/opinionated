The district court sentenced Gotora to concurrent prison terms of 78 months on Count 1 and 60 months on Count 2 and ordered concurrent three-year terms of supervised release on both counts. The court further ordered restitution in the amount of $1,167,546, representing the actual loss to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Go-tora argues on appeal that the district court erred in calculating the loss amounts, resulting in an 18-level increase in his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(J); in determining the amount of restitution; and in denying an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">We find that, for sentencing purposes, there is sufficient evidence for the district court to have concluded that the amount of actual loss was $1,167,546 and the intended loss was $3,818,533. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>582 F.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1116, - L.Ed.2d - (2010). This evidence includes the testimony of two IRS special agents that was supported by documentary evidence, the testimony of Gotora\u2019s cocon-spirator, and Gotora\u2019s own admissions. We find that the district court committed no clear error in finding Gotora responsible for the entire loss amounts. <em>United States v. Lghodaro, </em>967 F.2d 1028, 1030 (5th Cir.1992) (affirming where the court\u2019s findings regarding reasonable foreseeability were not expressly made, but the meaning of the court\u2019s findings was clear). For similar reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering restitution in the full amount of the IRS\u2019s actual loss. <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Avascal, </em>542 F.3d 495, 497-98 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Adams, </em>363 F.3d 363, 365-67 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">Based on the evidence and the \u201cextremely deferential standard of review\u201d accorded to decisions regarding offense level reductions pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, Gotora has not shown that the district court committed reversible error in finding that he failed to admit the conduct comprising his offense and thus had not sufficiently accepted responsibility to deserve a downward adjustment. <em>United States v. Angeles-Mendoza, </em>407 F.3d 742, 752-53 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120-21 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-19\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b205-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
