The district court imposed a within-guidelines sentence of 120 months in prison. Martindale appeals the sentence imposed, arguing that the district court committed procedural error by failing to sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>explain the reasons for overruling his objections to the obliterated-serial-number enhancement and the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement. He also asserts that the district court committed procedural error by enhancing his sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6). Finally, he contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the obliterated-serial-number enhancement quadrupled since the enactment of the initial guidelines without any consideration of the overall purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Martindale\u2019s argument regarding the adequacy of the district court\u2019s reasons is unavailing. The district court listened to Martindale\u2019s arguments, adopted the presentence report (PSR), and rejected Martindale\u2019s request for a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.2008). Further, the district court stated that upon consideration of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it felt that a sentence within the guidelines sentence range was justified. Thus, this court is satisfied that the district court judge considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision making authority. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">The district court\u2019s argument regarding the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement is also without merit. Section 2K2.1(b)(6) requires the district court to impose a four-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense.\u201d Martindale admitted to selling methamphetamine at his home, where a firearm was discovered. Martindale also admitted that most of those firearms discovered in Sheri Lynn Courtney\u2019s vehicle and residence were obtained as payment for methamphetamine. Thus, the district court\u2019s finding that Martindale used a firearm or possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>See United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1199 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Finally, Martindale\u2019s argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable is also without merit. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009)(stating that while a district court may vary from the guidelines range based solely on policy considerations, this court will not second guess the district court\u2019s refusal to do so because a particular guidelines is not empirically based). Accordingly, Martindale\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b206-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
