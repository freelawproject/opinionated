After review, we discern no error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">Ware, also proceeding <em>pro se </em>before the district court, brought this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against the following defendants: 1) Polk County Board of County Commissioners (\u201cthe Board\u201d); 2) David Kearns, a Polk County employee; 3) Kevin McCullough, a Polk County employee; 4) Randy M. Mink, Assistant Polk County Attorney; 5) the State of Florida; and 6) Judge Charles B. Curry, a judge on Florida\u2019s Tenth Judicial Circuit Court (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d). Ware alleged that the Board, Kearns, McCullough, and Mink (collectively \u201cPolk County agents\u201d) violated his constitutional rights when they imposed a fine on him for failing to obtain the necessary building permit before building on his property, placed a lien on his property for failing to pay the fine, and then filed a state court lawsuit to foreclose on his property. Ware further alleged that Judge Curry violated his constitutional rights by dismissing his state court counterclaim against the Polk County agents, which was filed in the state court lawsuit to foreclose on Ware\u2019s property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ware also alleged that the state of Florida was liable under a theory of <em>respondeat superi- or </em>for the actions of Judge Curry. The district court dismissed Ware\u2019s complaint, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over the complaint under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">On appeal, Ware argues that: (1) the district court erred in finding that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine barred it from exercising jurisdiction over his claims and (2) the court erred by not holding a hearing to determine whether the state court had jurisdiction to hear the underlying state court action before dismissing Ware\u2019s instant federal complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">A district court\u2019s determination that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a plaintiffs claims in light of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is reviewed <em>de novo. Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). The Rooker-Feldman doctrine generally \u201crecognizes that federal district courts do not have jurisdiction to act as appellate courts and precludes them from reviewing final state court decisions.\u201d <em>Green v. Jefferson County Comm\u2019n, </em>563 F.3d 1243, 1249 (11th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 199, 175 L.Ed.2d 127 (2009). The Supreme Court has held that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine is confined to cases that are \u201cbrought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 1521-22, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). \u201cThe doctrine applies both to federal claims raised in the state court and to those \u2018inextricably intertwined\u2019 with the state court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). \u201cA claim is inextricably intertwined if it would effectively nullify the state court judgment or it succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Ware\u2019s claims fall squarely within that description. Ware lost in state court. His \u00a7 1983 claims effectively ask the district court to review and reject the state court\u2019s judgment. And his federal claims are either the same as those raised in his counterclaims in state court or otherwise inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment because they focus on the legality of the lien that was litigated in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">The only remaining question is whether the state-court judgment was rendered before proceedings in the district court commenced. We have interpreted <em>Exxon Mobil </em>to apply the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine only to instances where the state court proceedings have ended at the time the federal action is filed. <em>Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1277. \u201c[Sjtate proceedings have not ended for purposes of <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>when an appeal from the state court judgment remains pending at the time the plaintiff commences the federal court action that complains of injuries caused by the state court judgment and invites review and rejection of that judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1279. Here, the defendants attached several exhibits to their motion to dismiss related to the disposition of the state court proceedings. A district court \u201cgenerally must convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment if it considers materials outside the complaint.\u201d <em>Day v. Taylor, </em>400 F.3d 1272, 1275-76 (11th Cir.2005). However, a court \u201cmay consider a document attached to a motion to dismiss without converting the motion into one for summary judgment if the attached document is (1) central to the plaintiff\u2019s claim and (2) undisputed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1276. Because the documents attached to the motion to dismiss are central to Ware\u2019s claim and undisputed, the district court properly considered them on a motion to dismiss. The exhibits establish that the claims in the state trial court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>proceeded to final judgment. The exhibits also establish that Ware had no intention of appealing the judgment to a state appellate court, preferring instead \u201cto go straight to federal\u201d court. Because no appeal remained pending at the time Ware commenced this federal action, the state proceedings were ended for purposes of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Ware also argues that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine should not apply because the state court lacked jurisdiction and its judgment was void <em>ab initio. </em>We have not yet recognized an exception to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine in cases where the state court that issued the underlying state court judgment lacked jurisdiction. <em>Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1261 n. 3. This case is not the proper occasion to answer that question because the state court had jurisdiction to issue its judgment. In Florida, state circuit courts have exclusive jurisdiction over all equitable actions, including those to foreclose a lien. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 26.012(2)(c); <em>Corbin Well Pump &amp; Supply, Inc. v. Koon, </em>482 So.2d 525, 527 (Fla. 5th DCA 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Because the underlying state court proceedings had ended, and Ware was complaining of injuries caused by state court judgments and seeking the district court to review and reject those judgments, the district court did not err in concluding that, under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider Ware\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Next, Ware argues that the district court erred by not holding a hearing to determine whether the state court had jurisdiction to hear his underlying state court claim before dismissing his federal complaint. We review a district court\u2019s decision to rule on a motion to dismiss without an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>Sunseri v. Macro Cellular Partners, </em>412 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2005). It is not an abuse of discretion for a court to decide a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction based on documentary evidence and without an evidentiary hearing if neither party makes a timely and unequivocal request for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 1251. The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Ware\u2019s complaint without holding a hearing because neither party requested that the district court hold a hearing, and the court1 could determine whether it had jurisdiction over Ware\u2019s federal claims based on the complaint, the motion to dismiss, and the exhibits attached to the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">After carefully reviewing the record and considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ware\u2019s civil action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-13\">.
