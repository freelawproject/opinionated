Willis claimed his disciplinary hearing did not meet the minimum requirements of due process. The district court disagreed and granted summary judgment to the Texas Tech defendants. Willis appealed, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">After allegations surfaced that Willis had pointed a 9mm pistol at a classmate while the two argued at Willis\u2019s off-campus residence, Texas Tech\u2019s Student Conduct Board sent Willis a detailed letter explaining that a complaint had been filed against him. The letter notified Willis of a hearing date and included: the factual basis for the complaint; the portions of the Student Code allegedly violated; a list of the Board members and an opportunity to challenge them for partiality; and an explanation of how to submit evidence, call witnesses in his behalf, and secure an advisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\">The Board held the hearing, at which Willis stated his position but called no witnesses, and determined that Willis had in fact pulled a gun on a fellow student. He was expelled. Willis sued Texas Tech and its administrators in state court for violating his federal due process rights, but the defendants removed to the Western District of Texas, where they moved for summary judgment. The district court \u2014 noting that Willis did not submit any evidence to refute Tech\u2019s motion\u2014 assumed Willis had a protected right to his education but held that Tech gave Willis all the process he was due. Willis appealed. Our review is de novo, applying the same standards as the district court and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Willis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">This court recently dealt with a similar case, one in which Louisiana State University disciplined a student for allegedly harassing his ex-girlfriend. W\u00e9 explained in a persuasive unpublished opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-17\">A student subject to school disciplinary proceedings is entitled to some procedural due process. The student must be given notice of the charges against him, an explanation of what evidence exists against him, and \u201can opportunity to present his side of the story.\u201d The student is not entitled to the \u201copportunity to secure counsel, to confront and c'foss-examine witnesses supporting the charge, or to call his own witnesses to verify his version of the incident.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtV\">Willis\u2019s cursory appellate brief fails to explain what about the hearing was deficient. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>An independent review of the undisputed record shows Tech gave Willis more than the minimum process required by the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b111-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

By its nature, a charge of misconduct, as opposed to a failure to meet the scholastic standards of the college, depends upon a collection of the facts concerning the charged misconduct, easily colored by the point of view of the witnesses. In such circumstances, a hearing which gives the Board or the administrative authorities of the college an opportunity to hear both sides in considerable detail is best suited to protect the rights of all involved. This is not to imply that a full-dress judicial hearing, with the right to cross-examine witnesses, is required. Such a hearing, with the attending publicity and disturbance of college activities, might be detrimental to the college's educational atmosphere and impractical to carry out. Nevertheless, the rudiments of an adversary proceeding may be preserved without encroaching upon the interests of the college.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
