Angiolillo filed this \u00a7 1983 and state law action against Collier County, its Sheriff, and five employees of the Collier County Sheriffs Department (\u201cDefendants\u201d), alleging claims of false arrest, malicious prosecution, conspiracy, and state law malicious prosecution. The district court either dismissed or granted summary judgment to Defendants on all claims. Angiolillo now appeals, raising three issues for our review. First, Angiol-illo argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to file a second amended complaint. Second, he argues that the court erred in granting summary judgment to Defendants Bates, Celiberti, and Hurley. And third he argues that the district court erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to Defendants. After thorough review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we affirm on all grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">I. Denial of Motion to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">\u201c[W]e will only reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend in instances in which the district court has clearly abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange County, </em>487 F.3d 1361, 1366 (11th Cir.2007) (internal citation and quotation omitted). \u201cPursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), a party seeking to amend its complaint after it previously has amended the complaint, or after a responsive pleading has been filed, may amend the complaint \u2018only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)). \u201cHowever, where a party\u2019s motion to amend is filed after the deadline for such motions, as delineated in the court\u2019s scheduling order, the party must show good cause why leave to amend the complaint should be granted.\u201d <em>Id. See also Sosa v. Airprint Sys., </em>133 F.3d 1417, 1418 n. 2 (11th Cir.1998) (\u201c[Wjhen a motion to amend is filed after a scheduling order deadline, Rule 16 is the proper guide for determining whether a party\u2019s delay may be excused.\u201d); Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(b)(4) (\u201cA schedule may be modified only for good cause and with the judge\u2019s consent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The district court\u2019s deadline to amend pleadings expired on February 20, 2009, as delineated in its Case Management and Scheduling Order. Angiolillo filed his motion for leave to amend on June 11, 2009, nearly four months after .the court\u2019s deadline. Therefore, Rule 16(b)\u2019s good cause requirement governed the court\u2019s decision whether to grant Angiolillo\u2019s motion for leave to amend. We agree with the district court that Angiolillo failed to demonstrate good cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-12\">Angiolillo\u2019s motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint merely stated that \u201csince the filing of his previous complaint, he ha[d] discovered information\u201d that \u201cwarranted] the reinstatement of Plaintiffs claims against Defendants Hunter, Rambosk and Spina.\u201d Angiolillo failed to give the court any idea, either general or particularized, as to what evidence was discovered and how such evidence might resurrect the claims against Defendants Hunter, Rambosk, and Spina that the district court had previously dismissed with prejudice. <em>See Smith, </em>487 F.3d at 1367 (\u201cCareful review of Smith\u2019s motion to amend his complaint reveals that Smith did not indicate with any specificity the good cause he had for untimely moving to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>amend his complaint. Smith alleged that discovery had \u2018produced new violations of the [l]aw that must be addressed within the counts of the complaint,\u2019 but he failed to further indicate what those new violations were, what facts supported them, and why those facts previously were undiscov-erable.\u201d) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Moreover, Angiolillo erroneously cited in his motion that Rule 15, as opposed to 16(b), governed the court\u2019s decision whether to grant him leave to amend, and thus failed to even include any substantive memorandum on good cause in support of his motion. Finally, our own independent comparison of the content of Angiolillo\u2019s Amended Complaint and Second Amended Complaint reveals only minor revisions to Angiolillo\u2019s factual allegations, none of which appear to add any material evidence to his claims against Hunter, Rambosk, or Spina. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Angiolillo\u2019s motion for leave to amend.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">II. Summary Judgment in Favor of Defendants Bates, Celiberti, Hurley</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants Bates, Celiberti, and Hurley, concluding that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on An-giolillo\u2019s false arrest claim and that An-giolillo failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact on his \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim. \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Rine v. Imagitas, Inc., </em>590 F.3d 1215, 1222 (11th Cir.2009). Upon review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">A. <em>False Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">\u201cLaw enforcement violates a person\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights when it arrests him or her without probable cause, and a claim arises under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Rushing v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>Parker, </em>599 F.3d 1263, 1265 (11th Cir.2010). \u201cProbable cause exists where the facts within the collective knowledge of law enforcement officials, derived from reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to cause a person of reasonable caution to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Brown v. City of Huntsville, Ala., </em>608 F.3d 724, 734 (11th Cir.2010). However, to receive qualified immunity from a false-arrest claim, an officer need not have actual probable cause but only \u201carguable\u201d probable cause. <em>Id. </em>\u201cArguable probable cause exists where reasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the Defendants could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest Plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Angiolillo was arrested for violating the terms of a Temporary Injunction for Protection Against Dating Violence, which prohibited him from contacting a woman whose full legal name is \u201cCrystal\u201d either in person or by phone, from using another person to contact her, or from frequenting a bar called JD Jags. Angiolillo received a similar temporary injunction against Crystal. The evidence submitted to the State Attorney\u2019s office, which led to its issuance of the capias warrant for Angiolillo\u2019s arrest, included the following items: (1) an investigative report stating that on May 12, 2007, Crystal (who is a realtor) received four phone calls from someone named \u201cLisa\u201d purporting to express interest in a piece of real estate but that when Crystal returned the call she heard Angiol-illo\u2019s voice stating, \u201cGOT HER!,\u201d accompanied by cheering and laughing; (2) a recording of the May 12, 2007, phone call by Crystal, which captured the background noise on the open line and Angiolillo\u2019s voice stating \u201cSHE\u2019S FUCKED ... SHE CAN\u2019 HEAR NOTHING ... SHE\u2019S LEAVING A MESSAGE ...\u201d; (3) an investigative report stating that Angiolillo had contacted the Sheriffs office to report that Crystal had violated the injunction order by calling his phone and leaving a message and a notation that no such message was recorded on Angiolillo\u2019s phone; (4) an investigative report stating that on May 27, 2007, Crystal reported that two of her friends, Judith Simon and Reuben Thompson, saw Angiolillo drive within 50-60 feet of the front door of JD Jags; and (5) statements by Simon and Thompson as to the same. Based on this evidence, the district court concluded that arguable probable cause existed to arrest Angiolillo, and thus Defendants Bates, Celiberti, and Hurley \u2014 the agents responsible for the investigation and providing the evidence to the State Attorney\u2019s Office \u2014 were entitled to qualified immunity from liability for An-giolillo\u2019s alleged false arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Angiolillo does not make any specific legal arguments related to arguable probable cause in his briefs. In fact, it is difficult to discern whether he raises <em>any </em>arguments responding to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his false arrest claim. He merely states the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ing: that someone in the Sheriffs Department heard that Celiberti was told to \u201cpush the case through and get a warrant and arrest Mr. Angiolillo because he did not deserve to be sheriff\u2019; that Bates failed to confirm Angiolillo\u2019s alleged alibi as to his whereabouts on the night he was sighted outside of JD Jags; that Celiberti failed to confirm the true identity of the owner of the phone number left by \u201cLisa,\u201d which was in actuality the number for the residence of Crystal\u2019s friends who provided statements about Angiolillo\u2019s presence at JD Jags; and that Bates misrepresented to the State Attorney that the statements provided by these friends, Simon and Thompson, were sworn, when in fact they were unsworn. None of these allegations vitiate the district court\u2019s finding of arguable probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Even accepting all of Angiolillo\u2019s statements as true, and disregarding the un-sworn statements of Simon and Thompson that Angiolillo approached JD Jags in his car, the remaining undisputed evidence in the record is sufficient to establish arguable probable cause that Angiolillo used a third party, \u201cLisa,\u201d to contact Crystal\u2014 conduct that expressly violates the terms of the temporary injunction. First, Crystal\u2019s victim statement reported that when she returned \u201cLisa\u2019s\u201d phone call, she heard Angiolillo\u2019s voice saying, \u201cWe got her!\u201d Second, Defendants obtained from Crystal a recording of the open line, which captures Angiolillo\u2019s voice making statements suggesting he intended to capture a message from Crystal on the phone line via the use of a \u201cBoost\u201d phone, a fact which was eventually corroborated by examining Angiolillo\u2019s and Crystal\u2019s phone records. Finally, Angiolillo subsequently contacted the Sheriffs Office claiming that Crystal had violated her temporary injunction by calling his phone number and leaving a message but that no such message was found. In sum, we conclude that a reasonable officer in the same position of the Assistant State Attorney issuing the capias warrant for Angiolillo\u2019s arrest \u201ccould have believed that probable cause existed to arrest Plaintiff.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>608 F.3d at 734. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants Bates, Celiberti, and Hurley on Angiolillo\u2019s false-arrest claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">B. <em>Malicious Prosecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">\u201cTo establish a federal malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove (1) the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, and (2) a violation of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.\u201d <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1234 (11th Cir.2004). \u201cUnder Florida law, a plaintiff must establish each of six elements to support a claim of malicious prosecution: (1) an original judicial proceeding against the present plaintiff was commenced or continued; (2) the present defendant was the legal cause of the original proceeding; (3) the termination of the original proceeding constituted a bona fide termination of that proceeding in favor of the present plaintiff; (4) there was an absence of probable cause for the original proceeding; (5) there was malice on the part of the present defendant; and (6) the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the original proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because we agree with the district court that there was probable cause for Angiolillo\u2019s arrest, he is unable to establish the fourth element of a common law claim for malicious prosecution under Florida law. Accordingly, Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Angiolillo\u2019s \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">III. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">A court may award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 to a prevailing defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>where the court finds that \u201cthe plaintiffs action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Rowe, </em>449 U.S. 5, 14, 101 S.Ct. 173, 178, 66 L.Ed.2d 163 (1980) (quoting <em>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, </em>434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, 700, 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)). Our circuit considers the following factors in determining whether a claim is frivolous: \u201c(1) whether the plaintiff established a prima facie ease; (2) whether the defendant offered to settle; and (3) whether the trial court dismissed the case prior to trial or held a full-blown trial on .the merits.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Sch. Bd. of Pinellas County, </em>773 F.2d 1182, 1189 (11th Cir.1985). We review an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs for abuse of discretion. <em>Gray ex rel. Alexander v. Bostic, </em>570 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.2009). Abuse-of-discretion review requires us to \u201caffirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The district court, adopting the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation, made the ultimate determination that An-giolillo\u2019s lawsuit was frivolous and awarded Defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees. The court specifically concluded that Angiolillo failed to establish a prima facie case; Defendants did not offer to settle; and the district court dismissed the majority of An-giolillo\u2019s claims with prejudice early in the litigation upon the filing of various motions to dismiss and Angiolillo\u2019s few remaining claims with prejudice on summary judgment. Thus, the district court did not apply \u201cthe wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Angiolillo renews the same two objections to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report as he raised before the district court. Neither of these objections persuade us that the district court \u201cmade a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">First, Angiolillo argues that the Magistrate Judge violated the \u201csanctity of the mediation process\u201d by determining that Defendants did not offer to settle because local rules require that any information derived from a mediation may not be made known to the Court. <em>See </em>Rule M.D. Fla. L.R. 9.07(b). As the district court stated in its response to this argument below, the Magistrate Judge .did not violate Rule 9.07(b) by determining that Defendants did not offer to settle. Rule 9.07(b) protects parties participating in mediation from the use of any statement made during mediation proceedings as an admission against their interest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Magistrate Judge did not use any statement made by Angiolillo during mediation as an admission against his interest in violation of Rule 9.07(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">Second, Angiolillo disputes the Magistrate Judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish a prima facie case by arguing that certain statements made by the Magistrate Judge are unsupported by the record. Angiolillo argues that if the Magistrate Judge had correctly stated the record, which allegedly demonstrates that he contested the allegation that he violated the temporary injunction by driving by JD Jags and that he amended his complaint only once, as opposed to twice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>upon consent of the district court, Defendants would have failed to satisfy <em>Sullivan\u2019s </em>first prong. We agree with the district court; these discrete factual disputes do not undermine the district court\u2019s ultimate determination that Angiolillo failed to establish a prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">To the contrary, our independent review of the record demonstrates that the district court was completely warranted in concluding that \u201cAngiolillo [did] not even attempt to shoulder his burden to establish that genuine issues of fact remain on his [malicious prosecution] claim.\u201d In his response to Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment, Angiolillo recites the elements for a prima facie case of malicious prosecution and, in a conclusory fashion, contends that these elements have been satisfied. He engages in no discussion demonstrating how the evidence supports his satisfaction of those elements. With respect to his false arrest claim, although he did put forth some <em>argument </em>in an attempt to undermine the conclusion that probable cause existed for his arrest, he did not provide any <em>evidence </em>to that effect. Angiolillo may have argued that Defendants\u2019 hypothesis that \u201cLisa\u2019s\u201d phone was a \u201cBoost\u201d phone linked to Angiolillo was \u201cunsupported,\u201d but the record demonstrates the opposite. This hypothesis was derived directly from Crystal\u2019s victim statement, the audio recording of Angiolil-lo\u2019s voice, and Angiolillo\u2019s report that Crystal had violated the injunction by calling his cell phone. Furthermore, this \u201cunsupported hypothesis\u201d was ultimately confirmed after Angiolillo\u2019s arrest. We have sustained findings of frivolity where a motion for summary judgment has been granted in instances in which the plaintiff did not introduce any evidence in support of his claim. <em>See Roper v. Edwards, </em>815 F.2d 1474, 1478 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201cWith this total absence of credible evidence to support their claims, the Ropers\u2019 action was frivolous, and the court\u2019s award of fees to Cochran was clearly justified.\u201d). Rather than offering substantive evidence in support of his claims, Angiolillo\u2019s submissions to the district court are replete with exclamatory statements and hyperbolic accusations, in many cases wholly unsupported by substantive legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Moreover, this case stands in stark contrast to the narrow circumstances in which we have reversed an award of attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing defendant. <em>See, e.g., Walker v. NationsBank of Florida N.A., </em>53 F.3d 1548, 1559 (11th Cir.1995) (holding that \u201ca plaintiffs claim should not be considered groundless or without foundation for the purpose of awarding fees to a prevailing defendant when the claims are meritorious enough to receive careful attention and review\u201d). In <em>Walker, </em>the district court on two occasions denied the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions and the case proceeded to trial. Here, almost all of Angiolillo\u2019s claims were dismissed early in this litigation on various motions to dismiss, and in its summary judgment order the district court concluded that Angiolillo\u2019s arguments were not only unpersuasive but almost nonexistent. Angiolillo\u2019s case did not present claims meritorious enough to receive the district court\u2019s \u201ccareful attention and review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">In sum, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding Angiol-illo\u2019s claims \u201cfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>449 U.S. at 14, 101 S.Ct. at 178 (quoting <em>Christiansburg, </em>434 U.S. at 421, 98 S.Ct. at 700). Accordingly, we uphold the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to Defendants pursuant to \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b636-5\">. Angiolillo attempts to make a good-cause argument before our Court on appeal, arguing that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against Hunter, Rambosk, and Spi-na with prejudice in response to a motion by Defendants not labeled as dispositive in violation of Local Rule 3.01(h)\u2019s requirement that \"[a]ll dispositive motions must be so designated in the caption of the motion.\" This is the same argument he raised before the district court in his motion to reconsider the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to amend. On appeal, Angiolillo faults the district court with \"completely ignoring]\u201d his Local Rule 3.01(h) argument and denying his motion for reconsideration on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\"A district court has sound discretion whether to alter or amend a judgment pursuant to a motion for reconsideration, and its decision will only be reversed if it abused that discretion.\u201d <em>Wilchombe v. TeeVee Toons, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 949, 957 (11th Cir.2009). Where a party gives no reason for not previously raising an issue, denial of a motion for reconsideration is \"especially soundly exercised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>O'Neal v. Kennamer, </em>958 F.2d 1044, 1047 (11th Cir.1992)). In light of Angiolillo's failure to raise this argument, or any good-cause argument for that matter, in his initial untimely motion to amend \u2014 arguments that were readily available to him at the time \u2014 the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for reconsideration. <em>See Wilchombe, </em>555 F.3d at 957 (\"A motion for reconsideration cannot be used to relitigate old matters, raise argument or present evidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment[, which includes] new arguments \u00dciat were previously available, but not pressed.\u201d) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A57\">To the extent that Angiolillo seeks to raise his argument related to Local Rule 3.01(h) as a distinct legal issue on appeal, he has failed to do so. This argument only appears as a sub-issue under his primary argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to amend. We thus consider this argument only as a belated attempt to establish the good-cause showing that was lacking in his initial motion to amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-6\">. In concluding that there was arguable probable cause for Angiolillo\u2019s arrest, the district court also relied on Angiolillo\u2019s and Crystal\u2019s cell phone records, which demonstrated that on May 12, 2007, Angiolillo received a phone call from Crystal but that at that same time Crystal had placed a phone call to the number left by \"Lisa\u201d in reference to her real estate inquiry. The purported explanation for this discrepancy is the purchase of a \u201cBoost\" phone, which can be used to transfer a phone call to another number without the caller\u2019s knowledge. This evidence, however, was not submitted to the State Attorney\u2019s office until after Angiolillo\u2019s arrest pursuant to the capias warrant on October 15, 2007. Therefore, we do not consider this evidence in our evaluation of whether there was arguable probable cause so as to insulate Defendants from liability under the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-6\">.
