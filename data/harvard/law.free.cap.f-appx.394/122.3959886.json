We find for House on both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">A defendant convicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm who has three prior convictions for violent felonies faces a statutory <em>minimum </em>15-year prison term under the ACCA. At his 2005 sentencing hearing, House received this 15-year minimum. The statutory <em>maximum </em>without the ACCA enhancement would have been 10 years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> House argues that one of his three prior convictions counted by the district court \u2014 engaging in organized criminal activity \u2014 is not a violent felony under the ACCA. According to House, his underlying organized criminal activity was a \u201cburglary\u201d crime, but it was not a \u201cgeneric\u201d burglary offense, something the Supreme Court requires for the conviction to fall under the ACCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> House urges that nothing shows \u2014 and the offense does not require \u2014 that he had the requisite intent to commit a theft at the \u201cmoment\u201d of his illegal entry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> House would get around his appeal waiver by showing his claim falls within its exception allowing him to challenge a sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum. Although the Government opposed House\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion in the district court, it has changed course here\u2014 conceding error and joining House\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>quest for resentencing within the proper statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">House\u2019s challenge to the ACCA enhancement is a claim that his sentence exceeds the proper statutory maximum because his sentence, with the ACCA enhancement, exceeds the statutory maximum sentence applicable without the enhancement. We agree it falls within the exception to House\u2019s appeal waiver.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Shepard v. United States </em>\u201cthat enquiry under the ACCA to determine whether a plea of guilty to burglary ... necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document, the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant, or to some comparable judicial record of this information.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <em>Shepard </em>documents introduced here do not show that House\u2019s prior burglary conviction for engaging in organized criminal activity included \u201can element of intent to commit a felony, theft, or assault at the moment of entry,\u201d so the conviction was not for \u201cgeneric\u201d burglary and cannot qualify as a violent felony conviction under the ACCA.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The government concedes as much.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-11\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED, and House\u2019s case is REMANDED with instructions to grant \u00a7 2255 relief and to resentence him within the statutory maximum.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b147-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
