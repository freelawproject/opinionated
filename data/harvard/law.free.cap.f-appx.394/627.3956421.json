The pre-sen-tence report gave Harris a criminal history category of V with a guideline range of 46-57 months imprisonment. The district court decreased the criminal history category to IV, with a guideline range of 37-46 months, because many of Harris\u2019s prior criminal offenses were traffic related. Harris argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors because: (1) the sentence does not accurately reflect the seriousness of the offense; (2) the sentence is excessive and thus does not promote respect for the law; and (3) the case received no media attention and so \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)\u2019s deterrence requirement should be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-22\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The challenger \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Where the district court imposes a within-guidelines sentence, it need only \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>[it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it had considered all of the factors of \u00a7 3553(a) and the arguments presented when determining the reasonableness of the sentence to be imposed. In making that determination, the court reduced Harris\u2019s criminal history category to more accurately represent the seriousness of his criminal behavior, and balanced that against his lengthy criminal history, illegal re-entries, and continuous disregard for the laws of the United States. In doing so, the court appropriately weighed the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and achieved the purposes of sentencing set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). Under the totality of the circumstances, Harris\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AXYS\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors a court must consider in determining a sentence include: (1) \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;\" (2) the need for the sentence (A) \"to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense,\u201d (B) \"to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\u201d (C) \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,\u201d and (D) \"to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training [or] medical care;\u201d (3) \"the kinds of sentences available;\u201d (4) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (5) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) \"the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities;\u201d (7) and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
