On appeal, Zavala argues that his sentence at the low end of the Sentencing Guideline range is substantively unreasonable because the district court only looked at the guideline range. Zavala does not challenge the procedural reasonableness of his \u2022 sentence. Additionally, Zavala acknowledges that our decision in <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that a district court without a fast-track program may not issue a sentencing departure or variance based on the availability of fast-track programs in other districts), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2825, 174 L.Ed.2d 556 (2009), is controlling, but wishes to preserve the issue should we decide differently in the future.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>We review \u201call sentences \u2014 whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range \u2014 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1090 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted). \u201c[T]he district court must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cThe length and amount of detail of the judge\u2019s reasoning required depends on the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201csentencing judge is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\u201d but \u201cshould set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). A district court\u2019s explicit acknowledgment that it has considered a defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is sufficient to demonstrate that it has adequately and properly considered those factors. <em>United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1278 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we must review the sentencing process for both procedural error and substantive reasonableness. <em>Livesay, </em>525 F.3d at 1091. Procedural errors occur when the district court fails to calculate or improperly calculates the guidelines range, treats the guidelines as mandatory, fails to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or fails to explain adequately the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>We examine substantive reasonableness \u201cunder an abuse of discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances\u201d and \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). We ordinarily \u201cexpect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), the sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection,\u201d namely, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future crimes of the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">In this case, Zavala\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable because the district court considered Zavala\u2019s personal characteristics and substantial criminal history, including assault with a deadly weapon, and found that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range satisfied the purposes of sentencing. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing Zavala to 77-months\u2019 imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ment. In addition, Zavala correctly notes that <em>Vega-CastAllo </em>remains binding precedent. Accordingly, we affirm Zavala\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-18\">. We note that Zavala did not make this argument in the district court. Therefore, even if we were not bound by <em>Vega-Castillo, </em>we would review Zavala\u2019s argument only for plain error. We also note that Zavala concedes in his brief on appeal that it is \"unclear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>on this record whether the district court would or would not have varied from the guidelines based on the fast-track disparity.\u201d Zavala brief at 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
