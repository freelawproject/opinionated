On appeal, he argues that: (1) the district court abused its discretion when it concluded that he committed a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3), even though state officials only charged him with a violation of \u00a7 316.1935(1); and (2) his 59-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Our \u201creasonableness\u201d . review \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">First, we are unpersuaded by Malloy\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion when it concluded that he committed a violation ' of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3). \u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may, upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment.\u201d <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107. A mandatory term of supervised release is that the defendant not commit another federal, state, or local crime. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). The commentary to the policy statements in the Sentencing Guidelines provides that a defendant may be charged with violating this mandatory term \u201cwhether or not the defendant has been the subject of a separate federal, state, or local prosecution for such conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1 comment. (n.l). Although these policy statements are not binding on the district court, it is still required to consider them. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 799 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">On the record here, the district court acted within its discretion when it revoked Malloy\u2019s supervised release by finding by a preponderance of the evidence that he violated Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.1935(3), even though state officials only charged him with a violation of \u00a7 316.1935(1). Nothing in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) requires the district court to base its revocation decision on only those violations charged by state officials, and the Sentencing Guidelines acknowledge this fact by indicating that district courts may revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release based on conduct that state officials choose not to prosecute. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1 comment. (n.l). The district court\u2019s consideration of, and ultimate agreement with, the Guidelines, standing alone, does not amount to an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to revoke Malloy\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">Nor has Malloy shown that his resulting sentence was substantively unreasonable. We review the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>(11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed To the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). We will remand for resentenc-ing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted). The burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Malloy\u2019s 59-month, above guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable. As the record shows, the district court analyzed Malloy\u2019s history and characteristics, recognizing that it had previously given Malloy multiple breaks, yet Malloy continued to engage in criminal activity. The court further noted that Malloy had previously fled and eluded police officers, which resulted in an officer having to seek immediate medical treatment. And here, Malloy again fled and eluded police officers without regard for the safety of others. The district court thus concluded that fleeing and eluding constituted a crime of violence under \u00a7 316.1935(3) because Mal-loy showed wanton disregard for the safety of the neighborhood, other drivers, and the police officers, and Malloy does not contest this conclusion. Based on this conduct, the court also concluded that a reasonable sentence was the statutory maximum penalty. In reaching this conclusion, the court placed more weight on the seriousness of the crime and Malloy\u2019s history and characteristics, and less weight on Malloy\u2019s arguments in mitigation, which is within its sole discretion. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 832.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">In addition, the court\u2019s findings regarding the important \u00a7 3553(a) factors are supported by the record, and Malloy\u2019s illegal activities occurred just over four months after he began his term of supervised release. Thus, Malloy has not demonstrated a clear error of judgment in the court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Further, the district court had the authority to vary the sentence above the guidelines range because Chapter Seven of the Sentencing Guidelines is \u201cmerely advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm his sentence as substantively reasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors a court should consider in sentencing a defendant after a revocation of supervised release include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics: (2) the need for the sentence to deter criminal conduct, protect the public from the defendant\u2019s further crimes, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment; (3) the sentencing guideline range; (4) any pertinent policy statement; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among similarly situated defendants; and (\u00f3) the need to provide restitution to victims of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a) and 3583(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AhA\">. Malloy has failed to offer any argument in his initial brief regarding the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, the district court's use of uncharged conduct in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ing the grade of his supervised release violation, or the sufficiency of the evidence for a \u00a7 316.1935(3) violation. He therefore has abandoned any argument pertaining to these issues. <em>See United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that \"issues not raised by a defendant in his initial brief on appeal are deemed waived\u201d). However, to the extent Malloy suggests that the district court did not consider specific mitigating evidence in determining his sentence\u2014 a procedural argument \u2014 Malloy\u2019s argument is without merit because the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and it was under no obligation to discuss each mitigating factor individually. <em>See Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 833.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
