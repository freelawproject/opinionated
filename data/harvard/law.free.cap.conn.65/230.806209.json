It is a general rule of law that a railroad corporation cannot by- its own act, without the consent of the legislature absolve itself of its public obligations. Wood\u2019s Railway Law, Yol. I., 25. But when the original grantee has, with the consent of the legislature, transferred the franchise with its property, the obligations which grow out of and are consideration for the franchise are transferred to the new owner, who, by the assent of the legislature, and by that assent only, has become the legal owner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-8\">It is then precisely as if the public grant had been made to the new possessor, for if the State through its legislature has assented to the transfer, the original grantee in divesting itself of the right to. operate a railroad has divested itself of the obligations and duties which are, for reasons of public policy, incident to aud inseparable from the lawful exercise of the right. And this is so whether the transfer be of the fee, or for a limited time. Wood\u2019s Railway Law, Vol, III., 1687; Pierce on Railroads, 283; Paterson\u2019s Ry. Acc. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 130, 131; <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Farnum, </em>9 Allen, <em>51; Mahoney </em>v. <em>Atlantic &amp; St. L. Ry. Co., </em>63 Me., 68; <em>Ditchett </em>v. <em>Spuyten Duyvil &amp; P.

Washington, </em>86 Va., 685.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b239-9\">The case of <em>Braslin </em>v. <em>Somerville Horse R. R., </em>145 Mass., 64, sustains the proposition, for the decision of that case <em>rests </em>upon the ground that the legislative assent only ratified the contract so far as the parties had themselves defined it, and that as the lease was only of a portion of the lessor\u2019s road and did not purport to transfer the franchise or even the whole of the property, the lessor was not absolved from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>the obligation inseparable from the ownership of the franchise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-5\">In a discussion of any authority holding that the lessor remains liable although the legislature has sanctioned the lease,it is to be carefully noted what tire lease or contract purports to convey. The lease in the case at bar was of the railway and all the rights, easements, franchises and privileges in connection therewith, with all the property of every nature and description and the right to receive for lessee\u2019s own use all tolls, profits, income and rents. The right to fix and determine the number and time of all trains, to fix all rates, employ and control all employees in connection with the business, and to have control of the business done or to be done, in connection with or on the leased property, is granted to the lessee. This right is exclusive. The lessee covenants to do, during the continuance of the lease, eveiy act and thing that may be by law required of or be obligatory upon it or the lessor, in respect to the operation, condition, maintenance and use of the railway and leased property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-6\">The ease of <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Vermont C. R. R. Co., </em>26 Vt., 717, appears from the opinion to have been a case of air unauthorized lease. The reason there assigned for holding the lessor liable \u2014 because otherwise it might be able to put its road into the hands of corporations or individuals of no responsibility \u2014 has no application to a ease where there is legislative assent. In the case at bar both the lessor and lessee are creatures of the General Assembly of this State, and the lessee had been already vested with power to construct and operate a railroad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b240-7\">There remains to be noticed a limited class of eases holding that the lessor cannot, in the absence of express legislative exemption, be discharged of its public obligations, on the ground that while the franchise exists the duties owed by it exist. We respectfully submit that the reason for such a decision has no applicability where the franchise itself is transferred with legislative sanction, so that the benefit of it to the original grantee is lost or suspended during the operation of the contract. The true rule, we submit, is as laid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>down by the authorities above cited, and in no event goes further than is expressed by the court in <em>Nugent </em>v. <em>B., C. &amp; M. R. R., </em>80 Me., at page 76 :\u2014 \u201cIn other words an authorized lease, without an exemption clause, absolves the lessor from the torts of the lessee resulting from the negligent operation and handling of its trains and the general management of the leased road, over which the lessor could have no control. But for an injury resulting from the negligent omission of some duty owed to the public, such as the proper construction of its road, station houses, etc., the charter company cannot in the absence of statutory exemption, discharge itself of legal responsibility.\u201d <em>St. L., W. &amp; W. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Carl, </em>28 Kan., 622. Such a rule recognizes the fact that there is no privity between the party injured by the negligent operation of the road, and the corporation which by authority of the legislature has transferred to another the exclusive 'control arid management of the trains and of all persons employed in their operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-5\">II. If the law as to the non-liability of the lessor is as we have above claimed it to be, there remains to be considered whether there is anything in the provisions of this particular lease which takes it out of the operation of the general rule. It will be claimed that by the terms of the lease the lessor retains such control of the finances of the road, and such control in the selection of the managing agent that the lessee is merely the general agent of the lessor, and that further, the provisions of the lease respecting indemnity to the lessor for all defaults of the lessee indicate that the parties did not contemplate any exemption of the lessor\u2019s liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b241-6\">The securing of indemnity, we submit, does not raise an obligation or liability where none otherwise exists. Nor is it any indication that the lessor and lessee intended that the lessor should remain liable. The best indication of their intention is to be found in the covenant of the lessee to do every act and thing that may be by law required of or obligatory upon it or the lessor in respect to the operation, condition, maintenance and use of the railway and demised premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>In conclusion, it is respectfully submitted that a fair and just construction of tliis lease transfers to the lessee, not as an agent but as a legal owner for the time being, the entire railroad and property of the lessor with the exclusive right to operate the railroad and to control its employees without let or hindrance by the lessor. Such transfer of property and franchise was approved by the General Assembly of the State, and as a legal effect of such approval the lessor is exempt from all liability for the negligent operation of the road by the lessee during the continuance of the lease.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-5\"><em>William H. Shields </em>and <em>Donald Or. </em>Perkins, for the appellee (plaintiff).</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b242-6\">I. The defendant claims that it is not responsible for the plaintiff\u2019s injury, because it was caused by the negligence of the servants of a corporation to which it had leased its road under an agreement ratified after its execution by Chap. LXXVL, Public Acts of 1869. It is conceded that except for the ratification of the lease by the statute, the defendant would be liable, notwithstanding the lease. A lease without statutory authority is <em>ultra </em>vires, and also void as against public policy. Redfield\u2019s Law of Railways (5th Ed.), 616; Pierce on Railroads, p. 283; Wood\u2019s Railway Law, p. 486, <em>n.; Thomas </em>v. <em>West Jersey </em>R. <em>Co., </em>101 U.

Co., </em>145 id., 67, and cases cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad5\">II. A railroad company cannot, on the ground of public policy, release itself from liability for the negligent operation of its road by a lessee, except under specific statutory provision authorizing such exemption. See authorities cited, <em>ante; </em>also <em>Washington Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>17 Wall., 445 ; <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Vermont R. Co., </em>26 Vt., 717 ; <em>Wabash R.

The case of <em>Braslin </em>v. <em>Somerville </em>is directly in point with the case at bar on the absence of any specific statutory exemption from liability, and also on the similarity of the leases, and the provision in each that the lessee indemnify the lessor from all damage by reason of its liability.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-5\">The statute does not either expressly or impliedly release the lessor from its liability to the public for injuries caused by the lessee in the operation of the road. The statute allows three forms of contract: 1. Any contract in relation to its business or property not forbidden by law. 2. A lease of its road and franchise. 3. A. contract for the operation of its road in connection with such connecting road. Surely the grant of the naked power to contract in relation to its business and property, and to operate its road in connection with a connecting road, cannot be said to include by implication an exemption from liability for the negligent operation of the road, under whatever contract is made. <em>Braslin </em>v. <em>Somerville H. R. Co., </em>145 Mass., 68.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-6\">III. Viewed in the light of the principles of law established by the foregoing authorities the lease in question does not exonerate the defendant for negligence in the operation of its road. The lessee was the agent of the defendant in the operation and management of the road, and the defendant is responsible for the negligent acts of the lessee or persons employed by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b243-7\">IV. On the facts it cannot be claimed successfully that the lessee stands in the relation, not of an agent, but a contractor to do a particular work entirely independent of the employer, and so is not liable. But even though it were held that the lessee was a contractor, yet on principle the defendant is liable for the injury in this case. Wood\u2019s Master and Servant, \u00a7 316, and cases there commented upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>and cited. Cooley on Torts, p. 644, and note. The injury consisted in the employees of the lessee allowing a heavy car under rapid propulsion, a dangerous agency, to escape from their control and run off of the layout within which they were bound to confine it, and run upon private property, and by collision injure the plaintiff, who was rightfully there attending to his own affairs. The injury resulted because the lessee did improperly the very thing it was employed to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b244-5\">\u201c Whoever for his own use brings on his land and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril.\u201d <em>Fletcher </em>v.

The complaint alleges that the defendant, through its agents and servants, on the 28th day of January, 1898, then having in their possession and control a certain engine and cars, the property of the defendant, and then running and moving the same upon the said railroad in the city of Norwich, in the exercise of their franchise and in operating their railroad, so negligently and carelessly managed the same that the plaintiff was thereby greatly cut, bruised, wrenched and wounded and was permanently disabled, to his great injury.

All freight bills, tickets, and printed matter used in the operation of the defendant road were in the name of the New York and New England Railroad Company with the addition \u2018Norwich and Worcester Division,\u2019 and some of the cars in use and the engines used at the time of the injury hereinafter referred to were the property of the defendant, and had the name of the defendant painted upon them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201c 9. At said time the general superintendent of the said New York and New England Railroad Company was the managing agent, selected by the said New York and New England Railroad Company to take charge of the defendant\u2019s railroad under said lease, and was a person satisfactory to the defendant company. He chose officials who had the power of hiring and discharging all employees including the employees causing the said injury, and the defendant company had no control over these employees except in its approval of the choice of said managing agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">\u201c 10. The general charge and determination of what expenditures should be made to keep the railroad, bridges, equipment and supplies of the defendant in the condition equal to that when leased, and what additions should be made for increased business, was confided to a managing agent appointed by agreement by the boards of directors of both roads, and the treasurer of the defendant paid the expenses authorized by such manager for such purposes from the funds received by the treasurer from the income of the road and property. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">\u201c16. The injury to the plaintiff was caused wholly by the unskilled and reckless management and operation of the defendant\u2019s railroad in the manner above stated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">\u201c17. The engineer and trainmen in charge of and operating the engine and cars above described which caused said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>accident, were employed as stated in paragraph 9 to work upon the defendant\u2019s railroad, and were paid by the treasurer as stated in paragraph 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201c 18. An action for the same cause of action was brought by this plaintiff against the New York and New England Railroad Company, and both causes were tried together by the court at the present session upon default and hearing in damages, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff to recover of the New York and New England Railroad Company the sum of four thousand five hundred dollars, damages, and his costs of suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201c19. Upon the foregoing facts the defendant admitted the negligence of the employees and the due care of the plaintiff and offered no evidence and made no claim in contradiction thereof, but asked the court upon the facts found to rule that the defendant was not liable for the injury complained of, and that nominal damages only should be assessed against this defendant; but the court refused so to rule and assessed substantial damages against the defendant, to wit: the sum of four thousand five hundred dollars.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The defendant appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court, on the sole ground that it is exempt from liability by reason of the indenture which exists between itself and the New York and New England Railroad Company, which is set out in the finding and which has received the legislative sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The defendant in its brief says: \u201c It is a general rule of law that a railroad corporation cannot by its own act, without the consent of the legislature, absolve itself of its public obligations, upon the principle that \u2018 where a corporation like a railroad company has granted to it by charter a franchise intended in large measure to be exercised for the public good, the due performance of those functions being the consideration of the public grant, any contract which disables the corporation from performing those functions, which undertakes without the consent of the State, to transfer to others the rights and powers conferred by the charter and to relieve the grantee of the burden which the charter im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>poses, is a violation of the contract with the State, and is void as against public policy.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">This is undoubtedly the law by all the authorities. The rule and the reason for it make the duty and the liability abide with the legal owner of the franchise. Thus, where a lease of a railroad is executed without legislative authority, the lessor remains liable for the <em>laches </em>and the neglect of the lessee, and may be sued therefor the same as though it was itself operating the road; the theory being in such cases that the lessee is the agent of the lessor. So, on the other hand, when the original grantee of a railroad franchise has, with the consent of the legislature, so transferred its property and its franchise to another that the transferee has become the legal owner thereof, then the obligations which grow out of and are the consideration for the franchise are transferred to the new owner. It is precisely as if the public grant had been made to the new possessor; for if the State through its legislature has assented to the transfer, the original grantee, in divesting itself of its property and of its right to operate a railroad, has also relieved itself of the obligations which are, for reasons of public policy, incident to and inseparable from the lawful exercise of the right. To this effect are the authorities cited upon the brief of the defendant, as fully as are those cited by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The question then in this case, and the only question, is whether or not the defendant has, with the consent and approval of the State, transferred the legal ownership of its franchise to the New York and New England R. R. Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The contract made between these parties received the approval of the legislature some months after it was executed, by the Act already referred to, which provides that: \u201c Any railroad company in this State * * * may take a lease of the property and franchises of, or lease its property and franchises to, any such railroad company, * * * and all such leases * * * heretofore made are hereby ratified and confirmed.\u201d The legislature can, therefore, be held to have approved no more than the parties have expressed by that contract. So the question is narrowed to an examination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>the contract, to discover if therein the parties have transferred from the defendant to the New York and New Eng-hind Railroad Company the ownership of the franchise with which the legislature had previously invested the defendant. There are in the contract no direct words indicating any such transfer; nor any words tending to show that the defendant expected to relieve itself from such duties and liabilities as its franchise imposed; nor that the New York and New England Railroad Company supposed it had become solely chargeable with such duties and liabilities. The contract is called a lease. In most of the provisions it is a lease, although in some of its features it seems more like a traffic arrangement than a lease. Like a lease, it does not purport to transfer the ownership, but only the right to use the property leased. The words of conveyance are \u201c demise, lease, rent;\u201d and the property \u201cdemised, leased and rented\u201d is all and singular the railway of the defendant, with all the lands on which the railway is located, and all rights, easements, franchises and privileges in connection therewith, or which are appurtenant thereto, together with all the personal property of the defendant used or to be used upon or in connection with the leased railroad, etc., as set out therein at great length. The consideration is a fixed annual rental. There is a fixed term and a stipulation that all the leased property, real and personal, shall at all times during the lease be kept in good repair; that all or any of it worn out, lost, or destroyed, shall be replaced and the whole returned at the end of the term to the defendant, in as good condition as to value, as it was at the date of the lease. The ownership of the franchise is not transferred, nor is it attempted to be transferred, any more than is the ownership of the railroad itself. On the contrary many of the provisions in the lease indicate that the defendant did not intend to part with its own franchise or undertake to do so. It promises and agrees on its part to maintain its own organization and existence as a body corporate in due form of law; that it will elect a lawful board of directors, a president, secretary or clerk, and a treasurer, and that such treasurer shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>satisfactory to the lessee, and shall employ proper and necessary clerks or assistants; and that it will do and perform all such acts, matters and things, as shall be proper and necessary to the due preservation of all the property, estate, rights, franchises and interests therein let and demised, as are needful to carry into effect the true effect and intent of the agreement; and promises to do all lawful corporate acts and things upon request of the lessee, to enable the lessee to make any addition to lands for the use of the demised railway, or to enable it to improve said railway or its curves, cuttings, embankments or lines of sight, or depot or other grounds ; while the lessee on its part promises and agrees to do all those things required by law to be done by those operating a railroad, the not doing of which might impair or forfeit the franchise of the defendant. The defendant preserves to itself an absolute control over all business done by the lessee upon the leased property, by requiring that the managing agent to be appointed by the lessee shall be a person satisfactory to itself; that its own treasurer shall collect all the moneys received from and the earnings of the leased property, and have possession of the same; from which he shall pay all the expenditures and dues incurred in respect to the property demised, all taxes, assessments and other liabilities, and shall, at the end of each six months, pay to himself for and on account of the defendant the semi-annual rent due by the terms of the contract, and the balance, if any, deliver over to the lessee, the said New York and New England Railroad Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We have examined this contract with all the care we were able to bestow, and have been able to come to no other conclusion than that the defendant did not intend to, and did not in fact, part with the legal ownership of its franchise by any stipulation contained therein, but purposely retained its franchise in its own ownership and under its own control. It is therefore not exempt from liability to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">A grant to a corporation of a right to lay out, construct and operate a railroad is the grant to the corporation of the capacity to exercise a portion of the powers of sovereignty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>for the purpose of making pecuniary profit to itself. This is its franchise. Such grants are never made except at the request of the corporation. In return, the corporation is held to have promised to pay just damages to any person injured by any want of care in using the right so granted. As the grant is of a public right in which every one of the public is a sharer, so the promise is to each one of the public. A due regard for the public rights obviously requires that a corporation which has asked for and received such a grant shall not be absolved from its promises except by an Act of the legislature to that effect so distinct and unequivocal as not to be open to mistake. Nothing should be left to inference. In this ease there is no such Act of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u25a0 In this opinion Fenn and Hamersley, Js., concurred; Torrance and Hall, Js., dissented.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b263-7\">Torrance, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuI\">(dissenting). In the result reached by the majority of the court in this case, I cannot concur. That result is, that the defendant is liable for what was in fact the negligent conduct of another corporation. It is based on the conclusion that the lease of February, 1869, though \u201c ratified and confirmed \u201d by the legislature, does not so transfer the franchise of the defendant, as to absolve it from liability for the acts of the lessee. Although the lease was in fact made before there was any legislative permission to make it, the subsequent legislative ratification placed it, in legal effect, \u2022upon the same footing as if it had been made and entered into after such permission had been granted. Regarding the matter from this point of view, let us consider briefly the Act granting such permission, and the lease which was, in legal effect, made in pursuance of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">The Act (Public Acts of 1869, Chap. 76) provides as follows: \u201c Any railroad company in this State <em>* </em>* * may take a lease of the property and franchises of, or lease its property and franchises to,\u201d any other railroad company \u201c with whose railroad its own railroad may connect or intersect. All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>such leases and contracts heretofore made are hereby ratified and. confirmed; provided that nothing in this Act shall be so construed as to authorize the merger or consolidation of the stock of any railroad companies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">By this Act the defendant was authorized to \u201clease its property and franchises \u201d to the lessee for such a period of time and upon such terms as might be agreed upon by the parties. Authority to \u201c lease its property and franchises \u201d as here used, clearly gives the lessor the right to convey and transfer \u201cits property and franchises \u201d to the lessee for and during the term of the lease. What does the word \u201cfranchises \u201d as used in this Act mean ? The word \u201c franchise \u201d is often used as a generic name, descriptive of all the rights, privileges, and immunities contained in the charter, including the right of the corporation to become and to continue to be a legal person; but in a narrower sense it includes only the rights, powers and privileges conferred by the legislature upon the corporation as such, after it has come into existence as a legal person. The right to form a railroad corporation is a franchise which may be said to belong to the corporators; while the right to take land for railroad purposes, to operate the railroad, and to take tolls therefor, are properly called \u201c franchises \u201d which belong to the corporation. It is in this narrower sense that the word \u201c franchises \u201d is used in this Act, for it clearly contemplates the continued existence of the lessor, as a corporation, in the use of all its \u201c franchises \u201d not transferred by the lease, and ready to resume the exercise of all its franchises at the termination of the lease ; and it is expressly forbidden to merge or consolidate its stock with that of the lessee. By this Act, then, the defendant was clearly authorized to transfer to the lessee for one hundred years, the right which it had under its charter to operate its then existing railroad, and its right to take tolls therefor, and any other \u201cfranchises \u201d of a similar nature, which the lessor might see fit to transfer. It was not authorized to transfer or assign its \u201c franchise,\u201d meaning by that its entire charter powers, either permanently or tempo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>rarily; it was only authorized to transfer temporarily its \u201c franchises \u201d in the narrower sense of the word franchise.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Such being the nature of the Act under which the lease was, in legal effect, made, let us look at the lease to see what it does transfer and convey to the lessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In the first place it begins by a recital which the legislature adopted, \u201c that it is believed to be for the advantage of the public \u201d that the railway and steamboat property of the defendant \u201cshould be managed and operated\u201d by the lessee for the term of one hundred years. In the next place the lease by apt and appropriate words transfers to the lessee for the term of one hundred years, the then existing railway of the defendant, and all its visible, tangible property of every kind, real or personal, and all its \u201c rights, easements, franchises and privileges, in connection therewith, or which are appurtenant thereto.\u201d It further provides as follows:\u2014 \u201c The business in connection with the leased property shall be managed and conducted as follows, to wit: The party of the second part shall fix and determine the number and time of all trains to run on the leased railway, to fix all rates of passenger and freight transportation, <em>employ </em>and <em>control all employees </em>in connection with the business, and have control of the business done or to be done, in connection with or on the leased property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The legal effect of these provisions, unless they are controlled by other provisions of the lease, is to transfer to the lessee for one hundred years, the exclusive right to use all the railroad property of the'defendant for railroad purposes; the exclusive right to operate, use, and control that property as a railway; and the exclusive right to hire, discharge, and control the persons who should be engaged in its operation and management.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">But the only other provisions which can by any possibility be claimed to control the legal effect of those already considered, are the following: First, the lessor is to appoint a treasurer satisfactory to the lessee, who is to receive as they accrue all earnings of the road, and pay all such expenditures as he knows to be correct and such others as are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ordered or approved by tbe lessee\u2019s managing agent, and semi-annually retain for tbe defendant the agreed rental, and turn over to the lessee the balance; second, the provisions in the lease respecting indemnity to the lessor for defaults or failures of the lessee in the operation and management of the railway, or in the use of the leased property; third and last, the provisions in relation to the appointment of a managing agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The provisions relating to the appointment and duties of the treasurer, are evidently put in as a method for securing the payment of the rent, and nothing more; they have no reference to the actual management and operation of the railway, or the hiring or discharge of employees, which are elsewhere provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The provisions for indemnity were evidently put in as a matter of caution, to cover cases where a duty still rested upon the defendant which the lessee had engaged to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">As to the managing agent the lease provides as follows: \u201c It is mutually agreed that the general charge and determination of what expenditures shall be made to keep the railway bridges, buildings, equipment, and supplies of the party of the first part equal to the present condition of the same, and what additions thereto may be required by the increased business of the road, shall be confided to a managing agent, to be agreed upon by the board of directors of the two companies,\u201d or, in default of such agreement, by certain arbitrators. This agent is to be removed on request of either of the parties. The duties of this agent relate solely to the preservation and protection of the reversionary interests of the lessor, and to the protection of the lessee upon its covenants with reference to such reversionary interests, and have nothing to do with the hire or discharge of servants and agents, or the actual operation of the railway in the running of trains.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The lease further provides that the lessee \u201c shall have a person in charge of the railroad and property, to be called the managing agent, who shall be a person satisfactory \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>to the lessor. This agent is appointed solely by the lessee, and at the time of the injury to the plaintiff this position was filled by its general superintendent. As stated in the finding: \u201c He chose officials who had the power of hiring and discharging all employees, including the employees causing said injury, and the defendant company had no control over these employees except in its approval of the choice of said managing agent.\u201d This managing agent was in no legal sense the agent or appointee of the lessor, any more than the treasurer of the lessor was the agent or appointee of the lessee. The fact that such agent was to be \u201c satisfactory \u201d to the lessor, gave it no control over the hire and discharge of the lessee\u2019s emplojrees, or the running of trains upon the leased railway; for the exclusive control of these matters is expressly given to the lessee, in the lease, just before the provision for the existence of this managing agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">These provisions, then, whether singly or combined, do not affect or control the legal effect of the provisions heretofore considered; and so the lease must be regarded as transferring to the lessee for one hundred years the exclusive right to operate this railway, and the exclusive right to hire and discharge and control the persons who from time to time are engaged in operating it. This being done with the legislative consent, with what propriety can the defendant be held liable for the acts of persons over whom it had and has no sort of control? The liability of a person for acts legally hurtful to another, is based, usually, upon his power to prevent or control such acts, or upon his power and control over the person who does them; and where there is no such power of prevention or control there can be, as a rule, no liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In the case at bar as the defendant had no power or control over the lessee or its employees who did the act complained of, I think it ought not to be held liable for the results of that act.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">In this opinion Hall, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
