The court charged the jury that if they found the existence of a known and established custom, as claimed by the plaintiffs, it would be presumed the parties contracted in view of it. <em>Held </em>that the charge was insufficient for the guidance of the jury in that it failed to instruct them what must be proved in order to show that the custom claimed was a known and established one, and in treating the presumption which might be drawn from it as one of law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-12\">A letter written by the plaintiffs to the defendant shortly before the commencement of the suit, asserting in detail the validity of theiT own claim and the unsoundness of the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, is inadmissible as evidence of the due performance by the plaintiffs of their contract. Such a letter stands upon the same ground as a party\u2019s declarations in his own favor.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b310-13\">If some portion of such a letter is competent evidence upon one branch of the case, such portion only should be read and the jury should be carefully instructed as to the purpose for which it is admitted.

The defense was that the plaintiffs\u2019 work and materials were furnished under a guarantee that the wells should furnish a supply of water sufficient for the needs of the defendant\u2019s hotel, and that they had utterly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>failed to do so; and a counterclaim growing out of the same matter.

The rule is well settled that where a custom exists in any trade or business that is uniformly followed by parties engaged in such business, and is reasonable and not opposed to any law, it will be presumed the parties contracted in reference to such usage. It is not necessary to aver such usage in the complaint. Rice on Ev., Vol. II., pp. 901, 904; <em>Bodfish </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>23 Me., 90; Chitty on Pl., Vol. I., p. 216; <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>32 Conn., 20 ; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Clews, </em>114 N.

They were instructed that to give a claimed usage effect it must be a \u201c known and established custom ; \u201d that \u201c it must be a universal, certain and general usage and custom of the trade, and not a custom of the plaintiffs only.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b314-7\">II. The letter was properly admitted in evidence. The objection taken by the defendant was that the letter was a declaration in plaintiffs\u2019 own interest. This objection cannot prevail. It was not designed to prove the facts recited therein, but merely to prove an offer of plaintiffs to do precisely as they had offered to do in a previous letter. The defendant cannot be now heard to urge an objection to evidence that was not made on the trial. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>36 Conn., 220; <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>24 id., 507; <em>Seger </em>v. <em>Barkhamsted, </em>22 id., 298.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b314-8\">Andrews, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmM\">Upon the trial the plaintiffs offered evidence and claimed to have proved that they bored four wells of the aggregate depth of 115 feet; that in boring these wells they started three or four other holes that were abandoned on account of striking solid bottom; and that there were about sixteen feet drilled in the holes that were so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>abandoned. The plaintiffs claimed to recover the contract price, |2.00 per foot for this drilling.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The defendant objected, on the ground that the written proposals made by the plaintiffs to the defendant did not include any such drilling And it appeared, in fact, that the proposals did not include any such holes. The plaintiffs offered to prove by their own agents that it was a custom of the trade of driving wells to charge for driving wells which did not produce water and which were abandoned. The defendant objected to this evidence upon the ground above stated, and also on the gi\u2019ound that the complaint contained no allegation making such evidence material. The court overruled this objection and admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In reference to this evidence the court charged the jury as follows: \u201c The plaintiffs include as a part of the work of digging these wells a number of feet driven in wells which proved to be failures. This charge they make upon the ground that it is a custom of the trade or business of digging wells like those contracted for, to charge for digging these wells which have to be abandoned as parts of the wells which are completed. Some evidence was offered from which it is claimed that you will find that such a custom exists. If you find there is a known and established custom in the trade to so charge, the parties will be presumed to have contracted with the custom in view and you can allow the claim. But it must be a universal, certain and general usage and custom of the trade, so proved by the evidence, and not a custom of the plaintiffs only, or the plaintiffs can recover only for the number of feet actually driven by them in the wells which were completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">This instruction seems to us to have been insufficient for the guidance of the jury in that it does not state what must be proved in order to show that a custom is a known and established one; and also in treating the presumption which might be drawn from such a custom as one of law. There was no evidence that the defendant had any actual knowledge of the custom, and she was liable if at all by reason of the custom, because it was a general, known and established one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>At the common law a custom was not an established one unless it was shown to have existed from time immemorial. By the more recent law the true test of such a custom is its having existed a sufficient length of time to have become generally known and to warrant the jury in finding that the contracts were made in reference to it. <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Bradlee &amp; Co., </em>9 Gill &amp; Johnson (Md.), 220; <em>Burroughs </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>10 Md., 248; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>1 Caines (N. Y.), 45; <em>Treadwell </em>v. <em>Union Ins. Co., </em>6 Cowen (N. Y.), <em>273; Crosby </em>v. <em>Fitch, </em>12 Conn., 410 <em>; Bliven </em>v. <em>New England Screw Co., </em>23 Howard, 431. No person can be made liable by reason of a custom, except when it is shown that he had knowledge of the custom. In eases where the custom is a limited or special one actual knowledge must be proved. And every custom is a limited or special one until it is shown to have existed long enough to sustain the test above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The defendant called as a witness her son who was also her business agent. He testified generally in her behalf and also in support of her counterclaim. Upon cross-examination counsel for the plaintiffs showed him the letter, Exhibit D, and asked him if he received the original of that letter. He replied that he might have received such a letter. Counsel then offered the letter in evidence, and on being asked for what purpose it was offered, stated: \u201cFor the purpose of refreshing the recollection of the witness whether Smith &amp; Winchester offered to proceed to put down as many wells, in addition to the four wells, as he desired.\u201d No other ground for the admission of the letter was stated by the counsel. After some considerable discussion between the opposing counsel, and with the court, the court admitted the letter to be laid in to the jury and read in evidence, remarking in doing so that \u201c it seemed to him to be proper in reply to the defendant\u2019s case.\u201d Counsel for the defendant objected, but not on the ground that the original was not produced, nor that it was offered at an improper time.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We think the admission of this letter, without carefully instructing the jury as to the part which might be read and the purpose for which it was admissible, was manifestly erro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>neous. It was a letter written by the plaintiffs only a short time before the suit was commenced, and, as appears on its face, after the dispute which resulted in the suit had already begun, setting forth with care and with considerable detail their own case both in chief and in reply to the counterclaim of the defendant. If it had been used only for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of the witness no harm could have been done, for it would not have been read to the jury. As evidence in reply to the counterclaim some three or four-lines near its close would perhaps be admissible. For this purpose the only fact which could legitimately be proved by the letter was, not that the plaintiffs were willing to fulfill their guarantee, but that the witness had knowledge of their willingness so to do, and the few lines might possibly be claimed to convey such knowledge. But this part of the letter would not be admissible, except in connection with evidence showing that the original letter was received by the witness before the expenses were made which were the subject of the counterclaim, and no such evidence appears to have been given. The letter was admitted generally, and the whole of it went to the jury as proper evidence for them to consider. Letters written by a party are not evidence for him any more than his declarations. This letter was not evidence of any fact stated in it. It was a naked claim by the plaintiffs that they had kept their agreement. It should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The other assignments of error we do not find it necessary to consider. Most of them are not well taken, and so far as they are well taken the grounds will not be likely to occur upon another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">There is error and a new trial is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
