It will thus be seen that the act imposes a tax on the right of succession, whether the property passes by will, by operation of law, ox by grant or gift to take effect in possession or enjoyment upon the death of the grantor or donor. The title of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the act is as follows: \u201cAn act relating to- the taxation of inheritances and providing for disposition of same,\u201d and the appellants contend that the title is not broad enough to sustain the provision imposing a tax upon property which passes by will or otherwise than by operation of law-.</p>\n<p id=\"AGt\">The word \u201cinheritance\u201d is no doubt properly confined to lands and tenements which pass by descent or by operation of law, but ini popular use this distinction is often disregarded, and this is especially true in succession or inheritance tax laws. The terms \u201cinherit,\u201d \u201cinheritance^\u201d and \u201cinheritance tax law,\u201d have thus been defined by lexicographers: Century Dictionary: \u201cInherit. In law it is used in contradistinction to acquiring by will, but, in popular use, this distinction is often disregarded. ... 3. To receive by transmission in any way; have imparted to or conferred upon; acquire from any source-. Inheritance. ... 4. A possession received by gift or without purchase; a permanent possession. 5. Possession; ownership; acquisition. Inheritance Tax Law. A statute imposing a tax on those acquiring property by inheritance- or will; sometimes taxing only collateral relatives and strangers, in such case commonly called collateral inheritance tax law.\u201d Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary: \u201cInheritance. ... 4. A possession received by gift or without purchase.\u201d Bouvier: \u201cInheritance. In civil law \u2014 the succession to all the rights of the deceased. It is of two kinds \u2014 that which arises by testament when the testator gives his succession to- a particular person, and that which arises by operation of law, which is called succession <em>ab intestat.\u201d </em>In contracts and wills the term \u201cInherit,\u201d is often construed to mean \u201cto take,\u201d \u201cto have-,\u201d \u201cto- receive,\u201d or \u201cto become possessed of.\u201d <em>Kohl v. </em>Frederick, 115 Iowa 517, 88 N. W. 1055; <em>Donald v. </em>Forger, 26 Misc. Rep. 16, 55 N. Y. Supp. 579; <em>Harris v. </em>Dyer, 18 R. I. 540, 28 Atl. 971; <em>Graham v. </em>Knowles, 140 Pa. St. 325, 21 Atl. 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">In revenue laws the term \u201cinheritance tax\u201d is- almost uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>versally employed to designate or describe a tax on the right of succession whether by operation of law, by will, or by grant. Thus, the title of the Pennsylvania act is as follows: \u201cAn act to provide fcr the better collection of collateral inheritance taxes.\u201d Laws of Pennsylvania, 1887, p. 79. The title of the Maine act is, \u201cAn act to tax collateral inheritances.\u201d Laws of Maine, 1893, chap\u2019. 146. The title of the Ohio, act is, \u201cAn act imposing a collateral inheritance tax.\u201d Laws of Ohio, 1893, ohapi 14. \u201cAn act to impose a direct inheritance tax.\u201d Laws of Ohio, 1894, pi, 166. All these acts, and others that might be cited with similar titles, contain provisions imposing a tax on devises and grants and gifts to take effect upon the death of the grantor or donor. These acts are not cited as authority to sustain the validity of the act in question, but for the purpose of showing the general and common use of the word \u201cinheritance\u201d in this connection. We are therefore of the opinion that the title of the act is broad enough to sustain the provision imposing a tax on the right of succession by will, as well as by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Mount, G.
