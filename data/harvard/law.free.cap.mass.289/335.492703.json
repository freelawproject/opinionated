There was a finding for the plaintiff. Four requests for rulings made by the defendants were denied. The first request was as follows: \u201cWhere written papers dated August 14, 1930, providing for the purchase of real estate were signed in duplicate by all the parties and were delivered by the vendor, who retained one copy and delivered the other copy to the proposed vendee \u2014, If the vendor\u2019s copy states in effect that he will pay the taxes only till August, 1930, while the vendee\u2019s copy makes no mention of taxes, there is a variance in the papers and there is no meeting of minds sufficient to predicate an action by the vendor on his copy.\u201d On a report to the Appellate Division the Appellate Division ruled \u201cthat there was prejudicial error in the refusal of trial court to grant the defendants\u2019 first request for ruling,\u201d and ordered the entry of judgment for the defendants. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The Appellate Division was right in ruling that the refusal of the defendants\u2019 first request was prejudicial error. This request contained an accurate narration of evidence in the case. The parties to the action \u201cexecuted two instruments\u201d which were introduced in evidence. Each of them purports to be a memorandum of a sale of real estate from the plaintiff to the defendants. They differ only in that following the words \u201cTaxes to be adjusted as follows,\u201d which appear in both instruments, the instrument delivered to the plaintiff, unlike the instrument delivered to the defendants, contains the words \u201cManuel Andrade agrees and assumes to pay the taxes for 1930 \u2014 from April to Aug. 1930.\u201d The report, which \u201ccontains all the evidence material to the questions reported,\u201d contains no extrinsic evidence tending to explain the inconsistency. See <em>Payson </em>v. <em>Lamson, </em>134 Mass. 593, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>594-595. The difference between the two instruments is substantial. In the absence, as here, of explanation by extrinsic evidence of the difference between them, the plaintiff\u2019s proof of a contract binding upon the defendants fails. <em>Vickery </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>202 Mass. 247, 249. Consequently the action could not be maintained by proof by the plaintiff that he was present at the time and place fixed for delivery of the deed and ready to deliver a deed conforming to the instrument delivered to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">Since a ruling in accordance with the defendants\u2019 first request would have disposed of the case in their favor, it is unnecessary to consider whether there was error in the denial of their other requests for rulings. And the Appellate Division rightly ordered the entry of judgment for the defendants. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 110, 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\"><em>Order of Appellate Division </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
