L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 70, to the effect that th\u00e9 tax for the year 1933 has been abated upon premises on Congress Street in Boston occupied by the' petitioner as a' tenant \u201cpaying taxes in full on said premises.\u201d The single justice ordered \u201cthat the petition be dismissed as a matter of law and not as a matter of discretion,\u201d and reported the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">We assume in favor of the petitioner that it was \u201cA person aggrieved\u201d and therefore entitled to apply to the assessors for an abatement under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 59, in the amended form appearing in St. 1933, c. 266,. \u00a7 1, and that if an abatement has in fact been granted it is entitled by means of this proceeding to obtain a certificate thereof \"from the present assessors under said \u00a7 70. The order of the single justice is to be construed as a ruling that as matter of law there was no evidence which would justify the issuance of the writ.. It follows that the sole question for decision is whether there is anything in the single justice\u2019s findings of subsidiary facts and in the evidence reported which would justify an ultimate finding that the assessors have abated the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The facts and evidence reported, in their aspect most favorable to the petitioner, may be summarized as follows: On December 29, 1933, the petitioner duly filed with the assessors its application for abatement on the usual form provided by the assessors. At that time the members of the board were Neal J. Holland, Henry Daily and Edward T. Kelly. The \"secretary of the board was Frederick E. Bolton. On the day on which the petition was filed \u201ca hearing was held\u201d, before Holland and Daily. Kelly, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>was chairman, was absent. At the conclusion of the hearing, Holland indorsed upon the face of the application the words \u201cAbate 7000 B of A,\u201d signed his name on one of the lines provided at the bottom of the form for the signatures \u2022of the assessors and handed it to Bolton. \u201cB of <em>A\u201d </em>was used by Holland as an abbreviation for \u201cBoard of Assessors.\u201d Thereafter that portion of the blank form immediately above Holland\u2019s signature was 'filled in with the appropriate figures, and signed by Bolton as secretary. The last paragraph of the application then read as follows: \u201cThis application having been considered by the Board of Assessors, it was voted that an abatement of $229.60 (Amount of tax) be allowed upon a valuation of $7000. F. E. Bolton .Secretary. N. J. Holland . . . Assessors of the City of Boston.\u201d On December 29, 1933, there were two meetings of the board of assessors attended by Holland and Daily, making a majority of the board. Holland presided. In the extended minutes of those meetings there is no reference to the petitioner\u2019s application or to any action taken thereon. On the face of the application there is stamped the following: \u201cAssessing Dept. City of Boston Abated Dec 30 1933.\u201d There was no evidence as to when or by whom this stamp was applied. There is also written at the bottom of the face of the application and at the left of Holland\u2019s signature the words \u201cNo Bd. Action Bd. Vote Required.\u201d There was no evidence as to when or by whom these words were written. They were not written by Holland or Daily or Bolton. It was the usual practice for the board of assessors to indicate upon the application what, if any, abatement was granted. Thereafter the secretary would fill the necessary figures in the blank spaces in the application and sign it. If no abatement was granted, the application was stamped \u201cDenied.\u201d If an abatement was granted} it would be \u201cposted\u201d in the record books of the board and various entries would be made by clerks, after which Bolton would sign the certificate which, is issued to the taxpayer. Many applications for abatement were \u201cconsidered by the assessors\u201d on December 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>The board of assessors, consisting of three members, must make such official decisions as are involved in the act of granting an abatement by vote, while they or a majority of them are in session as a board at a duly constituted meeting. They cannot act separately as individuals. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>School District in Lunenburg, </em>21 Pick. 75, 82. <em>Damon </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Framingham, </em>195 Mass. 72, 78. <em>Barnard </em>v. <em>Shelburne, </em>222 Mass. 76, 79. See <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>Scituate, </em>201 Mass. 107. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 60, makes careful provision for the keeping by the board of a record of all abatements and prescribes the particular items which shall enter into such record. One paragraph of this section reads as follows: \u201cIf the record of an abatement is made as a part of the record of a meeting of the board of assessors it shall be signed by the clerk or secretary of the board for that meeting; otherwise by a majority of the board.\u201d See also G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 66, \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">It is a general rule that where a public board is required to act through votes at meetings and to keep records of its acts, the record duly kept cannot be varied or added to by other evidence. <em>Halleck </em>v. <em>Boylston, </em>117 Mass. 469. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>98 Mass. 219, 221. <em>Lowell </em>v. <em>Wheelock, </em>11 Cush. 391. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crookston Lumber Co. </em>85 Minn. 405. <em>Sweetsir </em>v. <em>Chandler, </em>98 Maine, 145, 152. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGarry, </em>135 Mass. 553, 554; <em>Garvey </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>199 Mass. 47. See cases collected in 50 L. R. A. (N. S.) 99. Like other aspects of the so called paroi evidence rule, this is a rule of substantive law and not a part of the law of evidence. It forbids proof of acts of the board by any evidence other than the record. Records of the meetings of December 29 were in evidence, but they did not show any vote to abate the tax. There was nothing to show that the notation made by Holland or the stamp or the last paragraph of the petitioner\u2019s application signed by the secretary and quoted above was a part of a record of a meeting. It cannot be assumed without evidence that such entries on an application filed with a board are a part of the record of the acts of the board at a meeting. Nor are these entries a record of an abatement which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>not a part of a record of a meeting within that part of \u00a7 60 quoted above, because they are not \"signed ... by a majority of the board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">No record has been produced of action by the board, and therefore we can find nothing in the case which would support a finding that the assessors have abated the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
