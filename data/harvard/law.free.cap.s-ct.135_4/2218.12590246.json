Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code (Sign Code or Code), ch. 1, \u00a7 4.402 (2005).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Sign Code identifies various categories of signs based on the type of information they convey, then subjects each category to different restrictions. One of the categories is \"Temporary Directional Signs Relating to a Qualifying Event,\" loosely defined as signs directing the public to a meeting of a nonprofit group. \u00a7 4.402(P). The Code imposes more stringent restrictions on these signs than it does on signs conveying other messages. We hold that these provisions are content-based regulations of speech that cannot survive strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Sign Code prohibits the display of outdoor signs anywhere within the Town without a permit, but it then exempts 23 categories of signs from that requirement. These exemptions include everything from bazaar signs to flying banners. Three categories of exempt signs are particularly relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The first is \"Ideological Sign[s].\" This category includes any \"sign communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes that is not a Construction Sign, Directional Sign, Temporary Directional Sign Relating to a Qualifying Event, Political Sign, Garage Sale Sign, or a sign owned or required by a governmental agency.\" Sign Code, Glossary of General Terms (Glossary), p. 23 (emphasis deleted). Of the three categories discussed here, the Code treats ideological signs most favorably, allowing them to be up to 20 square feet in area and to be placed in all \"zoning districts\" without time limits. \u00a7 4.402(J).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The second category is \"Political Sign[s].\" This includes any \"temporary sign designed to influence the outcome of an election called by a public body.\" Glossary 23.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Code treats these signs less favorably than ideological signs. The Code allows the placement of political signs up to 16 square feet on residential property and up to 32 square feet on nonresidential property, undeveloped municipal property, and \"rights-of-way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00a7 4.402(I).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   These signs may be displayed up to 60 days before a primary election and up to 15 days following a general election.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The third category is \"Temporary Directional Signs Relating to a Qualifying Event.\" This includes any \"Temporary Sign intended to direct pedestrians, motorists, and other passersby to a 'qualifying event.' \" Glossary 25 (emphasis deleted). A \"qualifying event\" is defined as any \"assembly, gathering, activity, or meeting sponsored, arranged, or promoted by a religious, charitable, community service, educational, or other similar non-profit organization.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The Code treats temporary directional signs even less favorably than political signs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Temporary directional signs may be no larger than six square feet. \u00a7 4.402(P). They may be placed on private property or on a public right-of-way, but no more than four signs may be placed on a single property at any time.\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   . And, they may be displayed no more than 12 hours before the \"qualifying event\" and no more than 1 hour afterward.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioners Good News Community Church (Church) and its pastor, Clyde Reed, wish to advertise the time and location of their Sunday church services. The Church is a small, cash-strapped entity that owns no building, so it holds its services at elementary schools or other locations in or near the Town. In order to inform the public about its services, which are held in a variety of different locations, the Church began placing 15 to 20 temporary signs around the Town, frequently in the public right-of-way abutting the street. The signs typically displayed the Church's name, along with the time and location of the upcoming service. Church members would post the signs early in the day on Saturday and then remove them around midday on Sunday. The display of these signs requires little money and manpower, and thus has proved to be an economical and effective way for the Church to let the community know where its services are being held each week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   This practice caught the attention of the Town's Sign Code compliance manager, who twice cited the Church for violating the Code. The first citation noted that the Church exceeded the time limits for displaying its temporary directional signs. The second citation referred to the same problem, along with the Church's failure to include the date of the event on the signs. Town officials even confiscated one of the Church's signs, which Reed had to retrieve from the municipal offices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Reed contacted the Sign Code Compliance Department in an attempt to reach an accommodation. His efforts proved unsuccessful. The Town's Code compliance manager informed the Church that there\n   would be \"no leniency under the Code\" and promised to punish any future violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Shortly thereafter, petitioners filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, arguing that the Sign Code abridged their freedom of speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court denied the petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Sign Code's provision regulating temporary directional signs did not regulate speech on the basis of content.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5680421\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/966/#p979\">\n    587 F.3d 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (2009). It reasoned that, even though an enforcement officer would have to read the sign to determine what provisions of the Sign Code applied to it, the \" 'kind of cursory examination' \" that would be necessary for an officer to classify it as a temporary directional sign was \"not akin to an officer synthesizing the expressive content of the sign.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 978. It then remanded for the District Court to determine in the first instance whether the Sign Code's distinctions among temporary directional signs, political signs, and ideological signs nevertheless constituted a content-based regulation of speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Town. The Court of Appeals again affirmed, holding that the Code's sign categories were content neutral. The court concluded that \"the distinctions between Temporary Directional Signs, Ideological Signs, and Political Signs ... are based on objective factors relevant to Gilbert's creation of the specific exemption from the permit requirement and do not otherwise consider the substance of the sign.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537671\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/1057/#p1069\">\n    707 F.3d 1057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1069 (C.A.9 2013).

In light of that determination, it applied a lower level of scrutiny to the Sign Code and concluded that the law did not violate the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1073-1076.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We granted certiorari, 573 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12583024,12583025,12583026,12583027,12583028\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2900/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12583024,12583025,12583010,12583009\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/854/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), and now reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits the enactment of laws \"abridging the freedom of speech.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 1.

Some facial distinctions based on a message are obvious, defining regulated speech by particular subject matter, and others are more subtle, defining regulated speech by its function or purpose. Both are distinctions drawn based on the message a speaker conveys, and, therefore, are subject to strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Our precedents have also recognized a separate and additional category of laws that, though facially content neutral, will be considered content-based regulations of speech: laws that cannot be \" 'justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,' \" or that were adopted by the government \"because of disagreement with the message [the speech] conveys,\"\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

It defines \"Temporary Directional Signs\" on the basis of whether a sign conveys the message of directing the public to church or some other \"qualifying event.\" Glossary 25. It defines \"Political Signs\" on the basis of whether a sign's message is \"designed to influence the outcome of an election.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 24. And it defines \"Ideological Signs\" on the basis of whether a sign \"communicat [es] a message or ideas\" that do not fit within the Code's other categories.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 23. It then subjects each of these categories to different restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The restrictions in the Sign Code that apply to any given sign thus depend entirely on the communicative content of the sign. If a sign informs its reader of the time and place a book club will discuss John Locke's Two Treatises of Government, that sign will be treated differently from a sign expressing the view that one should vote for one of Locke's followers in an upcoming election, and both signs will be treated differently from a sign expressing an ideological view rooted in Locke's theory of government. More to the point, the Church's signs inviting people to attend its worship services are treated differently from signs conveying other types of ideas. On its face, the Sign Code is a content-based regulation of speech. We thus have no need to consider the government's justifications or purposes for enacting the Code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals offered several theories to explain why the Town's Sign Code should be deemed content neutral. None is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court of Appeals first determined that the Sign Code was content neutral because the Town \"did not adopt its regulation of speech [based on] disagree [ment] with the message conveyed,\" and its justifications for regulating temporary directional signs were \"unrelated to the content of the sign.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3537671\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/707/1057/#p1069\">\n    707 F.3d, at 1071-1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In its brief to this Court, the United States similarly contends that a sign regulation is content neutral-even if it expressly draws distinctions based on the sign's communicative content-if those distinctions can be \" 'justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.' \" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   20, 24 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ward, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 791,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; emphasis deleted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   But this analysis skips the crucial first step in the content-neutrality analysis: determining whether the law is content neutral on its face. A law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government's benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of \"animus toward the ideas contained\" in the regulated speech.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati v.

The Town's Sign Code likewise singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter.

The restrictions for political, ideological, and temporary event signs apply equally no matter who sponsors them. If a local business, for example, sought to put up signs advertising the Church's meetings, those signs would be subject to the same limitations as such signs placed by the Church. And if Reed had decided to display signs in support of a particular candidate, he could have made those signs far larger-and kept them up for far longer-than signs inviting people to attend his church services. If the Code's distinctions were truly speaker based, both types of signs would receive the same treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In any case, the fact that a distinction is speaker based does not, as the Court of Appeals seemed to believe, automatically render the distinction content neutral.

Thus, a law limiting the content of newspapers, but only newspapers, could not evade strict scrutiny simply because it could be characterized as speaker based.

Characterizing a distinction\n   as speaker based is only the beginning-not the end-of the inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nor do the Sign Code's distinctions hinge on \"whether and when an event is occurring.\" The Code does not permit citizens to post signs on any topic whatsoever within a set period leading up to an election, for example. Instead, come election time, it requires Town officials to determine whether a sign is \"designed to influence the outcome of an election\" (and thus \"political\") or merely \"communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes\" (and thus \"ideological\").

The Court of Appeals cited no precedent from this Court supporting its novel theory of an exception from the content-neutrality requirement for event-based laws.

A regulation that targets a sign because it conveys an idea about a specific event is no less content based than a regulation that targets a sign because it conveys some other idea. Here, the Code singles out signs bearing a particular message: the time and location of a specific event. This type of ordinance may seem like a perfectly rational way to regulate signs, but a clear and firm rule governing content neutrality is an essential means of protecting the freedom of speech, even if laws that might seem \"entirely reasonable\" will sometimes be \"struck down because of their content-based nature.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Ladue v.

Not \"all distinctions\" are subject to strict scrutiny, only\n   <em>\n    content-based\n   </em>\n   ones are.

See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.402(R).

At the same time, the presence of certain signs may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety. A sign ordinance narrowly tailored to the challenges of protecting the safety of pedestrians, drivers, and passengers-such as warning signs marking hazards on private property, signs directing traffic, or street numbers associated with private houses-well might survive strict scrutiny. The signs at issue in this case, including political and ideological signs and signs for events, are far removed from those purposes.

Content-based laws merit this protection because they present, albeit sometimes in a subtler form, the same dangers as laws that regulate speech based on viewpoint. Limiting speech based on its \"topic\" or \"subject\" favors those who do not want to disturb the status quo. Such regulations may interfere with democratic self-government and the search for truth.

This does not mean, however, that municipalities are powerless to enact and enforce reasonable sign regulations. I will not attempt to provide anything like a comprehensive list, but here are some rules that would not be content based:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Rules regulating the size of signs. These rules may distinguish among signs based on any content-neutral criteria, including any relevant criteria listed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Rules regulating the locations in which signs may be placed.

Like Justice KAGAN I believe that categories alone cannot satisfactorily resolve the legal problem before us. The First Amendment requires greater judicial sensitivity both to the Amendment's expressive objectives and to the public's legitimate need for regulation than a simple recitation of categories, such as \"content discrimination\" and \"strict scrutiny,\" would permit. In my view, the category \"content discrimination\" is better considered in many contexts, including here, as a rule of thumb, rather than as an automatic \"strict scrutiny\" trigger, leading to almost certain legal condemnation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To use content discrimination to trigger strict scrutiny sometimes makes perfect sense. There are cases in which the Court has found content discrimination an unconstitutional method for suppressing a viewpoint.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger v.

And there are cases where the Court has found content discrimination to reveal that rules governing a traditional public forum are, in fact, not a neutral way of fairly managing the forum in the interest of all speakers.\n   <em>\n    Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782915\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/92/#p95\">\n    408 U.S. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782915\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/92/#p95\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782915\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/92/#p95\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972)(\"Once a forum is opened up to assembly or speaking by some groups, government may not prohibit others from assembling or speaking on the basis of what they intend to say\"). In these types of cases, strict scrutiny is often appropriate, and content discrimination has thus served a useful purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   But content discrimination, while helping courts to identify unconstitutional suppression of expression, cannot and should not\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   trigger strict scrutiny. To say that it is not an automatic \"strict scrutiny\" trigger is not to argue against that concept's use. I readily concede, for example, that content discrimination, as a conceptual tool, can sometimes reveal weaknesses in the government's rationale for a rule that limits speech. If, for example, a city looks to litter prevention as the rationale for a prohibition against placing newsracks dispensing free advertisements on public property, why does it exempt other newsracks causing similar litter? Cf.\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230481\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/410/#p429\">\n    507 U.S. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230481\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/410/#p429\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230481\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/410/#p429\">\n    123 L.Ed.2d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). I also concede that, whenever government disfavors one kind of speech, it places that speech at a disadvantage, potentially interfering with the free marketplace of ideas and with an individual's ability to express thoughts and ideas that can help that individual determine the kind of society in which he wishes to live, help shape that society, and help define his place within it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Nonetheless, in these latter instances to use the presence of content discrimination automatically to trigger strict scrutiny and thereby call into play a strong presumption against constitutionality goes too far. That is because virtually all government activities involve speech, many of which involve the regulation of speech. Regulatory programs almost always require content discrimination. And to hold that such content discrimination triggers strict scrutiny is to write a recipe for judicial management of ordinary government regulatory activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Consider a few examples of speech regulated by government that inevitably involve\n   content discrimination, but where a strong presumption against constitutionality has no place.

The Court has said, for example, that we should apply less strict standards to \"commercial speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Service Comm'n of N. Y.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/#p562\">\n    447 U.S. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562-563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/#p562\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186683\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/557/#p562\">\n    65 L.Ed.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980). But I have great concern that many justifiable instances of \"content-based\" regulation are noncommercial. And, worse than that, the Court has applied the heightened \"strict scrutiny\" standard even in cases where the less stringent \"commercial speech\" standard was appropriate. See\n   <em>\n    Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.,\n   </em>\n   564 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450498,5923853\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2653/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2664,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450498,5923853\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2653/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011)(BREYER, J., dissenting). The Court has also said that \"government speech\" escapes First Amendment strictures. See\n   <em>\n    Rust v. Sullivan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/#p193\">\n    500 U.S. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193-194,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/#p193\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220676\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/173/#p193\">\n    114 L.Ed.2d 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). But regulated speech is typically private speech, not government speech. Further, the Court has said that, \"[w]hen the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.\"\n   <em>\n    R.A.V. v. St. Paul,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p395\">\n    505 U.S. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p395\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p395\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). But this exception accounts for only a few of the instances in which content discrimination is readily justifiable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   I recognize that the Court could escape the problem by watering down the force of the presumption against constitutionality that \"strict scrutiny\" normally carries with it. But, in my view, doing so will weaken the First Amendment's protection in instances where \"strict scrutiny\" should apply in full force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The better approach is to generally treat content discrimination as a strong reason weighing against the constitutionality of a rule where a traditional public forum, or where viewpoint discrimination, is threatened, but elsewhere treat it as a rule of thumb, finding it a helpful, but not determinative legal tool, in an appropriate case, to determine the strength of a justification. I would use content discrimination as a supplement to a more basic analysis, which, tracking most of our First Amendment cases, asks whether the regulation at issue works harm to First Amendment interests that is disproportionate in light of\n   the relevant regulatory objectives. Answering this question requires examining the seriousness of the harm to speech, the importance of the countervailing objectives, the extent to which the law will achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so.

Admittedly, this approach does not have the simplicity of a mechanical use of categories.

For example, some municipalities generally prohibit illuminated signs in residential neighborhoods, but lift that ban for signs that identify the address of a home or the name of its owner or occupant. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   City of Truth or Consequences, N. M., Code of Ordinances, ch. 16, Art. XIII, \u00a7\u00a7 11-13-2.3, 11-13-2.9(H)(4) (2014). In other municipalities, safety signs such as \"Blind Pedestrian Crossing\" and \"Hidden Driveway\" can be posted without a permit, even as other permanent signs require one. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Code of Athens-Clarke County, Ga., Pt. III, \u00a7 7-4-7(1) (1993). Elsewhere, historic site markers-for example, \"George Washington Slept Here\"-are also exempt from general regulations. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dover, Del., Code of Ordinances, Pt. II, App. B, Art. 5, \u00a7 4.5(F) (2012). And similarly, the federal Highway Beautification Act limits signs along interstate highways unless, for instance, they direct travelers to \"scenic and historical attractions\" or advertise free coffee. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20131\">\n    23 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), (c)(1), (c)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Given the Court's analysis, many sign ordinances of that kind are now in jeopardy.

Says the majority: When laws \"single[ ] out specific subject matter,\" they are \"facially content based\"; and when they are facially content based, they are automatically subject to strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2230, 2232 - 2233. And although the majority holds out hope that some sign laws with subject-matter exemptions \"might survive\" that stringent review,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2232 - 2233, the likelihood is that most will be struck down. After all, it is the \"rare case[ ] in which a speech restriction withstands strict scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee v.

So on the majority's view, courts would have to determine that a town has a compelling interest in informing passersby where George Washington slept. And likewise, courts would have to find that a town has no other way to prevent hidden-driveway mishaps than by specially treating hidden-driveway signs. (Well-placed speed bumps? Lower speed limits? Or how about just a ban on hidden driveways?) The consequence-unless courts water down strict scrutiny to something unrecognizable-is that our communities will find themselves in an unenviable bind: They will have to either repeal the exemptions that allow for helpful signs on streets and sidewalks, or else lift their sign restrictions altogether and resign themselves to the resulting clutter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Although the majority insists that applying strict scrutiny to all such ordinances is \"essential\" to protecting First Amendment freedoms,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2231, I find it challenging to understand why that is so. This Court's decisions articulate two important and related reasons for subjecting content-based speech regulations to the most exacting standard of review. The first is \"to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.\"\n   <em>\n    McCullen v.

The second is to ensure that the government has not regulated speech \"based on hostility-or favoritism-towards the underlying message expressed.\"\n   <em>\n    R.A.V. v. St. Paul,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p395\">\n    505 U.S. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p395\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481163\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/377/#p395\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992). Yet the subject-matter exemptions included in many sign ordinances do not implicate those concerns. Allowing residents, say, to install a light bulb over \"name and address\" signs but no others does not distort the marketplace of ideas. Nor does that different treatment give rise to an inference of impermissible government motive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We apply strict scrutiny to facially content-based regulations of speech, in keeping with the rationales just described, when there is any \"realistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.\"\n   <em>\n    Davenport v.

See Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. I, \u00a7\u00a7 4.402(J), (P)(2) (2014). Similarly, the Town offers no coherent justification for restricting the size of directional signs to 6 square feet while allowing other signs to reach 20 square feet. See \u00a7\u00a7 4.402(J), (P)(1). The best the Town could come up with at oral argument was that directional signs \"need to be smaller because they need to guide travelers along a route.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 40. Why exactly a smaller sign better helps travelers get to where they are going is left a mystery. The absence of any sensible basis for these and other distinctions dooms the Town's ordinance under even the intermediate scrutiny that the Court typically applies to \"time, place, or manner\" speech regulations. Accordingly, there is no need to decide in this case whether strict scrutiny applies to every sign ordinance in every town across this country containing a subject-matter exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   I suspect this Court and others will regret the majority's insistence today on answering that question in the affirmative. As the years go by, courts will discover that thousands of towns have such ordinances, many of them \"entirely reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2231. And as the challenges to them mount, courts will have to invalidate one after the other. (This Court may soon find itself a veritable Supreme Board of Sign Review.) And courts will strike down those democratically enacted local laws even though no one-certainly not the majority-has ever explained why the vindication of First Amendment values requires that result. Because I see no reason why such an easy case calls for us to cast a constitutional pall on reasonable regulations quite unlike the law before us, I concur only in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
