Petitioner Samuel Johnson is a felon with a long criminal record. In 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation began to monitor him because of his involvement in a white-supremacist organization that the Bureau suspected was planning to commit acts of terrorism. During the investigation, Johnson disclosed to undercover agents that he had manufactured explosives and that he planned to attack \"the Mexican consulate\" in Minnesota, \"progressive bookstores,\" and \" 'liberals.' \" Revised Presentence Investigation in No. 0:12CR00104-001 (D. Minn.), p. 15, \u00b6 16. Johnson showed the agents his AK-47 rifle, several semiautomatic firearms, and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After his eventual arrest, Johnson pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of \u00a7 922(g). The Government requested an enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act. It argued that three of Johnson's previous offenses-including unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, see Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.67(2006)-qualified as violent felonies. The District Court agreed and sentenced Johnson to a 15-year prison term under the Act. The Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20Fed.%20Appx.%20708\">\n    526 Fed.Appx. 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.A.8 2013)(\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ).

The court's task goes beyond deciding whether creation of risk is an element of the crime. That is so because, unlike the part of the definition of a violent felony that asks whether the crime \"has\n   <em>\n    as an element\n   </em>\n   the use ... of physical force,\" the residual clause asks whether the crime \"\n   <em>\n    involves conduct\n   </em>\n   \" that presents too much risk of physical injury. What is more, the inclusion of burglary and extortion among the enumerated offenses preceding the residual clause confirms that the court's task also goes beyond evaluating the chances that the physical acts that make up the crime will injure someone. The act of making an extortionate demand or breaking and entering into someone's home does not, in and of itself, normally cause physical injury. Rather, risk of injury arises because the extortionist might engage in violence\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   making his demand or because the burglar might confront a resident in the home\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   breaking and entering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We are convinced that the indeterminacy of the wide-ranging inquiry required by the residual clause both denies fair notice to defendants and invites arbitrary enforcement by judges. Increasing a defendant's sentence under the clause denies due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Two features of the residual clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague. In the first place, the residual clause leaves grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime. It ties the judicial assessment of risk to a judicially imagined \"ordinary case\" of a crime, not to real-world facts or statutory elements. How does one go about deciding what kind of conduct the \"ordinary case\" of a crime involves? \"A statistical analysis of the state reporter? A survey? Expert evidence? Google? Gut instinct?\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mayer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3433120\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/560/948/#p952\">\n    560 F.3d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 952 (C.A.9 2009)(Kozinski, C.J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). To take an example, does the ordinary instance of witness tampering involve offering a witness a bribe? Or threatening a witness with violence? Critically, picturing the criminal's behavior is not enough; as we have already discussed, assessing \"potential risk\" seemingly requires the judge to imagine how the idealized ordinary\n   case of the crime subsequently plays out.\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   illustrates how speculative (and how detached from statutory elements) this enterprise can become. Explaining why attempted burglary poses a serious potential risk of physical injury, the Court said: \"An armed would-be burglar may be spotted by a police officer, a private security guard, or a participant in a neighborhood watch program. Or a homeowner ... may give chase, and a violent encounter may ensue.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    550 U.S., at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The dissent, by contrast, asserted that any confrontation that occurs during an attempted burglary \"is likely to consist of nothing more than the occupant's yelling 'Who's there?' from his window, and the burglar's running away.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 226,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of SCALIA, J.). The residual clause offers no reliable way to choose between these competing accounts of what \"ordinary\" attempted burglary involves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the same time, the residual clause leaves uncertainty about how much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony. It is one thing to apply an imprecise \"serious potential risk\" standard to real-world facts; it is quite another to apply it to a judge-imagined abstraction. By asking whether the crime \"\n   <em>\n    otherwise\n   </em>\n   involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk,\" moreover, the residual clause forces courts to interpret \"serious potential risk\" in light of the four enumerated crimes-burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives. These offenses are \"far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.\"\n   <em>\n    Begay,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674072\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/137/\">\n    553 U.S., at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674072\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/137/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Does the ordinary burglar invade an occupied home by night or an unoccupied home by day? Does the typical extortionist threaten his victim in person with the use of force, or does he threaten his victim by mail with the revelation of embarrassing personal information? By combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the residual clause produces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This Court has acknowledged that the failure of \"persistent efforts ... to establish a standard\" can provide evidence of vagueness.\n   <em>\n    United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"341573\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/255/81/#p91\">\n    255 U.S. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 91,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"341573\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/255/81/#p91\">\n    41 S.Ct. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"341573\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/255/81/#p91\">\n    65 L.Ed. 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1921). Here, this Court's repeated attempts and repeated failures to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause confirm its hopeless indeterminacy. Three of the Court's previous four decisions about the clause concentrated on the level of risk posed by the crime in question, though in each case we found it necessary to resort to a different ad hoc test to guide our inquiry. In\n   <em>\n    James,\n   </em>\n   we asked whether \"the risk posed by attempted burglary is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses,\" namely completed burglary; we concluded that it was.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    550 U.S., at 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That rule takes care of attempted burglary, but offers no help at all with respect to the vast majority of offenses, which have no apparent analog among the enumerated crimes. \"Is, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 215,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Chambers,\n   </em>\n   our next case to focus on risk, relied principally on a statistical report prepared by the Sentencing Commission to conclude that an offender who fails to report to prison is not \"significantly more likely than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender, thereby producing a 'serious potential risk of physical\n   injury.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/\">\n    555 U.S., at 128-129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So much for failure to report to prison, but what about the tens of thousands of federal and state crimes for which no comparable reports exist? And even those studies that are available might suffer from methodological flaws, be skewed toward rarer forms of the crime, or paint widely divergent pictures of the riskiness of the conduct that the crime involves.

But common sense is a much less useful criterion than it sounds-as\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   itself illustrates. The Indiana statute involved in that case covered everything from provoking a high-speed car chase to merely failing to stop immediately after seeing a police officer's signal. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2289-2290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (KAGAN, J., dissenting). How does common sense help a federal court discern where the \"ordinary case\" of vehicular flight in Indiana lies along this spectrum? Common sense has not even produced a consistent conception of the degree of risk posed by each of the four enumerated crimes; there is no reason to expect it to fare any better with respect to thousands of unenumerated crimes. All in all,\n   <em>\n    James,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chambers,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   failed to establish any generally applicable test that prevents the risk comparison required by the residual clause from devolving into guesswork and intuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The remaining case,\n   <em>\n    Begay,\n   </em>\n   which preceded\n   <em>\n    Chambers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   , took an entirely different approach. The Court held that in order to qualify as a violent felony under the residual clause, a crime must resemble the enumerated offenses \"in kind as well as in degree of risk posed.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674072\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/137/\">\n    553 U.S., at 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674072\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/137/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court deemed drunk driving insufficiently similar to the listed crimes, because it typically does not involve \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 144-145,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674072\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/553/137/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Alas,\n   <em>\n    Begay\n   </em>\n   did not succeed in bringing clarity to the meaning of the residual clause. It did not (and could not) eliminate the need to imagine the kind of conduct typically involved in a crime. In addition, the enumerated crimes are not much more similar to one another in kind than in degree of risk posed, and the concept of \"aggressive conduct\" is far from clear.\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   criticized the \"purposeful, violent, and aggressive\" test as an \"addition to the statutory text,\" explained that \"levels of risk\" would normally be dispositive, and confined\n   <em>\n    Begay\n   </em>\n   to \"strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes.\" 564 U.S., at ---- - ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4335985,12450132\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/1/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2275-2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The present case, our fifth about the meaning of the residual clause, opens a new front of uncertainty. When deciding whether unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun is a violent felony, do we confine our attention to the risk that the shotgun will go off by accident while in someone's possession? Or do we also consider the possibility that the person possessing the shotgun will later use it to commit a crime? The inclusion of burglary and extortion among the enumerated offenses suggests that a crime may qualify under the residual clause even if the physical injury is remote from the criminal act. But how remote is too remote? Once again, the residual clause yields no answers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This Court is not the only one that has had trouble making sense of the residual\n   clause. The clause has \"created numerous splits among the lower federal courts,\" where it has proved \"nearly impossible to apply consistently.\"\n   <em>\n    Chambers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/\">\n    555 U.S., at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679441\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/122/\">\n    129 S.Ct. 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (ALITO, J., concurring in judgment). The most telling feature of the lower courts' decisions is not division about whether the residual clause covers this or that crime (even clear laws produce close cases); it is, rather, pervasive disagreement about the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to conduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to consider. Some judges have concluded that deciding whether conspiracy is a violent felony requires evaluating only the dangers posed by the \"simple act of agreeing [to commit a crime],\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Whitson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220613\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/1218/#p1222\">\n    597 F.3d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1222 (C.A.11 2010)(\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ); others have also considered the probability that the agreement will be carried out,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Some judges have assumed that the battery of a police officer (defined to include the slightest touching) could \"explode into violence and result in physical injury,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5657319\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/1143/#p1149\">\n    559 F.3d 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1149 (C.A.10 2009); others have felt that it \"do[es] a great disservice to law enforcement officers\" to assume that they would \"explod[e] into violence\" rather than \"rely on their training and experience to determine the best method of responding,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Some judges considering whether statutory rape qualifies as a violent felony have concentrated on cases involving a perpetrator much older than the victim,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Daye,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668708\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/571/225/#p230\">\n    571 F.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230-231 (C.A.2 2009); others have tried to account for the possibility that \"the perpetrator and the victim [might be] close in age,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Disagreements like these go well beyond disputes over matters of degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It has been said that the life of the law is experience. Nine years' experience trying to derive meaning from the residual clause convinces us that we have embarked upon a failed enterprise. Each of the uncertainties in the residual clause may be tolerable in isolation, but \"their sum makes a task for us which at best could be only guesswork.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2562 - 2563 (opinion of ALITO, J.). True enough, though we think many of the cases the Government and the dissent deem easy turn out not to be so easy after all. Consider just one of the Government's examples, Connecticut's offense of \"rioting at a correctional institution.\" See\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That certainly sounds like a violent felony-until one realizes that Connecticut defines this offense to include taking part in \"any disorder, disturbance, strike, riot or other organized disobedience to the rules and regulations\" of the prison. Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 53a-179b(a)(2012). Who is to say which the ordinary \"disorder\" most closely resembles-a full-fledged prison riot, a food-fight in the prison cafeteria, or a \"passive and nonviolent [act] such as disregarding an order to move,\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768227\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/85/\">\n    616 F.3d, at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Parker, J., dissenting)?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In all events, although statements in some of our opinions could be read to\n   suggest otherwise, our\n   <em>\n    holdings\n   </em>\n   squarely contradict the theory that a vague provision is constitutional merely because there is some conduct that clearly falls within the provision's grasp. For instance, we have deemed a law prohibiting grocers from charging an \"unjust or unreasonable rate\" void for vagueness-even though charging someone a thousand dollars for a pound of sugar would surely be unjust and unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    L.

We have similarly deemed void for vagueness a law prohibiting people on sidewalks from \"conduct[ing] themselves in a manner annoying to persons passing by\"-even though spitting in someone's face would surely be annoying.\n   <em>\n    Coates v. Cincinnati,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11734946\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/611/\">\n    402 U.S. 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11734946\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/611/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11734946\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/402/611/\">\n    29 L.Ed.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971). These decisions refute any suggestion that the existence of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   obviously risky crimes establishes the residual clause's constitutionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Resisting the force of these decisions, the dissent insists that \"a statute is void for vagueness only if it is vague in all its applications.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 2574. It claims that the prohibition of unjust or unreasonable rates in\n   <em>\n    L. Cohen Grocery\n   </em>\n   was \"vague in all applications,\" even though one can easily envision rates so high that they are unreasonable by any measure.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 2582. It seems to us that the dissent's supposed requirement of vagueness in all applications is not a requirement at all, but a tautology: If we hold a statute to be vague, it is vague in all its applications (and never mind the reality). If the existence of some clearly unreasonable rates would not save the law in\n   <em>\n    L. Cohen Grocery,\n   </em>\n   why should the existence of some clearly risky crimes save the residual clause?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government and the dissent next point out that dozens of federal and state criminal laws use terms like \"substantial risk,\" \"grave risk,\" and \"unreasonable risk,\" suggesting that to hold the residual clause unconstitutional is to place these provisions in constitutional doubt. See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2558 - 2559. Not at all. Almost none of the cited laws links a phrase such as \"substantial risk\" to a confusing list of examples. \"The phrase 'shades of red,' standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase 'fire-engine red, light pink, maroon,\n   <em>\n    navy blue,\n   </em>\n   or colors that otherwise involve shades of red' assuredly does so.\"\n   <em>\n    James,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    550 U.S., at 230, n. 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SCALIA, J., dissenting). More importantly, almost all of the cited laws require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages\n   <em>\n    on a particular occasion\n   </em>\n   . As a general matter, we do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as \"substantial risk\" to real-world conduct; \"the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly ... some matter of degree,\"\n   <em>\n    Nash v.

The residual clause, however, requires application of the \"serious potential risk\" standard to an idealized ordinary case of the crime. Because \"the elements necessary to determine the imaginary ideal are uncertain both in nature and degree of effect,\" this abstract inquiry offers significantly less predictability than one \"[t]hat deals with the actual, not with an imaginary condition other than the facts.\"\n   <em>\n    International Harvester Co. of America v.

Heller,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p625\">\n    554 U.S. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p625\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p625\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), but are instead primarily intended for use in criminal activity. In light of that intended use, the Government reasons that the ordinary case of this possession offense will involve the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   of a short-barreled shotgun in a serious crime, a scenario obviously posing a serious risk of physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   But even assuming that those who unlawfully possess these weapons typically intend to use them in a serious crime, the risk that the Government identifies arises not from the act of possessing the weapon, but from the act of using it. Unlike attempted burglary (at least of the type at issue in\n   <em>\n    James\n   </em>\n   ) or intentional vehicular flight-conduct that by itself often or always invites a dangerous confrontation-possession of a short-barreled shotgun poses a threat\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when an offender decides\n   to engage in additional, voluntary conduct that is not included in the elements of the crime. Until this weapon is assembled, loaded, or used, for example, it poses no risk of injury to others in and of itself. The risk of injury to others from mere possession of this firearm is too attenuated to treat this offense as a violent felony. I would reverse the Court of Appeals on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As the foregoing analysis demonstrates, ACCA's residual clause can be applied in a principled manner.

The notion that such laws may be void under the Constitution's Due Process Clauses, however, is a more recent development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Before the end of the 19th century, courts addressed vagueness through a rule of strict construction of penal statutes, not a rule of constitutional law. This rule of construction-better known today as the rule of lenity-first emerged in 16th-century England in reaction to Parliament's practice of making large swaths of crimes capital offenses, though it did not gain broad acceptance until the following century. See Hall, Strict or Liberal Construction of Penal Statutes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%20748\">\n    48 Harv. L.

Courts relied on this rule of construction in refusing to apply vague capital-offense statutes to prosecutions before them. As an example of this rule, William Blackstone described a notable instance in which an English statute imposing the death penalty on anyone convicted of \"stealing sheep,\n   <em>\n    or other cattle\n   </em>\n   \" was \"held to extend to nothing but mere sheep\" as \"th[e] general words, 'or other cattle,' [were] looked upon as much too loose to create a capital offence.\" 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 88 (1765).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Vague statutes surfaced on this side of the Atlantic as well. Shortly after the First Congress proposed the Bill of Rights, for instance, it passed a law providing\n   \"[t]hat every person who shall attempt to trade with the Indian tribes, or be found in the Indian country with such merchandise in his possession as are usually vended to the Indians, without a license,\" must forfeit the offending goods.

At first glance, punishing the unlicensed possession of \"merchandise ... usually vended to the Indians,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   would seem far more likely to \"invit [e] arbitrary enforcement,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2557, than does the residual clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   But rather than strike down arguably vague laws under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, antebellum American courts-like their English predecessors-simply refused to apply them in individual cases under the rule that penal statutes should be construed strictly.

Instead, our modern vagueness doctrine materialized after the rise of substantive due process. Following the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, corporations began to use that Amendment's Due Process Clause to challenge state laws that attached penalties to unauthorized commercial conduct. In addition to claiming that these laws violated their substantive due process rights, these litigants began-with some success-to contend that such laws were unconstitutionally indefinite. In one case, a railroad company challenged a Tennessee law authorizing penalties against any railroad that demanded \"more than a just and reasonable compensation\" or engaged in \"unjust and unreasonable discrimination\" in setting its rates.\n   <em>\n    Louisville &amp; Nashville R.

Anxious to rid our docket of bothersome residual clause cases, the Court is willing to do what it takes to get the job done. So brushing aside\n   <em>\n    stare decisis,\n   </em>\n   the Court holds that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague even though we have twice rejected that very argument within the last eight years. The canons of interpretation get no greater respect. Inverting the canon that\n   a statute should be construed if possible to avoid unconstitutionality, the Court rejects a reasonable construction of the residual clause that would avoid any vagueness problems, preferring an alternative that the Court finds to be unconstitutionally vague. And the Court is not stopped by the well-established rule that a statute is void for vagueness only if it is vague in all its applications. While conceding that some applications of the residual clause are straightforward, the Court holds that the clause is now void in its entirety. The Court's determination to be done with residual clause cases, if not its fidelity to legal principles, is impressive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Petitioner Samuel Johnson (unlike his famous namesake) has led a life of crime and violence. His presentence investigation report sets out a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of petty and serious crimes, beginning when he was 12 years old. Johnson's adult record includes convictions for, among other things, robbery, attempted robbery, illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, and a drug offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In 2010, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began monitoring Johnson because of his involvement with the National Socialist Movement, a white-supremacist organization suspected of plotting acts of terrorism. In June of that year, Johnson left the group and formed his own radical organization, the Aryan Liberation Movement, which he planned to finance by counterfeiting United States currency. In the course of the Government's investigation, Johnson \"disclosed to undercover FBI agents that he manufactured napalm, silencers, and other explosives for\" his new organization.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"321\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=526%20Fed.%20Appx.%20708\">\n    526 Fed.Appx. 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 709 (C.A.8 2013)(\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ). He also showed the agents an AK-47 rifle, a semiautomatic rifle, a semiautomatic pistol, and a cache of approximately 1,100 rounds of ammunition. Later, Johnson told an undercover agent: \"You know I'd love to assassinate some ... hoodrats as much as the next guy, but I think we really got to stick with high priority targets.\" Revised Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) \u00b6 15. Among the top targets that he mentioned were \"the Mexican consulate,\" \"progressive bookstores,\" and individuals he viewed as \"liberals.\" PSR \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In April 2012, Johnson was arrested, and he was subsequently indicted on four counts of possession of a firearm by a felon and two counts of possession of ammunition by a felon, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"322\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)and \u00a7 924(e). He pleaded guilty to one of the firearms counts, and the District Court sentenced him to the statutory minimum of 15 years' imprisonment under ACCA, based on his prior felony convictions for robbery, attempted robbery, and illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   ACCA provides a mandatory minimum sentence for certain violations of \u00a7 922(g), which prohibits the shipment, transportation, or possession of firearms or ammunition by convicted felons, persons previously committed to a mental institution, and certain others. Federal law normally provides a maximum sentence of 10 years' imprisonment for such crimes. See \u00a7 924(a)(2). Under ACCA, however, if a defendant convicted under \u00a7 922(g)has three prior convictions \"for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,\" the sentencing court must impose a sentence of at least 15 years' imprisonment. \u00a7 924(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   ACCA's definition of a \"violent felony\" has three parts. First, a felony qualifies if it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\n   against the person of another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Second, the Act specifically names four categories of qualifying felonies: burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives. See \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Third, the Act contains what we have called a \"residual clause,\" which reaches any felony that \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The present case concerns the residual clause. The sole question raised in Johnson's certiorari petition was whether possession of a sawed-off shotgun under Minnesota law qualifies as a violent felony under that clause. Although Johnson argued in the lower courts that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague, he did not renew that argument here. Nevertheless, after oral argument, the Court raised the question of vagueness on its own. The Court now holds that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague in all its applications.

That language is by no means incomprehensible. Nor is it unusual. There are scores of federal and state laws that employ similar standards.

If all these laws are unconstitutionally vague, today's decision is not a blast from a sawed-off shotgun; it is a nuclear explosion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Attempting to avoid such devastation, the Court distinguishes these laws primarily on the ground that almost all of them \"require gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages\n   <em>\n    on a particular occasion\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2561 (emphasis in original). The Court thus admits that, \"[a]s a general matter, we do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as 'substantial risk' to real-world conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Its complaint is that the residual clause \"requires application of the 'serious potential risk' standard to an\n   <em>\n    idealized ordinary case of the crime\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556011\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/192/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

What matters is whether it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute. And it surely is that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   First, this interpretation heeds the pointed distinction that ACCA draws between the \"element[s]\" of an offense and \"conduct.\" Under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), a crime qualifies as a \"violent felony\" if one of its \"element [s]\" involves \"the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" But the residual clause, which appears in the very next subsection, \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), focuses on \"conduct\"-specifically, \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" The use of these two different terms in \u00a7 924(e)indicates that \"conduct\" refers to things done during the commission of an offense that are not part of the elements needed for conviction. Because those extra actions vary from case to case, it is natural to interpret \"conduct\" to mean real-world conduct, not the conduct involved in some Platonic ideal of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Second, as the Court points out, standards like the one in the residual clause almost always appear in laws that call for application by a trier of fact. This strongly suggests that the residual clause calls for the same sort of application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Third, if the Court is correct that the residual clause is nearly incomprehensible when interpreted as applying to an \"idealized ordinary case of the crime,\" then that is telling evidence that this is not what Congress intended. When another interpretation is ready at hand, why should we assume that Congress gave the clause a meaning that is impossible-or even, exceedingly difficult-to apply?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Not only does the \"real-world conduct\" interpretation fit the terms of the residual\n   clause, but the reasons that persuaded the Court to adopt the categorical approach in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   either do not apply or have much less force in residual clause cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Taylor,\n   </em>\n   the question before the Court concerned the meaning of \"burglary,\" one of ACCA's enumerated offenses. The Court gave three reasons for holding that a judge making an ACCA determination should generally look only at the elements of the offense of conviction and not to other things that the defendant did during the commission of the offense. First, the Court thought that ACCA's use of the term \"convictions\" pointed to the categorical approach. The Court wrote: \"Section 924(e)(1)refers to 'a person who ... has three previous convictions' for-not a person who has committed-three previous violent felonies or drug offenses.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    495 U.S., at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the Court relied on legislative history, noting that ACCA had previously contained a generic definition of burglary and that \"the deletion of [this] definition ... may have been an inadvertent casualty of a complex drafting process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 589-590, 601,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, the Court felt that \"the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach [were] daunting.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    ., at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/#p600\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   None of these three grounds dictates that the categorical approach must be used in residual clause cases. The second ground, which concerned the deletion of a generic definition of burglary, obviously has no application to the residual clause. And the first ground has much less force in residual clause cases. In\n   <em>\n    Taylor,\n   </em>\n   the Court reasoned that a defendant has a \"conviction\" for burglary only if burglary is the offense set out in the judgment of conviction. For instance, if a defendant commits a burglary but pleads guilty, under a plea bargain, to possession of burglar's tools, the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   Court thought that it would be unnatural to say that the defendant had a\n   <em>\n    conviction\n   </em>\n   for burglary. Now consider a case in which a gang member is convicted of illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun and the evidence shows that he concealed the weapon under his coat, while searching for a rival gang member who had just killed his brother. In that situation, it is not at all unnatural to say that the defendant had a conviction for a crime that \"involve[d]\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   that present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)(emphasis added). At the very least, it would be a reasonable way to describe the defendant's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   Court's remaining reasons for adopting the categorical approach cannot justify an interpretation that renders the residual clause unconstitutional. While the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   Court feared that a conduct-specific approach would unduly burden the courts, experience has shown that application of the categorical approach has not always been easy. Indeed, the Court's main argument for overturning the statute is that this approach is unmanageable in residual clause cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As for the notion that the categorical approach is more forgiving to defendants, there is a strong argument that the opposite is true, at least with respect to the residual clause. Consider two criminal laws: Injury occurs in 10% of cases involving the violation of statute A, but in 90% of cases involving the violation of statute B. Under the categorical approach, a truly dangerous crime under statute A might not qualify as a violent felony, while a crime with no measurable risk of harm under statute B would count against the defendant. Under a conduct-specific inquiry, on the other hand, a defendant's actual conduct would determine whether ACCA's mandatory penalty applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   It is also significant that the allocation of the burden of proof protects defendants. The prosecution bears the burden of proving that a defendant has convictions that qualify for sentencing under ACCA. If evidentiary deficiencies, poor recordkeeping, or anything else prevents the prosecution from discharging that burden under the conduct-specific approach, a defendant would not receive an ACCA sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Nor would a conduct-specific inquiry raise constitutional problems of its own. It is questionable whether the Sixth Amendment creates a right to a jury trial in this situation. See\n   <em>\n    Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503479\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/224/\">\n    523 U.S. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503479\" index=\"404\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/224/\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503479\" index=\"405\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/224/\">\n    140 L.Ed.2d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). But if it does, the issue could be tried to a jury, and the prosecution could bear the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant's prior crimes involved conduct that presented a serious potential risk of injury to another. I would adopt this alternative interpretation and hold that the residual clause requires an examination of real-world conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Court's only reason for refusing to consider this interpretation is that \"the Government has not asked us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2562. But the Court cites no case in which we have suggested that a saving interpretation may be adopted only if it is proposed by one of the parties. Nor does the Court cite any secondary authorities advocating this rule. Cf. Scalia, Reading Law \u00a7 38 (stating the canon with no such limitation). On the contrary, we have long recognized that it is \"our plain duty to adopt that construction which will save [a] statute from constitutional infirmity,\" where fairly possible.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8289641\" index=\"406\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/213/366/#p407\">\n    213 U.S. 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 407,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8289641\" index=\"407\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/213/366/#p407\">\n    29 S.Ct. 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8289641\" index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/213/366/#p407\">\n    53 L.Ed. 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1909). It would be strange if we could fulfill that \"plain duty\" only when a party asks us to do so. And the Court's refusal to consider a saving interpretation not advocated by the Government is hard to square with the Court's adoption of an argument that petitioner chose not to raise. As noted, Johnson did not ask us to hold that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague, but the Court interjected that issue into the case, requested supplemental briefing on the question, and heard reargument.

Much easier to conceal than long-barreled shotguns used for hunting and other lawful purposes, short-barreled shotguns can be hidden under a coat, tucked into a bag, or stowed under a car seat. And like a handgun, they can be fired with one hand-except to more lethal effect. These weapons thus combine the deadly characteristics of conventional shotguns with the more convenient handling of handguns. Unlike those common firearms, however, they are not typically possessed for lawful purposes. And when a person illegally possesses a sawed-off shotgun during the commission of a crime, the risk of violence is seriously increased. The ordinary case of unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun therefore \"presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" \u00a7 922(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Congress' treatment of sawed-off shotguns confirms this judgment. As the Government's initial brief colorfully recounts, sawed-off shotguns were a weapon of choice for gangsters and bank robbers during the Prohibition Era. See Brief for United States 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, Congress enacted the National Firearms Act of 1934, which required individuals possessing certain especially dangerous weapons-including sawed-off shotguns-to register with the Federal Government and pay a special tax.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"448\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205845\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(2). The Act was passed on the understanding that \"while there is justification for permitting the citizen to keep a pistol or revolver for his own protection without any restriction, there is no reason why anyone except a law officer should have a ... sawed-off shotgun.\" H.R.Rep. No. 1780, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 1 (1934). As amended, the Act imposes strict registration requirements for any individual wishing to possess a covered shotgun, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 5822, 5841(b), and illegal possession of such a weapon is punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years. See \u00a7\u00a7 5861(b)-(d), 5871. It is telling that this penalty exceeds that prescribed by federal law for quintessential violent felonies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It thus seems perfectly clear that Congress has long regarded the illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun as a crime that poses a serious risk of harm to others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The majority of States agree. The Government informs the Court, and Johnson does not dispute, that 28 States have followed Congress' lead by making it a crime to possess an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, and 11 other States and the District of Columbia prohibit private possession of sawed-off shotguns entirely. See Brief for United States 8-9 (collecting statutes). Minnesota, where petitioner was convicted,\n   has adopted a blanket ban, based on its judgment that \"[t]he sawed-off shotgun has no legitimate use in the society whatsoever.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Ellenberger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10746445\" index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/543/673/#p674\">\n    543 N.W.2d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676 (Minn.App.1996)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Possession of a sawed-off shotgun in Minnesota is thus an inherently criminal act. It is fanciful to assume that a person who chooses to break the law and risk the heavy criminal penalty incurred by possessing a notoriously dangerous weapon is unlikely to use that weapon in violent ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   If we were to abandon the categorical approach, the facts of Johnson's offense would satisfy the residual clause as well. According to the record in this case, Johnson possessed his sawed-off shotgun while dealing drugs. When police responded to reports of drug activity in a parking lot, they were told by two people that \"Johnson and another individual had approached them and offered to sell drugs.\" PSR \u00b6 45. The police then searched the vehicle where Johnson was seated as a passenger, and they found a sawed-off shotgun and five bags of marijuana. Johnson admitted that the gun was his.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Understood in this context, Johnson's conduct posed an acute risk of physical injury to another. Drugs and guns are never a safe combination. If one of his drug deals had gone bad or if a rival dealer had arrived on the scene, Johnson's deadly weapon was close at hand. The sawed-off nature of the gun elevated the risk of collateral damage beyond any intended targets. And the location of the crime-a public parking lot-significantly increased the chance that innocent bystanders might be caught up in the carnage. This is not a case of \"mere possession\" as Johnson suggests. Brief for Petitioner i. He was not storing the gun in a safe, nor was it a family heirloom or collector's item. He illegally possessed the weapon in case he needed to use it during another crime. A judge or jury could thus conclude that Johnson's offense qualified as a violent felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   There should be no doubt that Samuel Johnson was an armed career criminal. His record includes a number of serious felonies. And he has been caught with dangerous weapons on numerous occasions. That this case has led to the residual clause's demise is confounding. I only hope that Congress can take the Court at its word that either amending the list of enumerated offenses or abandoning the categorical approach would solve the problem that the Court perceives.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    The Court also says that the residual clause's reference to the enumerated offenses is \"confusing.\"\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2561.

If the Court's concern is that some of the enumerated offenses do not seem especially risky, all that means is that the statute \"sets a low baseline level for risk.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.,\n    </em>\n    at ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2278(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    This rule is simply an application of the broader rule that, except in First Amendment cases, we will hold that a statute is facially unconstitutional only if \"no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Consequently, there is no reason why the no-set-of-circumstances rule should not apply in this context. I assume that the Court does not mean to abrogate the no-set-of-circumstances rule in its entirety, but the Court provides no justification for its refusal to apply that rule here. Perhaps the Court has concluded, for some undisclosed reason, that void-for-vagueness claims are different from all other facial challenges not based on the First Amendment. Or perhaps the Court has simply created an ACCA exception.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    <em>\n     United States v.
