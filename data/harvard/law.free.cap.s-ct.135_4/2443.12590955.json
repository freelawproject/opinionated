Los Angeles Municipal Code \u00a7\u00a7 41.49(2), (3)(a), (4) (2015). The questions presented are whether facial challenges to statutes can be brought under the Fourth Amendment and, if so, whether this provision of the Los Angeles Municipal Code is facially invalid. We hold facial challenges can be brought under the Fourth Amendment. We further hold that the provision of the Los Angeles Municipal Code that requires hotel operators to make their registries available to the police on demand is facially unconstitutional because it penalizes them for declining to turn over their records without affording them any opportunity for precompliance review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) \u00a7 41.49 requires hotel operators to record\n   information about their guests, including: the guest's name and address; the number of people in each guest's party; the make, model, and license plate number of any guest's vehicle parked on hotel property; the guest's date and time of arrival and scheduled departure date; the room number assigned to the guest; the rate charged and amount collected for the room; and the method of payment. \u00a7 41.49(2). Guests without reservations, those who pay for their rooms with cash, and any guests who rent a room for less than 12 hours must present photographic identification at the time of check-in, and hotel operators are required to record the number and expiration date of that document. \u00a7 41.49(4). For those guests who check in using an electronic kiosk, the hotel's records must also contain the guest's credit card information. \u00a7 41.49(2)(b). This information can be maintained in either electronic or paper form, but it must be \"kept on the hotel premises in the guest reception or guest check-in area or in an office adjacent\" thereto for a period of 90 days. \u00a7 41.49(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 41.49(3)(a)-the only provision at issue here-states, in pertinent part, that hotel guest records \"shall be made available to any officer of the Los Angeles Police Department for inspection,\" provided that \"[w]henever possible, the inspection shall be conducted at a time and in a manner that minimizes any interference with the operation of the business.\" A hotel operator's failure to make his or her guest records available for police inspection is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. \u00a7 11.00(m) (general provision applicable to entire LAMC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2003, respondents, a group of motel operators along with a lodging association, sued the city of Los Angeles (City or petitioner) in three consolidated cases challenging the constitutionality of \u00a7 41.49(3)(a). They sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The parties \"agree[d] that the sole issue in the ... action [would be] a facial constitutional challenge\" to \u00a7 41.49(3)(a) under the Fourth Amendment. App. 195. They further stipulated that respondents have been subjected to mandatory record inspections under the ordinance without consent or a warrant.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 194-195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following a bench trial, the District Court entered judgment in favor of the City, holding that respondents' facial challenge failed because they lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the records subject to inspection. A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed on the same grounds.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904693\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/1085/\">\n    686 F.3d 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).

Those defending the statute argued that facial relief was inappropriate because most women voluntarily notify their husbands about a planned abortion and for them the law would not impose an undue burden. The Court rejected this argument, explaining: The \"[l]egislation is measured for consistency with the Constitution by its impact on those whose conduct it affects....

Statutes authorizing warrantless searches also do no work where the subject of a search has consented.

And, we see no reason why this minimal requirement is inapplicable here. While the Court has never attempted to prescribe the exact form an opportunity for precompliance review must take, the City does not even attempt to argue that \u00a7 41.49(3)(a) affords hotel operators any opportunity whatsoever. Section 41.49(3)(a) is, therefore, facially invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A hotel owner who refuses to give an officer access to his or her registry can be arrested on the spot.

Absent an opportunity for precompliance review, the ordinance creates an intolerable\n   risk that searches authorized by it will exceed statutory limits, or be used as a pretext to harass hotel operators and their guests. Even if a hotel has been searched 10 times a day, every day, for three months, without any violation being found, the operator can only refuse to comply with an officer's demand to turn over the registry at his or her own peril.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To be clear, we hold only that a hotel owner must be afforded an\n   <em>\n    opportunity\n   </em>\n   to have a neutral decisionmaker review an officer's demand to search the registry before he or she faces penalties for failing to comply. Actual review need only occur in those rare instances where a hotel operator objects to turning over the registry. Moreover, this opportunity can be provided without imposing onerous burdens on those charged with an administrative scheme's enforcement. For instance, respondents accept that the searches authorized by \u00a7 41.49(3)(a) would be constitutional if they were performed pursuant to an administrative subpoena. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36-37. These subpoenas, which are typically a simple form, can be issued by the individual seeking the record-here, officers in the field-without probable cause that a regulation is being infringed.

Given the limited grounds on which a motion to quash can be granted, such challenges will likely be rare. And, in the even rarer event that an officer reasonably suspects that a hotel operator may tamper with the registry while the motion to quash is pending, he or she can guard the registry until the required hearing can occur, which ought not take long.\n   <em>\n    Riley v.

To classify hotels as pervasively regulated would permit what has always been a narrow exception to swallow the rule.

The historical record here, however, is not as clear as petitioner suggests. The City and Justice SCALIA principally point to evidence that hotels were treated as public accommodations. Brief for Petitioner 34-36;\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2459 - 2460, and n. 1.

But laws obligating inns to provide suitable lodging to all paying guests are not the same as laws subjecting inns to warrantless searches. Petitioner also asserts that \"[f]or a long time, [hotel] owners left their registers open to widespread inspection.\" Brief for Petitioner 51. Setting aside that modern hotel registries contain sensitive information,\n   such as driver's licenses and credit card numbers for which there is no historic analog, the fact that some hotels chose to make registries accessible to the public has little bearing on whether government authorities could have viewed these documents on demand without a hotel's consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Even if we were to find that hotels are pervasively regulated, \u00a7 41.49 would need to satisfy three additional criteria to be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment: (1) \"[T]here must be a 'substantial' government interest that informs the regulatory scheme pursuant to which the inspection is made\"; (2) \"the warrantless inspections must be 'necessary' to further [the] regulatory scheme\"; and (3) \"the statute's inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, [must] provid[e] a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    Burger,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/\">\n    482 U.S., at 702-703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) \u00a7 41.49(2) (2015). The purpose of this recordkeeping requirement is to deter criminal conduct, on the theory that criminals will be unwilling to carry on illicit activities in motel rooms if they must provide identifying information at check-in. Because this deterrent effect will only be accomplished if motels actually do require guests to provide the required information, the ordinance also authorizes police to conduct random spot checks of motels' guest registers to ensure that they are properly maintained. \u00a7 41.49(3). The ordinance limits these spot checks to the four corners of the register, and does not authorize police to enter any nonpublic area of the motel. To the extent possible, police must conduct these spot checks at times that will minimize any disruption to a motel's business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The parties do not dispute the governmental interests at stake. Motels not only provide housing to vulnerable transient populations, they are also a particularly attractive site for criminal activity ranging from drug dealing and prostitution to human trafficking. Offering privacy and anonymity on the cheap, they have been employed as prisons for migrants smuggled across the border and held for ransom, see Sanchez, Immigrant Smugglers Become More Ruthless, Washington Post, June 28, 2004, p. A3; Wagner, Human Smuggling, Arizona Republic, July 23, 2006, p. A1, and rendezvous sites where child sex workers meet their clients on threat of violence from their procurers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court today concludes that Los Angeles's ordinance is \"unreasonable\" inasmuch as it permits police to flip through a guest register to ensure it is being filled out without first providing an opportunity for the motel operator to seek judicial review. Because I believe that such a limited inspection of a guest register is eminently reasonable under the circumstances presented, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   I assume that respondents may bring a facial challenge to the City's ordinance under the Fourth Amendment. Even so, their claim must fail because, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   the law is constitutional in most, if not all, of its applications. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Salerno,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). But because the Court discusses the propriety of a facial challenge at some length, I offer a few thoughts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Article III limits our jurisdiction to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\" Accordingly, \"[f]ederal courts may not 'decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them' or give 'opinion[s] advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Chafin v.

To be sure, the\n   <em>\n    reasoning\n   </em>\n   of a decision may suggest that there is no permissible application of a particular statute,\n   <em>\n    Chicago v. Morales,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248042\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/41/\">\n    527 U.S. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 77,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248042\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/41/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248042\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/527/41/\">\n    144 L.Ed.2d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999)(SCALIA, J., dissenting), and under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis,\n   </em>\n   this reasoning-to the extent that it is necessary to the holding-will be binding in all future cases. But in this sense, the facial invalidation of a statute is\n   a logical consequence of the Court's opinion, not the immediate effect of its judgment. Although we have at times described our holdings as invalidating a law, it is always the application of a law, rather than the law itself, that is before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The upshot is that the effect of a given case is a function not of the plaintiff's characterization of his challenge, but the narrowness or breadth of the ground that the Court relies upon in disposing of it. If a plaintiff elects not to present any case-specific facts in support of a claim that a law is unconstitutional-as is the case here-he will limit the grounds on which a Court may find for him to highly abstract rules that would have broad application in future cases. The decision to do this might be a poor strategic move, especially in a Fourth Amendment case, where the reasonableness of a search is a highly factbound question and general, abstract rules are hard to come by. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Sibron v. New York,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167951\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/40/\">\n    392 U.S. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167951\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/40/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 1889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167951\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/40/\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968). But even had the plaintiffs in this case presented voluminous facts in a self-styled as-applied challenge, nothing would force this Court to rely upon those facts rather than the broader principle that the Court has chosen to rely upon. I see no reason why a plaintiff's self-description of his challenge as facial would provide an independent reason to reject it unless we were to delegate to litigants our duty to say what the law is.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Fourth Amendment provides, in relevant part, that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\" Grammatically, the two clauses of the Amendment seem to be independent-and directed at entirely different actors. The former tells the executive what it must do when it conducts a search, and the latter tells the judiciary what it must do when it issues a search warrant. But in an effort to guide courts in applying the Search-and-Seizure Clause's indeterminate reasonableness standard, and to maintain coherence in our case law, we have used the Warrant Clause as a guidepost for assessing the reasonableness of a search, and have erected a framework of presumptions applicable to broad categories of searches conducted by executive officials.

As Blackstone observed, \"Inns, in particular, being intended for the lodging and receipt of travellers, may be indicted, suppressed, and the inn-keepers fined, if they refuse to entertain a traveller without a very sufficient cause: for thus to frustrate the end of their institution is held to be disorderly behavior.\" 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 168 (1765). Justice Story similarly recognized \"[t]he soundness of the public policy of subjecting particular classes of persons to extraordinary responsibility, in cases where an extraordinary confidence is necessarily reposed in them, and there is an extraordinary temptation to fraud, or danger of plunder.\" J. Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments \u00a7 464, pp. 487-488 (5th ed. 1851). Accordingly, in addition to the obligation to receive any paying guest, \"innkeepers are bound to take, not merely ordinary care, but uncommon care, of the goods, money, and baggage of their guests,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 470, at 495, as travellers \"are obliged to rely almost implicitly on the good faith of innholders, whose education and morals are none of the best, and who might have frequent opportunities of associating with ruffians and pilferers,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 471, at 498.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   These obligations were not merely aspirational. At the time of the founding, searches-indeed, warrantless searches-of inns and similar places of public accommodation were commonplace. For example, although Massachusetts was perhaps\n   the State most protective against government searches, \"the state code of 1788 still allowed tithingmen to search public houses of entertainment on every Sabbath without any sort of warrant.\" W. Cuddihy, Fourth Amendment: Origins and Original Meaning 602-1791, 743 (2009).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   As this evidence demonstrates, the regulatory tradition governing motels is not only longstanding, but comprehensive. And the tradition continues in Los Angeles. The City imposes an occupancy tax upon transients who stay in motels, LAMC \u00a7 21.7.3, and makes the motel owner responsible for collecting it, \u00a7 21.7.5. It authorizes city officials \"to enter [a motel], free of charge, during business hours\" in order to \"inspect and examine\" them to determine whether these tax provisions have been complied with. \u00a7\u00a7 21.7.9, 21.15. It requires all motels to obtain a \"Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate,\" which must be displayed on the premises. \u00a7 21.7.6. State law requires motels to \"post in a conspicuous place ... a statement of rate or range of rates by the day for lodging,\" and forbids any charges in excess of those posted rates. Cal. Civ.Code Ann. \u00a7 1863 (West 2010). Hotels must change bed linens between guests, Cal.Code Regs., tit. 25, \u00a7 40 (2015), and they must offer guests the option not to have towels and linens laundered daily, LAMC \u00a7 121.08. \"Multiuse drinking utensils\" may be placed in guest rooms only if they are \"thoroughly washed and sanitized after each use\" and \"placed in protective bags.\" Cal.Code Regs., tit. 17, \u00a7 30852. And state authorities, like their municipal counterparts, \"may at reasonable times enter and inspect any hotels, motels, or other public places\" to ensure compliance. \u00a7 30858.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The regulatory regime at issue here is thus substantially\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   comprehensive than the regulations governing junkyards in\n   <em>\n    Burger,\n   </em>\n   where licensing, inventory-recording, and permit-posting requirements were found sufficient to qualify the industry as closely regulated.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/\">\n    482 U.S., at 704-705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's suggestion that these regulations are not sufficiently targeted to motels, and are \"akin to ... minimum wage and maximum hour rules,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2455, is simply false. The regulations we have described above reach into the \"minutest detail[s]\" of motel operations,\n   <em>\n    Barlow's, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 314, 98 S.Ct. 1816and those who enter that business today (like those who have entered it over the centuries) do so with an expectation that they will be subjected to especially vigilant governmental oversight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, this ordinance is not an outlier. The City has pointed us to more than 100 similar register-inspection laws in cities and counties across the country, Brief for Petitioner 36, and n. 3, and that is far from exhaustive. In all, municipalities in at least 41 States have laws similar to Los Angeles's, Brief for National League of Cities et al. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   16-17, and at least 8 States have their own laws authorizing register inspections, Brief for California et al. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This copious evidence is surely enough to establish that \"[w]hen a [motel operator] chooses to engage in this pervasively regulated business ... he does so with the knowledge that his business records ... will be subject to effective inspection.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Biswell,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170455\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/311/#p311\">\n    406 U.S. 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 316,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170455\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/311/#p311\">\n    92 S.Ct. 1593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170455\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/406/311/#p311\">\n    32 L.Ed.2d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). And\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   is the relevant constitutional test-not whether this regulatory superstructure is \"the same as laws subjecting inns to warrantless searches,\" or whether, as an historical matter, government authorities not only required these documents to be kept but permitted them to be viewed on demand without a motel's consent.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2455 - 2456.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court's observation that \"[o]ver the past 45 years, the Court has identified only four industries\" as closely regulated,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2454, is neither here nor there. Since we first concluded in\n   <em>\n    Colonnade Catering\n   </em>\n   that warrantless searches of closely regulated businesses are reasonable, we have only identified\n   <em>\n    one\n   </em>\n   industry as\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   closely regulated, see\n   <em>\n    Barlow's,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490680\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/307/#p312\">\n    436 U.S., at 313-314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490680\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/307/#p312\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's statistic thus tells us more about how this Court exercises its discretionary review than it does about the number of industries that qualify as closely regulated. At the same time, lower courts, which do not have the luxury of picking the cases they hear, have identified many more businesses as closely regulated under the test we have announced: pharmacies,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Like automobile junkyards and catering companies that serve alcohol, many of these businesses are far from \"intrinsically dangerous,\" cf.\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2455, n. 5. This should come as no surprise. The reason closely regulated industries may be searched without a warrant has nothing to do with the risk of harm they pose; rather, it has to do with the expectations of those who enter such a line of work. See\n   <em>\n    Barlow's, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 313,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490680\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/307/#p312\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The City's ordinance easily satisfies the remaining\n   <em>\n    Burger\n   </em>\n   requirements: It furthers a substantial governmental interest, it is necessary to achieving that interest, and it provides an adequate substitute for a search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Neither respondents nor the Court question the substantial interest of the City in deterring criminal activity. See Brief for Respondents 34-41;\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2455. The private pain and public costs imposed by drug dealing, prostitution, and human trafficking are beyond contention, and motels provide an obvious haven for those who trade in human misery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Warrantless inspections are also necessary to advance this interest. Although the Court acknowledges that law enforcement can enter a motel room without a warrant when exigent circumstances exist, see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2454, n. 4, the whole reason criminals use motel rooms in the first place is that they offer privacy and secrecy, so that police will never come to discover these exigencies. The recordkeeping requirement, which all parties admit is permissible, therefore operates by\n   <em>\n    deterring\n   </em>\n   crime. Criminals, who depend on the anonymity that motels offer, will balk when confronted with a motel's demand that they produce identification. And a motel's evasion of the recordkeeping requirement fosters crime. In San Diego, for example, motel owners were indicted for collaborating with members of the Crips street gang\n   in the prostitution of underage girls; the motel owners \"set aside rooms apart from the rest of their legitimate customers where girls and women were housed, charged the gang members/pimps a higher rate for the rooms where 'dates' or 'tricks' took place, and warned the gang members of inquiries by law enforcement.\" Office of the Attorney General, Cal. Dept. of Justice, The State of Human Trafficking in California 25 (2012). The warrantless inspection requirement provides a necessary incentive for motels to maintain their registers thoroughly and accurately: They never know when law enforcement might drop by to inspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Respondents and the Court acknowledge that\n   <em>\n    inspections\n   </em>\n   are necessary to achieve the purposes of the recordkeeping regime, but insist that\n   <em>\n    warrantless\n   </em>\n   inspections are not. They have to acknowledge, however, that the motel operators who conspire with drug dealers and procurers may demand precompliance judicial review simply as a pretext to buy time for making fraudulent entries in their guest registers. The Court therefore must resort to arguing that warrantless inspections are not \"necessary\" because other alternatives exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court suggests that police could obtain an administrative subpoena to search a guest register and, if a motel moves to quash, the police could \"guar[d] the registry pending a hearing\" on the motion.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2456. This proposal is equal parts 1984 and Alice in Wonderland. It protects motels from government inspection of their registers by authorizing government agents to seize the registers\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (if \"guarding\" entails forbidding the register to be moved) or to upset guests by a prolonged police presence at the motel. The Court also notes that police can obtain an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   warrant before conducting a register inspection.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2456. Presumably such warrants could issue without probable cause of wrongdoing by a particular motel, see\n   <em>\n    Camara,\n   </em>\n   387 U.S., at 535-536,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338823\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/523/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; otherwise, this would be no alternative at all. Even so, under this regime police would have to obtain an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   warrant before\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   inspection. That is because law enforcement would have no way of knowing ahead of time which motels would refuse consent to a search upon request; and if they wait to obtain a warrant until consent is refused, motels will have the opportunity to falsify their guest registers while the police jump through the procedural hoops required to obtain a warrant. It is quite plausible that the costs of this always-get-a-warrant \"alternative\" would be prohibitive for a police force in one of America's largest cities, juggling numerous law-enforcement priorities, and confronting more than 2,000 motels within its jurisdiction.

To be sure, the fact that obtaining a warrant might be costly will not by itself render a warrantless search reasonable under the Fourth Amendment; but it can render a warrantless search\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   in the context of an administrative-search regime governing closely regulated businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   But all that discussion is in any case irrelevant. The administrative search need only be reasonable. It is not the burden of Los Angeles to show that there\n   are no less restrictive means of achieving the City's purposes. Sequestration or\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   warrants were\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   alternatives to the warrantless search regimes approved by this Court in\n   <em>\n    Colonnade Catering,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Biswell,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dewey,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burger\n   </em>\n   . By importing a least-restrictive-means test into\n   <em>\n    Burger\n   </em>\n   's Fourth Amendment framework, today's opinion implicitly overrules that entire line of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, the City's ordinance provides an adequate substitute for a warrant. Warrants \"advise the owner of the scope and objects of the search, beyond which limits the inspector is not expected to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    Barlow's,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490680\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/307/#p312\">\n    436 U.S., at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490680\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/307/#p312\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, they aim to protect against \"devolv[ing] almost unbridled discretion upon executive and administrative officers, particularly those in the field, as to when to search and whom to search.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490680\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/307/#p312\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Los Angeles's ordinance provides that the guest register must be kept in the guest reception or guest check-in area, or in an adjacent office, and that it \"be made available to any officer of the Los Angeles Police Department for inspection. Whenever possible, the inspection shall be conducted at a time and in a manner that minimizes any interference with the operation of the business.\" LAMC \u00a7 41.49(3). Nothing in the ordinance authorizes law enforcement to enter a nonpublic part of the motel.

Veh. &amp; Traf. Law \u00a7 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -a5 (McKinney 1986)). The Los Angeles ordinance-which limits warrantless police searches to the pages of a guest register in a public part of a motel-circumscribes police discretion in much more exacting terms than the laws we have approved in our earlier cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court claims that Los Angeles's ordinance confers too much discretion because it does not adequately limit the\n   <em>\n    frequency\n   </em>\n   of searches. Without a trace of irony, the Court tries to distinguish Los Angeles's law from the laws upheld in\n   <em>\n    Dewey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burger\n   </em>\n   by pointing out that the latter regimes required inspections at least four times a year and on a \" 'regular basis,' \" respectively.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2456. But the warrantless police searches of a business \"10 times a day, every day, for three months\" that the Court envisions under Los Angeles's regime,\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2453, are entirely consistent with the regimes in\n   <em>\n    Dewey\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Burger\n   </em>\n   ; 10 times a day, every day, is \"at least four times a year,\" and on a (much too) \" 'regular basis.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2456.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   That is not to say that the Court's hypothetical searches are necessarily constitutional. It is only to say that Los Angeles's ordinance presents no greater risk that such a hypothetical will materialize than the laws we have already upheld. As in our earlier cases, we should leave it to lower courts to consider on a case-by-case basis whether warrantless searches have been conducted in an unreasonably intrusive or harassing manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court reaches its wrongheaded conclusion not simply by misapplying our precedent, but by mistaking our precedent for the Fourth Amendment itself. Rather than bother with the text of that Amendment, the Court relies exclusively on our administrative-search cases,\n   <em>\n    Camara,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See v. Seattle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    387 U.S. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338972\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/387/541/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), and\n   <em>\n    Barlow's\n   </em>\n   . But the Constitution predates 1967, and it remains the supreme law of the land today. Although the categorical framework our jurisprudence has erected in this area may provide us guidance, it is guidance to answer the constitutional question at issue: whether the challenged search is\n   <em>\n    reasonable\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   An administrative, warrantless-search ordinance that narrowly limits the scope of searches to a single business record, that does not authorize entry upon premises not open to the public, and that is supported by the need to prevent fabrication of guest registers, is, to say the least, far afield from the laws at issue in the cases the Court relies upon. The Court concludes that such minor intrusions, permissible when the police are trying to tamp down the market in stolen auto parts, are \"unreasonable\" when police are instead attempting to stamp out the market in child sex slaves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Because I believe that the limited warrantless searches authorized by Los Angeles's ordinance are reasonable under the circumstances, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Justice ALITO, with whom Justice THOMASjoins, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   After today, the city of Los Angeles can never, under any circumstances, enforce its 116-year-old requirement that hotels make their registers available to police officers. That is because the Court holds that \u00a7 41.49(3)(a) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (2015) is\n   <em>\n    facially\n   </em>\n   unconstitutional. Before entering a judgment with such serious safety and federalism implications, the Court must conclude that every application of this law is unconstitutional-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that \" 'no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2450 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Salerno,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    481 U.S. 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 745,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p745\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105,1148012\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/697/\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987)). I have doubts about the Court's approach to administrative searches and closely regulated industries.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2451 - 2456. But even if the Court were 100% correct, it still should uphold \u00a7 41.49(3)(a) because many other applications of this law are constitutional. Here are five examples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Example One. The police have probable cause to believe that a register contains evidence of a crime. They go to a judge and get a search warrant. The hotel operator, however, refuses to surrender the register, but instead stashes it away. Officers could tear the hotel apart looking for it. Or they could simply order the operator to produce it. The Fourth Amendment does not create a right to defy a warrant. Hence \u00a7 41.49(3)(a) could be constitutionally applied in this scenario. Indeed, the Court concedes that it is proper to apply a California obstruction of justice law in such a case. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2451 - 2452, n. 1; Brief for Respondents 49. How could applying\n   a city law with a similar effect be different? No one thinks that overlapping laws are unconstitutional. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yates v. United States,\n   </em>\n   574 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12586973\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1074/#p1096\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1096,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12586973\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1074/#p1096\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015)(KAGAN, J. dissenting) (\"Overlap-even significant overlap-abounds in criminal law\") (collecting citations). And a specific law gives more notice than a general law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In any event, the Los Angeles ordinance is arguably broader in at least one important respect than the California obstruction of justice statute on which the Court relies.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2451 - 2452, n. 1. The state law applies when a person \"willfully resists, delays, or obstructs any public officer ... in the discharge or attempt to discharge any duty of his or her office.\" Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 148(a)(1)(West 2014). In the example set out above, suppose that the hotel operator, instead of hiding the register, simply refused to tell the police where it is located. The Court cites no California case holding that such a refusal would be unlawful, and the city of Los Angeles submits that under California law, \"[o]bstruction statutes prohibit a hotel owner from\n   <em>\n    obstructing\n   </em>\n   a search, but they do not require affirmative assistance.\" Reply Brief 5. The Los Angeles ordinance, by contrast, unequivocally requires a hotel operator to make the register available on request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Example Two. A murderer has kidnapped a woman with the intent to rape and kill her and there is reason to believe he is holed up in a certain motel. The Fourth Amendment's reasonableness standard accounts for exigent circumstances. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brigham City v. Stuart,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275413\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/398/#p403\">\n    547 U.S. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275413\" index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/398/#p403\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275413\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/398/#p403\">\n    164 L.Ed.2d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). When the police arrive, the motel operator folds her arms and says the register is locked in a safe. Invoking \u00a7 41.49(3)(a), the police order the operator to turn over the register. She refuses. The Fourth Amendment does not protect her from arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Example Three. A neighborhood of \"pay by the hour\" motels is a notorious gathering spot for child-sex traffickers. Police officers drive through the neighborhood late one night and see unusual amounts of activity at a particular motel. The officers stop and ask the motel operator for the names of those who paid with cash to rent rooms for less than three hours. The operator refuses to provide the information. Requesting to see the register-and arresting the operator for failing to provide it-would be reasonable under the \"totality of the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Ohio v. Robinette,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594631\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/33/#p39\">\n    519 U.S. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594631\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/33/#p39\">\n    117 S.Ct. 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594631\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/33/#p39\">\n    136 L.Ed.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1996). In fact, the Court has upheld a similar reporting duty against a Fourth Amendment challenge where the scope of information required was also targeted and the public's interest in crime prevention was no less serious. See\n   <em>\n    California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84421\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/21/#p39\">\n    416 U.S. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39, n. 15, 66-67,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84421\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/21/#p39\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"84421\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/416/21/#p39\">\n    39 L.Ed.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974)(having \"no difficulty\" upholding a requirement that banks must provide reports about transactions involving more than $10,000, including the name, address, occupation, and social security number of the customer involved, along with a summary of the transaction, the amount of money at issue, and the type of identification presented).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Example Four. A motel is operated by a dishonest employee. He has been charging more for rooms than he records, all the while pocketing the difference. The owner finds out and eagerly consents to a police inspection of the register. But when officers arrive and ask to see the register, the operator hides it. The Fourth Amendment does not allow the operator's refusal to defeat the owner's consent. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mancusi v. DeForte,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171394\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/364/#p369\">\n    392 U.S. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369-370,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171394\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/364/#p369\">\n    88 S.Ct. 2120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171394\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/364/#p369\">\n    20 L.Ed.2d 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Accordingly, it would not violate the Fourth Amendment to arrest the operator for failing to make the register \"available to any officer of the Los Angeles Police Department for inspection.\" \u00a7 41.49(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Example Five. A \"mom and pop\" motel always keeps its old-fashioned guest register open on the front desk. Anyone who wants to can walk up and leaf through it. (Such motels are not as common as they used to be, but Los Angeles is a big place.) The motel has no reasonable expectation of privacy in the register, and no one doubts that police officers-like anyone else-can enter into the lobby. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

But when an officer starts looking at the register, as others do, the motel operator at the desk snatches it away and will not give it back. Arresting that person would not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   These are just five examples. There are many more. The Court rushes past examples like these by suggesting that \u00a7 41.49(3)(a) does no \"work\" in such scenarios.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2451. That is not true. Under threat of legal sanction, this law orders hotel operators to do things they do not want to do. To be sure, there may be circumstances in which \u00a7 41.49(3)(a)'s command conflicts with the Fourth Amendment, and in those circumstances the Fourth Amendment is supreme. See U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2. But no different from any other local law, the remedy for such circumstances should be an as-applied injunction\n   <em>\n    limited to the conflict with the Fourth Amendment\n   </em>\n   . Such an injunction would protect a hotel from being \"searched 10 times a day, every day, for three months, without any violation being found.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2453. But unlike facial invalidation, an as-applied injunction does not produce collateral damage. Section 41.49(3)(a) should be enforceable in those many cases in which the Fourth Amendment is not violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   There are serious arguments that the Fourth Amendment's application to warrantless searches and seizures is inherently inconsistent with facial challenges. See\n   <em>\n    Sibron v.

But assuming such facial challenges ever make sense conceptually, this particular one fails under basic principles of facial invalidation. The Court's contrary holding is befuddling. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Relatedly, the United States claims that a statute authorizing warrantless searches may still have independent force if it imposes a penalty for failing to cooperate in a search conducted under a warrant or in an exigency. See Brief for United States as\n    <em>\n     Amicus Curiae\n    </em>\n    19. This argument gets things backwards. An otherwise facially unconstitutional statute cannot be saved from invalidation based solely on the existence of a penalty provision that applies when searches are not actually authorized by the statute. This argument is especially unconvincing where, as here, an independent obstruction of justice statute imposes a penalty for \"willfully, resist[ing], delay[ing], or obstruct[ing] any public officer ... in the discharge or attempt to discharge any duty of his or her office of employment.\" Cal.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 148(a)(1)(West 2014).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Respondents contend that \u00a7 41.49's principal purpose instead is to facilitate criminal investigation. Brief for Respondents 44-47. Because we find that the searches authorized by \u00a7 41.49 are unconstitutional even if they serve the City's asserted purpose, we decline to address this argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Justice SCALIA professes to be baffled at the idea that we could suggest that in certain circumstances, police officers may seize something that they cannot immediately search.\n    <em>\n     Post,\n    </em>\n    at 2461 - 2462 (dissenting opinion). But that is what this Court's cases have explicitly endorsed, including\n    <em>\n     Riley\n    </em>\n    just last Term.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    In suggesting that our holding today will somehow impede law enforcement from achieving its important aims, Justice SCALIA relies on instances where hotels were used as \"prisons for migrants smuggled across the border and held for ransom\" or as \"rendezvous sites where child sex workers meet their clients on threat of violence from their procurers.\" See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2457. It is hard to imagine circumstances more exigent than these.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Justice SCALIA's effort to depict hotels as raising a comparable degree of risk rings hollow. See\n    <em>\n     post,\n    </em>\n    at 2457, 2463 - 2464. Hotels-like practically all commercial premises or services-can be put to use for nefarious ends. But unlike the industries that the Court has found to be closely regulated, hotels are not intrinsically dangerous.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    As Beale helpfully confirms, \"[f]rom the earliest times the fundamental characteristic of an inn has been its public nature. It is a public house, a house of public entertainment, or, as it is legally phrased, a common inn.\" J.
