Her husband, Kanishka Berashk, is an Afghan citizen and former civil servant in the Taliban regime who resides in that country. When the Government declined to issue an immigrant visa to Berashk, Din sued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The state action of which Din complains is the denial of\n   <em>\n    Berashk's\n   </em>\n   visa application. Naturally, one would expect him-not Din-to bring this suit. But because Berashk is an unadmitted and nonresident alien, he has no right of entry into the United States, and no cause of action to press in furtherance of his claim for admission. See\n   <em>\n    Kleindienst v. Mandel,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p762\">\n    408 U.S. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 762,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p762\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p762\">\n    33 L.Ed.2d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). So, Din attempts to bring suit on his behalf, alleging that the Government's denial of her\n   <em>\n    husband's\n   </em>\n   visa application violated\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   constitutional rights. See App. 36-37, Complaint \u00b6 56. In particular, she claims that the Government denied her due process of law when, without adequate explanation of the reason for the visa denial, it deprived her of her constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse. There is no such constitutional right. What Justice BREYER's dissent strangely describes as a \"deprivation of her freedom to live together with her spouse in America,\"\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2142, is, in any world other than the artificial world of ever-expanding constitutional rights, nothing more than a deprivation of her spouse's freedom to immigrate into America.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons given in this opinion and in the opinion concurring in the judgment, we vacate and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20Stat.%20163\">\n    66 Stat. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   an alien may not enter and permanently reside in the United States without a visa. \u00a7 1181(a). The INA creates a special visa-application process for aliens sponsored by \"immediate relatives\" in the United States. \u00a7\u00a7 1151(b), 1153(a). Under this process, the citizen-relative first files a petition on behalf of the alien living abroad, asking to have the alien classified as an immediate relative. See \u00a7\u00a7 1153(f), 1154(a)(1). If and when a petition is approved, the alien may apply for a visa by submitting the required documents and appearing at a United States Embassy or consulate for an interview with a consular officer. See \u00a7\u00a7 1201(a)(1), 1202. Before issuing a visa, the consular officer must ensure the alien is not inadmissible under any provision of the INA. \u00a7 1361.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   One ground for inadmissibility, \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B), covers \"[t]errorist activities.\" In addition to the violent and destructive acts the term immediately brings to mind, the INA defines \"terrorist activity\" to include providing material support to a terrorist organization and serving as a\n   terrorist organization's representative. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(i), (iii)-(vi).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Fauzia Din came to the United States as a refugee in 2000, and became a naturalized citizen in 2007. She filed a petition to have Kanishka Berashk, whom she married in 2006, classified as her immediate relative. The petition was granted, and Berashk filed a visa application. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan, interviewed Berashk and denied his application. A consular officer informed Berashk that he was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)but provided no further explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Din then brought suit in Federal District Court seeking a writ of mandamus directing the United States to properly adjudicate Berashk's visa application; a declaratory judgment that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)-(3), which exempts the Government from providing notice to an alien found inadmissible under the terrorism bar, is unconstitutional as applied; and a declaratory judgment that the denial violated the Administrative Procedure Act. App. 36-39, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 55-68. The District Court granted the Government's motion to dismiss, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. The Ninth Circuit concluded that Din \"has a protected liberty interest in marriage that entitled [her] to review of the denial of [her] spouse's visa,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4048814\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/856/#p860\">\n    718 F.3d 856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (2013), and that the Government's citation of \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)did not provide Din with the \"limited judicial review\" to which she was entitled under the Due Process Clause,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 868.

The first question that we must ask, then, is whether the denial of Berashk's visa application deprived Din of any of these interests. Only if we answer in the affirmative must we proceed to consider whether the Government's explanation afforded sufficient process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Due Process Clause has its origin in Magna Carta. As originally drafted, the Great Charter provided that \"[n]o freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, or liberties, or free customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any otherwise destroyed; nor will we not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his peers, or\n   <em>\n    by the law of the land\n   </em>\n   .\" Magna Carta, ch. 29, in 1 E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 45 (1797) (emphasis added). The Court has recognized that at the time of the Fifth Amendment's ratification, the words \"due process of law\" were understood \"to convey the same meaning as the words 'by the law of the land' \" in Magna Carta.\n   <em>\n    Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488987\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/59/272/#p276\">\n    18 How. 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 276,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488987\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/59/272/#p276\">\n    15 L.Ed. 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1856). Although the terminology associated with the guarantee of due process changed dramatically between 1215 and 1791, the general scope of the underlying rights protected stayed roughly constant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Edward Coke, whose Institutes \"were read in the American Colonies by virtually every student of law,\"\n   <em>\n    Klopfer v. North Carolina,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p225\">\n    386 U.S. 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 225,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p225\">\n    87 S.Ct. 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170322\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/213/#p225\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), thoroughly described the scope of the interests that could be deprived only pursuant to \"the law of the land.\" Magna Carta, he wrote, ensured that, without due process, \"no man [may] be taken or imprisoned\"; \"disseised of his lands, or tenements, or dispossessed of his goods, or chattels\"; \"put from his livelihood without answer\"; \"barred to have the benefit of the law\"; denied \"the franchises, and priviledges, which the subjects have of the gift of the king\"; \"exiled\"; or \"forejudged of life, or limbe, disherited, or put to torture, or death.\" 1 Coke,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 46-48. Blackstone's description of the rights protected by Magna Carta is similar, although he discusses them in terms much closer to the \"life, liberty, or property\" terminology used in the Fifth Amendment. He described first an interest in \"personal security,\" \"consist[ing] in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health, and his reputation.\" 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 125 (1769). Second, the \"personal liberty of individuals\" \"consist[ed] in the power of locomotion, of changing situation, or removing one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct; without imprisonment or restraint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 130. And finally, a person's right to property included \"the free use, enjoyment, and disposal of all his acquisitions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 134.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Din, of course, could not conceivably claim that the denial of Berashk's visa application deprived her-or for that matter even Berashk-of life or property; and under the above described historical understanding, a claim that it deprived her of liberty is equally absurd. The Government has not \"taken or imprisoned\" Din, nor has it \"confine[d]\" her, either by \"keeping [her] against h[er] will in a private house, putting h[er] in the stocks, arresting or forcibly detaining h[er] in the street.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 132. Indeed, not even Berashk has suffered a deprivation of liberty so understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Despite this historical evidence, this Court has seen fit on several occasions to expand the meaning of \"liberty\" under the Due Process Clause to include certain implied \"fundamental rights.\" (The reasoning presumably goes like this: If you have a right to do something, you are free to do it, and deprivation of freedom is a deprivation of \"liberty\"-never mind the original meaning of that word in the Due Process Clause.) These implied rights have been given\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   protection than \"life, liberty, or property\" properly understood. While one may be dispossessed of property, thrown in jail, or even executed so long as proper procedures are followed, the enjoyment of implied constitutional rights cannot be limited at all, except by provisions that are \"narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Reno v. Flores,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/#p301\">\n    507 U.S. 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 301-302,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/#p301\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6228898\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/292/#p301\">\n    123 L.Ed.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Din does not explicitly argue that the Government has violated this absolute prohibition of the\n   <em>\n    substantive\n   </em>\n   component of the Due Process Clause, likely because it is obvious that a law barring aliens engaged in terrorist activities from entering this country\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest. She nevertheless insists that, because enforcement of the law affects her enjoyment of an implied fundamental liberty, the Government must first provide her a full battery of procedural-due-process protections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I think it worth explaining why,\n   <em>\n    even if\n   </em>\n   one accepts the textually unsupportable doctrine of implied fundamental rights, Din's arguments would fail. Because \"extending\n   constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest ... place[s] the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action,\"\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Although immigration was effectively unregulated prior to 1875, as soon as Congress began legislating in this area it enacted a complicated web of regulations that erected serious impediments to a person's ability to bring a spouse into the United States. See Abrams, What Makes the Family Special?\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%207\">\n    80 U. Chi. L.

Thus, a woman in Din's position not only lacked a liberty interest that might be affected by the Government's disposition of her husband's visa application, she lost her\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   rights as a citizen upon marriage. When Congress began to impose quotas on immigration by country of origin less than 15 years later, with the Immigration Act of 1921, it omitted fiances and husbands from the family relations eligible for preferred status in the allocation of quota spots. \u00a7 2(d),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20Stat.%206\">\n    42 Stat. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

C. Bredbenner, A Nationality of Her Own 5\n   (1998). Modern equal-protection doctrine casts substantial doubt on the permissibility of such asymmetric treatment of women citizens in the immigration context, and modern moral judgment rejects the premises of such a legal order. Nevertheless, this all-too-recent practice repudiates any contention that Din's asserted liberty interest is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\"\n   <em>\n    Glucksberg, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 720,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916123\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/702/#p720\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotations marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Indeed, the law showed little more solicitude for the marital relationship when it was a male resident or citizen seeking admission for his fiancee or wife. The Immigration Act of 1921 granted nonquota status only to unmarried, minor children of citizens, \u00a7 2(a), while granting fiancees and wives preferred status\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the allocation of quota spots, \u00a7 2(d). In other words, a citizen could move his spouse forward in the line, but once all the quota spots were filled for the year, the spouse was barred without exception. This was not just a theoretical possibility: As one commentator has observed, \"[f]or many immigrants, the family categories did little to help, because the quotas were so small that the number of family members seeking slots far outstripped the number available.\" Abrams,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although Congress has tended to show \"a continuing and kindly concern ... for the unity and the happiness of the immigrant family,\" E.

Even where Congress has provided special privileges to promote family immigration, it has also \"written in careful checks and qualifications.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   This Court has consistently recognized that these various distinctions are \"policy questions entrusted exclusively to the political branches of our Government, and we have no judicial authority to substitute our political judgment for that of the Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Fiallo v.

But perhaps recognizing that our established methodology for identifying fundamental rights cuts against his conclusion, see Part II-B,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   he argues that the term \"liberty\" in the Due Process Clause includes implied rights that, although not so fundamental as to deserve substantive-due-process protection, are important enough to deserve procedural-due-process protection.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 2142.

This might, indeed, deprive Din of something \"important,\"\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2142, but if that is the criterion for Justice BREYER's new pairing of substantive and procedural due process, we are in for quite a ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because Fauzia Din was not deprived of \"life, liberty, or property\" when the Government denied Kanishka Berashk admission to the United States, there is no process due to her under the Constitution.

Once this standard is met, \"courts will neither look behind the exercise of that discretion, nor test it by balancing its justification against\" the constitutional interests of citizens the visa denial might implicate.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   This reasoning has particular force in the area of national security, for which Congress has provided specific statutory directions pertaining to visa applications by noncitizens who seek entry to this country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Like the professors who sought an audience with Dr. Mandel, Din claims her constitutional rights were burdened by the denial of a visa to a noncitizen, namely her husband. And as in\n   <em>\n    Mandel,\n   </em>\n   the Government provided a reason for the visa denial: It concluded Din's husband was inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)'s terrorism bar. Even assuming Din's rights were burdened directly by the visa denial, the remaining question is whether the reasons given by the Government satisfy\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   's \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" standard. I conclude that they do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, the consular officer's determination that Din's husband was ineligible for a visa was controlled by specific statutory factors. The provisions of \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)establish specific criteria for determining terrorism-related inadmissibility. The consular officer's citation of that provision suffices to show that the denial rested on a determination that Din's husband did not satisfy the statute's requirements.

Din claims due process requires she be provided with the facts underlying this determination, arguing\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   required a similar factual basis. It is true the Attorney General there disclosed the facts motivating his decision to deny Dr. Mandel a waiver, and that the Court cited those facts as demonstrating \"the Attorney General validly exercised the plenary power that Congress delegated to the Executive.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p762\">\n    408 U.S., at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p762\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But unlike the waiver\n   provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Mandel,\n   </em>\n   which granted the Attorney General nearly unbridled discretion, \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)specifies discrete factual predicates the consular officer must find to exist before denying a visa. Din, moreover, admits in her Complaint that Berashk worked for the Taliban government, App. 27-28, which, even if itself insufficient to support exclusion, provides at least a facial connection to terrorist activity. Absent an affirmative showing of bad faith on the part of the consular officer who denied Berashk a visa-which Din has not plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity-\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   instructs us not to \"look behind\" the Government's exclusion of Berashk for additional factual details beyond what its express reliance on \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)encompassed. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p762\">\n    408 U.S., at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782950\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/408/753/#p762\">\n    92 S.Ct. 2576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Government, furthermore, was not required, as Din claims, to point to a more specific provision within \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B). To be sure, the statutory provision the consular officer cited covers a broad range of conduct. And Din perhaps more easily could mount a challenge to her husband's visa denial if she knew the specific subsection on which the consular officer relied. Congress understood this problem, however. The statute generally requires the Government to provide an alien denied a visa with the \"specific provision or provisions of law under which the alien is inadmissible,\" \u00a7 1182(b)(1); but this notice requirement does not apply when, as in this case, a visa application is denied due to terrorism or national security concerns. \u00a7 1182(b)(3). Notably, the Government is not prohibited from offering more details when it sees fit, but the statute expressly refrains from requiring it to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Congress evaluated the benefits and burdens of notice in this sensitive area and assigned discretion to the Executive to decide when more detailed disclosure is appropriate. This considered judgment gives additional support to the independent conclusion that the notice given was constitutionally adequate, particularly in light of the national security concerns the terrorism bar addresses.

Here \"balancing\" would not change the result. The \"private interest\" is important, the risk of an \"erroneous deprivation\" is significant, and the Government's interest in not providing a reason is normally small, at least administratively speaking. Indeed, Congress requires the State Department to provide a reason for a visa denial in most contexts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Accordingly, in the absence of some highly unusual circumstance (not shown to be present here, see\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   at 2146), the Constitution requires the Government to provide an adequate reason why it refused to grant Ms. Din's husband a visa.

It is a complex provision with 10 different subsections, many of which cross-reference other provisions of law. See Appendix,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . Some parts cover criminal conduct that is particularly serious, such as hijacking aircraft and assassination. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii)(I), (IV). Other parts cover activity that, depending on the factual circumstances, cannot easily be labeled \"terrorist.\" One set of cross-referenced subsections, for example, brings within the section's visa prohibition any individual who has \"transfer[red] ... [any] material financial benefit\" to \"a group of two or more individuals, whether organized or not, which ... has a subgroup which engages\" in \"afford[ing] material support ... for ... any individual who ... plans\" \"[t]he use of any ... weapon ... with intent ... to cause substantial damage to property.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI), (vi)(III), (iv)(VI)(bb), (iii)(V). At the same time, some subsections provide the visa applicant with a defense; others do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)(iv)(VI)(dd)(permitting applicant to show \"by clear and convincing evidence that the actor did not know, and should not reasonably have known, that the organization was a terrorist organization\"). Taken together the subsections, directly or through cross-reference, cover a vast waterfront of human activity potentially benefitting, sometimes in major ways, sometimes hardly at all, sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly, sometimes a few people, sometimes many, sometimes those with strong links, sometimes those with hardly a link, to a loosely or strongly connected group of individuals, which, through many different kinds of actions, might fall within the broad statutorily defined term \"terrorist.\" See,\n   <em>\n    e.g., Daneshvar v.

Cf.,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p221\">\n    545 U.S., at 225-226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p221\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prison administrators must inform prisoners of \"factual basis\" for extreme solitary confinement). Perhaps the Department denied the visa because Ms. Din's husband at one point was a payroll clerk for the Afghan Government when that government was controlled by the Taliban. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2140 - 2141 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). But there is no way to know if that is so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The generality of the statutory provision cited and the lack of factual support mean that here, the reason given is analogous to telling a criminal defendant only that he is accused of \"breaking the law\"; telling a property owner only that he cannot build because environmental rules forbid it; or telling a driver only that police pulled him over because he violated traffic laws. As such, the reason given cannot serve its procedural purpose. It does not permit Ms. Din to assess the correctness of the State Department's conclusion; it does not permit her to determine what kinds of facts she might provide in response; and it does not permit her to learn whether, or what kind of, defenses might be available. In short, any \"reason\" that Ms. Din received is not constitutionally adequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Seemingly aware that he cannot deny these basic legal principles, Justice KENNEDY rests his conclusions upon two considerations that, in his view, provide sufficient grounds for an exception.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2140 - 2141. Most importantly, he says that ordinary rules of due process must give way here to national security concerns. But just what are those concerns? And how do they apply here? Ms. Din's counsel stated at oral argument that there were no such concerns in this case. Tr. of Oral Arg. 35. And the Solicitor General did not deny that statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In other cases, such concerns may exist. But, when faced with the need to provide public information without compromising security interests, the Government has found ways to do so, for example, by excising sensitive portions of documents requested by the press, members of the public, or other public officials. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Moreover, agencies and courts have found ways to conduct proceedings in private, through internal review or\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   proceedings, and thereby protect sensitive information. See\n   <em>\n    Webster v.

Would these (or other) methods prove adequate in other cases where a citizen's freedom to live in America\n   with her spouse is at issue? Are they even necessary here? The Government has not explained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I do not deny the importance of national security, the need to keep certain related information private, or the need to respect the determinations of the other branches of Government in such matters. But protecting ordinary citizens from arbitrary government action is fundamental. Thus, the presence of security considerations does not suspend the Constitution.\n   <em>\n    Hamdi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p533\">\n    542 U.S., at 527-537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864651\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/507/#p533\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion).

How exactly would it harm important security interests to give Ms. Din a better explanation? Is there no way to give Ms. Din such an explanation while also maintaining appropriate secrecy? I believe we need answers to these questions before we can accept as constitutional a major departure from the procedural requirements that the Due Process Clause ordinarily demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Justice KENNEDY also looks for support to the fact that Congress specifically exempted the section here at issue, \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B), from the statutory provision requiring the State Department to provide a reason for visa denials. \u00a7 1182(b)(3). An exception from a statutory demand for a reason, however, is not a command to do the opposite; rather, at most, it leaves open the question whether other law requires a reason. Here that other law is the Constitution, not a statute. In my view, the Due Process Clause requires the Department to provide an adequate reason.
