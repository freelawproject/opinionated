Stat. \u00a7 1979,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , against several jail officers, alleging that they used excessive force against him, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The officers concede that they intended to use the force that they used. But the parties disagree about whether the force used was excessive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The question before us is whether, to prove an excessive force claim, a pretrial detainee must show that the officers were\n   <em>\n    subjectively\n   </em>\n   aware that their use of force was unreasonable, or only that the officers' use of that force was\n   <em>\n    objectively\n   </em>\n   unreasonable. We conclude that the latter standard is the correct one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Some but not all of the facts are undisputed: Michael Kingsley, the petitioner, was arrested on a drug charge and detained in a Wisconsin county jail prior to trial. On the evening of May 20, 2010, an officer performing a cell check noticed a piece of paper covering the light fixture above Kingsley's bed. The officer told Kingsley to remove it; Kingsley refused; subsequently other officers told Kingsley to remove the paper; and each time Kingsley refused. The next morning, the jail administrator, Lieutenant Robert Conroy, ordered Kingsley to remove the paper. Kingsley once again refused. Conroy then told Kingsley that officers would remove the paper and that he would be moved to a receiving cell in the interim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Shortly thereafter, four officers, including respondents Sergeant Stan Hendrickson and Deputy Sheriff Fritz Degner, approached the cell and ordered Kingsley to stand, back up to the door, and keep his hands behind him. When Kingsley refused to comply, the officers handcuffed him, forcibly removed him from the cell, carried him to a receiving cell, and placed him face down on a bunk with his hands handcuffed behind his back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties' views about what happened next differ. The officers testified that Kingsley resisted their efforts to remove his handcuffs. Kingsley testified that he did not resist. All agree that Sergeant Hendrickson placed his knee in Kingsley's back and Kingsley told him in impolite language to get off. Kingsley testified that Hendrickson and Degner then slammed his head into the concrete bunk-an allegation the officers deny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties agree, however, about what happened next: Hendrickson directed Degner to stun Kingsley with a Taser; Degner applied a Taser to Kingsley's back for approximately five seconds; the officers then left the handcuffed Kingsley alone in the receiving cell; and officers returned to the cell 15 minutes later and removed Kingsley's handcuffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on these and related events, Kingsley filed a \u00a7 1983complaint in Federal District Court claiming (among other\n   things) that Hendrickson and Degner used excessive force against him, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The officers moved for summary judgment, which the District Court denied, stating that \"a reasonable jury could conclude that [the officers] acted with malice and intended to harm [Kingsley] when they used force against him.\"\n   <em>\n    Kingsley v. Josvai,\n   </em>\n   No. 10-cv-832-bbc (WD Wis., Nov. 16, 2011), App to Pet. for Cert. 66a-67a. Kingsley's excessive force claim accordingly proceeded to trial. At the conclusion of the trial, the District Court instructed the jury as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Excessive force means force\n   <em>\n    applied recklessly\n   </em>\n   that is unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances of the time. Thus, to succeed on his claim of excessive use of force, plaintiff must prove each of the following factors by a preponderance of the evidence:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"(1) Defendants used force on plaintiff;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"(2) Defendants' use of force was unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances at the time;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \"(3) Defendants knew that using force presented a risk of harm to plaintiff, but they recklessly disregarded plaintiff's safety by failing to take reasonable measures to minimize the risk of harm to plaintiff; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"(4) Defendants' conduct caused some harm to plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"In deciding whether one or more defendants used 'unreasonable' force against plaintiff, you must consider whether it was unreasonable from the perspective of a reasonable officer facing the same circumstances that defendants faced. You must make this decision based on what defendants knew at the time of the incident, not based on what you know now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Also, in deciding whether one or more defendants used unreasonable force and acted with\n   <em>\n    reckless disregard of plaintiff's rights\n   </em>\n   , you may consider factors such as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"\u2022 The need to use force;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \"\u2022 The relationship between the need to use force and the amount of force used;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \"\u2022 The extent of plaintiff's injury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"\u2022 Whether defendants reasonably believed there was a threat to the safety of staff or prisoners; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"\u2022 Any efforts made by defendants to limit the amount of force used.\" App. 277-278 (emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The jury found in the officers' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On appeal, Kingsley argued that the correct standard for judging a pretrial detainee's excessive force claim is objective unreasonableness. And, the jury instruction, he said, did not hew to that standard. A panel of the Court of Appeals disagreed, with one judge dissenting. The majority held that the law required a \"subjective inquiry\" into the officer's state of mind. There must be \" 'an actual intent to violate [the plaintiff's] rights or reckless disregard for his rights.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120237\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/443/#p451\">\n    744 F.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451 (C.A.7 2014)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

In a case like this one, there are, in a sense, two separate state-of-mind questions. The first concerns the defendant's state of mind with respect to his physical acts-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   his state of mind with respect to the bringing about of certain physical consequences in the world. The second question concerns the defendant's state of mind with respect to whether his use of force was \"excessive.\" Here, as to the first question, there is no dispute. As to the second, whether to interpret the defendant's physical acts in the world as involving force that was \"excessive,\" there is a dispute. We conclude with respect to that question that the relevant standard is objective not subjective. Thus, the defendant's state of mind is not a matter that a plaintiff is required to prove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Consider the series of physical events that take place in the world-a series of events that might consist, for example, of the swing of a fist that hits a face, a push that leads to a fall, or the shot of a Taser that leads to the stunning of its recipient. No one here denies, and we must assume, that, as to the series of events that have taken place in the world, the defendant must possess a purposeful, a knowing, or possibly a reckless state of mind. That is because, as we have stated, \"liability for\n   <em>\n    negligently\n   </em>\n   inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.\"\n   <em>\n    County of Sacramento v.

Thus, if an officer's Taser goes off by accident or if an officer unintentionally trips and falls on a detainee, causing him harm, the pretrial detainee cannot prevail on an excessive force claim. But if the use of force is deliberate-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   purposeful or knowing-the pretrial detainee's claim may proceed. In the context of a police pursuit of a suspect the Court noted, though without so holding, that recklessness in some cases might suffice as a standard for imposing liability. See\n   <em>\n    Lewis, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 849,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/#p849\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whether that standard might suffice for liability in the case of an alleged mistreatment of a pretrial detainee need not be decided here; for the officers do not dispute that they acted purposefully or knowingly with respect to the force they used against Kingsley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We now consider the question before us here-the defendant's state of mind with respect to the proper\n   <em>\n    interpretation\n   </em>\n   of the force (a series of events in the world) that the defendant deliberately (not accidentally or negligently) used. In deciding whether the force deliberately used is, constitutionally speaking, \"excessive,\" should courts use an objective standard only, or instead a subjective standard that takes into account a defendant's state of mind? It is with respect to\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   question that we hold that courts must use an\n   objective standard. In short, we agree with the dissenting appeals court judge, the Seventh Circuit's jury instruction committee, and Kingsley, that a pretrial detainee must show only that the force purposely or knowingly used against him was objectively unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A court (judge or jury) cannot apply this standard mechanically. See\n   <em>\n    Lewis, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 850,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504410\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/833/#p849\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   Court went on to explain that, in the absence of an expressed intent to punish, a pretrial detainee can nevertheless prevail by showing that the actions are not \"rationally related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental purpose\" or that the actions \"appear excessive in relation to that purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 561,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1780223\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/520/#p540\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   Court applied this latter objective standard to evaluate a variety of prison conditions, including a prison's practice of double-bunking.

See Part II-A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . That jury instruction defined \"excessive force\" as \"force applied recklessly that is unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances of the time.\" App. 277. It required Kingsley to show that the officers \"recklessly disregarded [Kingsley's] safety.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 278.

Reply Brief 20-22. Respondents argue that irrespective of our holding, any error in the instruction was harmless. Brief for Respondents 57-58. And the Solicitor General suggests that, because the instructions defined \"recklessness\" with reference to objective factors, those instructions effectively embody our objective standard and did not confuse the jury.

Together, these features suggested the jury should weigh respondents' subjective reasons for using force and subjective views about the excessiveness of the force. As we have just held, that was error. But because the question whether that error was harmless may depend in part on the detailed specifics of this case, we leave that question for the Court of Appeals to resolve in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Justice SCALIA, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice THOMAS join, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Constitution contains no freestanding prohibition of excessive force. There are, however, four constitutional provisions that we have said forbid the use of excessive force in certain circumstances. The Fourth Amendment prohibits it when it makes a search or seizure \"unreasonable.\" The Eighth Amendment prohibits it when it constitutes \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.

Objective reasonableness of the force used is nothing more than a heuristic for identifying this intent.

Unquestionably. A State would plainly violate the Due Process Clause if it extended a detainee's confinement because it believed him mentally ill (not as \"punishment\"), without giving him the constitutionally guaranteed processes that must precede the deprivation of liberty. But Kingsley does not claim deprivation of liberty in that normal sense of that word-the right to walk about free. He claims that the Due Process Clause confers, on pretrial detainees, a substantive \"liberty\" interest that consists of freedom from objectively unreasonable force. Kingsley seeks relief, in other words, under\n   the doctrine of \"substantive due process,\" through which we have occasionally recognized \"liberty\" interests other than freedom from incarceration or detention, that \"cannot be limited at all, except by provisions that are 'narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.' \"\n   <em>\n    Kerry v.
