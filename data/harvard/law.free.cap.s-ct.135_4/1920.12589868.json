One form of patent injury occurs if unauthorized persons or entities copy, use, or otherwise infringe upon the patented invention. Another form of injury to the patent holder or his licensees can occur when the actor induces others to infringe the patent. In the instant case, both forms of injury-direct infringement and wrongful inducement of others to commit infringement-were alleged. After two trials, the defendant was found liable for both types of injury. The dispute now before the Court concerns the inducement aspect of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The patent holder who commenced this action is the petitioner here, Commil USA, LLC. The technical details of Commil's patent are not at issue. So it suffices to say, with much oversimplification, that the patent is for a method of implementing short-range wireless networks. Suppose an extensive business headquarters or a resort or a college campus wants a single, central wireless system (sometimes called a Wi-Fi network). In order to cover the large space, the system needs multiple base stations so a user can move around the area and still stay connected. Commil's patent relates to a method of providing faster and more reliable communications between devices and base stations. The particular claims of Commil's patent are discussed in the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058631\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/1361/#p1364\">\n    720 F.3d 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1364-1365, 1372 (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Commil brought this action against Cisco Systems, Inc., which makes and sells wireless networking equipment. In 2007, Commil sued Cisco in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Cisco is the respondent here. Commil alleged that Cisco had infringed Commil's patent by making and using networking equipment. In addition Commil alleged that Cisco had induced others to infringe the patent by selling the infringing equipment for them to use, in contravention of Commil's exclusive patent rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the first trial, the jury concluded that Commil's patent was valid and that Cisco had directly infringed. The jury awarded Commil $3.7 million in damages. As to induced infringement, the jury found Cisco not liable. Commil filed a motion for a new trial on induced infringement and damages, which the District Court granted because of certain inappropriate comments Cisco's counsel had made during the first trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A month before the second trial Cisco went to the United States Patent and Trademark Office and asked it to reexamine the validity of Commil's patent. The Office granted the request; but, undoubtedly to Cisco's disappointment, it confirmed the validity of Commil's patent. App. 159, 162.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Back in the District Court, the second trial proceeded, limited to the issues of inducement and damages on that issue and direct infringement. As a defense to the claim of inducement, Cisco argued it had a good-faith belief that Commil's patent was invalid. It sought to introduce evidence to support that assertion. The District Court, however, ruled that Cisco's proffered evidence of its good-faith belief in the patent's invalidity was inadmissible. While the District Court's order does not provide the reason for the ruling, it seems the court excluded this evidence on the assumption that belief in invalidity is not a defense to a plaintiff's claim that the defendant induced others to infringe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the close of trial, and over Cisco's objection, the District Court instructed the\n   jury that it could find inducement if \"Cisco actually intended to cause the acts that constitute ... direct infringement and that Cisco knew or should have known that its actions would induce actual infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 21. The jury returned a verdict for Commil on induced infringement and awarded $63.7 million in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After the verdict, but before judgment, this Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S. A.,\n   </em>\n   563 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2060/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2060/\">\n    179 L.Ed.2d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). That case, as will be discussed in more detail, held that, in an action for induced infringement, it is necessary for the plaintiff to show that the alleged inducer knew of the patent in question and knew the induced acts were infringing.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2060/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2068-2069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Relying on that case, Cisco again urged that the jury instruction was incorrect because it did not state knowledge as the governing standard for inducement liability. The District Court denied Cisco's motion and entered judgment in Commil's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Cisco appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The court concluded it was error for the District Court to have instructed the jury that Cisco could be liable for induced infringement if it \" 'knew or should have known' \" that its customers infringed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058631\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/1361/#p1364\">\n    720 F.3d, at 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The panel held that \"induced infringement 'requires knowledge that the induced acts constitute patent infringement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech, supra,\n   </em>\n   at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2060/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). By stating that Cisco could be found liable if it \" 'knew or should have known that its actions would induce actual infringement,' \" the Court of Appeals explained, the District Court had allowed \"the jury to find [Cisco] liable based on mere negligence where knowledge is required.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058631\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/1361/#p1364\">\n    720 F.3d, at 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That ruling, which requires a new trial on the inducement claim with a corrected instruction on knowledge, is not in question here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   What is at issue is the second holding of the Court of Appeals, addressing Cisco's contention that the trial court committed further error in excluding Cisco's evidence that it had a good-faith belief that Commil's patent was invalid. Beginning with the observation that it is \"axiomatic that one cannot infringe an invalid patent,\" the Court of Appeals reasoned that \"evidence of an accused inducer's good-faith belief of invalidity may negate the requisite intent for induced infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1368. The court saw \"no principled distinction between a good-faith belief of invalidity and a good-faith belief of non-infringement for the purpose of whether a defendant possessed the specific intent to induce infringement of a patent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058631\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/1361/#p1364\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge Newman dissented on that point. In Judge Newman's view a defendant's good-faith belief in a patent's invalidity is not a defense to induced infringement. She reasoned that \"whether there is infringement in fact does not depend on the belief of the accused infringer that it might succeed in invalidating the patent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1374(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Both parties filed petitions for rehearing en banc, which were denied.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732097\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/699/#p700\">\n    737 F.3d 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 700 (C.A.Fed.2013). Five judges, however, would have granted rehearing en banc to consider the question whether a good-faith belief in invalidity is a defense to induced infringement.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 700(Reyna, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court granted certiorari to decide that question. 574 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593998,12593999,12594000,12594001,12594002,12594003\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/752/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593995,12593996,12593997,12594000,12594001,12594002\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/190/474/\">\n    190 L.Ed.2d 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Although the precise issue to be addressed concerns a claim of improper inducement to infringe, the discussion to follow refers as well to direct infringement and contributory infringement, so it is instructive at the outset to set forth the statutory provisions pertaining to these three forms of liability. These three relevant provisions are found in \u00a7 271 of the Patent Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Subsection (a) governs direct infringement and provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \"Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority makes, uses, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under this form of liability, a defendant's mental state is irrelevant.

In Commil and the Government's view, not only is knowledge or belief in the patent's validity irrelevant, they further argue the party charged with inducing infringement need not know that the acts it induced would infringe.

Commil and the Government (which supports Commil in this case) argue that\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech\n   </em>\n   should be read as holding that only knowledge of the patent is required for induced infringement. That, as will be explained, would contravene\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech\n   </em>\n   's explicit holding that liability for induced infringement can only attach if the defendant knew of the patent and knew as well that \"the induced acts constitute patent infringement.\" 563 U.S., at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2060/\">\n    131 S.Ct., at 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff, SEB, had invented and patented a deep fryer. A few years later, Sunbeam asked Pentalpha to supply deep fryers for Sunbeam to sell. To make the deep fryer, Pentalpha bought\n   an SEB fryer and copied all but the cosmetic features. Pentalpha then sold the fryers to Sunbeam, which in turn sold them to customers. SEB sued Pentalpha for induced infringement, arguing Pentalpha had induced Sunbeam and others to sell the infringing fryers in violation of SEB's patent rights. In defense, Pentalpha argued it did not know the deep fryer it copied was patented and therefore could not be liable for inducing anyone to infringe SEB's patent.

But in the Court's\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech\n   </em>\n   decision, its description of the factual circumstances suggests otherwise.

Qualifying or limiting its holding, as the Government and Commil seek to do, would lead to the conclusion, both in inducement and contributory infringement cases, that a person, or entity, could be liable even though he did not know the acts were infringing.

That presumption takes away any need for a plaintiff to prove his patent is valid to bring a claim. But if belief in invalidity were a defense to induced infringement, the force of that presumption would be lessened to a drastic degree, for a defendant could prevail if he proved he reasonably believed the patent was invalid.

But the questions courts must address when interpreting and implementing the statutory framework require a determination of the procedures and sequences that the parties must follow to prove the act of wrongful inducement and any related issues of patent validity. \"Validity and infringement are distinct issues, bearing different burdens, different presumptions, and different evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058631\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/1361/#p1364\">\n    720 F.3d, at 1374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Newman, J.). To be sure, if at the end of the day, an act that would have been an infringement or an inducement to infringe pertains to a patent that is shown to be invalid, there is no patent to be infringed. But the allocation of the burden to persuade on these questions, and the timing for the presentations of the relevant arguments, are concerns of central relevance to the orderly administration of the patent system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Invalidity is an affirmative defense that \"can preclude enforcement of a patent against otherwise infringing conduct.\" 6A Chisum on Patents \u00a7 19.01, p. 19-5 (2015). An accused infringer can, of course, attempt to prove that the patent in suit is invalid; if the patent is indeed invalid, and shown to be so under proper procedures, there is no liability. See\n   <em>\n    i4i, supra,\n   </em>\n   at ---- - ----, 131 S.Ct., at 2247-2248. That is because invalidity is not a defense to infringement, it is a defense to liability. And because of that fact, a belief as to invalidity cannot negate the scienter required for induced infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   There are also practical reasons not to create a defense based on a good-faith belief in invalidity. First and foremost, accused inducers who believe a patent is invalid have various proper ways to obtain a ruling to that effect. They can file a declaratory judgment action asking a federal court to declare the patent invalid. See\n   <em>\n    MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p137\">\n    549 U.S. 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p137\">\n    127 S.Ct. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553591\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/118/#p137\">\n    166 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). They can seek\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and receive a decision as to validity within 12 to 18 months. See \u00a7 316. Or they can, as Cisco did here, seek\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   reexamination of the patent by the Patent and Trademark Office. \u00a7 302. And, of course, any accused infringer who believes the patent in suit is invalid may raise the affirmative defense of invalidity. \u00a7 282(b)(2). If the defendant is successful, he will be immune from liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Creating a defense of belief in invalidity, furthermore, would have negative consequences. It can render litigation more burdensome for everyone involved. Every accused inducer would have an incentive to put forth a theory of invalidity and could\n   likely come up with myriad arguments. See Sloan, Think it is Invalid? A New Defense to Negate Intent for Induced Infringement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20Fed.%20Cir.%20B.J.%20613\">\n    23 Fed. Cir.

In addition the need to respond to the defense will increase discovery costs and multiply the issues the jury must resolve. Indeed, the jury would be put to the difficult task of separating the defendant's belief regarding validity from the actual issue of validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As a final note, \"[o]ur law is ... no stranger to the possibility that an act may be 'intentional' for purposes of civil liability, even if the actor lacked actual knowledge that her conduct violated the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Jerman v.

Recognizing that infringement requires validity is entirely consistent with the \"long-accepted truth ... that infringement and invalidity are separate matters under patent law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2060/\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5960868,12459541\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2060/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court next insists that permitting the defense at issue would undermine the statutory presumption of validity.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1928 - 1929. It would do no such thing. By reason of the statutory presumption of validity, \u00a7 282(a), patents can be held invalid only by \"clear and convincing evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership,\n   </em>\n   564 U.S. ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5933721,12450135\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2238/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2242,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5933721,12450135\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2238/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). This\n   presumption is not weakened by treating a good-faith belief in invalidity as a defense to induced infringement. An alleged inducer who succeeds in this defense does not thereby call a patent's validity into question. He merely avoids liability for a third party's infringement of a\n   <em>\n    valid\n   </em>\n   patent, in no way undermining that patent's presumed validity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Next, the Court says that \"invalidity is not a defense to infringement, it is a defense to liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1929. That is an assertion, not an argument. Again, to infringe a patent is to invade the patentee's right of exclusivity. An invalid patent confers no such right. How is it possible to interfere with rights that do not exist? The Court has no answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   That brings me to the Court's weakest argument: that there are \"practical reasons not to\n   <em>\n    create\n   </em>\n   a defense based on a good-faith belief in invalidity.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1929 (emphasis added); see also\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Creating\n   </em>\n   a defense of belief in invalidity, furthermore, would have negative consequences\" (emphasis added)). Ours is not a common-law court.\n   <em>\n    Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10687\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/64/#p78\">\n    304 U.S. 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10687\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/64/#p78\">\n    58 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10687\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/304/64/#p78\">\n    82 L.Ed. 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1938). We do not, or at least should not,\n   <em>\n    create\n   </em>\n   defenses to statutory liability-and that is not what this dissent purports to do. Our task is to interpret the Patent Act, and to decide whether\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   makes a good-faith belief in a patent's invalidity a defense to induced infringement. Since, as we said in\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech, supra,\n   </em>\n   the Act makes knowledge of infringement a requirement for induced-infringement liability; and since there can be no infringement (and hence no knowledge of infringement) of an invalid patent; good-faith belief in invalidity is a defense. I may add, however, that if the desirability of the rule we adopt were a proper consideration, it is by no means clear that the Court's holding, which increases the\n   <em>\n    in terrorem\n   </em>\n   power of patent trolls, is preferable. The Court seemingly acknowledges that consequence in Part III of its opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
