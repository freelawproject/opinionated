I discuss each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 29, 1992, William Leroy Barnes accompanied two other men, Robert Lewis Blakney and Frank Junior Chambers, to the home of B.P. Tutterow and his wife, Ruby, with the intent to rob them.\n   <em>\n    State v. Barnes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"53983\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/345/184/#p200\">\n    345 N.C. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=481%20S.E.2d%2044\">\n    481 S.E.2d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 51 (1997). The three targeted the Tutterows because Chambers knew that B.P., a deputy sheriff who worked at a jail where he had been held, often carried a significant amount of cash in his wallet. In the course of the robbery, Barnes and Chambers shot and killed the Tutterows. They then went to the apartment of some friends, where Barnes and Chambers showed off the guns they had stolen from the Tutterows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The three men were tried together on two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon, and one count of first-degree burglary. The jury found them guilty on all counts. During the penalty phase of the trial, Chambers' attorney warned the jurors as follows that they would answer for their vote before God:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   \"All of us will stand in judgment one day.... [D]oes a true believer want to explain to God, yes, I did violate one of your commandments. Yes, I know they are not the ten suggestions. They are the ten commandments. I know it says, Thou shalt not kill, but I did it because the laws of man said I could. You can never justify violating a law of God by saying the laws of man allowed it. If there is a higher God and a higher law, I would say not.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 172a.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The jury recommended that Barnes and Chambers be sentenced to death for each murder and that Blakney be sentenced to two mandatory terms of life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the jury made these recommendations, defense counsel moved to question the jury based on allegations that a juror had called a minister to seek guidance about capital punishment. Defense counsel acknowledged that there was no evidence that the juror had discussed the facts of the case with the minister. The trial court denied his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On direct appeal, the Supreme Court of North Carolina concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying that motion. It explained that \"[t]he trial court was faced with the mere unsubstantiated allegation that a juror called a minister to ask a question about the death penalty\" and that there was \"no evidence that the content of any such possible discussion prejudiced defendants or that the juror gained access to improper or prejudicial matters and considered them with regard to th[e] case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 228,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=481%20S.E.2d%2044\">\n    481 S.E.2d, at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After unsuccessfully seeking state collateral review, Barnes pursued federal relief, arguing that the Supreme Court of North Carolina had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law as determined by this Court when it denied relief on his juror misconduct claim, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1).

Over a dissent, the Court of Appeals concluded that the North\n   Carolina court had unreasonably applied this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Remmer v.

Although\n   <em>\n    Remmer\n   </em>\n   did not provide further guidance as to what constituted \"the matter pending before the jury,\" the panel concluded, based on the Court of Appeals' own precedents, that the death penalty generally was \"the matter pending before the jury.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4069843\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/751/229/\">\n    751 F.3d, at 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court remanded the case for the District Court to consider whether Barnes could show actual prejudice from the error under\n   <em>\n    Brecht v.

Hurst,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789879\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/360/181/#p184\">\n    360 N.C. 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184-186,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634818\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/624/309/#p314\">\n    624 S.E.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314-315 (2006). As Hurst later recounted, \" '[he] knew [he] was going to kill [Branch]' \" as soon as they finished scheduling the sale.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 185,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634818\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/624/309/#p314\">\n    624 S.E.2d, at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (brackets in original). The two men met in a field, where Hurst asked if he could test-fire the gun. As Branch walked into the field to set up some cans and bottles for that purpose, Hurst opened fire. Hurst shot Branch three times. His first shot struck Branch in the ribs or stomach, prompting him to yell, \" '[N]o, no, don't shoot.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   His second shot struck Branch in the side, causing him to fall. Hurst then walked over to Branch and shot him in the head, before taking his keys and driving off in Branch's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A jury convicted Hurst of first-degree murder and recommended that he be sentenced to death. The trial court adopted the recommendation. In a later petition for state collateral review, Hurst asserted that his constitutional rights were violated when a juror asked her father where she could look in the Bible for passages about the death penalty. He attached an affidavit from juror Christina Foster, in which she stated that she had \"often had lunch with [her] father who worked near the courthouse\" during the trial and, before deliberations, had asked him \"where [she] could look in the Bible for help and guidance in making [her] decision for between life and death.\" App. in No. 13-6 (CA4), p. 441. Her father gave her \"the section in the Bible where [she] could find 'an eye for an eye.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634818\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/624/309/#p314\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The state court rejected Hurst's argument. It first noted that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit had \"determined that the Bible does not constitute an improper external influence in a capital case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 481-482. It then found that Hurst had \"presented no evidence\" that Foster's father either \"knew what case juror Foster was sitting on\" or \"deliberately attempted to influence her vote by directing her to a specific passage in the Bible.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 482. The court therefore denied Hurst relief, and the Supreme Court of North Carolina summarily denied a petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Hurst then filed an application for federal relief, arguing, among other things, that the North Carolina court had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law as determined by this Court in rejecting his juror-influence claim. See \u00a7 2254(d)(1). As with Barnes' application, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed.\n   <em>\n    Hurst\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.

Although two judges on the panel expressed their misgivings in a concurrence,\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   (opinion of Shedd, J., joined by Niemeyer, J.), the panel concluded that the earlier \"holding in\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   dictate[d] the same result\" in Hurst's case,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 398.

In recognition of the serious disruption to state interests that occurs when a federal court collaterally reviews a state-court judgment, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 imposes strict limits on that review. Among those limits are the prohibitions found in \u00a7 2254(d), which dictates that a federal court may not grant relief \"with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim-\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We have repeatedly explained that the \u00a7 2254(d)\"standard is difficult to meet.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrington v.

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals turned to its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   precedents to determine whether the moral and spiritual implications of the death penalty as a general matter constituted \"the matter pending before the jury.\" It cited its earlier decisions in\n   <em>\n    Stockton v.

The third-party communication in Barnes' case involved nothing of the sort. Instead, it concerned a juror who asked her minister a question about the death penalty generally and did not discuss the facts of the case. No precedent of this Court holds that such a communication concerns \"the matter pending before the jury.\" Accordingly, the state court reasonably concluded that the juror's question about the death penalty generally-not the case specifically-did not concern the matter pending before the jury.
