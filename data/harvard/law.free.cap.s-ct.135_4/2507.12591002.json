This dispute comes to the Court on a disparate-impact theory of liability. In contrast to a disparate-treatment case, where a \"plaintiff must establish that the defendant had a discriminatory intent or motive,\" a plaintiff bringing a disparate-impact claim challenges practices that have a \"disproportionately adverse effect on minorities\" and are otherwise unjustified by a legitimate rationale.\n   <em>\n    Ricci v.

The question presented for the Court's determination is whether disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act (or FHA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Stat.%2081\">\n    82 Stat. 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before turning to the question presented, it is necessary to discuss a different federal statute that gives rise to this dispute. The Federal Government provides low-income housing tax credits that are distributed to developers through designated state agencies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2042\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress has directed States to develop plans identifying selection criteria for distributing the credits. \u00a7 42(m)(1). Those plans must include certain criteria, such as public housing waiting lists, \u00a7 42(m)(1)(C), as well as certain preferences, including that low-income housing units \"contribut[e] to a concerted community revitalization plan\" and be built in census tracts populated predominantly by low-income residents. \u00a7\u00a7 42(m)(1)(B)(ii)(III), 42(d)(5)(ii)(I). Federal law thus favors the distribution of these tax credits for the development of housing units in low-income areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the State of Texas these federal credits are distributed by the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (Department). Under Texas law, a developer's application for the tax credits is scored under a point system that gives priority to statutory criteria, such as the financial feasibility of the development project and the income level of tenants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Tex. Govt.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 2306.6710(a)-(b)(West 2008). The Texas Attorney General has interpreted state law to permit the consideration of additional criteria, such as whether the housing units will be built in a neighborhood with good schools. Those criteria cannot be awarded more points than statutorily mandated criteria. Tex. Op. Atty. Gen. No. GA-0208, pp. 2-6 (2004),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201434796\">\n    2004 WL 1434796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *4-*6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc. (ICP), is a Texas-based nonprofit corporation that assists low-income families in obtaining affordable housing. In 2008, the ICP brought this suit against the Department and its officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. As relevant here, it brought a disparate-impact claim under \u00a7\u00a7 804(a) and 805(a) of the FHA. The ICP alleged the Department has caused continued segregated housing patterns by its disproportionate allocation of the tax credits, granting too many credits for housing in predominantly black inner-city areas and too few in predominantly white suburban neighborhoods. The ICP contended that the Department must modify its selection criteria in order to encourage the construction of low-income housing in suburban communities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The District Court concluded that the ICP had established a prima facie case of disparate impact. It relied on two pieces of statistical evidence. First, it found \"from 1999-2008, [the Department] approved tax credits for 49.7% of proposed non-elderly units in 0% to 9.9% Caucasian areas, but only approved 37.4% of proposed non-elderly units in 90% to 100% Caucasian areas.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261756\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/749/486/#p499\">\n    749 F.Supp.2d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (N.D.Tex.2010)(footnote omitted). Second, it found \"92.29% of [low-income housing tax credit] units in the city of Dallas were located in census tracts with less than 50% Caucasian residents.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261756\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/749/486/#p499\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The District Court then placed the burden on the Department to rebut the ICP's prima facie showing of disparate impact.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5748018\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/860/312/#p322\">\n    860 F.Supp.2d 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 322-323 (2012). After assuming the Department's proffered interests were legitimate,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 326, the District Court held that a defendant-here the Department-must prove \"that there are no other less discriminatory alternatives to advancing their proffered interests,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   Because, in its view, the Department \"failed to meet [its] burden of proving that there are no less discriminatory alternatives,\" the District Court ruled for the ICP.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 331.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court's remedial order required the addition of new selection criteria for the tax credits. For instance, it awarded points for units built in neighborhoods with good schools and disqualified sites that are located adjacent to or near hazardous conditions, such as high crime areas or landfills. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203201401\">\n    2012 WL 3201401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Aug. 7, 2012). The remedial order contained no explicit racial targets or quotas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While the Department's appeal was pending, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a regulation interpreting the FHA to encompass disparate-impact liability. See Implementation of the Fair Housing Act's Discriminatory Effects Standard, 78 Fed.Reg. 11460 (2013). The regulation also established a burden-shifting framework for adjudicating disparate-impact claims. Under the regulation, a plaintiff first must make a prima facie showing of disparate impact. That is, the plaintiff \"has the burden of proving that a challenged practice caused or predictably will cause a discriminatory effect.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.500\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 100.500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (2014). If a statistical discrepancy is caused by factors other than the defendant's policy, a plaintiff cannot establish a prima facie case, and there is no liability. After a plaintiff does establish a prima facie showing\n   of disparate impact, the burden shifts to the defendant to \"prov[e] that the challenged practice is necessary to achieve one or more substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests.\" \u00a7 100.500(c)(2). HUD has clarified that this step of the analysis \"is analogous to the Title VII requirement that an employer's interest in an employment practice with a disparate impact be job related.\" 78 Fed.Reg. 11470. Once a defendant has satisfied its burden at step two, a plaintiff may \"prevail upon proving that the substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests supporting the challenged practice could be served by another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.\" \u00a7 100.500(c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held, consistent with its precedent, that disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180154\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/275/#p280\">\n    747 F.3d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 280 (2014). On the merits, however, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. Relying on HUD's regulation, the Court of Appeals held that it was improper for the District Court to have placed the burden on the Department to prove there were no less discriminatory alternatives for allocating low-income housing tax credits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180154\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/275/#p280\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180154\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/275/#p280\">\n    ., at 282-283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a concurring opinion, Judge Jones stated that on remand the District Court should reexamine whether the ICP had made out a prima facie case of disparate impact. She suggested the District Court incorrectly relied on bare statistical evidence without engaging in any analysis about causation. She further observed that, if the federal law providing for the distribution of low-income housing tax credits ties the Department's hands to such an extent that it lacks a meaningful choice, then there is no disparate-impact liability. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 283-284(specially concurring opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Department filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on the question whether disparate-impact claims are cognizable under the FHA.

Some segregated housing patterns can be traced to conditions that arose in the mid-20th century. Rapid urbanization, concomitant with the rise of suburban developments accessible by car, led many white families to leave the inner cities. This often left minority families concentrated in the center of the Nation's cities. During this time, various practices were followed, sometimes with governmental support, to encourage and maintain the separation of the races: Racially restrictive covenants prevented the conveyance of property to minorities, see\n   <em>\n    Shelley v. Kraemer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157293\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/334/1/\">\n    334 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6157293\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/334/1/\">\n    68 S.Ct. 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20L.%20Ed.%201161\">\n    92 L.Ed. 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1948); steering by real-estate agents led potential buyers to consider homes in racially homogenous areas; and discriminatory lending practices, often referred to as redlining, precluded minority families from purchasing homes in affluent areas.

By the 1960's, these policies, practices, and prejudices had created many predominantly black inner cities surrounded by mostly white suburbs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   See K. Clark, Dark Ghetto: Dilemmas of Social Power 11, 21-26 (1965).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The mid-1960's was a period of considerable social unrest; and, in response, President Lyndon Johnson established the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, commonly known as the Kerner Commission. Exec. Order No. 11365, 3 CFR 674 (1966-1970 Comp.). After extensive factfinding the Commission identified residential segregation and unequal housing and economic conditions in the inner cities as significant, underlying causes of the social unrest. See Report of the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders 91 (1968) (Kerner Commission Report). The Commission found that \"[n]early two-thirds of all nonwhite families living in the central cities today live in neighborhoods marked by substandard housing and general urban blight.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 13. The Commission further found that both open and covert racial discrimination prevented black families from obtaining better housing and moving to integrated communities.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The Commission concluded that \"[o]ur Nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white-separate and unequal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1. To reverse \"[t]his deepening racial division,\"\n   <em>\n    ibid.,\n   </em>\n   it recommended enactment of \"a comprehensive and enforceable open-occupancy law making it an offense to discriminate in the sale or rental of any housing ... on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 263.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, and the Nation faced a new urgency to resolve the social unrest in the inner cities. Congress responded by adopting the Kerner Commission's recommendation and passing the Fair Housing Act. The statute addressed the denial of housing opportunities on the basis of \"race, color, religion, or national origin.\" Civil Rights Act of 1968, \u00a7 804,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Stat.%2083\">\n    82 Stat. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Then, in 1988, Congress amended the FHA. Among other provisions, it created certain exemptions from liability and added \"familial status\" as a protected characteristic. See Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=102%20Stat.%201619\">\n    102 Stat. 1619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The issue here is whether, under a proper interpretation of the FHA, housing decisions with a disparate impact are prohibited. Before turning to the FHA, however, it is necessary to consider two other antidiscrimination statutes that preceded it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The first relevant statute is \u00a7 703(a) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Stat.%20255\">\n    78 Stat. 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, the employer had a policy requiring its manual laborers to possess a high school diploma and to obtain satisfactory scores on two intelligence tests. The Court of Appeals held the employer had not adopted these job requirements for a racially discriminatory purpose, and the plaintiffs did not challenge that holding in this Court. Instead, the plaintiffs argued \u00a7 703(a)(2) covers the discriminatory effect of a practice as well as the motivation behind the practice. Section 703(a), as amended, provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"It shall be an unlawful employer practice for an employer-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment\n   in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court did not quote or cite the full statute, but rather relied solely on \u00a7 703(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    Griggs,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S., at 426, n. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In interpreting \u00a7 703(a)(2), the Court reasoned that disparate-impact liability furthered the purpose and design of the statute.

In light of the statute's goal of achieving \"equality of employment opportunities and remov[ing] barriers that have operated in the past\" to favor some races over others, the Court held \u00a7 703(a)(2) of Title VII must be interpreted to allow disparate-impact claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 429-430,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court put important limits on its holding: namely, not all employment practices causing a disparate impact impose liability under \u00a7 703(a)(2).

Congress' use of the phrase \"otherwise make unavailable\" refers to the consequences of an action rather than the actor's intent. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Giles,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336826\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/41/#p48\">\n    300 U.S. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 48,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336826\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/41/#p48\">\n    57 S.Ct. 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"336826\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/300/41/#p48\">\n    81 L.Ed. 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1937)(explaining that the \"word 'make' has many meanings, among them '[t]o cause to exist, appear or occur' \" (quoting Webster's New International Dictionary 1485 (2d ed. 1934))). This results-oriented language counsels in favor of recognizing disparate-impact liability. See\n   <em>\n    Smith, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 236,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court has construed statutory language similar to \u00a7 805(a) to include disparate-impact liability. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Board of Ed. of City School Dist. of New York v.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Harris,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305255\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/130/#p140\">\n    444 U.S. 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 140-141,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305255\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/130/#p140\">\n    100 S.Ct. 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11305255\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/130/#p140\">\n    62 L.Ed.2d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979)(holding the term \"discriminat[e]\" encompassed disparate-impact liability in the context of a statute's text, history, purpose, and structure).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   A comparison to the antidiscrimination statutes examined in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   is useful. Title VII's and the ADEA's \"otherwise adversely affect\" language is equivalent in function and purpose to the FHA's \"otherwise make unavailable\" language. In these three statutes the operative text looks to results. The relevant statutory phrases, moreover, play an identical role in the structure common to all three statutes: Located at the end of lengthy sentences that begin with prohibitions on disparate treatment, they serve as catchall phrases looking to consequences, not intent. And all three statutes use the word \"otherwise\" to introduce the results-oriented phrase. \"Otherwise\" means \"in a different way or manner,\" thus signaling a shift in emphasis from an actor's intent to the consequences of his actions. Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1598 (1971). This similarity in text and structure is all the more compelling given that Congress passed the FHA in 1968-only four years after passing Title VII and only four months after enacting the ADEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is true that Congress did not reiterate Title VII's exact language in the FHA, but that is because to do so would have made the relevant sentence awkward and unclear. A provision making it unlawful to \"refuse to sell [,] ... or otherwise [adversely affect], a dwelling to any person\" because of a protected trait would be grammatically obtuse, difficult to interpret, and far more expansive in scope than Congress likely intended. Congress thus chose words that serve the same purpose and bear the same basic meaning but are consistent with the structure and objectives of the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Emphasizing that the FHA uses the phrase \"because of race,\" the Department argues this language forecloses disparate-impact liability since \"[a]n action is not taken 'because of race' unless race is a\n   <em>\n    reason\n   </em>\n   for the action.\" Brief for Petitioners 26.\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   however, dispose of this argument. Both Title VII and the ADEA contain identical \"because of\" language, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(2);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), and the Court nonetheless held those statutes impose disparate-impact liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition, it is of crucial importance that the existence of disparate-impact liability is supported by amendments to the FHA that Congress enacted in 1988.

And with that understanding, it made a considered judgment to retain the relevant statutory text. See H.R.Rep. No. 100-711, p. 21, n. 52(1988), 1988 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2173 (H.R. Rep.)

The amendments included three exemptions from liability that assume the existence of disparate-impact claims. The most logical conclusion is that the three amendments were deemed necessary because Congress presupposed disparate impact under the FHA as it had been enacted in 1968.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The relevant 1988 amendments were as follows. First, Congress added a clarifying provision: \"Nothing in [the FHA] prohibits a person engaged in the business of furnishing appraisals of real property to take into consideration factors other than race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap, or familial status.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203605\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Second, Congress provided: \"Nothing in [the FHA] prohibits conduct against a person because such person has been convicted by any court of competent jurisdiction of the illegal manufacture or distribution of a controlled substance.\" \u00a7 3607(b)(4).

Indeed, none of these amendments would make sense if the FHA encompassed only disparate-treatment\n   claims. If that were the sole ground for liability, the amendments merely restate black-letter law. If an actor makes a decision based on reasons other than a protected category, there is no disparate-treatment liability. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v.

But the amendments do constrain disparate-impact liability. For instance, certain criminal convictions are correlated with sex and race. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimbrough v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p98\">\n    552 U.S. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 98,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p98\">\n    128 S.Ct. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675682\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/85/#p98\">\n    169 L.Ed.2d 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007)(discussing the racial disparity in convictions for crack cocaine offenses). By adding an exemption from liability for exclusionary practices aimed at individuals with drug convictions, Congress ensured disparate-impact liability would not lie if a landlord excluded tenants with such convictions. The same is true of the provision allowing for reasonable restrictions on occupancy. And the exemption from liability for real-estate appraisers is in the same section as \u00a7 805(a)'s prohibition of discriminatory practices in real-estate transactions, thus indicating Congress' recognition that disparate-impact liability arose under \u00a7 805(a). In short, the 1988 amendments signal that Congress ratified disparate-impact liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A comparison to\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   's discussion of the ADEA further demonstrates why the Department's interpretation would render the 1988 amendments superfluous. Under the ADEA's reasonable-factor-other-than-age (RFOA) provision, an employer is permitted to take an otherwise prohibited action where \"the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). In other words, if an employer makes a decision based on a reasonable factor other than age, it cannot be said to have made a decision on the basis of an employee's age. According to the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   plurality, the RFOA provision \"plays its principal role\" \"in cases involving disparate-impact claims\" \"by precluding liability if the adverse impact was attributable to a nonage factor that was 'reasonable.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S., at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The availability of disparate-impact liability, furthermore, has allowed private developers to vindicate the FHA's objectives and to protect their property rights by stopping municipalities from enforcing arbitrary and, in practice, discriminatory ordinances barring the construction of certain types of housing units. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huntington, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1494828\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/15/\">\n    109 S.Ct. 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Recognition of disparate-impact liability under the FHA also plays a role in uncovering discriminatory intent: It permits plaintiffs to counteract unconscious prejudices and disguised animus that escape easy classification as disparate treatment. In this way disparate-impact liability may prevent segregated housing patterns that might otherwise result from covert and illicit stereotyping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   But disparate-impact liability has always been properly limited in key respects that avoid the serious constitutional questions that might arise under the FHA, for instance, if such liability were imposed based solely on a showing of a statistical disparity. Disparate-impact liability mandates the \"removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers,\" not the displacement of valid governmental policies.\n   <em>\n    Griggs, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 431,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FHA is not an instrument to force housing authorities to reorder their priorities. Rather, the FHA aims to ensure that those priorities can be achieved without arbitrarily creating discriminatory effects or perpetuating segregation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Unlike the heartland of disparate-impact suits targeting artificial barriers to housing, the underlying dispute in this case involves a novel theory of liability. See Seicshnaydre, Is Disparate Impact Having Any Impact? An Appellate Analysis of Forty Years of Disparate Impact Claims Under the Fair Housing Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Am.%20U.%20L.%20Rev.%20357\">\n    63 Am. U. L. Rev. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360-363 (2013)(noting the rarity of this type of claim). This case, on remand, may be seen simply as an attempt to second-guess which of two reasonable approaches a housing authority should follow in the sound exercise of its discretion in allocating tax credits for low-income housing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   An important and appropriate means of ensuring that disparate-impact liability is properly limited is to give housing authorities and private developers leeway to state and explain the valid interest served by their policies. This step of the analysis is analogous to the business necessity standard under Title VII and provides a defense against disparate-impact liability. See 78 Fed.Reg. 11470(explaining that HUD did not use the phrase \"business necessity\" because that \"phrase may not be easily understood to cover the full scope of practices covered by the Fair Housing Act, which applies to individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and public entities\"). As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Ricci,\n   </em>\n   an entity \"could be liable for disparate-impact discrimination only if the [challenged practices] were not job related and consistent with business necessity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   557 U.S., at 587,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658054\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/557/#p577\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just as an employer may maintain a workplace requirement that causes a disparate impact if that requirement is a \"reasonable measure[ment] of job performance,\"\n   <em>\n    Griggs, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 436, 91 S.Ct. 849so too must housing authorities and private developers be allowed to maintain a policy if they can prove it is necessary to achieve a valid interest. To be sure, the Title VII framework may not transfer exactly to the fair-housing context, but the comparison suffices for present purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   It would be paradoxical to construe the FHA to impose onerous costs on actors who encourage revitalizing dilapidated housing in our Nation's cities merely because some other priority might seem preferable. Entrepreneurs must be given latitude to consider market factors. Zoning officials, moreover, must often make decisions based on a mix of factors, both objective (such as cost and traffic patterns) and, at least to some extent, subjective (such as preserving historic architecture). These factors contribute to a community's quality of life and are legitimate concerns for housing authorities. The FHA does not decree a particular vision of urban development; and it does not put housing authorities and private developers in a double bind of liability, subject to suit whether they choose to rejuvenate a city core or to promote new low-income housing in suburban communities. As HUD itself recognized in its recent rulemaking, disparate-impact liability \"does not mandate that affordable housing be located in neighborhoods with any particular characteristic.\"78 Fed.Reg. 11476.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In a similar vein, a disparate-impact claim that relies on a statistical disparity must fail if the plaintiff cannot point to a defendant's policy or policies causing that disparity. A robust causality requirement ensures that \"[r]acial imbalance ... does not, without more, establish a prima facie case of disparate impact\" and thus protects defendants from being held liable for racial disparities they did not create.\n   <em>\n    Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605737\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/642/#p653\">\n    490 U.S. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605737\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/642/#p653\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605737\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/642/#p653\">\n    104 L.Ed.2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), superseded by statute on other grounds, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(k). Without adequate safeguards at the prima facie stage, disparate-impact liability might cause race to be used and considered in a pervasive way and \"would almost inexorably lead\" governmental or private entities to use \"numerical quotas,\" and serious constitutional questions then could arise.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605737\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/642/#p653\">\n    490 U.S., at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605737\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/642/#p653\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The litigation at issue here provides an example. From the standpoint of determining advantage or disadvantage to racial minorities, it seems difficult to say as a general matter that a decision to build low-income housing in a blighted inner-city neighborhood instead of a suburb is discriminatory, or vice versa. If those sorts of judgments are subject to challenge without adequate safeguards, then there is a danger that potential defendants may adopt racial quotas-a circumstance that itself raises serious constitutional concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Courts must therefore examine with care whether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of disparate impact and prompt resolution of these cases is important. A plaintiff who fails to allege facts at the pleading stage or produce statistical evidence demonstrating a causal connection cannot make out a prima facie case of disparate impact. For instance, a plaintiff challenging the decision of a private developer to construct a new building in one location rather than another will not easily be able to show this is a policy causing a disparate impact because such a one-time decision may not be a policy at all. It may also be difficult to establish causation because\n   of the multiple factors that go into investment decisions about where to construct or renovate housing units. And as Judge Jones observed below, if the ICP cannot show a causal connection between the Department's policy and a disparate impact-for instance, because federal law substantially limits the Department's discretion-that should result in dismissal of this case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180154\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/275/#p280\">\n    747 F.3d, at 283-284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (specially concurring opinion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The FHA imposes a command with respect to disparate-impact liability. Here, that command goes to a state entity. In other cases, the command will go to a private person or entity. Governmental or private policies are not contrary to the disparate-impact requirement unless they are \"artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.\"\n   <em>\n    Griggs,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S., at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Difficult questions might arise if disparate-impact liability under the FHA caused race to be used and considered in a pervasive and explicit manner to justify governmental or private actions that, in fact, tend to perpetuate race-based considerations rather than move beyond them. Courts should avoid interpreting disparate-impact liability to be so expansive as to inject racial considerations into every housing decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The limitations on disparate-impact liability discussed here are also necessary to protect potential defendants against abusive disparate-impact claims. If the specter of disparate-impact litigation causes private developers to no longer construct or renovate housing units for low-income individuals, then the FHA would have undermined its own purpose as well as the free-market system. And as to governmental entities, they must not be prevented from achieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compliance with health and safety codes.

Although the Court is reluctant to approve or disapprove a case that is not pending, it should be noted that\n   <em>\n    Magner\n   </em>\n   was decided without the cautionary standards announced in this opinion and, in all events, the case was settled by the parties before an ultimate determination of disparate-impact liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Were standards for proceeding with disparate-impact suits not to incorporate at least the safeguards discussed here, then disparate-impact liability might displace valid governmental and private priorities, rather than solely \"remov[ing] ... artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers.\"\n   <em>\n    Griggs,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S., at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

EEOC's \"own official history of these early years records with unusual candor the commission's fundamental disagreement with its founding charter, especially Title VII's literal requirement that the discrimination be intentional.\" H. Graham, The Civil Rights Era: Origins and Development of National Policy 1960-1972, p. 248 (1990). The Commissioners and their legal staff thought that \"discrimination\" had become \"less often an individual act of disparate treatment flowing from an evil state of mind\" and \"more institutionalized.\" Jackson, EEOC vs. Discrimination, Inc., 75 The Crisis 16 (1968). They consequently decided they should target employment practices \"which prove to have a demonstrable racial effect without a clear and convincing business motive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (emphasis deleted). EEOC's \"legal staff was aware from the beginning that a normal, traditional, and literal interpretation of Title VII could blunt their efforts\" to penalize employers for practices that had a disparate impact, yet chose \"to defy Title VII's restrictions and attempt to build a body of case law that would justify [their] focus on effects and [their] disregard of intent.\" Graham,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 248, 250.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The lack of legal authority for their agenda apparently did not trouble them much. For example, Alfred Blumrosen, one of the principal creators of disparate-impact liability at EEOC, rejected what he described as a \"defeatist view of Title VII\" that saw the statute as a \"compromise\" with a limited scope. A. Blumrosen, Black Employment and the Law 57-58 (1971). Blumrosen \"felt that most of the problems confronting the EEOC could be solved by creative interpretation of Title VII which would be upheld by the courts, partly out of deference to the administrators.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   EEOC's guidelines from those years are a case study in Blumrosen's \"creative interpretation.\" Although EEOC lacked substantive rulemaking authority, see\n   <em>\n    Faragher v.

In 1966, for example, EEOC issued guidelines suggesting that the use of employment tests in hiring decisions could violate Title VII based on disparate impact, notwithstanding the statute's express statement that \"it shall not be an unlawful employment practice ... to give and to act upon the results of any professionally developed ability test provided that such test ... is not\n   <em>\n    designed, intended, or used\n   </em>\n   to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,\" \u00a7 2000e-2(h)(emphasis added). See EEOC, Guidelines on Employment Testing Procedures 2-4 (Aug. 24, 1966). EEOC followed this up with a 1970 guideline that was even more explicit, declaring that, unless certain criteria were met, \"[t]he use of any test which adversely affects hiring, promotion, transfer or any other employment\n   or membership opportunity of classes protected by title VII constitutes discrimination.\" 35 Fed.Reg. 12334 (1970).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   EEOC was initially hesitant to take its approach to this Court, but the\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs forced its hand.

Standing alone, the fact that a practice has a disparate impact is not conclusive evidence, as the\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   Court appeared to\n   believe, that a practice is \"discriminatory,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    401 U.S., at 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11712736\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/401/424/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Although presently observed racial imbalance\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   result from past [discrimination], racial imbalance can also result from any number of innocent private decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Parents Involved in Community Schools v.

See also \u00a7 3605(a)(barring \"discriminat[ion] against any person in making available such a [housing] transaction ... because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin\"). The Solicitor General argues that \"[t]he plain meaning of the phrase 'make unavailable' includes actions that\n   <em>\n    have the result\n   </em>\n   of making housing or transactions unavailable, regardless of whether the actions were intended to have that result.\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   18 (emphasis added). This argument is not consistent with ordinary English usage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   It is doubtful that the Solicitor General's argument accurately captures the \"plain meaning\" of the phrase \"make unavailable\" even when that phrase is not linked to the phrase \"because of.\" \"[M]ake unavailable\" must be viewed together with the rest of the actions covered by \u00a7 804(a), which applies when a party \"\n   <em>\n    refuse[s]\n   </em>\n   to sell or rent\" a dwelling, \"\n   <em>\n    refuse[s]\n   </em>\n   to negotiate for the sale or rental\" of a dwelling, \"\n   <em>\n    den[ies]\n   </em>\n   a dwelling to any person,\" \"or otherwise\n   <em>\n    make[s] unavailable\n   </em>\n   \" a dwelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   \u00a7 3604(a)(emphasis added).

The result of these ordinary rules of interpretation is that even without \"because of,\" the phrase \"make unavailable\" likely would require intentionality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The FHA's inclusion of \"because of,\" however, removes any doubt. Sections 804(a) and 805(a) apply only when a party makes a dwelling or transaction unavailable \"because of\" race or another protected characteristic. In ordinary English usage, when a person makes something unavailable \"because of\" some factor, that factor must be a reason for the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Here is an example. Suppose that Congress increases the minimum wage. Some economists believe that such legislation reduces the number of jobs available for \"unskilled workers,\" Fuller &amp; Geide-Stevenson, Consensus Among Economists: Revisited, 34 J. Econ. Educ. 369, 378 (2003), and minorities tend to be disproportionately represented in this group, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Detailed Years of School Completed by People 25 Years and Over by Sex, Age Groups, Race and Hispanic Origin: 2014, online at http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/data/cps/2014/tables.html (all Internet materials as visited June 23, 2015, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). Assuming for the sake of argument that these economists are correct, would it be fair to say that Congress made jobs unavailable to African-Americans or Latinos \"because of\" their race or ethnicity?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   A second example. Of the 32 college players selected by National Football League (NFL) teams in the first round of the 2015 draft, it appears that the overwhelming majority were members of racial minorities. See Draft 2015, http://www.nfl.com/draft/2015. See also Miller, Powerful Sports Agents Representing Color, Los Angeles Sentinel, Feb. 6, 2014, p. B3 (noting \"there are 96 players (76 of whom are African-American) chosen in the first rounds of the 2009, 2010, and 2011 NFL drafts\"). Teams presumably chose the players they think are most likely to help them win games. Would anyone say the NFL teams made draft slots unavailable to white players \"because of\" their race?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   A third example. During the present Court Term, of the 21 attorneys from the Solicitor General's Office who argued cases in this Court, it appears that all but 5(76%) were under the age of 45. Would the Solicitor General say he made argument opportunities unavailable to older attorneys \"because of\" their age?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The text of the FHA simply cannot be twisted to authorize disparate-impact claims. It is hard to imagine how Congress could have more clearly stated that the FHA prohibits only intentional discrimination than by forbidding acts done \"because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The circumstances in which the FHA was enacted only confirm what the text says. In 1968, \"the predominant focus of antidiscrimination law was on intentional discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v. City of Jackson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 258,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005)(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The very \"concept of disparate impact liability, by contrast, was quite novel.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (collecting citations). See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 15 (\"JUSTICE GINSBURG: ... If we're going to be realistic about this, ... in 1968, when the Fair Housing Act passed, nobody knew anything about disparate impact\"). It is anachronistic to think that Congress authorized disparate-impact claims in 1968 but packaged that striking innovation so imperceptibly in the FHA's text.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Eradicating intentional discrimination was and is the FHA's strategy for providing fair housing opportunities for all. The Court recalls the country's shameful history of segregation and\n   <em>\n    de jure\n   </em>\n   housing discrimination and then jumps to the conclusion that the FHA authorized disparate-impact claims as a method of combatting that evil.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2534 - 2536. But the fact that the 1968 Congress sought to end housing discrimination says nothing about the means it devised to achieve that end. The FHA's text plainly identifies the weapon Congress chose-outlawing disparate treatment \"because of race\" or another protected characteristic.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 3605(a).

Congress also gave the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) rulemaking authority and the power to adjudicate certain housing claims. See \u00a7\u00a7 3612, 3614a. And, what is most relevant for present purposes, Congress added three safe-harbor provisions, specifying that \"[n]othing in [the FHA]\" prohibits (a) certain actions taken by real property appraisers, (b) certain occupancy requirements, and (c) the treatment of persons convicted of manufacturing or distributing illegal drugs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   According to the Solicitor General and the Court, these amendments show that the FHA authorizes disparate-impact claims. Indeed, the Court says that they are \"of crucial importance.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2519. This \"crucial\" argument, however, cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Solicitor General and the Court contend that the 1988 Congress implicitly authorized disparate-impact liability by adopting the amendments just noted while leaving the operative provisions of the FHA untouched. Congress knew at that time, they maintain, that the Courts of Appeals had held that the FHA sanctions disparate-impact claims, but Congress failed to enact bills that would have rejected that theory of liability. Based on this, they submit that Congress silently ratified those decisions. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2519 - 2520; Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   23-24. This argument is deeply flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Not the greatest of its defects is its assessment of what Congress must have known about the judiciary's interpretation of the FHA. The Court writes that by 1988, \"all nine\n   <em>\n    Courts of Appeals\n   </em>\n   to have addressed the question had concluded the Fair Housing Act encompassed disparate-impact claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2519 (emphasis added). See also Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   12. But\n   <em>\n    this Court\n   </em>\n   had not addressed that question.

While the Court highlights the decisions of the Courts of Appeals, it fails to mention something that is of at least equal importance: The official view of the United States in 1988.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Shortly\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the 1988 amendments were adopted, the United States formally argued in this Court that the FHA prohibits only intentional discrimination. See Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Huntington v. Huntington Branch, NAACP,\n   </em>\n   O.T. 1988, No. 87-1961, p. 15 (\"An action taken because of some factor other than race,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   financial means, even if it causes a discriminatory effect, is not\n   an example of the intentional discrimination outlawed by the statute\");\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 14 (\"The words 'because of' plainly connote a causal connection between the housing-related action and the person's race or color\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was the same position that the United States had taken in lower courts for years. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It is implausible that the 1988 Congress was aware of certain lower court decisions but oblivious to the United States' considered and public view that those decisions were wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   This fact is fatal to any notion that Congress implicitly ratified disparate impact in 1988. The canon of interpretation on which the Court and the Solicitor General purport to rely-the so-called \"prior-construction canon\"-does not apply where lawyers cannot \"justifiably regard the point as settled\" or when \"other sound rules of interpretation\" are implicated. A. Scalia &amp; B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 324, 325 (2012). That was the case here. Especially after the United States began repudiating disparate impact, no one could have reasonably thought that the question was settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Nor can such a faulty argument be salvaged by pointing to Congress' failure in 1988 to enact language that would have made it clear that the FHA does not authorize disparate-impact suits based on zoning decisions.

They make no reference to \u00a7 804(a) or \u00a7 805(a) or any other provision of the FHA; nor do they state that they apply to conduct that would otherwise be prohibited.

Kennedy). Others worried about disparate-impact liability and recognized that this Court had not decided whether disparate-impact claims were authorized under the 1968 Act. See H.R.Rep. No. 100-711, pp. 89-93 (1988). Still others disapproved of disparate-impact liability and believed that the 1968 Act did not authorize it. That was the view of President Reagan when he signed the amendments. See Remarks on Signing the Fair Housing Amendments Act of\n   1988, 24 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1140, 1141 (1988) (explaining that the amendments did \"not represent any congressional or executive branch endorsement of the notion, expressed in some judicial opinions, that [FHA] violations may be established by a showing of disparate impact\" because the FHA \"speaks only to intentional discrimination\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The 1988 safe-harbor provisions have all the hallmarks of a compromise among these factions. These provisions neither authorize nor bar disparate-impact claims, but they do provide additional protection for persons and entities engaging in certain practices that Congress especially wished to shield. We \"must respect and give effect to these sorts of compromises.\"\n   <em>\n    Ragsdale v.

For Members of Congress who supported disparate impact, the safe harbors left the favorable lower court decisions in place. And for those who hoped that this Court would ultimately agree with the position being urged by the United States, those provisions were not surplusage. In the Circuits in which disparate-impact FHA liability had been accepted, the safe-harbor provisions furnished a measure of interim protection until the question was resolved by this Court. They also provided partial protection in the event that this Court ultimately rejected the United States' argument. Neither the Court, the principal respondent, nor the Solicitor General has cited any case in which the canon against surplusage has been applied in circumstances like these.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   On the contrary, we have previously refused to interpret enactments like the 1988 safe-harbor provisions in such a way.

In that case, the question was whether a provision of the Internal Revenue Code excluding a recovery for personal injury from gross income applied to punitive damages. Well after the critical provision was enacted, Congress adopted an amendment providing that punitive damages for nonphysical injuries were not excluded. Pointing to this amendment, a taxpayer argued: \"Why ... would Congress have enacted this amendment removing punitive damages (in nonphysical injury cases) unless Congress believed that, in the amendment's absence, punitive damages did fall within the provision's coverage?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 89,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594850\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/79/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To paraphrase\n   <em>\n    O'Gilvie,\n   </em>\n   the Court today asks: Why would Congress have enacted the 1988 amendments, providing safe harbors from three types of disparate-impact claims, unless Congress believed that, in the amendments' absence, disparate-impact claims did fall within the FHA's coverage?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Court rejected the argument in\n   <em>\n    O'Gilvie\n   </em>\n   . \"The short answer,\" the Court wrote, is that Congress might have simply wanted to \"clarify the matter in respect to nonphysical injuries\" while otherwise \"leav[ing] the law where it found it.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Although other aspects of\n   <em>\n    O'Gilvie\n   </em>\n   triggered a dissent, see\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 94-101,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594850\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/79/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of SCALIA, J.), no one quarreled with this self-evident piece of the Court's analysis.

Under these provisions of the FHA, like \u00a7 4(a)(1) of the ADEA, a defendant must act \"because of\" race or one of the other prohibited grounds. That is, it is unlawful for a person or entity to \"[t]o refuse to sell or rent,\" \"refuse to negotiate,\" \"otherwise make unavailable,\" etc. for a forbidden reason. These provisions of the FHA, unlike the Title VII provision in\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   or \u00a7 4(a)(2) of the ADEA, do not make it unlawful to take an action that happens to adversely affect a person because of race, religion, etc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   plurality's analysis, moreover, also depended on other language, unique to the ADEA, declaring that \"it shall not be unlawful for an employer 'to take any action\n   <em>\n    otherwise prohibited\n   </em>\n   ... where the differentiation is based on reasonable factors other than age.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    544 U.S., at 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"382\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Stat.%20603\">\n    81 Stat. 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; emphasis added). This \"otherwise prohibited\" language was key to the plurality opinion's reading of the statute because it arguably suggested disparate-impact liability.

In fact, even with this \"otherwise prohibited\" language, Justice SCALIA merely concluded that \u00a7 4(a)(2) was ambiguous-\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   that disparate-impacts suits are required.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 243,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5877522\" index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/228/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 1536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   The FHA does not contain any phrase like \"otherwise prohibited.\" Such language certainly is nowhere to be found in \u00a7\u00a7 804(a) and 805(a). And for all the reasons already explained, the 1988 amendments do not presuppose disparate-impact liability. To the contrary, legislative enactments declaring only that certain actions are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   grounds for liability do not implicitly create a new theory of liability that all other facets of the statute foreclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   This discussion of our cases refutes any notion that \"[t]ogether,\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   holds\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the plurality in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   instructs that antidiscrimination laws must be construed to encompass disparate-impact claims when their text refers to the consequences of actions and not just to the mindset of actors, and where that interpretation is consistent with statutory purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2517. The Court stumbles in concluding that \u00a7 804(a) of the FHA is more like \u00a7 4(a)(2) of the ADEA than \u00a7 4(a)(1). The operative language in \u00a7 4(a)(1) of the ADEA-which, per\n   <em>\n    Smith,\n   </em>\n   does not authorize disparate-impact claims-is materially indistinguishable from the operative language in \u00a7 804(a) of the FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Even more baffling, neither alone nor in combination do\n   <em>\n    Griggs\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   support the Court's conclusion that \u00a7 805(a) of the FHA allows disparate-impact suits.

The Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs (the Department) has only so many tax credits to distribute. If it gives credits for housing in lower income areas, many families-including many minority families-will obtain better housing. That is a good thing. But if the Department gives credits for housing in higher income areas, some of those families will be able to afford to move into more desirable neighborhoods. That is also a good thing. Either path, however, might trigger a disparate-impact suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   This is not mere speculation. Here, one respondent has sued the Department for not allocating enough credits to higher income areas. See Brief for Respondent Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 23. But\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   respondent argues that giving credits to wealthy neighborhoods violates \"the moral imperative to improve the substandard and inadequate affordable housing in many of our inner cities.\" Reply Brief for Respondent Frazier Revitalization Inc. 1. This latter argument has special force because a city can build more housing where property is least expensive, thus benefiting more people. In fact, federal\n   law often favors projects that revitalize low-income communities. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2513.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   No matter what the Department decides, one of these respondents will be able to bring a disparate-impact case. And if the Department opts to compromise by dividing the credits, both respondents might be able to sue. Congress surely did not mean to put local governments in such a position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   The Solicitor General's answer to such problems is that HUD will come to the rescue. In particular, HUD regulations provide a defense against disparate-impact liability if a defendant can show that its actions serve \"substantial, legitimate, nondiscriminatory interests\" that \"necessar[ily]\" cannot be met by \"another practice that has a less discriminatory effect.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.500\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 100.500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2014). (There is, of course, no hint of anything like this defense in the text of the FHA. But then, there is no hint of disparate-impact liability in the text of the FHA either.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The effect of these regulations, not surprisingly, is to confer enormous discretion on HUD-without actually solving the problem. What is a \"substantial\" interest? Is there a difference between a \"legitimate\" interest and a \"nondiscriminatory\" interest? To what degree must an interest be met for a practice to be \"necessary\"? How are parties and courts to measure \"discriminatory effect\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   These questions are not answered by the Court's assurance that the FHA's disparate-impact \"analysis 'is analogous to the Title VII requirement that an employer's interest in an employment practice with a disparate impact be job related.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2514 (quoting 78 Fed.Reg. 11470). See also\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2522 (likening the defense to \"the business necessity standard\"). The business-necessity defense is complicated enough in employment cases; what it means when plopped into the housing context is anybody's guess. What is the FHA analogue of \"job related\"? Is it \"housing related\"? But a vast array of municipal decisions affect property values and thus relate (at least indirectly) to housing. And what is the FHA analogue of \"business necessity\"? \"Housing-policy necessity\"? What does that mean?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Compounding the problem, the Court proclaims that \"governmental entities ... must not be prevented from achieving legitimate objectives, such as ensuring compliance with health and safety codes.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2524. But what does the Court mean by a \"legitimate\" objective? And does the Court mean to say that there can be no disparate-impact lawsuit if the objective is \"legitimate\"? That is certainly not the view of the Government, which takes the position that a disparate-impact claim may be brought to challenge actions taken with such worthy objectives as improving housing in poor neighborhoods and making financially sound lending decisions.
