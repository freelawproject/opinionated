Users of that Web site may post items on their Facebook page that are accessible to other users, including Facebook \"friends\" who are notified when new content is posted. In May 2010, Elonis's wife of nearly seven years left him, taking with her their two young children. Elonis began \"listening to more violent music\" and posting self-styled \"rap\" lyrics inspired by the music. App. 204, 226.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Eventually, Elonis changed the user name on his Facebook page from his actual name to a rap-style nom de plume, \"Tone Dougie,\" to distinguish himself from his \"on-line persona.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n    ., at 249, 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The lyrics Elonis posted as \"Tone Dougie\" included graphically violent language and imagery. This material was often interspersed with disclaimers that the lyrics were \"fictitious,\" with no intentional \"resemblance to real persons.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 331, 329. Elonis posted an explanation to another Facebook user that \"I'm doing this for me.

Around Halloween of 2010, Elonis posted a photograph of himself and a co-worker at a \"Halloween Haunt\" event at the amusement park where they worked. In the photograph, Elonis was holding a toy knife against his co-worker's neck, and in the caption Elonis wrote, \"I wish.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 340. Elonis was not Facebook friends with the co-worker and did not \"tag\" her, a Facebook feature that would have alerted her to the posting.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 175; Brief for Petitioner 6, 9. But the chief of park security was a Facebook \"friend\" of Elonis, saw the photograph, and fired him.

Didn't I tell y'all I had several? Y'all sayin' I had access to keys for all the f***in' gates. That I have sinister plans for all my friends and must have taken home a couple.

Shortly after he was fired, Elonis posted an adaptation of a satirical sketch that he and his wife had watched together.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 164-165, 207. In the actual sketch, called \"It's Illegal to Say ...,\" a comedian explains that it is illegal for a person to say he wishes to kill the President, but not illegal to explain that it is illegal for him to say that. When Elonis posted the script of the sketch, however, he substituted his wife for the President. The posting was part of the basis for Count Two of the indictment, threatening his wife:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Hi, I'm Tone Elonis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Did you know that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife? ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   It's one of the only sentences that I'm not allowed to say....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Now it was okay for me to say it right then because I was just telling you that it's illegal for me to say I want to kill my wife....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Um, but what's interesting is that it's very illegal to say I really, really think someone out there should kill my wife....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   But not illegal to say with a mortar launcher.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Because that's its own sentence....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I also found out that it's incredibly illegal, extremely illegal to go on Facebook and say something like the best place to fire a mortar launcher at her house would be from the cornfield behind it because of easy access to a getaway road and you'd have a clear line of sight through the sun room....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Yet even more illegal to show an illustrated diagram.

At the bottom of the post, Elonis included a link to the video of the original skit, and wrote, \"Art is about pushing limits. I'm willing to go to jail for my Constitutional rights. Are you?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 333.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After viewing some of Elonis's posts, his wife felt \"extremely afraid for [her] life.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 156. A state court granted her a three-year protection-from-abuse order against Elonis (essentially, a restraining order).\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 148-150. Elonis referred to the order in another post on his \"Tone Dougie\" page, also included in Count Two of the indictment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \"Fold up your [protection-from-abuse order] and put it in your pocket\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Try to enforce an Order\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   that was improperly granted in the first place\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Me thinks the Judge needs an education\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   on true threat jurisprudence\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   And prison time'll add zeros to my settlement ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   And if worse comes to worse\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   I've got enough explosives\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   to take care of the State Police and the Sheriff's Department.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 334.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   At the bottom of this post was a link to the Wikipedia article on \"Freedom of speech.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Elonis's reference to the police was the basis for Count Three of his indictment, threatening law enforcement officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That same month, interspersed with posts about a movie Elonis liked and observations on a comedian's social commentary,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 356-358, Elonis posted an entry that gave rise to Count Four of his indictment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"That's it, I've had about enough\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   I'm checking out and making a name for myself\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Enough elementary schools in a ten mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a Kindergarten class\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   The only question is ... which one?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 335.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Meanwhile, park security had informed both local police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Elonis's posts, and FBI Agent Denise Stevens had created a Facebook account to monitor his online activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 49-51, 125\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   After the post about a school shooting, Agent Stevens and her partner visited Elonis at his house.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 65-66.

App. 14-17. In the District Court, Elonis moved to dismiss the indictment for failing to allege that he had intended to threaten anyone. The District Court denied the motion, holding that Third Circuit precedent required only that Elonis \"intentionally made the communication, not that he intended to make a threat.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 51a. At trial, Elonis testified that his posts emulated the rap lyrics of the well-known performer Eminem, some of which involve fantasies about killing his ex-wife. App. 225. In Elonis's view, he had posted \"nothing ... that hasn't been said already.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 205. The Government presented as witnesses Elonis's wife and co-workers, all of whom said they felt afraid and viewed Elonis's posts as serious threats. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 153, 158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Elonis requested a jury instruction that \"the government must prove that he intended to communicate a true threat.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 21. See also\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 267-269, 303. The District Court denied that request. The jury instructions instead informed the jury that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   \"A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a statement in a context or under such circumstances wherein a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take the life of an individual.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 301.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Government's closing argument emphasized that it was irrelevant whether Elonis intended the postings to be threats-\"it doesn't matter what he thinks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 286. A jury convicted Elonis on four of the five counts against him, acquitting only on the charge of threatening park patrons and employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 309. Elonis was sentenced to three years, eight months' imprisonment and three years' supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Elonis renewed his challenge to the jury instructions in the Court of Appeals, contending that the jury should have been required to find that he intended his posts to be threats. The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the intent required by Section 875(c)is only the intent to communicate words that the defendant understands, and that a reasonable person would view as a threat.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702403\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/321/#p332\">\n    730 F.3d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (C.A.3 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We granted certiorari. 573 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582477,12582478,12582479,12582480,12582481,12582482\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2819/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582571,12582572,12582573,12582574,12582480,12582491,12582492\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/784/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   An individual who \"transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another\" is guilty of a felony and faces up to five years' imprisonment.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). This statute requires that a communication be transmitted and that the communication contain a threat. It does not specify that the defendant must have any mental state with respect to these elements. In particular, it does not indicate whether the defendant must intend that his communication contain a threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Elonis argues that the word \"threat\" itself in Section 875(c)imposes such a requirement. According to Elonis, every definition of \"threat\" or \"threaten\" conveys the notion of an intent to inflict harm. Brief for Petitioner 23. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jeffries,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3515751\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/692/473/#p483\">\n    692 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483 (C.A.6 2012)(Sutton, J.,\n   <em>\n    dubitante\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   11 Oxford English Dictionary 353 (1933) (\"to declare (usually conditionally) one's intention of inflicting injury upon\"); Webster's New International Dictionary 2633 (2d ed. 1954) (\"\n   <em>\n    Law,\n   </em>\n   specif., an expression of an intention to inflict loss or harm on another by illegal means\"); Black's Law Dictionary 1519 (8th ed. 2004) (\"A communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   These definitions, however, speak to what the statement conveys-not to the mental state of the author. For example, an anonymous letter that says \"I'm going to kill you\" is \"an expression of an intention to inflict loss or harm\" regardless of the author's intent. A victim who receives that letter in the mail has received a threat, even if the author believes (wrongly) that his message will be taken as a joke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For its part, the Government argues that Section 875(c)should be read in light of its neighboring provisions, Sections 875(b)and 875(d). Those provisions also prohibit certain types of threats, but expressly include a mental state requirement of an \"intent to extort.\" See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(proscribing threats to injure or kidnap made \"with intent to extort\"); \u00a7 875(d)(proscribing threats to property or reputation made \"with intent to extort\"). According to the Government, the express \"intent to extort\" requirements in Sections 875(b)and (d)should preclude courts from implying an unexpressed \"intent to threaten\" requirement in Section 875(c).

The fact that Congress excluded the requirement of an \"intent to extort\" from Section 875(c)is strong evidence that Congress did not mean to confine Section 875(c)to crimes of extortion. But that does not suggest that Congress, at the same time, also meant to exclude a requirement that a defendant act with a certain mental state in communicating a threat. The most we can conclude from the language of Section 875(c)and its neighboring provisions is that Congress meant to proscribe a broad class of threats in Section 875(c), but did not identify what mental state, if any, a defendant must have to be convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In sum, neither Elonis nor the Government has identified any indication of a\n   particular mental state requirement in the text of Section 875(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The fact that the statute does not specify any required mental state, however, does not mean that none exists.

The jury was instructed that the Government need prove only that a reasonable person would regard Elonis's communications as threats, and that was error. Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendant's mental state.

Attorneys and judges need to know which mental state is required for conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20875\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), an important criminal statute. This case squarely presents that issue, but the Court provides only a partial answer. The Court holds that the jury instructions in this case were defective because they required only negligence in conveying a threat. But the\n   Court refuses to explain what type of intent was necessary. Did the jury need to find that Elonis had the\n   <em>\n    purpose\n   </em>\n   of conveying a true threat? Was it enough if he\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that his words conveyed such a threat? Would\n   <em>\n    recklessness\n   </em>\n   suffice? The Court declines to say. Attorneys and judges are left to guess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   This will have regrettable consequences. While this Court has the luxury of choosing its docket, lower courts and juries are not so fortunate. They must actually decide cases, and this means applying a standard. If purpose or knowledge is needed and a district court instructs the jury that recklessness suffices, a defendant may be wrongly convicted. On the other hand, if recklessness is enough, and the jury is told that conviction requires proof of more, a guilty defendant may go free. We granted review in this case to resolve a disagreement among the Circuits. But the Court has compounded-not clarified-the confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   There is no justification for the Court's refusal to provide an answer. The Court says that \"[n]either Elonis nor the Government has briefed or argued\" the question whether recklessness is sufficient.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2012 - 2013. But in fact both parties addressed that issue. Elonis argued that recklessness is not enough, and the Government argued that it more than suffices. If the Court thinks that we cannot decide the recklessness question without additional help from the parties, we can order further briefing and argument. In my view, however, we are capable of deciding the recklessness issue, and we should resolve that question now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Section 875(c)provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   \"Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing ... any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Thus, conviction under this provision requires proof that: (1) the defendant transmitted something, (2) the thing transmitted was a threat to injure the person of another, and (3) the transmission was in interstate or foreign commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   At issue in this case is the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   required with respect to the second element-that the thing transmitted was a threat to injure the person of another. This Court has not defined the meaning of the term \"threat\" in \u00a7 875(c), but in construing the same term in a related statute, the Court distinguished a \"true 'threat' \" from facetious or hyperbolic remarks.\n   <em>\n    Watts v.

In my view, the term \"threat\" in \u00a7 875(c)can fairly be defined as a statement that is reasonably interpreted as \"an expression of an intention to inflict evil, injury, or damage on another.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2382 (1976). Conviction under \u00a7 875(c)demands proof that the defendant's transmission was in fact a threat,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   that it is reasonable to interpret the transmission as an expression of an intent to harm another. In addition, it must be shown that the defendant was at least reckless as to whether the transmission met that requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Why is recklessness enough? My analysis of the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   issue follows the same track as the Court's, as far as it goes. I agree with the Court that we should presume that criminal statutes require some sort of\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   for conviction. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2008 - 2011. To be sure, this presumption marks a departure from the way in which we generally interpret statutes.

But this step is justified by a well-established pattern in our criminal laws. \"For several centuries (at least since 1600) the different common law crimes have been so defined as to require, for guilt, that the defendant's acts or omissions be accompanied by one or more of the various types of fault (intention, knowledge, recklessness or-more rarely-negligence).\" 1 W. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 5.5, p. 381 (2003).

See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2010 - 2012. As the Court states, \"[w]hen interpreting federal criminal statutes that are silent on the required mental state, we read into the statute 'only that\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   which is necessary to separate wrongful conduct from \"otherwise innocent conduct.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2010 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Carter v.

In the hierarchy of mental states that may be required as a condition for criminal liability, the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   just above negligence is recklessness. Negligence requires only that the defendant \"should [have] be [en] aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk,\" ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02(2)(d), p. 226 (1985), while recklessness exists \"when a person disregards a risk of harm of which he is aware,\"\n   <em>\n    Farmer v.

And when Congress does not specify a\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   in a criminal statute, we have no justification for inferring that anything more than recklessness is needed. It is quite unusual for us to interpret a statute to contain a requirement that is nowhere set out in the text. Once we have reached recklessness, we have gone as far as we can without stepping over the line that separates interpretation from amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   There can be no real dispute that recklessness regarding a risk of serious harm is wrongful conduct.

And there are good reasons for that rule: True threats inflict great harm and have little if any social value. A threat may cause serious emotional stress for the person threatened and those who care about that person, and a threat may lead to a violent confrontation. It is true that a communication containing a threat may include other statements that have value and are entitled to protection. But that does not justify constitutional protection for the threat itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Elonis argues that the First Amendment protects a threat if the person making the statement does not actually intend to cause harm. In his view, if a threat is made for a \" 'therapeutic' \" purpose, \"to 'deal with the pain' ... of a wrenching event,\" or for \"cathartic\" reasons, the threat is protected. Brief for Petitioner 52-53. But whether or not the person making a threat intends to cause harm, the damage is the same. And the fact that making a threat may have a therapeutic or cathartic effect for the speaker is not sufficient to justify constitutional protection. Some people may experience a therapeutic or cathartic benefit only if they know that their words will cause harm or only if they actually plan to carry out the threat, but surely the First Amendment does not protect them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Elonis also claims his threats were constitutionally protected works of art. Words like his, he contends, are shielded by the First Amendment because they are similar to words uttered by rappers and singers in public performances and recordings. To make this point, his brief includes a lengthy excerpt from the lyrics of a rap song in which a very well-compensated rapper imagines killing his ex-wife and dumping her body in a lake. If this celebrity can utter such words, Elonis pleads, amateurs like him should be able to post similar things on social media. But context matters. \"Taken in context,\" lyrics in songs that are performed for an audience or sold in recorded form are unlikely to be interpreted as a real threat to a real person.\n   <em>\n    Watts, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 708,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178344\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/705/#p708\">\n    89 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Statements on social media that are pointedly directed at their victims, by contrast, are much more likely to be taken seriously. To hold otherwise would grant a license to anyone who is clever enough to dress up a real threat in the guise of rap lyrics, a parody, or something similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The facts of this case illustrate the point. Imagine the effect on Elonis's estranged wife when she read this: \" 'If I only knew then what I know now ... I would have smothered your ass with a pillow, dumped your body in the back seat, dropped you off in Toad Creek and made it look like a rape and murder.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702403\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/321/#p332\">\n    730 F.3d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324 (C.A.3 2013). Or this: \"There's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you. I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Or this: \"Fold up your [protection from abuse order] and put\n   it in your pocket[.] Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 325.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   There was evidence that Elonis made sure his wife saw his posts. And she testified that they made her feel \" 'extremely afraid' \" and \" 'like [she] was being stalked.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Considering the context, who could blame her? Threats of violence and intimidation are among the most favored weapons of domestic abusers, and the rise of social media has only made those tactics more commonplace. See Brief for The National Network to End Domestic Violence et al. as\n   <em>\n    Amici Curiae\n   </em>\n   4-16. A fig leaf of artistic expression cannot convert such hurtful, valueless threats into protected speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   It can be argued that \u00a7 875(c), if not limited to threats made with the intent to harm, will chill statements that do not qualify as true threats,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   statements that may be literally threatening but are plainly not meant to be taken seriously. We have sometimes cautioned that it is necessary to \"exten [d] a measure of strategic protection\" to otherwise unprotected false statements of fact in order to ensure enough \" 'breathing space' \" for protected speech.\n   <em>\n    Gertz v.

A similar argument might be made with respect to threats.

To benefit from a favorable ruling on appeal, a defendant must have actually asked for the legal rule the appellate court adopts. Rule 30(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedurerequires a defendant to \"inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection.\" An objection cannot be vague or open-ended. It must\n   <em>\n    specifically\n   </em>\n   identify the alleged error. And failure to lodge a sufficient objection \"precludes appellate review,\" except for plain error. Rule 30(d); see also 2A C. Wright &amp; P. Henning, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 484, pp. 433-435 (4th ed. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   At trial, Elonis objected to the District Court's instruction, but he did not argue for recklessness. Instead, he proposed instructions that would have required proof that he acted purposefully or with knowledge that his statements would be received as threats. See App. 19-21. He advanced the same position on appeal and in this Court. See Brief for Petitioner 29 (\"Section 875(c)requires proof that the defendant\n   <em>\n    intended\n   </em>\n   the charged statement to be a 'threat' \" (emphasis in original)); Corrected Brief of Appellant in No. 12-3798 (CA3), p. 14 (\"[A] 'true threat' has been uttered only if the speaker acted with\n   <em>\n    subjective intent to threaten\n   </em>\n   \" (same)). And at oral argument before this Court, he expressly disclaimed any agreement with a recklessness standard-which the Third Circuit remains free to adopt. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8:22-23 (\"[W]e would say that recklessness is not justif[ied]\"). I would therefore\n   remand for the Third Circuit to determine if Elonis's failure (indeed,\n   <em>\n    refusal\n   </em>\n   ) to argue for recklessness prevents reversal of his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Third Circuit should also have the opportunity to consider whether the conviction can be upheld on harmless-error grounds. \"We have often applied harmless-error analysis to cases involving improper instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Neder v.

Save two, every Circuit to have considered the issue-11 in total-has held that this provision demands proof only of general intent, which here requires no more than that a defendant knew he transmitted a communication, knew the words used in that communication, and understood the ordinary meaning of those words in the relevant context. The outliers are the Ninth and Tenth Circuits, which have concluded that proof of an intent to threaten was necessary for conviction. Adopting the minority position, Elonis urges us to hold that \u00a7 875(c)and the First Amendment require proof of an intent to threaten. The Government in turn advocates a general-intent approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Rather than resolve the conflict, the Court casts aside the approach used in nine Circuits and leaves nothing in its place. Lower courts are thus left to guess at the appropriate mental state for \u00a7 875(c). All they know after today's decision is that a requirement of general intent will not do. But they can safely infer that a majority of this Court would not adopt an intent-to-threaten requirement, as the opinion carefully leaves open the possibility that recklessness may be enough.

This uncertainty could have been avoided had we simply adhered to the background rule of the common law favoring general intent. Although I am sympathetic to my colleagues' policy concerns about the risks associated with threat prosecutions, the answer to such fears is not to discard our traditional approach to state-of-mind requirements in criminal law. Because the Court of Appeals properly applied the general-intent standard, and because the communications transmitted by Elonis were \"true threats\" unprotected by the First Amendment, I would affirm the judgment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Enacted in 1939, \u00a7 875(c)provides, \"Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\" Because \u00a7 875(c)criminalizes speech, the First Amendment requires that the term \"threat\" be limited to a narrow class of historically unprotected communications\n   called \"true threats.\" To qualify as a true threat, a communication must be a serious expression of an intention to commit unlawful physical violence, not merely \"political hyperbole\"; \"vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks\"; or \"vituperative, abusive, and inexact\" statements.\n   <em>\n    Watts v.

Knowing that the communication contains a \"threat\"-a serious expression of an intention to engage in unlawful physical violence-does not, however, require knowing that a jury will conclude that the communication contains a threat as a matter of law. Instead, like one who mails an \"obscene\" publication and is prosecuted under the federal obscenity statute, a defendant prosecuted under \u00a7 875(c)must know only the words used in that communication, along with their ordinary meaning in context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   General intent divides those who know the facts constituting the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of this crime from those who do not. For example, someone who transmits a threat who does not know English-or who knows English, but perhaps does not know a threatening idiom-lacks the general intent required under \u00a7 875(c). See\n   <em>\n    Ragansky, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 645 (\"[A] foreigner, ignorant of the English language, repeating [threatening] words without knowledge of their meaning, may not knowingly have made a threat\"). Likewise, the hapless mailman who delivers a threatening letter, ignorant of its contents, should not fear prosecution. A defendant like Elonis, however, who admits that he \"knew that what [he] was saying was violent\" but supposedly \"just wanted to express [him]self,\" App. 205, acted with the general intent required under \u00a7 875(c), even if he did not know that a jury would conclude that his communication constituted a \"threat\" as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Demanding evidence only of general intent also corresponds to \u00a7 875(c)'s statutory backdrop. As previously discussed, before the enactment of \u00a7 875(c), courts had read the Presidential threats statute to require proof only of general intent. Given Congress' presumptive awareness of this application of the Presidential threats statute-not to mention this Court's similar approach in the obscenity context, see\n   <em>\n    Rosen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701357\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/29/\">\n    161 U.S., at 41-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701357\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/29/\">\n    16 S.Ct. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -it is difficult to conclude that the Congress that enacted \u00a7 875(c)in 1939 understood it to contain an implicit mental-state requirement apart from general intent. There is certainly no textual evidence to support this conclusion. If anything, the text supports the opposite inference, as \u00a7 875(c), unlike the Presidential threats statute, contains no reference to knowledge or willfulness. Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress departed from the \"conventional\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   element\" of general intent,\n   <em>\n    Staples, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 605,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147026\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/600/#p608\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; I\n   would not impose a higher mental-state requirement here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The majority refuses to apply these ordinary background principles. Instead, it casts my application of general intent as a negligence standard disfavored in the criminal law.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2010 - 2013. But that characterization misses the mark. Requiring general intent in this context is not the same as requiring mere negligence. Like the mental-state requirements adopted in many of the cases cited by the Court, general intent under \u00a7 875(c)prevents a defendant from being convicted on the basis of any\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   beyond his awareness.

In other words, the defendant must\n   <em>\n    know\n   </em>\n   -not merely be reckless or negligent with respect to the fact-that he is committing the acts that constitute the\n   <em>\n    actus reus\n   </em>\n   of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   But general intent requires\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   mental state (not even a negligent one) concerning the \"fact\" that certain words meet the\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   definition of a threat. That approach is particularly appropriate where, as here, that legal status is determined by a jury's application of the legal standard of a \"threat\" to the contents of a communication. And convicting a defendant despite his ignorance of the legal-or objective-status of his conduct does not mean that he is being punished for negligent conduct. By way of example, a defendant who is convicted of murder despite claiming that he acted in self-defense has not been penalized under a negligence standard merely because he does not know that the jury will reject his argument that his \"belief in the necessity of using force to prevent harm to himself [was] a reasonable one.\" See 2 W.

To shore up its position,\n   it asserts that the critical portion of\n   <em>\n    Rosen\n   </em>\n   rejected an \" 'ignorance of the law' defense,\" and claims that \"no such contention is at issue here.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2012. But the thrust of Elonis' challenge is that a \u00a7 875(c)conviction cannot stand if the defendant's subjective belief of what constitutes a \"threat\" differs from that of a reasonable jury. That is akin to the argument the defendant made-and lost-in\n   <em>\n    Rosen\n   </em>\n   . That defendant insisted that he could not be convicted for mailing the paper \"unless he knew or believed that such paper could be properly or justly characterized as obscene.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701357\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/29/\">\n    161 U.S., at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5701357\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/161/29/\">\n    16 S.Ct. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, however, held that the Government did not need to show that the defendant \"regard[ed] the paper as one that the statute forbade to be carried in the mails,\" because the obscene character of the material did not \"depend upon the opinion or belief of the person who ... assumed the responsibility of putting it in the mails.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The majority's muddying of the waters cannot obscure the fact that today's decision is irreconcilable with\n   <em>\n    Rosen\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Hamling\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The majority today at least refrains from requiring an intent to threaten for \u00a7 875(c)convictions, as Elonis asks us to do. Elonis contends that proof of a defendant's intent to put the recipient of a threat in fear is necessary for conviction, but that element cannot be found within the statutory text. \"[W]e ordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face,\" including elements similar to the one Elonis proposes.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bates v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470498\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/23/#p29\">\n    522 U.S. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470498\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/23/#p29\">\n    118 S.Ct. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470498\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/23/#p29\">\n    139 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997)(declining to read an \"intent to defraud\" element into a criminal statute). As the majority correctly explains, nothing in the text of \u00a7 875(c)itself requires proof of an intent to threaten. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2008 - 2009. The absence of such a requirement is significant, as Congress knows how to require a heightened\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   in the context of threat offenses. See \u00a7 875(b)(providing for the punishment of \"[w]hoever, with intent to extort ..., transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another\"); see also \u00a7 119 (providing for the punishment of \"[w]hoever knowingly makes restricted personal information about [certain officials] ... publicly available ... with the intent to threaten\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Elonis nonetheless suggests that an intent-to-threaten element is necessary in order to avoid the risk of punishing innocent conduct. But there is nothing absurd about punishing an individual who, with knowledge of the words he uses and their ordinary meaning in context, makes a threat. For instance, a high-school student who sends a letter to his principal stating that he will massacre his classmates with a machine gun, even if he intended the letter as a joke, cannot fairly be described as engaging in innocent conduct. But see\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2006 - 2007, 2012 - 2013 (concluding that Elonis' conviction under \u00a7 875(c)for discussing a plan to \" 'initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined' \" against \" 'a Kindergarten class' \" cannot stand without proof of some unspecified heightened mental state).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Elonis also insists that we read an intent-to-threaten element into \u00a7 875(c)in light of the First Amendment. But our practice of construing statutes \"to avoid constitutional questions ... is not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature,\"\n   <em>\n    Salinas v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470644\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/52/#p59\">\n    522 U.S. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59-60,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470644\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/52/#p59\">\n    118 S.Ct. 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470644\" index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/52/#p59\">\n    139 L.Ed.2d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997)(internal quotation marks omitted), and ordinary background principles of criminal law do not support\n   rewriting \u00a7 875(c)to include an intent-to-threaten requirement.

Instead, Elonis claims that only\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   threats fall within this particular historical exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   If it were clear that intentional threats alone have been punished in our Nation since 1791, I would be inclined to agree. But that is the not the case. Although the Federal Government apparently did not get into the business of regulating threats until 1917, the States have been doing so since the late 18th and early 19th centuries. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   1795 N.J. Laws p. 108; Ill. Rev. Code of Laws, Crim. Code \u00a7 108 (1827) (1827 Ill. Crim. Code); 1832 Fla. Laws pp. 68-69. And that practice continued even after the States amended their constitutions to include speech protections similar to those in the First Amendment. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Fla. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 5 (1838); Ill. Const., Art. VIII, \u00a7 22 (1818), Mich. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 7 (1835); N.J. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 5 (1844); J. Hood, Index of Colonial and State Laws of New Jersey 1203, 1235, 1257, 1265 (1905); 1 Ill. Stat., ch. 30, div. 9, \u00a7 31 (3d ed. 1873). State practice thus provides at least some evidence of the original meaning of the phrase \"freedom of speech\" in the First Amendment. See\n   <em>\n    Roth v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160660\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/476/#p481\">\n    354 U.S. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 481-483,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160660\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/476/#p481\">\n    77 S.Ct. 1304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6160660\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/354/476/#p481\">\n    1 L.Ed.2d 1498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1957)(engaging in a similar inquiry with respect to obscenity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Shortly after the founding, several States and Territories enacted laws making it a crime to \"knowingly send or deliver any letter or writing, with or without a name subscribed thereto, or signed with a fictitious name, ... threatening to maim, wound, kill or murder any person, or to burn his or her [property], though no money, goods or chattels, or other valuable thing shall be demanded,\"\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   1795 N.J. Laws \u00a7 57, at 108; see also,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   1816 Ga. Laws p. 178; 1816 Mich. Territory Laws p. 128; 1827 Ill. Crim. Code \u00a7 108; 1832 Fla. Laws, at 68-69. These laws appear to be the closest early analogue to \u00a7 875(c), as they penalize transmitting a communication containing a threat without proof of a demand to extort something from the victim. Threat provisions explicitly requiring proof of a specific \"intent to extort\" appeared alongside these laws, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   1795 N.J. Laws \u00a7 57, at 108, but those provisions are simply the predecessors to \u00a7 875(b)and \u00a7 875(d), which likewise expressly contain an intent-to-extort requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The laws without that extortion requirement were copies of a 1754 English threat statute subject to only a general-intent requirement. The statute made it a capital\n   offense to \"knowingly send any Letter without any Name subscribed thereto, or signed with a fictitious Name ... threatening to kill or murder any of his Majesty's Subject or Subjects, or to burn their [property], though no Money or Venison or other valuable Thing shall be demanded.\" 27 Geo. II, ch. 15, in 7 Eng. Stat. at Large 61 (1754); see also 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 144 (1768) (describing this statute). Early English decisions applying this threat statute indicated that the appropriate mental state was general intent. In\n   <em>\n    King v. Girdwood,\n   </em>\n   1 Leach 142, 168 Eng. Rep. 173 (K.B. 1776), for example, the trial court instructed the jurors that, \"if they were of opinion that\" the \"terms of the letter conveyed an actual threat to kill or murder,\" \"and that the prisoner knew the contents of it, they ought to find him guilty; but that if they thought he did not know the contents, or that the words might import any thing less than to kill or murder, they ought to acquit,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 143, 168 Eng. Rep., at 173. On appeal following conviction, the judges \"thought that the case had been properly left to the Jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.,\n   </em>\n   168 Eng. Rep., at 174. Other cases likewise appeared to consider only the import of the letter's language, not the intent of its sender. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g., Rex v. Boucher,\n   </em>\n   4 Car. &amp; P. 562, 563, 172 Eng. Rep. 826, 827 (K.B. 1831) (concluding that an indictment was sufficient because \"th[e] letter very plainly conveys a threat to kill and murder\" and \"[n]o one who received it could have any doubt as to what the writer meant to threaten\"); see also 2 E. East, A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown 1116 (1806) (discussing\n   <em>\n    Jepson and Springett's Case,\n   </em>\n   in which the judges disagreed over whether \"the letter must be understood as ... importing a threat\" and whether that was \"a necessary construction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Unsurprisingly, these early English cases were well known in the legal world of the 19th century United States. For instance, Nathan Dane's A General Abridgement of American Law-\"a necessary adjunct to the library of every American lawyer of distinction,\" 1 C. Warren, History of the Harvard Law School and of Early Legal Conditions in America 414 (1908)-discussed the English threat statute and summarized decisions such as\n   <em>\n    Girdwood\n   </em>\n   . 7 N. Dane, A General Abridgement of American Law 31-32 (1824). And as this Court long ago recognized, \"It is doubtless true ... that where English statutes ... have been adopted into our own legislation; the known and settled construction of those statutes by courts of law, has been considered as silently incorporated into the acts, or has been received with all the weight of authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennock v. Dialogue,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335131\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/27/1/#p18\">\n    2 Pet. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335131\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/27/1/#p18\">\n    7 L.Ed. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1829); see also,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

In short, there is good reason to believe that States bound by their own Constitutions to protect freedom of speech long ago enacted general-intent threat statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Elonis disputes this historical analysis on two grounds, but neither is persuasive. He first points to a treatise stating that the 1754 English statute was \"levelled against such whose intention it was, (by writing such letters, either without names or in fictitious names,) to conceal themselves from the knowledge of the party threatened, that they might obtain their object by creating terror in [the victim's] mind.\" 2 W. Russell &amp; D. Davis, A Treatise on Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors 1845 (1st Am. ed. 1824). But the fact that the ordinary prosecution under this provision involved a defendant who intended to cause fear does not mean that such a mental\n   state was\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   as a matter of law. After all, \u00a7 875(c)is frequently deployed against people who wanted to cause their victims fear, but that fact does not answer the legal question presented in this case.

And his treatises do not clearly distinguish between the offense of making threats with the intent to extort and the offense of sending threatening letters without such a requirement in their discussions of threat statutes, making it difficult to draw strong inferences about the latter category. See 2 J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Criminal Law \u00a7 1201, p. 664, and nn. 5-6 (1877); 2 J.

One notes in passing that character evidence is admissible \"to prove\n   <em>\n    guilty knowledge\n   </em>\n   of the defendant, when that is an essential element of the crime; that is, the\n   <em>\n    quo animo,\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   or design,\" and offers as an example that in the context of \"sending a threatening letter, ... prior and subsequent letters to the same person are competent in order to show the intent and meaning of the particular letter in question.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

But it is unclear from that statement whether that court thought an\n   <em>\n    intent to threaten\n   </em>\n   was required, especially as the case it cited for this proposition-\n   <em>\n    Rex v. Boucher,\n   </em>\n   4 Car. &amp; P. 562, 563, 172 Eng. Rep. 826, 827 (K.B. 1831)-supports a general-intent approach.
