Those who want the State to issue a particular specialty plate may propose a plate design, comprising a slogan, a graphic, or (most commonly) both. If the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board approves the design, the State will make it available for display on vehicles registered in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, the Texas Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans proposed a\n   specialty license plate design featuring a Confederate battle flag. The Board rejected the proposal. We must decide whether that rejection violated the Constitution's free speech guarantees. See Amdts. 1, 14. We conclude that it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Texas law requires all motor vehicles operating on the State's roads to display valid license plates. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20502.001\">\n    Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 502.001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West Supp. 2014), 504.001 (2013), 504.943 (Supp. 2014). And Texas makes available several kinds of plates. Drivers may choose to display the State's general-issue license plates. See Texas Dept. of Motor Vehicles, Motor Vehicle Registration Manual 9.1 (Apr. 2015). Each of these plates contains the word \"Texas,\" a license plate number, a silhouette of the State, a graphic of the Lone Star, and the slogan \"The Lone Star State.\" Texas Dept. of Motor Vehicles, The Texas Classic FAQs (July 16, 2012), online at http://www.txdmv. gov/motorists/license-plates (all Internet materials as visited June 16, 2015, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). In the alternative, drivers may choose from an assortment of specialty license plates. \u00a7 504.008(b) (West 2013). Each of these plates contains the word \"Texas,\" a license plate number, and one of a selection of designs prepared by the State. See\n   <em>\n    ibid.\n   </em>\n   ; Specialty License Plates, http://www.txdmv.gov/motorists/license-plates/specialty-license-plates (displaying available Texas specialty plates); Create a Plate: Your Design, http://www.myplates.com/BackgroundOnly (same). Finally, Texas law provides for personalized plates (also known as vanity plates).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20217.45\">\n    43 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 217.45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(7) (2015). Pursuant to the personalization program, a vehicle owner may request a particular alphanumeric pattern for use as a plate number, such as \"BOB\" or \"TEXPL8.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here we are concerned only with the second category of plates, namely specialty license plates, not with the personalization program. Texas offers vehicle owners a variety of specialty plates, generally for an annual fee. See \u00a7 217.45(b)(2). And Texas selects the designs for specialty plates through three distinct processes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   First, the state legislature may specifically call for the development of a specialty license plate. See Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7\u00a7 504.602-504.663(West 2013 and Supp. 2014). The legislature has enacted statutes authorizing, for example, plates that say \"Keep Texas Beautiful\" and \"Mothers Against Drunk Driving,\" plates that \"honor\" the Texas citrus industry, and plates that feature an image of the World Trade Center towers and the words \"Fight Terrorism.\" See \u00a7\u00a7 504.602, 504.608, 504.626, 504.647.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, the Board may approve a specialty plate design proposal that a state-designated private vendor has created at the request of an individual or organization. See \u00a7\u00a7 504.6011(a), 504.851(a);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20217.52\">\n    43 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 217.52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Among the plates created through the private-vendor process are plates promoting the \"Keller Indians\" and plates with the slogan \"Get it Sold with RE/MAX.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, the Board \"may create new specialty license plates on its own initiative or on receipt of an application from a\" nonprofit entity seeking to sponsor a specialty plate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20504.801\">\n    Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 504.801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b). A nonprofit must include in its application \"a draft design of the specialty license plate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20217.45\">\n    43 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7 217.45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i)(2)(C). And Texas law vests in the Board authority to approve or to disapprove an application. See \u00a7 217.45(i)(7). The relevant statute says that the Board \"may refuse to create a\n   new specialty license plate\" for a number of reasons, for example \"if the design might be offensive to any member of the public ... or for any other reason established by rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20504.801\">\n    Tex. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 504.801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Specialty plates that the Board has sanctioned through this process include plates featuring the words \"The Gator Nation,\" together with the Florida Gators logo, and plates featuring the logo of Rotary International and the words \"SERVICE ABOVE SELF.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2009, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Texas Division (a nonprofit entity), applied to sponsor a specialty license plate through this last-mentioned process. SCV's application included a draft plate design. See Appendix,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   . At the bottom of the proposed plate were the words \"SONS OF CONFEDERATE VETERANS.\" At the side was the organization's logo, a square Confederate battle flag framed by the words \"Sons of Confederate Veterans 1896.\" A faint Confederate battle flag appeared in the background on the lower portion of the plate. Additionally, in the middle of the plate was the license plate number, and at the top was the State's name and silhouette. The Board's predecessor denied this application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2010, SCV renewed its application before the Board. The Board invited public comment on its website and at an open meeting. After considering the responses, including a number of letters sent by elected officials who opposed the proposal, the Board voted unanimously against issuing the plate. The Board explained that it had found \"it necessary to deny th[e] plate design application, specifically the confederate flag portion of the design, because public comments ha[d] shown that many members of the general public find the design offensive, and because such comments are reasonable.\" App. 64. The Board added \"that a significant portion of the public associate the confederate flag with organizations advocating expressions of hate directed toward people or groups that is demeaning to those people or groups.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2012, SCV and two of its officers (collectively SCV) brought this lawsuit against the chairman and members of the Board (collectively Board). SCV argued that the Board's decision violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment, and it sought an injunction requiring the Board to approve the proposed plate design. The District Court entered judgment for the Board. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.\n   <em>\n    Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. v. Vandergriff,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156713\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/388/\">\n    759 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). It held that Texas's specialty license plate designs are private speech and that the Board, in refusing to approve SCV's design, engaged in constitutionally forbidden viewpoint discrimination. The dissenting judge argued that Texas's specialty license plate designs are government speech, the content of which the State is free to control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We granted the Board's petition for certiorari, and we now reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When government speaks, it is not barred by the Free Speech Clause from determining the content of what it says.\n   <em>\n    Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    555 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 467-468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). That freedom in part reflects the fact that it is the democratic electoral process that first and foremost provides a check on government speech. See\n   <em>\n    Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508355\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/217/#p235\">\n    529 U.S. 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508355\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/217/#p235\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508355\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/217/#p235\">\n    146 L.Ed.2d 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Thus, government statements (and government\n   actions and programs that take the form of speech) do not normally trigger the First Amendment rules designed to protect the marketplace of ideas. See\n   <em>\n    Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872909\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/550/#p559\">\n    544 U.S. 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 559,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872909\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/550/#p559\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872909\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/550/#p559\">\n    161 L.Ed.2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005). Instead, the Free Speech Clause helps produce informed opinions among members of the public, who are then able to influence the choices of a government that, through words and deeds, will reflect its electoral mandate. See\n   <em>\n    Stromberg v. California,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"434002\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/283/359/#p369\">\n    283 U.S. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"434002\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/283/359/#p369\">\n    51 S.Ct. 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"434002\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/283/359/#p369\">\n    75 L.Ed. 1117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1931)(observing that \"our constitutional system\" seeks to maintain \"the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Were the Free Speech Clause interpreted otherwise, government would not work. How could a city government create a successful recycling program if officials, when writing householders asking them to recycle cans and bottles, had to include in the letter a long plea from the local trash disposal enterprise demanding the contrary? How could a state government effectively develop programs designed to encourage and provide vaccinations, if officials also had to voice the perspective of those who oppose this type of immunization? \"[I]t is not easy to imagine how government could function if it lacked th[e] freedom\" to select the messages it wishes to convey.\n   <em>\n    Summum, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We have therefore refused \"[t]o hold that the Government unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of viewpoint when it chooses to fund a program dedicated to advance certain permissible goals, because the program in advancing those goals necessarily discourages alternative goals.\"\n   <em>\n    Rust v.

We have pointed out that a contrary holding \"would render numerous Government programs constitutionally suspect.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Cf.\n   <em>\n    Keller v.

And we have made clear that \"the government can speak for itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Southworth, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 229,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9508355\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/529/217/#p235\">\n    120 S.Ct. 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That is not to say that a government's ability to express itself is without restriction.

And the Free Speech Clause itself may constrain the government's speech if, for example, the government seeks to compel private persons to convey the government's speech. But, as a general matter, when the government speaks it is entitled to promote a program, to espouse a policy, or to take a position. In doing so, it represents its citizens and it carries out its duties on their behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In our view, specialty license plates issued pursuant to Texas's statutory scheme convey government speech. Our reasoning rests primarily on our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   a recent case that presented a similar problem. We conclude here, as we did there, that our precedents regarding government speech (and not our precedents regarding forums for private speech) provide the appropriate framework through which to approach the case. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    555 U.S., at 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   we considered a religious organization's request to erect in a 2.5-acre city park a monument setting forth the organization's religious tenets.

First, history shows that \"[g]overnments have long used monuments to speak to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 470,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Stentiford, A Moving History 56 (2004) (Minard). The State presented a depiction of the head of a Hereford steer. Fox 15; Minard 56. In the years since, New Hampshire plates have featured the profile of the \"Old Man of the Mountain,\" Massachusetts plates have included a representation of the Commonwealth's famous codfish, and Wyoming plates have displayed a rider atop a bucking bronco. Minard 60, 61, 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In 1928, Idaho became the first State to include a slogan on its plates.

The brown potato did not catch on, but slogans on license plates did. Over the years, state plates have included the phrases \"North to the Future\" (Alaska), \"Keep Florida Green\" (Florida), \"Hoosier Hospitality\" (Indiana), \"The Iodine Products State\" (South Carolina), \"Green Mountains\" (Vermont), and \"America's Dairyland\" (Wisconsin). Fox 13, 29, 39, 91, 101, 109. States have used license plate slogans to urge action, to promote tourism, and to tout local industries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Texas, too, has selected various messages to communicate through its license plate designs. By 1919, Texas had begun to display the Lone Star emblem on its plates. Texas Department of Transportation, The History of Texas License Plates 9, 11 (1999). In 1936, the State's general-issue plates featured the first slogan on Texas license plates: the word \"Centennial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 20.

In 1977, Texas replaced the Lone Star with a small silhouette of the State.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 63. And in 1995, Texas plates celebrated \"150 Years of Statehood.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 101. Additionally, the Texas Legislature has specifically authorized specialty plate designs stating, among other things, \"Read to Succeed,\" \"Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo,\" \"Texans Conquer Cancer,\" and \"Girl Scouts.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20504.607\">\n    Tex.

Each Texas license plate is a government article serving the governmental purposes of vehicle registration and identification. The governmental nature of the plates is clear from their faces: The State places the name \"TEXAS\" in large letters at the top of every plate. Moreover, the State requires Texas vehicle owners to display license plates, and every Texas license plate is issued by the State. See \u00a7 504.943. Texas also owns the designs on its license plates, including the designs that Texas adopts on the basis of proposals made by private individuals and organizations. See \u00a7 504.002(3). And Texas dictates the manner in which drivers may dispose of unused plates. See \u00a7 504.901(c). See also \u00a7 504.008(g) (requiring that vehicle owners return unused specialty plates to the State).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Texas license plates are, essentially, government IDs.

If not, the individual could simply display the message in question in larger letters on a bumper sticker right next to the plate. But the individual prefers a license plate design to the purely private speech expressed through bumper stickers. That may well be because Texas's license plate designs convey government agreement with the message displayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Third, Texas maintains direct control over the messages conveyed on its specialty plates. Texas law provides that the State \"has sole control over the design, typeface, color, and alphanumeric pattern for all license plates.\" \u00a7 504.005. The Board must approve every specialty plate design proposal before the design can appear on a Texas plate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Tex.%20Admin.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20217.45\">\n    43 Tex.

Texas asserts, and SCV concedes, that the State has rejected at least a dozen proposed designs. Reply Brief 10; Tr. of Oral Arg. 49-51. Accordingly, like the city government in\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   Texas \"has 'effectively controlled' the messages [conveyed] by exercising 'final approval authority' over their selection.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    555 U.S., at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johanns,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872909\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/550/#p559\">\n    544 U.S., at 560-561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872909\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/550/#p559\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This final approval authority allows Texas to choose how to present itself and its constituency.

But it need not issue plates deriding schooling. Texas offers plates that pay tribute to the Texas citrus industry. See \u00a7 504.626. But it need not issue plates praising Florida's oranges as far better. And Texas offers plates that say \"Fight Terrorism.\" See \u00a7 504.647. But it need not issue plates promoting al Qaeda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   These considerations, taken together, convince us that the specialty plates here in question are similar enough to the monuments in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   to call for the same result. That is not to say that every element of our discussion in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   is relevant here. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   we emphasized that monuments were \"permanent\" and we observed that \"public parks can accommodate only a limited number of permanent monuments.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    555 U.S., at 464, 470, 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We believed that the speech at issue was government speech rather than private speech in part because we found it \"hard to imagine how a public park could be opened up for the installation of permanent monuments by every person or group wishing to engage in that form of expression.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 479,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, a State could theoretically offer a much larger number of license plate designs, and those designs need not be available for time immemorial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But those characteristics of the speech at issue in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   were particularly important because the government speech at issue occurred in public parks, which are traditional public forums for \"the delivery of speeches and the holding of marches and demonstrations\" by private citizens.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 478,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast,\n   license plates are not traditional public forums for private speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   And other features of the designs on Texas's specialty license plates indicate that the message conveyed by those designs is conveyed on behalf of the government. Texas, through its Board, selects each design featured on the State's specialty license plates. Texas presents these designs on government-mandated, government-controlled, and government-issued IDs that have traditionally been used as a medium for government speech. And it places the designs directly below the large letters identifying \"TEXAS\" as the issuer of the IDs. \"The [designs] that are accepted, therefore, are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message, and they thus constitute government speech.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     Id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   SCV believes that Texas's specialty license plate designs are not government speech, at least with respect to the designs (comprising slogans and graphics) that were initially proposed by private parties.

First, the State exercises final authority over each specialty license plate design. This authority militates against a determination that Texas has created a public forum.

With respect to specialty license plate designs, Texas is not simply managing government property, but instead is engaging in expressive conduct. As we have described, we reach this conclusion based on the historical context, observers' reasonable interpretation of the messages conveyed by Texas specialty plates, and the effective control that the State exerts over the design selection process. Texas's specialty license plate designs \"are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message.\"\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    555 U.S., at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They \"constitute government speech.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The fact that private parties take part in the design and propagation of a message does not extinguish the governmental nature of the message or transform the government's role into that of a mere forum-provider. In\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   private entities \"financed and donated monuments that the government accept[ed] and display[ed] to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 470-471,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, similarly, private parties propose designs that Texas may accept and display on its license plates. In this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   the \"government entity may exercise [its] freedom to express its views\" even \"when it receives assistance from private sources for the purpose of delivering a government-controlled message.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And in this case, as in\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   forum analysis is inapposite. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 480,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Of course, Texas allows many more license plate designs than the city in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   allowed monuments. But our holding in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   was not dependent on the precise number of monuments found within the park. Indeed, we indicated that the permanent displays in New York City's Central Park also constitute government speech. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 471-472,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And an\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   brief had informed us that there were, at the time, 52 such displays. See Brief for City of New York in\n   <em>\n    Pleasant Grove City v. Summum,\n   </em>\n   O.T. 2008, No. 07-665, p. 2. Further, there may well be many more messages that Texas wishes to convey through its license plates than there were messages that the city in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   wished to convey through its monuments. Texas's desire to communicate numerous messages does not mean\n   that the messages conveyed are not Texas's own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Additionally, the fact that Texas vehicle owners pay annual fees in order to display specialty license plates does not imply that the plate designs are merely a forum for private speech. While some nonpublic forums provide governments the opportunity to profit from speech, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehman v. Shaker Heights,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172836\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/298/#p299\">\n    418 U.S. 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172836\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/298/#p299\">\n    94 S.Ct. 2714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6172836\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/298/#p299\">\n    41 L.Ed.2d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974)(plurality opinion), the existence of government profit alone is insufficient to trigger forum analysis. Thus, if the city in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   had established a rule that organizations wishing to donate monuments must also pay fees to assist in park maintenance, we do not believe that the result in that case would have been any different. Here, too, we think it sufficiently clear that Texas is speaking through its specialty license plate designs, such that the existence of annual fees does not convince us that the specialty plates are a nonpublic forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Finally, we note that this case does not resemble other cases in which we have identified a nonpublic forum. This case is not like\n   <em>\n    Perry Ed. Assn.,\n   </em>\n   where we found a school district's internal mail system to be a nonpublic forum for private speech. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189226\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/37/#p45\">\n    460 U.S., at 48-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189226\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/37/#p45\">\n    103 S.Ct. 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, it was undisputed that a number of private organizations, including a teachers' union, had access to the mail system. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 39-40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189226\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/37/#p45\">\n    103 S.Ct. 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was therefore clear that private parties, and not only the government, used the system to communicate. Here, by contrast, each specialty license plate design is formally approved by and stamped with the imprimatur of Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Nor is this case like\n   <em>\n    Lehman,\n   </em>\n   where we found the advertising space on city buses to be a nonpublic forum.

There, the messages were located in a context (advertising space) that is traditionally available for private speech. And the advertising space, in contrast to license plates, bore no indicia that the speech was owned or conveyed by the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Nor is this case like\n   <em>\n    Cornelius,\n   </em>\n   where we determined that a charitable fundraising program directed at federal employees constituted a nonpublic forum.

Further, the charitable solicitations did not appear on a government ID under the government's name. In contrast to the instant case, there was no reason for employees to \"interpret [the solicitation] as conveying some message on the [government's] behalf.\"\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    555 U.S., at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Our determination that Texas's specialty license plate designs are government speech does not mean that the designs do not also implicate the free speech rights of private persons.

The Court holds that all the privately created messages on the many specialty plates issued by the State of Texas convey a government message rather than the message of the motorist displaying the plate. Can this possibly be correct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Here is a test. Suppose you sat by the side of a Texas highway and studied the license plates on the vehicles passing by. You would see, in addition to the standard Texas plates, an impressive array of specialty plates. (There are now more than 350 varieties.) You would likely observe plates that honor numerous colleges and universities. You might see plates bearing the name of a high school, a fraternity or sorority, the Masons, the Knights of Columbus, the Daughters of the American Revolution, a realty company, a favorite soft drink, a favorite burger restaurant, and a favorite NASCAR driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As you sat there watching these plates speed by, would you really think that the sentiments reflected in these specialty plates are the views of the State of Texas and not those of the owners of the cars? If a car with a plate that says \"Rather Be Golfing\" passed by at 8:30 am on a Monday morning, would you think: \"This is the official policy of the State-better to golf than to work?\" If you did your viewing at the start of the college football season and you saw Texas plates with the names of the University of Texas's out-of-state competitors in upcoming games-Notre Dame, Oklahoma State, the University of Oklahoma, Kansas State, Iowa State-would you assume that the State of Texas was officially (and perhaps treasonously) rooting for the Longhorns' opponents? And when a car zipped by with a plate that reads \"NASCAR-24 Jeff Gordon,\" would you think that Gordon (born in California, raised in Indiana, resides in North Carolina)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is the official favorite of the State government?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court says that all of these messages are government speech. It is essential that government be able to express its own viewpoint, the Court reminds us, because otherwise, how would it promote its programs, like recycling and vaccinations?\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2245 - 2246. So when Texas issues a \"Rather Be Golfing\" plate, but not a \"Rather Be Playing Tennis\" or \"Rather Be Bowling\" plate, it is furthering a state policy to promote golf but not tennis or bowling. And when Texas allows motorists to obtain a Notre Dame license plate but not a University of Southern California plate, it is taking sides in that long-time rivalry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   This capacious understanding of government speech takes a large and painful bite out of the First Amendment. Specialty plates may seem innocuous. They make motorists happy, and they put money in a State's coffers. But the precedent this case sets is dangerous. While all license plates unquestionably contain\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   government speech (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   the name of the State and the numbers and/or letters identifying\n   the vehicle), the State of Texas has converted the remaining space on its specialty plates into little mobile billboards on which motorists can display their own messages. And what Texas did here was to reject one of the messages that members of a private group wanted to post on some of these little billboards because the State thought that many of its citizens would find the message offensive. That is blatant viewpoint discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   If the State can do this with its little mobile billboards, could it do the same with big, stationary billboards? Suppose that a State erected electronic billboards along its highways. Suppose that the State posted some government messages on these billboards and then, to raise money, allowed private entities and individuals to purchase the right to post their own messages. And suppose that the State allowed only those messages that it liked or found not too controversial. Would that be constitutional?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   What if a state college or university did the same thing with a similar billboard or a campus bulletin board or dorm list serve? What if it allowed private messages that are consistent with prevailing views on campus but banned those that disturbed some students or faculty? Can there be any doubt that these examples of viewpoint discrimination would violate the First Amendment? I hope not, but the future uses of today's precedent remain to be seen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Specialty plates like those involved in this case are a recent development. License plates originated solely as a means of identifying vehicles. In 1901, New York became the first State to require automobiles to be licensed, but rather than issue license plates itself, New York required drivers to display their initials on their cars. J. Minard &amp; T. Stentiford, A Moving History 50 (2004). Two years later, Massachusetts became the first State to issue license plates. The plates said \"Mass. Automobile Register\" and displayed the vehicle's registration number.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 51. Plates of this type-featuring a registration number, the name of the State, and sometimes the date-were the standard for decades thereafter. See\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 52-94; see also generally, J. Fox, License Plates of the United States 10-99 (1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Texas license plates initially followed this pattern. When the first official state plate appeared in 1917, it featured a number and the abbreviation \"TEX.\" Texas Department of Transportation, The History of Texas License Plates 9 (1999) (History). In 1925, the year of issue was added, and the State began issuing plates that identified certain vehicle types,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \"C-M\" for commercial trucks (1925),\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 14-15; \"FARM\" for farm trucks (1935),\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 22; \"Overwidth\" (1949),\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 32; \"House Trailer\" (1951),\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 36. In 1936, a special plate with the word \"CENTENNIAL\" was created to mark the State's 100th birthday, and the first plate identifying the owner as a \"State Official\" appeared two years later.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 20, 25. Starting in the 1950's, Texas began issuing plates to identify some other registrants, such as \"Amateur Radio Operator\" (1954),\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 38, \"State Judge\" (1970)\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 64; and \"Disabled Veteran,\" (1972),\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   ., at 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A sesquicentennial plate appeared in 1985, and two years later, legislation was introduced to create a bronze license plate with 14-karat gold-plated lettering, available for a fee of $1,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 81.

The group applied for a Texas specialty license plate in 2009 and again in 2010. Their proposed design featured a controversial symbol, the Confederate battle flag, surrounded by the words \"Sons of Confederate Veterans 1896\" and a gold border. App. 29. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board (or Board) invited public comments and considered the plate design at a meeting in April 2011. At that meeting, one board member was absent, and the remaining eight members deadlocked on whether to approve the plate. The Board thus reconsidered the plate at\n   its meeting in November 2011. This time, many opponents of the plate turned out to voice objections. The Board then voted unanimously against approval and issued an order stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   \"The Board has considered the information and finds it necessary to deny this plate design application, specifically the confederate flag portion of the design, because public comments have shown that many members of the general public find the design offensive, and because such comments are reasonable. The Board finds that a significant portion of the public associate the confederate flag with organizations advocating expressions of hate directed toward people or groups that is demeaning to those people or groups.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 64-65.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Board also saw \"a compelling public interest in protecting a conspicuous mechanism for identification, such as a license plate, from degrading into a possible public safety issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 65. And it thought that the public interest required rejection of the plate design because the controversy surrounding the plate was so great that \"the design could distract or disturb some drivers to the point of being unreasonably dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   At the same meeting, the Board approved a Buffalo Soldiers plate design by a 5-to-3 vote. Proceeds from fees paid by motorists who select that plate benefit the Buffalo Soldier National Museum in Houston, which is \"dedicated primarily to preserving the legacy and honor of the African American soldier.\" Buffalo Soldier National Museum, online at http://www.buffalosoldiermuseum. com. \"Buffalo Soldiers\" is a nickname that was originally given to black soldiers in the Army's 10th Cavalry Regiment, which was formed after the Civil War, and the name was later used to describe other black soldiers. W. Leckie &amp; S. Leckie, The Buffalo Soldiers: A Narrative of the Black Cavalry in the West 21, 26-27 (2003). The original Buffalo Soldiers fought with distinction in the Indian Wars, but the \"Buffalo Soldiers\" plate was opposed by some Native Americans.

We held that the monuments represented government speech, and we identified several important factors that led to this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   First, governments have long used monuments as a means of expressing a government message. As we put it, \"[s]ince ancient\n   times, kings, emperors, and other rulers have erected statues of themselves to remind their subjects of their authority and power.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    ., at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here in the United States, important public monuments like the Statue of Liberty, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial, express principles that inspire and bind the Nation together. Thus, long experience has led the public to associate public monuments with government speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Second, there is no history of landowners allowing their property to be used by third parties as the site of large permanent monuments that do not express messages that the landowners wish to convey.

As we said in\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   governments have used monuments since time immemorial to express important government messages, and there is no history of governments giving equal space to those wishing to express dissenting views. In 1775, when a large gilded equestrian statue of King George III dominated Bowling Green, a small park in lower Manhattan,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the colonial governor surely would not have permitted the construction on that land of a monument to the fallen at Lexington and Concord. When the United States accepted the Third French Republic's gift of the Statue of Liberty in 1877, see\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    ., at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679175\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/460/#p467\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Congress, it seems safe to say, would not have welcomed a gift of a Statue of Authoritarianism if one had been offered by another country. Nor is it likely that the National Park Service today would be receptive if private groups, pointing to the Lincoln Memorial, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall, sought permission to put up monuments to Jefferson Davis, Orval Faubus, or the North Vietnamese Army. Governments have always used public monuments to express a government message, and members of the public understand this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The history of messages on license plates is quite different. After the beginning of motor vehicle registration in 1917, more than 70 years passed before the proliferation\n   of specialty plates in Texas. It was not until the 1990's that motorists were allowed to choose from among 10 messages, such as \"Read to Succeed\" and \"Keep Texas Beautiful.\" History at 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Up to this point, the words on the Texas plates can be considered government speech. The messages were created by the State, and they plausibly promoted state programs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But when, at some point within the last 20 years or so, the State began to allow private entities to secure plates conveying their own messages, Texas crossed the line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The contrast between the history of public monuments, which have been used to convey government messages for centuries, and the Texas license plate program could not be starker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In an attempt to gather historical support for its position, the Court relies on plates with the mottos or symbols of other States. As the Court notes, some of these were issued well before \"The Lone Star State\" made its debut in Texas in 1991.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 82. But this history is irrelevant for present purposes. Like the 1991 Texas plate, these out-of-state plates were created by the States that issued them, and motorists generally had no choice but to accept them. For example, the State of New Hampshire made it a crime to cover up the words \"Live Free or Die\" on its plates. See\n   <em>\n    Wooley v. Maynard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p717\">\n    430 U.S. 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p717\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p717\">\n    51 L.Ed.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The words and symbols on plates of this sort were and are government speech, but plates that are essentially commissioned by private entities (at a cost that exceeds $8,000) and that express a message chosen by those entities are very different-and quite new. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   history here does not suggest that the messages at issue are government speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Texas specialty plate program also does not exhibit the \"selective receptivity\" present in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   . To the contrary, Texas's program is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   selective by design. The Board's chairman, who is charged with approving designs, explained that the program's purpose is \"to encourage private plates\" in order to \"generate additional revenue for the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   ., 58. And most of the time, the Board \"base[s] [its] decisions on rules that primarily deal with reflectivity and readability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p717\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127286\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/430/705/#p717\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   A Department brochure explains: \"Q.

See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2249 (citing Reply Brief 10 and Tr. of Oral Arg. 49-51). But even if this happened, it shows only that the present case may not be the only one in which the State has exercised viewpoint discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Texas's only other (also extrarecord) evidence of selectivity concerns a proposed plate that was thought to create a threat to the fair enforcement of the State's motor vehicle laws. Reply Brief 9-10 (citing publicly available Transcript of Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board Meeting, Aug. 9, 2012, p. 112, online at http://www.txdmv.gov/reports-and-data/doc_download/450-2012-tran-aug9). This proposed\n   plate was a Texas DPS Troopers Foundation (Troopers) plate, proposed in 2012. The Board considered that proposed plate at an August 2012 meeting, at which it approved six other plate designs without discussion, but it rejected the Troopers plate in a deadlocked vote due to apparent concern that the plate could give the impression that those displaying it would receive favored treatment from state troopers.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., at 109-112. The constitutionality of this Board action does not necessarily turn on whether approval of this plate would have made the message government speech. If, as I believe, the Texas specialty plate program created a limited public forum, private speech may be excluded if it is inconsistent with the purpose of the forum.\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger,\n   </em>\n   515 U.S., at 829,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p829\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Thus, even if Texas's extrarecord information is taken into account, the picture here is different from that in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   . Texas does not take care to approve only those proposed plates that convey messages that the State supports. Instead, it proclaims that it is open to all private messages-except those, like the SCV plate, that would offend some who viewed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court believes that messages on privately created plates are government speech because motorists want a seal of state approval for their messages and therefore prefer plates over bumper stickers.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2248 - 2249. This is dangerous reasoning. There is a big difference between government speech (that is, speech by the government in furtherance of its programs) and governmental blessing (or condemnation) of private speech. Many private speakers in a forum would welcome a sign of government approval. But in the realm of private speech, government regulation may not favor one viewpoint over another.\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 828,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p829\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   A final factor that was important in\n   <em>\n    Summum\n   </em>\n   was space. A park can accommodate only so many permanent monuments. Often large and made of stone, monuments can last for centuries and are difficult to move. License plates, on the other hand, are small, light, mobile, and designed to last for only a relatively brief time. The only absolute limit on the number of specialty plates that a State could issue is the number of registered vehicles. The variety of available plates is limitless, too. Today Texas offers more than 350 varieties. In 10 years, might it be 3,500?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In sum, the Texas specialty plate program has none of the factors that were critical in\n   <em>\n    Summum,\n   </em>\n   and the Texas program exhibits a very important characteristic that was missing in that case: Individuals who want to display a Texas specialty plate, instead of the standard plate, must pay an increased annual registration fee. See http://www.dmv.org/tx-texas/license-plates.php. How many groups or individuals would clamor to pay $8,000 (the cost of the deposit required to create a new plate) in order to broadcast the government's message as opposed to their own? And if Texas really wants to speak out in support of, say, Iowa State University (but not the University of Iowa) or \"Young Lawyers\" (but not old ones), why must it be paid to say things that it really wants to say? The fees Texas collects pay for much more than merely the administration of the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   States have not adopted specialty license plate programs like Texas's because they are now bursting with things they want to say on their license plates. Those programs were adopted because they bring in money. Texas makes public the revenue\n   totals generated by its specialty plate program, and it is apparent that the program brings in many millions of dollars every year. See http://www.txdmv.gov/reports-and-data/doc_download/5050-specialty-plates-revenue-fy-1994-2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Texas has space available on millions of little mobile billboards. And Texas, in effect, sells that space to those who wish to use it to express a personal message-provided only that the message does not express a viewpoint that the State finds unacceptable. That is not government speech; it is the regulation of private speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   What Texas has done by selling space on its license plates is to create what we have called a limited public forum. It has allowed state property (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   motor vehicle license plates) to be used by private speakers according to rules that the State prescribes. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Good News Club v. Milford Central School,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312877\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/98/#p106\">\n    533 U.S. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106-107,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312877\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/98/#p106\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312877\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/98/#p106\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). Under the First Amendment, however, those rules cannot discriminate on the basis of viewpoint. See\n   <em>\n    Rosenberger,\n   </em>\n   515 U.S., at 829,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1564137\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/515/819/#p829\">\n    115 S.Ct. 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p800\">\n    473 U.S. 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p800\">\n    105 S.Ct. 3439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206353\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/473/788/#p800\">\n    87 L.Ed.2d 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985)). But that is exactly what Texas did here. The Board rejected Texas SCV's design, \"specifically the confederate flag portion of the design, because public comments have shown that many members of the general public find the design offensive, and because such comments are reasonable.\" App. 64. These statements indisputably demonstrate that the Board denied Texas SCV's design because of its viewpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Confederate battle flag is a controversial symbol. To the Texas Sons of Confederate Veterans, it is said to evoke the memory of their ancestors and other soldiers who fought for the South in the Civil War. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 15-16. To others, it symbolizes slavery, segregation, and hatred. Whatever it means to motorists who display that symbol and to those who see it, the flag expresses a viewpoint. The Board rejected the plate design because it concluded that many Texans would find the flag symbol offensive. That was pure viewpoint discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   If the Board's candid explanation of its reason for rejecting the SCV plate were not alone sufficient to establish this point, the Board's approval of the Buffalo Soldiers plate at the same meeting dispels any doubt. The proponents of both the SCV and Buffalo Soldiers plates saw them as honoring soldiers who served with bravery and honor in the past. To the opponents of both plates, the images on the plates evoked painful memories. The Board rejected one plate and approved the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Like these two plates, many other specialty plates have the potential to irritate and perhaps even infuriate those who see them. Texas allows a plate with the words \"Choose Life,\" but the State of New York rejected such a plate because the message \" '[is] so incredibly divisive,' \" and the Second Circuit recently sustained that decision.\n   <em>\n    Children First Foundation, Inc. v. Fiala,\n   </em>\n   --- F.3d ----, ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%202444501\">\n    2015 WL 2444501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *18 (C.A.2, May 22, 2015). Texas allows a specialty plate honoring the Boy Scouts, but the group's refusal to accept gay leaders angers some. Virginia, another State with a proliferation of specialty plates, issues plates for controversial organizations like the National Rifle Association, controversial commercial enterprises (raising tobacco and mining coal), controversial sports (fox hunting), and a professional sports team with a controversial name (the Washington Redskins). Allowing\n   States to reject specialty plates based on their potential to offend is viewpoint discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Board's decision cannot be saved by its suggestion that the plate, if allowed, \"could distract or disturb some drivers to the point of being unreasonably dangerous.\" App. 65. This rationale cannot withstand strict scrutiny. Other States allow specialty plates with the Confederate Battle Flag,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Texas has not pointed to evidence that these plates have led to incidents of road rage or accidents. Texas does not ban bumper stickers bearing the image of the Confederate battle flag. Nor does it ban any of the many other bumper stickers that convey political messages and other messages that are capable of exciting the ire of those who loathe the ideas they express.

Texas cannot forbid private speech based on its viewpoint. That is what it did here. Because the Court approves this violation of the First Amendment, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   APPENDIX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Sample Texas Specialty Plates\n   All found at http://txdmv.gov/motorists/license-plates/specialty-license-plates\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    Elliot, Shifting Gears, Forbes Life, Oct. 2013, pp. 55, 57.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    The Appendix,\n    <em>\n     infra,\n    </em>\n    reproduces the available specialty plates mentioned throughout this opinion in order of first reference.
