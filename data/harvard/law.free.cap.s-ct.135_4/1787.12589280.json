Like many other States, Maryland taxes the income its residents earn both within and outside the State, as well as the income that nonresidents earn from sources within Maryland. But unlike most other States, Maryland does not offer its residents a full credit against the income taxes that they pay to other States. The effect of this scheme is that some of the income earned by Maryland residents outside the State is taxed twice. Maryland's scheme creates an incentive for taxpayers to opt for intrastate rather than interstate economic activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We have long held that States cannot subject corporate income to tax schemes similar to Maryland's, and we see no reason why income earned by individuals should be treated less favorably. Maryland admits that its law has the same economic effect as a state tariff, the quintessential evil targeted by the dormant Commerce Clause. We therefore affirm the decision of Maryland's highest court and hold that this feature of the State's tax scheme violates the Federal Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Maryland, like most States, raises revenue in part by levying a personal income tax. The income tax that Maryland imposes upon its own residents has two parts: a \"state\" income tax, which is set at a graduated rate, Md. Tax-Gen. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-105(a)(Supp.2014), and a so-called \"county\" income tax, which is set at a rate that varies by county but is capped at 3.2%, \u00a7\u00a7 10-103, 10-106 (2010). Despite the names that Maryland has assigned to these taxes, both are State taxes, and both are collected by the State's Comptroller of the Treasury.\n   <em>\n    Frey v. Comptroller of Treasury,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702189\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/111/#p125\">\n    422 Md. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 125, 141-142,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702189\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/111/#p125\">\n    29 A.3d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483, 492 (2011). Of course, some Maryland residents earn income in other States, and some of those States also tax this income. If Maryland residents pay income tax to another jurisdiction for income earned there, Maryland allows them a credit against the \"state\" tax but not the \"county\" tax. \u00a7 10-703;\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718237\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/147/#p156\">\n    431 Md. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156-157,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718237\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/147/#p156\">\n    64 A.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458 (2013)(case below). As a result, part of the income that a Maryland resident earns outside the State may be taxed twice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Maryland also taxes the income of nonresidents. This tax has two parts. First, nonresidents must pay the \"state\" income tax on all the income that they earn from sources within Maryland. \u00a7\u00a7 10-105(d)(Supp.2014), 10-210 (2010). Second, nonresidents not subject to the county tax must pay a \"special nonresident tax\" in lieu of the \"county\" tax. \u00a7 10-106.1;\n   <em>\n    Frey, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 125-126,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702189\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/422/111/#p125\">\n    29 A.3d, at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"special nonresident tax\" is levied on income earned from sources within Maryland, and its rate is \"equal to the lowest county income tax rate set by any Maryland county.\" \u00a7 10-106.1. Maryland does not tax the income that nonresidents earn from sources outside Maryland. See \u00a7 10-210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Respondents Brian and Karen Wynne are Maryland residents. In 2006, the relevant tax year, Brian Wynne owned stock in Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc., a Subchapter S corporation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That year, Maxim earned income in States other than Maryland, and it filed state income tax returns in 39 States. The Wynnes earned income passed through to them from Maxim. On their 2006 Maryland tax return, the Wynnes claimed an income tax credit for income taxes paid to other States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioner, the Maryland State Comptroller of the Treasury, denied this claim and assessed a tax deficiency. In accordance with Maryland law, the Comptroller allowed the Wynnes a credit against their Maryland \"state\" income tax but not against their \"county\" income tax. The Hearings and Appeals Section of the Comptroller's Office slightly modified the assessment but otherwise affirmed. The Maryland Tax Court also affirmed, but the Circuit Court for Howard County reversed on the ground that Maryland's tax system violated the Commerce Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718237\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/147/#p156\">\n    431 Md. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718237\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/147/#p156\">\n    64 A.3d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court of Appeals held that the tax failed both the fair apportionment and nondiscrimination parts of the\n   <em>\n    Complete Auto\n   </em>\n   test. With respect to fair apportionment, the court first held that the tax failed the \"internal consistency\" test because if every State adopted Maryland's tax scheme, interstate commerce would be taxed at a higher rate than intrastate commerce. It then held that the tax failed the \"external consistency\" test because it created a risk of multiple taxation. With respect to nondiscrimination, the court held that the tax discriminated against interstate commerce because it denied residents a credit on income taxes paid to other States and so taxed income earned interstate at a rate higher than income earned intrastate. The court thus concluded that Maryland's tax scheme was unconstitutional insofar as it denied the Wynnes a credit against the \"county\" tax for income taxes they paid to other States. Two judges dissented and argued that the tax did not violate the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals later issued a brief clarification that \"[a] state may avoid discrimination against interstate commerce by providing a tax credit, or some other method of apportionment, to avoid discriminating against interstate commerce in violation of the dormant\n   Commerce Clause.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718237\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/147/#p156\">\n    431 Md., at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3718237\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/431/147/#p156\">\n    64 A.3d, at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We granted certiorari. 572 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12706631,12706634,12706635,12706636,12706637,12581811,12581812,12581813,12581814,12581815,12581816,12706653\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2660/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582022,12706631,12582023,12706634,12706635,12706636,12706637,12581811,12581812,12581813,12581815,12581816,12706620,12706621\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/189/208/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Commerce Clause grants Congress power to \"regulate Commerce ... among the several States.\" Art.

As the Solicitor General puts it, individuals \"reap the benefits of local roads, local police and fire protection, local public schools, [and] local health and welfare benefits.\" Brief for United States as\n   <em>\n    Amicus Curiae\n   </em>\n   30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This argument fails because corporations also benefit heavily from state and local services. Trucks hauling a corporation's supplies and goods, and vehicles transporting its employees, use local roads. Corporations call upon local police and fire departments to protect their facilities. Corporations rely on local schools to educate prospective employees, and the availability of good schools and other government services are features that may aid a corporation in attracting and retaining employees. Thus, disparate treatment of corporate and personal income cannot be justified based on the state services enjoyed by these two groups of taxpayers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The sole remaining attribute that, in the view of petitioner, distinguishes a corporation from an individual for present purposes is the right of the individual to vote.

The argument is that this Court need not be concerned about state laws that burden the interstate activities of individuals because those individuals can lobby and vote against legislators who support such measures. But if a State's tax unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce, it is invalid regardless of whether the plaintiff is a resident voter or nonresident of the State.

It is likely that only a distinct minority of a State's residents earns income out of State. Schemes that discriminate against income earned in other States may be attractive to legislators and a majority of their constituents for precisely this reason. It is even more farfetched to suggest that natural persons with out-of-state income are better able to influence state lawmakers than large corporations headquartered in the State. In short, petitioner's argument would leave no security where the majority of voters prefer protectionism at the expense of the few who earn income interstate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It would be particularly incongruous in the present case to disregard our prior decisions regarding the taxation of corporate income because the income at issue here is a type of corporate income, namely, the income of a Subchapter S corporation.

This practice, however, was by no means universal. A great many States-such as Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, and Maryland-had early income tax schemes that allowed their residents a credit against taxes paid to other States. See Ala.Code, Tit. 51, ch. 17, \u00a7 390 (1940); Colo. Stat. Ann., ch. 84A, \u00a7 38 (Cum. Supp. 1951); Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 92-3111 (1974); Carroll's Ky. Stat. Ann., ch. 108, Art. XX, \u00a7 4281b-15 (Baldwin rev. 1936); Md. Ann.Code, Art. 81, ch. 277, \u00a7 231 (1939). Other States also adopted internally consistent tax schemes. For example, Massachusetts and Utah taxed only the income of residents, not nonresidents. See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 62 (1932); Utah Rev. Stat. \u00a7 80-14-1\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (1933).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In any event, it is hardly surprising that these early state ventures into the taxation of income included some protectionist regimes that favored the local economy over interstate commerce. What is much more significant is that over the next century, as our Commerce Clause jurisprudence developed, the States have almost entirely abandoned that approach, perhaps in recognition of their doubtful constitutionality. Today, the near-universal state practice is to provide credits against personal income taxes for such taxes paid to other States. See 2 J. Hellerstein &amp; W. Hellerstein, State Taxation, \u00b6 20.10, pp. 20-163 to 20-164 (3d ed. 2003).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   F\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As previously noted, the tax schemes held to be unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    J.D.

Assume that every State imposed the following taxes, which are similar to Maryland's \"county\" and \"special nonresident\" taxes: (1) a 1.25% tax on income that residents earn in State, (2) a 1.25% tax on income that residents earn in other jurisdictions, and (3) a 1.25% tax on income that nonresidents earn in State. Assume further that two taxpayers, April and Bob, both live in State A, but that April earns her income in State A whereas Bob earns his income in State B. In this circumstance, Bob will pay more income tax than April solely\n   because he earns income interstate. Specifically, April will have to pay a 1.25% tax only once, to State A. But Bob will have to pay a 1.25% tax twice: once to State A, where he resides, and once to State B, where he earns the income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Critically-and this dispels a central argument made by petitioner and the principal dissent-the Maryland scheme's discriminatory treatment of interstate commerce is not simply the result of its interaction with the taxing schemes of other States. Instead, the internal consistency test reveals what the undisputed economic analysis shows: Maryland's tax scheme is inherently discriminatory and operates as a tariff. See Brief for Tax Economists 4, 9; Brief for Knoll &amp; Mason 2. This identity between Maryland's tax and a tariff is fatal because tariffs are \"[t]he paradigmatic example of a law discriminating against interstate commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    West Lynn,\n   </em>\n   512 U.S., at 193,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39942\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/186/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, when asked about the foregoing analysis made by\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   Tax Economists and Knoll &amp; Mason, counsel for Maryland responded, \"I don't dispute the mathematics. They lose me when they switch from tariffs to income taxes.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 9. But Maryland has offered no reason why our analysis should change because we deal with an income tax rather than a formal tariff, and we see none. After all, \"tariffs against the products of other States are so patently unconstitutional that our cases reveal not a single attempt by any State to enact one. Instead, the cases are filled with state laws that aspire to reap some of the benefits of tariffs by other means.\"\n   <em>\n    West Lynn, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 193,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39942\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/186/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   None of our dissenting colleagues dispute this economic analysis. The principal dissent focuses instead on a supposed \"oddity\" with our analysis: The principal dissent can envision other tax schemes that result in double taxation but do not violate the internal consistency test. This would happen, the principal dissent points out, if State A taxed only based on residence and State B taxed only based on source.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1822 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); see also\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1810 - 1811 (SCALIA, J., dissenting). Our prior decisions have already considered and rejected this precise argument-and for good reason. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Armco,\n   </em>\n   we struck down an internally inconsistent tax that posed a risk of double taxation even though we recognized that there might be other permissible arrangements that would result in double taxation.

In this case, the internal consistency test and economic analysis-indeed, petitioner's own concession-confirm that the tax scheme operates as a tariff and discriminates against interstate commerce, and so the scheme is invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Petitioner and the principal dissent,\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1816, also note that by offering residents who earn income in interstate commerce a credit against the \"state\" portion of the income tax, Maryland actually receives less tax revenue from residents who earn income from interstate commerce rather than intrastate commerce. This argument is a red herring. The critical point is that the total tax burden on interstate commerce is higher, not that Maryland may receive more or less tax revenue from a particular taxpayer. See\n   <em>\n    Armco, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 642-645,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6205320\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/638/#p642\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Maryland's tax unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce, and it is thus invalid regardless of how much a particular taxpayer must pay to the taxing State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Once again, a simple hypothetical illustrates the point. Assume that State A imposes a 5% tax on the income that its residents earn in-state but a 10% tax on income they earn in other jurisdictions. Assume also that State A happens to grant a credit against income taxes paid to other States. Such a scheme discriminates against interstate commerce because it taxes income earned interstate at a higher rate than income earned intrastate. This is so despite the fact that, in certain circumstances, a resident of State A who earns income interstate may pay less tax to State A than a neighbor who earns income intrastate. For example, if Bob lives in State A but earns his income in State B, which has a 6% income tax rate, Bob would pay a total tax of 10% on his income, though 6% would go to State B and (because of the credit) only 4% would go to State A. Bob would thus pay less to State A than his neighbor, April, who lives in State A and earns all of her income there, because April would pay a 5% tax to State A. But Bob's tax burden to State A is irrelevant; his total tax burden is what matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The principal dissent is left with two arguments against the internal consistency test. These arguments are inconsistent with each other and with our precedents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   First, the principal dissent claims that the analysis outlined above requires a State taxing based on residence to \"recede\" to a State taxing based on source.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1813 - 1814. We establish no such rule of priority. To be sure, Maryland could remedy the infirmity in its tax scheme by offering, as most States do, a credit against income taxes paid to other States. See\n   <em>\n    Tyler Pipe, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 245-246, and n. 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28129\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/232/#p259\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If it did, Maryland's tax scheme would survive the internal consistency test and would not be inherently discriminatory. Tweak our first hypothetical,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1803 - 1804, and assume that all States impose a 1.25% tax on all three categories of income but also allow a credit against income taxes that\n   residents pay to other jurisdictions. In that circumstance, April (who lives and works in State A) and Bob (who lives in State A but works in State B) would pay the same tax. Specifically, April would pay a 1.25% tax only once (to State A), and Bob would pay a 1.25% tax only once (to State B, because State A would give him a credit against the tax he paid to State B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   But while Maryland could cure the problem with its current system by granting a credit for taxes paid to other States, we do not foreclose the possibility that it could comply with the Commerce Clause in some other way. See Brief for Tax Economists 32; Brief for Knoll &amp; Mason 28-30. Of course, we do not decide the constitutionality of a hypothetical tax scheme that Maryland might adopt because such a scheme is not before us. That Maryland's existing tax unconstitutionally discriminates against interstate commerce is enough to decide this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, the principal dissent finds a \"deep flaw\" with the possibility that \"Maryland could eliminate the inconsistency [with its tax scheme] by terminating the special nonresident tax-a measure that would not help the Wynnes at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1822. This second objection refutes the first. By positing that Maryland could remedy the unconstitutionality of its tax scheme by eliminating the special nonresident tax, the principal dissent accepts that Maryland's desire to tax based on residence need not \"recede\" to another State's desire to tax based on source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Moreover, the principal dissent's supposed flaw is simply a truism about every case under the dormant Commerce Clause (not to mention the Equal Protection Clause): Whenever government impermissibly treats like cases differently, it can cure the violation by either \"leveling up\" or \"leveling down.\" Whenever a State impermissibly taxes interstate commerce at a higher rate than intrastate commerce, that infirmity could be cured by lowering the higher rate, raising the lower rate, or a combination of the two. For this reason, we have concluded that \"a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination.\"\n   <em>\n    McKesson Corp. v.

See\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 1808 - 1809. Nor does he dispute the fact that the Maryland tax scheme is tantamount to\n   a tariff on work done out of State.

I, \u00a7 10, cl. 2). But he does not explain why, under his interpretation of the Constitution, the Import-Export Clause would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant Commerce Clause.

He notes that some States imposed income taxes at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and he observes that \"[t]here is no indication that those early state income tax schemes provided credits for income taxes paid elsewhere.\"\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1812 (dissenting opinion). \"It seems highly implausible,\" he writes, \"that those who ratified the Commerce Clause understood it to conflict with the income tax laws of their States and nonetheless adopted it without a word of concern.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   This argument is plainly unsound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   First, because of the difficulty of interstate travel, the number of individuals who earned income out of State in 1787 was surely very small. (We are unaware of records showing, for example, that it was common in 1787 for workers to commute to Manhattan from New Jersey by rowboat or from Connecticut by stagecoach.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, Justice THOMAS has not shown that the small number of individuals who earned income out of State were taxed twice on that income. A number of Founding-era income tax schemes appear to have taxed only the income of residents, not nonresidents. For example, in his report to Congress on direct taxes, Oliver Wolcott, Jr., Secretary of Treasury, describes Delaware's income tax as being imposed only on \"the inhabitants of this State,\" and he makes no mention of the taxation of nonresidents' income. Report to 4th Cong., 2d Sess. (1796), concerning Direct Taxes, in 1 American State Papers, Finance 429 (1832). Justice THOMAS likewise understands that the Massachusetts and Delaware income taxes were imposed only on residents.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1812, n. These tax schemes, of course, pass the internal consistency test. Moreover, the difficulty of administering an income tax on nonresidents would have diminished the likelihood of double taxation. See R. Blakey, State Income Taxation 1 (1930).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Third, even if some persons were taxed twice, it is unlikely that this was a matter of such common knowledge that it must have been known by the delegates to the State ratifying conventions who voted to adopt the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Justice SCALIA, with whom Justice THOMASjoins as to Parts I and II, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Court holds unconstitutional Maryland's refusal to give its residents full credits against income taxes paid to other States. It does this by invoking the negative Commerce Clause, a judge-invented rule under which judges may set aside state laws that they think impose too much of a burden upon interstate commerce. I join the principal dissent, which demonstrates the incompatibility of this decision\n   with our prior negative Commerce Clause cases.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1813 - 1821 (opinion of GINSBURG, J.). Incompatibility, however, is not the test for me-though what is incompatible with our cases\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   fails my test as well, as discussed briefly in Part III below.

It contains only a Commerce Clause. Unlike the negative Commerce Clause adopted by the judges, the real Commerce Clause adopted by the People merely empowers Congress to \"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\" Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. The Clause says nothing about prohibiting state laws that burden commerce. Much less does it say anything about authorizing judges to set aside state laws\n   <em>\n    they believe\n   </em>\n   burden commerce. The clearest sign that the negative Commerce Clause is a judicial fraud is the utterly illogical holding that congressional consent enables States to enact laws that would otherwise constitute impermissible burdens upon interstate commerce.

And the doctrine in any event is not quite as old as the Court makes it seem. The idea that the Commerce Clause of its own force limits state power \"finds no expression\" in discussions surrounding the Constitution's ratification. F. Frankfurter, The Commerce Clause Under Marshall, Taney and Waite 13 (1937).

This line of reasoning forgets that interpretation requires heeding more than the Constitution's purposes; it requires heeding the means the Constitution uses to achieve those purposes. The Constitution addresses the evils of local impediments to commerce by prohibiting States from imposing certain especially burdensome taxes\n   -\"Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports\" and \"Dut[ies] of Tonnage\"-without congressional consent. Art. I, \u00a7 10, cls. 2-3. It also addresses these evils by giving Congress a commerce power under which\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   may prohibit other burdensome taxes and laws. As the Constitution's text shows, however, it does not address these evils by empowering the\n   <em>\n    judiciary\n   </em>\n   to set aside state taxes and laws that\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   deems too burdensome. By arrogating this power anyway, our negative Commerce Clause cases have disrupted the balance the Constitution strikes between the goal of protecting commerce and competing goals like preserving local autonomy and promoting democratic responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The failings of negative Commerce Clause doctrine go beyond its lack of a constitutional foundation, as today's decision well illustrates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   1. One glaring defect of the negative Commerce Clause is its lack of governing principle. Neither the Constitution nor our legal traditions offer guidance about how to separate improper state interference with commerce from permissible state taxation or regulation of commerce.

How did this exercise in counterfactuals find its way into our basic charter? The test, it is true, bears some resemblance to Kant's first formulation of the categorical imperative: \"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law\" without contradiction. Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals 30 (J. Ellington transl. 3d ed. 1993). It bears no resemblance, however, to anything in the text or structure of the Constitution. Nor can one discern an obligation of internal consistency from our legal traditions, which show that States have been imposing internally inconsistent taxes for quite a while-until recently with our approval.

A final defect of our Synthetic Commerce Clause cases is their incompatibility with the judicial role. The doctrine does not call upon us to perform a conventional judicial function, like interpreting a legal text, discerning a legal tradition, or even applying a stable body of precedents. It instead requires us to balance the needs of commerce against the needs of state governments. That is a task for legislators, not judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Today's enterprise of eliminating double taxation puts this problem prominently on display. The one sure way to eliminate all double taxation is to prescribe uniform national tax rules-for example, to allow taxation of income only where earned. But a program of prescribing a national tax code plainly exceeds the judicial competence. (It may even exceed the legislative competence to come up with a uniform code that accounts for the many political and economic differences among the\n   States.) As an alternative, we could consider whether a State's taxes in practice overlap too much with the taxes of other States. But any such approach would drive us \"to the perplexing inquiry, so unfit for the judicial department, what degree of taxation is the legitimate use, and what degree may amount to an abuse of power.\"\n   <em>\n    McCulloch v. Maryland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"287\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p430\">\n    4 Wheat. 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 430,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4702\" index=\"288\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/17/316/#p430\">\n    4 L.Ed. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1819). The Court today chooses a third approach, prohibiting States from imposing internally inconsistent taxes.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1802. But that rule avoids double taxation only in the hypothetical world where all States adopt the same internally consistent tax, not in the real world where different States might adopt different internally consistent taxes. For example, if Maryland imposes its income tax on people who live in Maryland regardless of where they work (one internally consistent scheme), while Virginia imposes its income tax on people who work in Virginia regardless of where they live (another internally consistent scheme), Marylanders who work in Virginia\n   <em>\n    still\n   </em>\n   face double taxation.\n   <em>\n    Post,\n   </em>\n   at 1801 - 1802. Then again, it is only fitting that the Imaginary Commerce Clause would lead to imaginary benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For reasons of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis,\n   </em>\n   I will vote to set aside a tax under the negative Commerce Clause if (but only if) it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce or cannot be distinguished from a tax this Court has already held unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    American Trucking Assns.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209338\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/429/\">\n    545 U.S., at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209338\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/429/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). The income tax before us does not discriminate on its face against interstate commerce; a resident pays no less to Maryland when he works in Maryland than when he works elsewhere. Neither is the tax before us indistinguishable from one that we have previously held unconstitutional. To the contrary, as the principal dissent establishes, our prior cases validate this tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Maryland's refusal to give residents full tax credits against income taxes paid to other States has its disadvantages. It threatens double taxation and encourages residents to work in Maryland. But Maryland's law also has its advantages. It allows the State to collect equal revenue from taxpayers with equal incomes, avoids the administrative burdens of verifying tax payments to other States, and ensures that every resident pays the State at least some income tax. Nothing in the Constitution precludes Maryland from deciding that the benefits of its tax scheme are worth the costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Justice THOMAS, with whom Justice SCALIAjoins except as to the first paragraph, dissenting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \"I continue to adhere to my view that the negative Commerce Clause has no basis in the text of the Constitution, makes little sense, and has proved virtually unworkable in application, and, consequently, cannot serve as a basis for striking down a state statute.\"\n   <em>\n    McBurney v.

A taxpayer living in one State and working in another gains protection and benefits from both-and so can be called upon to share in the costs of both States' governments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   States deciding whether to tax residents' entire worldwide income must choose between legitimate but competing tax policy objectives. A State might prioritize obtaining equal contributions from those who benefit from the State's protection in roughly similar ways. Or a State might prioritize ensuring that its taxpayers are not subject to double taxation. A State cannot, however, accomplish both objectives at once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   To illustrate, consider the Wynnes. Under the tax scheme in place in 2006, other Howard County residents who earned their income in-state but who otherwise had the same tax profile as the Wynnes (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   $2.67 million in taxable net income) owed the same amount of taxes\n   <em>\n    to Maryland\n   </em>\n   as the Wynnes. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-56. The scheme thus ensured that all residents with similar access to the State's protection and benefits and similar ability to pay made equal contributions to the State to defray the costs of those benefits. Maryland could not achieve that objective, however, without exposing the Wynnes to a risk of double taxation. Conversely, the Court prioritizes reducing the risk that the Wynnes' income will be taxed twice by two different States. But that choice comes at a cost: The Wynnes enjoyed equal access to the State's services but will have paid $25,000 less to cover the costs of those services than similarly situated neighbors who earned their income entirely within the State. See Pet. for Cert. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   States confront the same trade-off when deciding whether to tax nonresidents' entire in-state income. A State can require all residents and nonresidents who work within the State under its protection to contribute equally to the cost of that protection. Or the State can seek to avoid exposing its workers to any risk of double taxation. But it cannot achieve both objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   For at least a century, responsibility for striking the right balance between these two policy objectives has belonged to the States (and Congress), not this Court. Some States have chosen the same balance the Court embraces today. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1801. But since almost the dawn of the modern era of state income taxation, other States have taken the same approach as Maryland does now, taxing residents' entire income, wherever earned, while at the same time taxing nonresidents' entire in-state income. And recognizing that \"[p]rotection, benefit, and power over [a taxpayer's income] are not confined to either\" the State of residence or the State in which income is earned, this Court has long afforded States that flexibility.\n   <em>\n    Curry v.

This history of States imposing and this Court upholding income tax schemes materially identical to the one the Court confronts here should be the beginning and end of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The modern era of state income taxation dates from a Wisconsin tax enacted in 1911. See 1911 Wis. Laws ch. 658; R.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Blakey, State Income Taxation 1 (1930). From close to the start of this modern era, States have taxed residents and nonresidents in ways materially indistinguishable from the way Maryland does now. In 1915, for example, Oklahoma began taxing residents' \"entire net income ... arising or accruing from\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   sources,\" while at the same time taxing nonresidents' \"entire net income from [sources] in th[e] State.\" 1915 Okla. Sess. Laws ch. 164, \u00a7 1, pp. 232-233 (emphasis added). Like Maryland today, Oklahoma provided no credit to either residents or nonresidents for taxes paid elsewhere. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   ch. 164, \u00a7 1\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   at 232-237. In 1917, neighboring Missouri adopted a similar scheme: Residents owed taxes on their \"entire net income ... from\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   sources\" and nonresidents owed taxes on their \"entire net income ... from all sources within th[e] state.\" 1917 Mo. Laws \u00a7 1(a), pp. 524-525 (emphasis added). Missouri too provided neither residents nor nonresidents a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   at 524-538. Thus, much like Maryland today, these early income tax adopters simultaneously taxed residents on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   income, wherever earned, and nonresidents on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   income earned within the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Almost immediately, this Court began issuing what became a long series of decisions, repeatedly upholding States' authority to tax both residents' worldwide income and nonresidents' in-state income.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maguire v.

Moreover, the Court has rejected challenges to taxes that flunk the test.

The Court did so, satisfied that there was a sufficiently close connection between the tax at issue and the local conduct that triggered the tax. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209338\" index=\"467\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/429/\">\n     ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The logic of\n   <em>\n    ATA II,\n   </em>\n   counsel for the Wynnes appeared to recognize, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 46-47, would permit a State to impose a head tax-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a flat charge imposed on every resident in the State-even if that tax were part of an internally inconsistent tax scheme. Such a tax would rest on purely local conduct: the taxpayer's residence in the taxing State. And the taxes paid would defray costs closely connected to that local conduct-the services used by the taxpayer while living in the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   I see no reason why the Constitution requires us to disarm States from using a progressive tax, rather than a flat toll, to cover the costs of local services all residents enjoy. A head tax and a residence-based income tax differ, do they not, only in that the latter is measured by each taxpayer's ability to pay. Like the head tax, however, a residence-based income tax is triggered by the purely local conduct of residing in the State. And also like the head tax, a residence-based income tax covers costs closely connected to that residence: It finances services used by those living in the State. If a head tax qualifies for\n   <em>\n    ATA II'\n   </em>\n   s reprieve from internal consistency, then so too must a residence-based income tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The majority asserts that because Maryland's tax scheme is internally inconsistent, it \"operates as a tariff,\" making it \" 'patently unconstitutional.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1803 - 1804. This is a curious claim. The defining characteristic of a tariff is that it taxes interstate activity at a higher rate than it taxes the same activity conducted within the State. See\n   <em>\n    West Lynn Creamery,\n   </em>\n   512 U.S., at 193,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39942\" index=\"468\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/186/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Maryland's resident income tax does the exact\n   opposite: It taxes the income of its residents at precisely the same rate, whether the income is earned in-state or out-of-state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   There is, moreover, a deep flaw in the Court's chosen test. The Court characterizes internal consistency as a \"cure,\"\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1801 - 1802, 1805 - 1806, but the test is scarcely that, at least for the double taxation the Court believes to justify its intervention. According to the Court, Maryland's tax \"scheme\" is internally inconsistent because Maryland simultaneously imposes two taxes: the county income tax and the special nonresident tax. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1795, 1803 - 1804, and n. 8. But only one of these taxes-the county income tax-actually falls on the Wynnes. Because it is the interaction between these two taxes that renders Maryland's tax scheme internally inconsistent, Maryland could eliminate the inconsistency by terminating the special nonresident tax-a measure that would not help the Wynnes at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Maryland could, in other words, bring itself into compliance with the test at the heart of the Court's analysis without removing the double tax burden the test is purportedly designed to \"cure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   To illustrate this oddity, consider the Court's \"simple example\" of April (who lives and works in State A) and Bob (who lives in State A, but works in State B).\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1803 - 1804, 1805 - 1806. Both States fail the internal consistency test because they impose (1) a 1.25% tax on income that residents earn in-state, (2) a 1.25% tax on income that residents earn in other jurisdictions, and (3) a 1.25% tax on income that nonresidents earn in-state. According to the Court, these tax schemes are troubling because \"Bob will pay more income tax than April solely because he earns income interstate.\"\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1804.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Each State, however, need not pursue the same approach to make their tax schemes internally consistent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 25-26. State A might choose to tax residents' worldwide income only, which it could do by eliminating tax # 3 (on nonresidents' in-state income). State B might instead choose exclusively to tax income earned within the State by deleting tax # 2 (on residents' out-of-state income). Each State's tax scheme would then be internally consistent. But the tax burden on April and Bob would remain unchanged: Just as under the original schemes, April would have to pay a 1.25% tax only once, to State A, and Bob would have to pay a 1.25% tax twice: once to State A, where he resides, and once to State B, where he earns the income. The Court's \"cure,\" in other words, is no match for the perceived disease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The Court asserts that this flaw is just a \"truism\" of every discrimination case, whether brought under the dormant Commerce Clause or the Equal Protection Clause.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 1806. That is simply incorrect. As the Court acknowledges, a government that impermissibly \"treats like cases differently\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   discriminates) can ordinarily cure the violation either by \"leveling up\" or \"leveling down.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Consider another April and Bob example. If Bob must pay a 10% tax and April must pay a 5% tax, that discrimination can be eliminated either by requiring both to pay the 10% tax (\"leveling up\")\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   by requiring both to pay the 5% tax (\"leveling down\"). True, \"leveling up\" leaves Bob's tax bill unchanged. \"Leveling up\" nonetheless benefits Bob because it eliminates the unfairness of being treated differently. And if, as is often true in dormant Commerce Clause cases, April and Bob compete in the same market, then \"leveling up\" provides the concrete benefit of placing a new burden on Bob's competitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   The majority's rule does not work this way. As just explained, Maryland can \"cure\" what the majority deems discrimination without lowering the Wynnes' taxes\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   increasing the tax burden on any of the Wynnes' neighbors-by terminating the special nonresident tax. See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1821 - 1822. The State can, in other words, satisfy the majority not by lowering Bob's taxes or by raising April's taxes, but by eliminating the taxes imposed on yet a third taxpayer (say, Cathy). The Court's internal consistency test thus scarcely resembles \"ordinary\" anti-discrimination law. Whatever virtue the internal consistency test has in other contexts, this shortcoming makes it a poor excuse for jettisoning taxation principles as entrenched as those here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   This case is, at bottom, about policy choices: Should States prioritize ensuring that all who live or work within the State shoulder their fair share of the costs of government? Or must States prioritize avoidance of double taxation? As I have demonstrated,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 1821 - 1823, achieving even the latter goal is beyond this Court's competence. Resolving the competing tax policy considerations this case implicates is something the Court is even less well equipped to do. For a century, we have recognized that state legislatures and the Congress are constitutionally assigned and institutionally better equipped to balance such issues. I would reverse, so that we may leave that task where it belongs.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience of the reader.
