Only if the state court's decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\" or \"was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented,\" may a federal court grant habeas relief premised on a federal claim previously adjudicated on the merits in state court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This task is straightforward when the last state court to decide a claim has issued an opinion explaining its decision.

And\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   confirms that it matters not whether the state court exercised mandatory or discretionary review. Although\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   required a federal habeas court to presume that an unexplained summary affirmance adjudicated the merits of any federal claim presented to the state court,\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   cited\n   <em>\n    Ylst\n   </em>\n   as an example of how this \"presumption may be overcome.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    562 U.S., at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In short,\n   <em>\n    Richter\n   </em>\n   instructs that federal habeas courts should continue to \"look through\" even nondiscretionary adjudications to determine whether a claim was procedurally defaulted.
