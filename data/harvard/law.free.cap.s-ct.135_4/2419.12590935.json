The Government then sells, allocates, or otherwise disposes of the raisins in ways it determines are best suited to maintaining an orderly market. The question is whether the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment bars the Government from imposing such a demand on the growers without just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to promulgate \"marketing orders\" to help maintain stable markets for particular agricultural products. The marketing order for raisins requires growers in certain years to give a percentage of their crop to the Government, free of charge. The required allocation is determined by the Raisin Administrative Committee, a Government entity composed largely of growers and others in the raisin business appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture. In 2002-2003, this Committee ordered raisin growers to turn over 47 percent of their crop. In 2003-2004, 30 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Growers generally ship their raisins to a raisin \"handler,\" who physically separates the raisins due the Government (called \"reserve raisins\"), pays the growers only for the remainder (\"free-tonnage raisins\"), and packs and sells the free-tonnage raisins. The Raisin Committee acquires title to the reserve raisins that have been set aside, and decides how to dispose of them in its discretion. It sells them in noncompetitive markets, for example to exporters, federal agencies, or foreign governments; donates them to charitable causes; releases them to growers who agree to reduce their raisin production; or disposes of them by \"any other means\" consistent with the purposes of the raisin program.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20989.67\">\n    7 CFR \u00a7 989.67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5) (2015). Proceeds from Committee sales are principally used to subsidize handlers who sell raisins for export (not including the Hornes, who are not raisin exporters). Raisin growers retain an interest in any net proceeds from sales the Raisin Committee makes, after deductions for the export subsidies and the Committee's administrative expenses. In the years at issue in this case, those proceeds were less than the cost of producing the crop one year, and nothing at all the next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Hornes-Marvin Horne, Laura Horne, and their family-are both raisin growers and handlers. They \"handled\" not only their own raisins but also those produced by other growers, paying those growers in full for all of their raisins, not just the free-tonnage portion. In 2002, the Hornes refused to set aside any raisins for the Government, believing they were not legally bound to do so. The Government sent trucks to the Hornes' facility at eight o'clock one morning to pick up the raisins, but the Hornes refused entry. App. 31; cf.\n   <em>\n    post,\n   </em>\n   at 2442 (SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Government then assessed against the Hornes a fine equal to the market value of the missing raisins-some $480,000-as well as an additional civil penalty of just over $200,000 for disobeying the order to turn them over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the Government sought to collect the fine, the Hornes turned to the courts, arguing that the reserve requirement was an unconstitutional taking of their property under the Fifth Amendment. Their case eventually made it to this Court when the Government argued that the lower courts had no jurisdiction to consider the Hornes' constitutional defense to the fine.\n   <em>\n    Horne v.

The court then considered whether that requirement was a physical appropriation of property, giving rise to a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking, or a restriction on a raisin grower's use of his property, properly analyzed under the more flexible and forgiving standard for a regulatory taking. The court rejected the Hornes' argument that the reserve requirement was a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking, reasoning that \"the Takings Clause affords less protection to personal than to real property,\" and concluding that the Hornes \"are not completely divested of their property rights,\" because growers retain an interest in the proceeds from any sale of reserve raisins by the Raisin Committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1139.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court instead viewed the reserve requirement as a use restriction, similar to a government condition on the grant of a land use permit.

As in such permit cases, the Court of Appeals explained, the Government here imposed a condition (the reserve requirement) in exchange for a Government benefit (an orderly raisin market). And just as a landowner was free to avoid the government condition by forgoing a permit, so too the Hornes could avoid the reserve requirement by \"planting different crops.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066107\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/1128/#p1137\">\n    750 F.3d, at 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under that analysis, the court found that the reserve requirement was a proportional response to the Government's interest in ensuring an orderly raisin market, and not a taking under the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We granted certiorari. 574 U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12586944,12586939,12586940,12586941,12586942,12586943\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1039/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12586944,12586939,12586940\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/190/907/\">\n    190 L.Ed.2d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The petition for certiorari poses three questions, which we answer in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The first question presented asks \"Whether the government's 'categorical duty' under the Fifth Amendment to pay just compensation when it 'physically takes possession of an interest in property,'\n   <em>\n    Arkansas Game &amp; Fish Comm'n v.

Nor is there any dispute that, in the case of real property, such an appropriation is a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking that requires just compensation. See\n   <em>\n    Loretto v.

The Government has a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it takes your car, just as when it takes your home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Takings Clause provides: \"[N]or shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" U.S. Const., Amdt. 5. It protects \"private property\" without any distinction between different types. The principle reflected in the Clause goes back at least 800 years to Magna Carta, which specifically protected agricultural crops from uncompensated takings. Clause 28 of that charter forbade any \"constable or other bailiff\" from taking \"corn or other provisions from any one without immediately tendering money therefor, unless he can have postponement thereof by permission of the seller.\" Cl. 28 (1215), in W. McKechnie, Magna Carta, A Commentary on the Great Charter of King John 329 (2d ed. 1914).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The colonists brought the principles of Magna Carta with them to the New World, including that charter's protection against uncompensated takings of personal property. In 1641, for example, Massachusetts adopted its Body of Liberties, prohibiting \"mans Cattel or goods of what kinde soever\" from being \"pressed or taken for any publique use or service, unlesse it be by warrant grounded upon some act of the generall Court, nor without such reasonable prices and hire as the ordinarie rates of the Countrie do afford.\" Massachusetts Body of Liberties \u00b6 8, in R. Perry, Sources of Our Liberties 149 (1978). Virginia allowed the seizure of surplus \"live stock, or beef, pork, or bacon\" for the military, but only upon \"paying or tendering to the owner the price so estimated by the appraisers.\" 1777 Va. Acts ch. XII. And South Carolina authorized the seizure of \"necessaries\" for public use, but provided that \"said articles so seized shall be paid for agreeable to the prices such and the like articles sold for on the ninth day of October last.\" 1779 S.C. Acts \u00a7 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Given that background, it is not surprising that early Americans bridled at appropriations of their personal property during the Revolutionary War, at the hands of both sides. John Jay, for example, complained to the New York Legislature about military impressment by the Continental Army of \"Horses, Teems, and Carriages,\" and voiced his fear that such action by the \"little Officers\" of the Quartermasters Department might extend to \"Blankets, Shoes, and many other articles.\" A Hint to the Legislature of the State of New York (1778), in John Jay, The Making of a Revolutionary 461-463 (R. Morris ed. 1975) (emphasis deleted). The legislature took the \"hint,\" passing a law that, among other things, provided for compensation for the impressment of horses and carriages. 1778 N.Y. Laws ch. 29. According to the author of the first treatise on the Constitution, St. George Tucker, the Takings Clause was \"probably\" adopted in response to \"the arbitrary and oppressive mode of obtaining supplies for the army, and other public uses, by impressment, as was too frequently practised during the revolutionary war, without any compensation whatever.\" 1 Blackstone's Commentaries, Editor's App. 305-306 (1803).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Nothing in this history suggests that personal property was any less protected against physical appropriation than real property.

In\n   <em>\n    Loretto,\n   </em>\n   the Court held that requiring an owner of an apartment building to allow installation of a cable box on her rooftop was a physical taking of real property, for which compensation was required. That was true without regard to the claimed public benefit or the economic impact on the owner. The Court explained that such protection was justified not only by history, but also because \"[s]uch an appropriation is perhaps the most serious form of invasion of an owner's property interests,\" depriving the owner of the \"the rights to possess, use and dispose of\" the property.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636616\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/419/#p426\">\n    458 U.S., at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636616\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/419/#p426\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

They own the raisins they grew and are handling for themselves, and they own the raisins they handle for other growers, having paid those growers for all their raisins (not just the free-tonnage amount, as is true with respect to most handlers). See\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   at 2424 - 2425; Tr. of Oral Arg. 3-4.

It is possible that the majority questions the Government's argument because of its breadth-the Government argues that \"it would be appropriate to consider what value all of the raisins would have had\n   <em>\n    in the absence of the marketing order,\n   </em>\n   \" and I am unaware of any precedent that allows a court to account for portions of the marketing order that are entirely separate from the reserve requirement. But neither am I aware of any precedent that would distinguish between how the\n   <em>\n    Bauman\n   </em>\n   doctrine applies to the reserve requirement itself and how it applies to other types of partial takings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Ultimately, the majority rejects the Government's request for a remand because it believes that the Government \"does not suggest that the marketing order affords the Hornes compensation\" in the amount of the fine that the Government assessed.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2433. In my view, however, the relevant precedent indicates that the Takings Clause requires compensation in an amount equal to the value of the reserve raisins adjusted to account for the benefits received. And the Government does, indeed, suggest that the marketing order affords just compensation. See Brief for Respondent 56 (\"It is likely that when all benefits and alleged losses from the marketing order are calculated, [the Hornes] would have a net\n   <em>\n    gain\n   </em>\n   rather than a net loss, given that a central point of the order is to benefit producers\").

To qualify as a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking under\n   <em>\n    Loretto,\n   </em>\n   the governmental action must be so completely destructive to the property owner's rights-all of them-as to render the ordinary, generally applicable protections of the\n   <em>\n    Penn Central\n   </em>\n   framework either a foregone conclusion or unequal to the task. Simply put, the retention of even one property right that is not destroyed is sufficient to defeat a claim of a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking under\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   When evaluating the Order under this rubric, it is important to bear two things in mind. The first is that\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   is not concerned with whether the Order is a good idea now, whether it was ever a good idea, or whether it intrudes upon some property rights. The Order may well be an outdated, and by some lights downright silly, regulation. It is also no doubt intrusive. But whatever else one can say about the Order, it is not a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking if it does not result in the destruction of every property right. The second thing to keep in mind is the need for precision about whose property rights are at issue and about what property is at issue. Here, what is at issue are the Hornes' property rights in the raisins they own and that are subject to the reserve requirement. The Order therefore effects a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking under\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   if and only if each of the Hornes' property rights in the portion of raisins that the Order designated as reserve has been destroyed. If not, then whatever fate the Order may reach under some other takings test, it is not a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Hornes, however, retain at least one meaningful property interest in the reserve\n   raisins: the right to receive some money for their disposition. The Order explicitly provides that raisin producers retain the right to \"[t]he net proceeds from the disposition of reserve tonnage raisins,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20989.66\">\n    7 CFR \u00a7 989.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), and ensures that reserve raisins will be sold \"at prices and in a manner intended to maxim[ize] producer returns,\" \u00a7 989.67(d)(1). According to the Government, of the 49 crop years for which a reserve pool was operative, producers received equitable distributions of net proceeds from the disposition of reserve raisins in 42. See Letter from Donald B. Verrilli, Jr., Solicitor General, to Scott S. Harris, Clerk of Court (Apr. 29, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Granted, this equitable distribution may represent less income than what some or all of the reserve raisins could fetch if sold in an unregulated market. In some years, it may even turn out (and has turned out) to represent no net income. But whether and when that occurs turns on market forces for which the Government cannot be blamed and to which all commodities-indeed, all property-are subject. In any event, we have emphasized that \"a reduction in the value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking,\"\n   <em>\n    Andrus,\n   </em>\n   444 U.S., at 66, 100 S.Ct. 318that even \"a significant restriction ... imposed on one means of disposing\" of property is not necessarily a taking,\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 65, 100 S.Ct. 318and that not every \" 'injury to property by governmental action' \" amounts to a taking,\n   <em>\n    PruneYard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181446\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/74/\">\n    447 U.S., at 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6181446\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/74/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, we would not have used the word \"destroy\" in\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   if we meant \"damaged\" or even \"substantially damaged.\" I take us at our word:\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   's strict requirement that all property interests be \"destroy[ed]\" by governmental action before that action can be called a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking cannot be satisfied if there remains a property interest that is at most merely damaged. That is the case here; accordingly, no\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking has occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moreover, when, as here, the property at issue is a fungible commodity for sale, the income that the property may yield is the property owner's most central interest.

The Hornes do not use the raisins that are subject to the reserve requirement-which are, again, the only raisins that have allegedly been unlawfully taken-by eating them, feeding them to farm animals, or the like. They wish to use those reserve raisins by selling them, and they value those raisins only because they are a means of acquiring money. While the Order infringes upon the amount of that potential income, it does not inexorably eliminate it. Unlike the law in\n   <em>\n    Loretto,\n   </em>\n   see\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636616\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/419/#p426\">\n    458 U.S., at 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 S.Ct. 3164the Order therefore cannot be said to have prevented the Hornes from making\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   use of the relevant property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The conclusion that the Order does not effect a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking fits comfortably within our precedents. After all, we have observed that even \"[r]egulations that bar trade in certain goods\" altogether-for example, a ban on the sale of eagle feathers-may survive takings challenges.\n   <em>\n    Andrus,\n   </em>\n   444 U.S., at 67,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304710\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/51/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be sure, it was important to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Andrus\n   </em>\n   that the regulation at issue did not prohibit the possession, donation, or devise of the property. See\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304710\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/51/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But as to those feathers the plaintiffs would have liked to sell, the law said they could not be sold at any price-and therefore\n   categorically could not be converted into money. Here, too, the Hornes may do as they wish with the raisins they are not selling. But as to those raisins that they would like to sell, the Order subjects a subset of them to the reserve requirement, which allows for the conversion of reserve raisins into at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   money and which is thus\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   generous than the law in\n   <em>\n    Andrus\n   </em>\n   . We held that no taking occurred in\n   <em>\n    Andrus,\n   </em>\n   so rejecting the Hornes' claim follows\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   We made this principle even clearer in\n   <em>\n    Lucas,\n   </em>\n   when we relied on\n   <em>\n    Andrus\n   </em>\n   and said that where, as here, \"property's only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale,\" a regulation could even \"render [that] property economically\n   <em>\n    worthless\n   </em>\n   \" without effecting a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking.\n   <em>\n    Lucas,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/\">\n    505 U.S., at 1027-1028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481136\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/1003/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2886\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Andrus,\n   </em>\n   444 U.S., at 66-67,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11304710\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/444/51/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; emphasis added).

It has no effect whatsoever on raisins that the Hornes grow for their own use. But insofar as the Hornes wish to sell some raisins in a market regulated by the Government and at a price supported by governmental intervention, the Order requires that they give up the right to sell a portion of those raisins at that price and instead accept disposal of them at a lower price. Given that we have held that the Government may impose a price on the privilege of engaging in a particular business without effecting a taking-which is all that the Order does-it follows that the Order at the very least does not run afoul of our\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   takings jurisprudence. Under a different takings test, one might reach a different conclusion. But the Hornes have advanced only this narrow\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   takings claim, and that claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Court's contrary conclusion rests upon two fundamental errors. The first is the Court's breezy assertion that a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking has occurred because the Hornes \"lose the entire 'bundle' of property rights in the appropriated raisins ... with the exception of\" the retained interest in the equitable distribution of the proceeds from\n   the disposition of the reserve raisins.\n   <em>\n    Ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2427 - 2428. But if there is a property right that has not been lost, as the Court concedes there is, then the Order has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   destroyed each of the Hornes' rights in the reserve raisins and does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   effect a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking. The Court protests that the retained interest is not substantial or certain enough. But while I see more value in that interest than the Court does, the bottom line is that\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   does not distinguish among retained property interests that are substantial or certain enough to count and others that are not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor is it at all clear how the Court's approach will be administrable. How, after all, are courts, governments, or individuals supposed to know how much a property owner must be left with before this Court will bless the retained interest as sufficiently meaningful and certain?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   One virtue of the\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   test was, at least until today, its clarity. Under\n   <em>\n    Loretto,\n   </em>\n   a total destruction of all property rights constitutes a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking; anything less does not. See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636616\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/419/#p426\">\n    458 U.S., at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636616\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/419/#p426\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the \"very narrow\" nature of the\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   framework). Among the most significant doctrinal damage that the Court causes is the blurring of this otherwise bright line and the expansion of this otherwise narrow category. By the Court's lights, perhaps a 95 percent destruction of property rights can be a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking. Perhaps 90? Perhaps 60, so long as the remaining 40 is viewed by a reviewing court as less than meaningful? And what makes a retained right meaningful enough? One wonders. Indeed, it is not at all clear what test the Court has actually applied. Such confusion would be bad enough in any context, but it is especially pernicious in the area of property rights. Property owners should be assured of where they stand, and the government needs to know how far it can permissibly go without tripping over a categorical rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The second overarching error in the Court's opinion arises from its reliance on what it views as the uniquely physical nature of the taking effected by the Order. This, it says, is why many of the cases having to do with so-called regulatory takings are inapposite. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2428 - 2430. It is not the case, however, that Government agents acting pursuant to the Order are storming raisin farms in the dark of night to load raisins onto trucks. But see Tr. of Oral Arg. 30 (remarks of ROBERTS, C.J.). The Order simply requires the Hornes to set aside a portion of their raisins-a requirement with which the Hornes refused to comply. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20989.66\">\n    7 CFR \u00a7 989.66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2); Tr. of Oral Arg. 31. And it does so to facilitate two classic regulatory goals. One is the regulatory purpose of limiting the quantity of raisins that can be sold on the market. The other is the regulatory purpose of arranging the orderly disposition of those raisins whose sale would otherwise exceed the cap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Hornes and the Court both concede that a cap on the quantity of raisins that the Hornes can sell would not be a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking. See\n   <em>\n    ante,\n   </em>\n   at 2428; Brief for Petitioners 23, 52. The Court's focus on the physical nature of the intrusion also suggests that merely arranging for the sale of the reserve raisins would not be a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking. The rub for the Court must therefore be not that the Government is doing these things, but that it is accomplishing them by the altogether understandable requirement that the reserve raisins be physically set aside. I know of no principle, however, providing that if the Government achieves a permissible regulatory end by asking regulated individuals or entities to physically move the property subject to the regulation, it has committed a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking rather than a potential regulatory taking. After all, in\n   <em>\n    Monsanto,\n   </em>\n   the data that the pesticide companies had to turn over to the Government was presumably turned over in some physical form, yet even the Court does not call\n   <em>\n    Monsanto\n   </em>\n   a physical takings case. It therefore cannot be that any regulation that involves the slightest physical movement of property is necessarily evaluated as a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking rather than as a regulatory taking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The combined effect of these errors is to unsettle an important area of our jurisprudence. Unable to justify its holding under our precedents, the Court resorts to superimposing new limitations on those precedents, stretching the otherwise strict\n   <em>\n    Loretto\n   </em>\n   test into an unadministrable one, and deeming regulatory takings jurisprudence irrelevant in some undefined set of cases involving government regulation of property rights. And it does all of this in service of eliminating a type of reserve requirement that is applicable to just a few commodities in the entire country-and that, in any event, commodity producers could vote to terminate if they wished. See Letter from Solicitor General to Clerk of Court (Apr. 29, 2015); 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 608c(16)(B);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20989.91\">\n    7 CFR \u00a7 989.91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). This intervention hardly strikes me as worth the cost, but what makes the Court's twisting of the doctrine even more baffling is that it ultimately instructs the Government that it can permissibly achieve its market control goals by imposing a quota without offering raisin producers a way of reaping any return whatsoever on the raisins they cannot sell. I have trouble understanding why anyone would prefer that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Because a straightforward application of our precedents reveals that the Hornes have not suffered a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   taking, I would affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit. The Court reaches a contrary conclusion only by expanding our\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   takings doctrine in a manner that is as unwarranted as it is vague. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    For example, in\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Indeed, the only citation the Court offers for these allegedly crucial facts is the Maryland Court of Appeals' opinion, not ours.

First, it seems, the Court believes the degree of the intrusion on property rights is greater here than in\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    . See\n    <em>\n     ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2430. Maybe, maybe not. But nothing in\n    <em>\n     Monsanto\n    </em>\n    suggests this is a relevant question, and the Court points to nothing saying that it is. Second, the Court believes that \"[s]elling produce in interstate commerce\" is not a government benefit.\n    <em>\n     Ante,\n    </em>\n    at 2430. Again, that may be true, but the Hornes are not simply selling raisins in interstate commerce. They are selling raisins in a regulated market at a price artificially inflated by Government action in that market.
