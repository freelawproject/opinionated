Less than a decade ago, we explained that an ordinance requiring firearms in the home to be kept inoperable, without an exception for self-defense, conflicted with the Second Amendment because it \"ma [de] it impossible for citizens to use [their firearms] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense.\"\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v. Heller,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p630\">\n    554 U.S. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 630,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p630\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p630\">\n    171 L.Ed.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Despite the clarity with which we described the Second Amendment's core protection for the right of self-defense, lower courts, including the ones here, have failed to protect it. Because Second Amendment rights are no less protected by our Constitution than\n   other rights enumerated in that document, I would have granted this petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Section 4512 of the San Francisco Police Code provides that \"[n]o person shall keep a handgun within a residence owned or controlled by that person unless\" (1) \"the handgun is stored in a locked container or disabled with a trigger lock that has been approved by the California Department of Justice\" or (2) \"[t]he handgun is carried on the person of an individual over the age of 18\" or \"under the control of a person who is a peace officer under [California law].\" San Francisco Police Code, Art. 45, \u00a7\u00a7 4512(a), (c) (2015). The law applies across the board, regardless of whether children are present in the home. A violation of the law is punishable by up to six months of imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $1,000. \u00a7 4512(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioners-six San Francisco residents who keep handguns in their homes, as well as two organizations-filed suit to challenge this law under the Second Amendment. According to petitioners, the law impermissibly rendered their handguns \"[in]operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense\" in the home.\n   <em>\n    Heller, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 635,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p630\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because it is impossible to \"carry\" a firearm on one's person while sleeping, for example, petitioners contended that the law effectively denies them their right to self-defense at times when their potential need for that defense is most acute. In support of that point, they cited a Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, survey estimating that over 60 percent of all robberies of occupied dwellings between 2003 and 2007 occurred between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The District Court for the Northern District of California denied them a preliminary injunction, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Court of Appeals readily acknowledged that the law \"burdens the core of the Second Amendment right\" because \"[h]aving to retrieve handguns from locked containers or removing trigger locks makes it more difficult 'for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense' in the home.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240538\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/953/#p964\">\n    746 F.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 964 (2014)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Heller, supra,\n   </em>\n   at 630,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p630\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But it reasoned that this was not a \"severe burden\" justifying the application of strict scrutiny because \"a modern gun safe may be opened quickly.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240538\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/953/#p964\">\n    746 F.3d, at 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying intermediate scrutiny, the court evaluated San Francisco's proffered \"evidence that guns kept in the home are most often used in suicides and against family and friends rather than in self-defense and that children are particularly at risk of injury and death.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 965. The court concluded that the law served \"a significant government interest by reducing the number of gun-related injuries and deaths from having an unlocked handgun in the home\" and was \"substantially related\" to that interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 966.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The decision of the Court of Appeals is in serious tension with\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   . We explained in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   that the Second Amendment codified a right \" 'inherited from our English ancestors,' \" a key component of which is the right to keep and bear arms for the lawful purpose of self-defense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p630\">\n    554 U.S., at 599\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p630\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We therefore rejected as inconsistent with the Second Amendment a ban on possession of handguns in the home because \"handguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home\" and because a trigger-lock requirement prevented residents from rendering their firearms \"operable for the purpose of immediate self-defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 629, 635,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p630\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . San Francisco's law allows residents to\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   their handguns for the purpose of self-defense, but it prohibits them from\n   <em>\n    keeping\n   </em>\n   those handguns \"operable for the purpose of\n   <em>\n    immediate\n   </em>\n   self-defense\" when not carried on their person. The law thus burdens their right to self-defense at the times they are most vulnerable-when they are sleeping, bathing, changing clothes, or otherwise indisposed. There is consequently no question that San Francisco's law burdens the core of the Second Amendment right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   That burden is significant. One petitioner, an elderly woman who lives alone, explained that she is currently forced to store her handgun in a lock box and that if an intruder broke into her home at night, she would need to \"turn on the light, find [her] glasses, find the key to the lockbox, insert the key in the lock and unlock the box (under the stress of the emergency), and then get [her] gun before being in position to defend [herself].\" Declaration of Espanola Jackson in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Record in Case 3:09-cv-02143 (ND Cal.), Doc. 136-3, p. 2. As she is over 79 years old, that would \"not [be] an easy task.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Another petitioner stated that she is forced to store her gun in a code-operated safe and, in the event of an emergency, would need to get to that safe, remember her code under stress, and correctly enter it before she could retrieve her gun and be in a position to defend herself. If she erroneously entered the number due to stress, the safe would impose a delay before she could try again. A third petitioner explained that he would face the same challenge and, in the event the battery drains on his battery-operated safe, would need to locate a backup key to access his handgun. In an emergency situation, the delay imposed by this law could prevent San Francisco residents from using their handguns for the lawful purpose of self-defense. And that delay could easily be the difference between life and death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Since our decision in\n   <em>\n    Heller,\n   </em>\n   members of the Courts of Appeals have disagreed about whether and to what extent the tiers-of-scrutiny analysis should apply to burdens on Second Amendment rights. Compare\n   <em>\n    Heller v. District of Columbia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769810,5712319\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/670/1244/\">\n    670 F.3d 1244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.A.D.C.2011)(\"We ask first whether a particular provision impinges upon a right protected by the Second Amendment; if it does, then we go on to determine whether the provision passes muster under the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny\"), with\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   at 1271(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (\"In my view,\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   leave little doubt that courts are to assess gun bans and regulations based on text, history, and tradition, not by a balancing test such as strict or intermediate scrutiny\"). One need not resolve that dispute to know that something was seriously amiss in the decision below. In that decision, the Court of Appeals recognized that the law \"burdens the core of the Second Amendment right,\" yet concluded that, because the law's burden was not as \"severe\" as the one at issue in\n   <em>\n    Heller,\n   </em>\n   it was \"not a substantial burden on the Second Amendment right itself.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240538\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/953/#p964\">\n    746 F.3d, at 963-965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   But nothing in our decision in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   suggested that a law must rise to the level of the absolute prohibition at issue in that case to constitute a \"substantial burden\" on the core of the Second Amendment right. And when a law burdens a constitutionally protected right, we have generally required a higher showing than the Court of Appeals demanded here.
