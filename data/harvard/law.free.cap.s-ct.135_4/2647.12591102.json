And each time, a court vacated that sentence. After Jordan's third successful appeal, the prosecutor entered into a plea agreement whereby Jordan would receive a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. When the Mississippi Supreme Court later invalidated that agreement, Jordan requested that the prosecutor reinstate the\n   life-without-parole deal through a new plea. The prosecutor refused. Jordan was then retried and again sentenced to death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Jordan applied for federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that the prosecutor's decision to seek the death penalty after having agreed to a lesser sentence was unconstitutionally vindictive. The District Court denied Jordan's petition, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in a divided decision, denied Jordan's request for a certificate of appealability (COA). Because the Fifth Circuit clearly misapplied our precedents regarding the issuance of a COA, I would grant Jordan's petition and summarily reverse the Fifth Circuit's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1976, Jordan was arrested for the abduction and murder of Edwina Marter. Jackson County Assistant District Attorney Joe Sam Owen led the prosecution. The jury convicted Jordan of capital murder, and, under then-applicable Mississippi law, he automatically received a sentence of death. After Jordan's sentence was imposed, however, the Mississippi Supreme Court held that automatic death sentences violated the Eighth Amendment. See\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Jordan was accordingly granted a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Owen continued to serve as the lead prosecutor at Jordan's second trial. Jordan was again convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The Fifth Circuit later determined, however, that the jury had been improperly instructed on the imposition of the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

By this point, Owen had left the district attorney's office for private practice. But at the behest of Marter's family, Owen agreed to represent the State as a special prosecutor. A jury once more sentenced Jordan to death, but this Court subsequently vacated the decision upholding that sentence and remanded for reconsideration in light of\n   <em>\n    Skipper v.

In support of the agreement, Owen stipulated to several mitigating circumstances, including Jordan's remorse, his record of honorable service and disability incurred in the military during the Vietnam War, his good behavior in prison, and his significant contributions to society while incarcerated. 1 Postconviction Record 20-21. The trial court accepted the plea and, in December 1991, Jordan was sentenced to life without parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As it turned out, this sentence, too, was defective. At the time the parties reached their plea agreement, Mississippi's sentencing statutes authorized a term of life without parole only for those defendants who-unlike Jordan-had been found to be habitual offenders. Citing this statutory gap, the Mississippi Supreme Court held in an unrelated case that a plea agreement materially identical to Jordan's violated Mississippi public policy.\n   <em>\n    Lanier v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7465017\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/635/813/\">\n    635 So.2d 813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). Such agreements, the court explained, were \"void\n   <em>\n    ab initio,\n   </em>\n   \" and thus the parties were \"placed\n   back in the positions which they occupied prior to entering into the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 816-817.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the decision in\n   <em>\n    Lanier,\n   </em>\n   Jordan filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion with the trial court seeking to remedy his unlawful sentence by changing its term from life without parole to life with the possibility of parole. While the motion was pending, the Mississippi Legislature amended the State's criminal code to permit sentences of life without parole for all capital murder convictions. See 1994 Miss. Laws p. 851 (amending Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 97-3-21). The Mississippi Supreme Court ultimately agreed with Jordan that his sentence was invalid under\n   <em>\n    Lanier\n   </em>\n   and remanded the case for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    Jordan v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=697%20So.%202d%201190\">\n    697 So.2d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997)(table).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On remand, Jordan asked Owen (reprising his role as special prosecutor) to reinstate their earlier life-without-parole agreement based on the recent amendment to Mississippi law. Jordan, in return, would agree to waive his right to challenge the retroactive application of that amendment to his case. Jordan had good reason to believe that his request would be granted: Three other Mississippi capital defendants had successfully petitioned to have their plea agreements invalidated under the logic of\n   <em>\n    Lanier\n   </em>\n   . Each had committed crimes at least as serious as Jordan's,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and each had received a life sentence after their successful appeals. Yet Owen refused to enter into the same agreement he had previously accepted, instead seeking the death penalty at a new sentencing trial. Owen later explained that he had declined to negotiate because he felt Jordan had violated their original agreement by asking the trial court to modify his sentence. See\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

The trial court denied the motion, and Jordan received a death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Jordan continued to pursue his prosecutorial vindictiveness claim on direct appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. That court rejected Jordan's argument, noting, among other things, that its previous decision in Jordan's case had left open the possibility that Owen could seek the death penalty.\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

No one disputes that Jordan, like Deloney, attempted to alter the terms of his plea agreement. But he did so only because the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Lanier\n   </em>\n   rendered invalid his life-without-parole sentence. In light of\n   <em>\n    Lanier,\n   </em>\n   either Jordan or Owen should have asked to vacate Jordan's invalid sentence; Jordan simply moved first. Moreover, and again in contrast to the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Deloney,\n   </em>\n   Jordan never attempted to deprive the State of the benefit of its earlier bargain. Once Mississippi law changed, Jordan was willing to return to the\n   <em>\n    status quo ante\n   </em>\n   : He offered to accept the same sentence of life without parole. It was Owen, the prosecutor, who demanded a fourth trial. On these facts, it is far from certain that\n   <em>\n    Deloney\n   </em>\n   precludes Jordan from asserting a claim of prosecutorial vindictiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In any event, Jordan's reading of the Fifth Circuit's case law need not be the best one to allow him to obtain further review. \"[M]eritorious appeals are a subset of those in which a certificate should issue,\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.
