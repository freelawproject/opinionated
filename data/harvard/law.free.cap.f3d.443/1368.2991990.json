United States, </em>100 F.3d 1525, 1537-40 (Fed.Cir.1996) <em>(en banc) (\u201cPreseault II </em>\u201d), and <em>Caldwell, </em>391 F.3d at 1228-30, in order to abandon a line that is subject to STB jurisdiction, a railroad must apply to the STB under either 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10903 (standard abandonment), or 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10502 (abandonment by exemption).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All proceedings involved in these appeals were exemption proceedings. Under the Trails Act, the STB may issue a NITU, suspending exemption proceedings for 180 days to allow a third party to enter into an agreement with the railroad to use the right-of-way as a recreational trail. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(b)(2) and (d) (2005). If the railroad and the trail operator reach an agreement, \u201cthe NITU extends indefinitely to permit interim trail use____\u201d <em>Caldwell, </em>391 F.3d at 1230; <em>see </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(d)(1). If no trail use agreement is reached, the NITU converts into an effective notice of exemption, allowing the railroad to \u201cabandon the line entirely and liquidate its interest.\u201d <em>Preseault I, </em>494 U.S. at 7, 110 S.Ct. 914; see <em>Caldwell, </em>391 F.3d at 1230. While it retains jurisdiction over the right-of-way, the STB may reopen exemption proceedings to substitute a new trail operator, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(f), to accept late-filed trail use requests, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(e)(1), or to vacate a notice of exemption and issue a NITU when a railroad late files its statement of willingness to negotiate, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">In <em>Preseault I, </em>the Court noted but did not resolve the claim that \u201cCongress ... violated the Fifth Amendment by precluding reversion of state property interests.\u201d 494 U.S. at 9, 110 S.Ct. 914; <em>see also id. </em>at 22,110 S.Ct. 914 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring) (operation of the Trails Act \u201cmay delay property owners\u2019 enjoyment of their rever-sionary interests,\u201d which \u201cburdens and defeats the property interest\u201d). In <em>Preseault II, </em>we established that the elimination of adjacent landowners\u2019 state law reversion-ary interests when abandonment is suspended under the Trails Act constitutes a Fifth Amendment taking. 100 F.3d at 1550-52. In <em>Caldwell, </em>we held that such a claim accrues for statute-of-limitations purposes when railroad abandonment proceedings are suspended by the STB\u2019s issuance of a NITU. <em>Caldwell, </em>391 F.3d at 1235. The Barclay appellants (the appellants in No. 05-1255) and Renewal (the appellant in No. 05-5109) challenge both the correctness of the <em>Caldwell </em>decision and its applicability to the particular facts of their takings claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b898-14\">The Barclay appellants filed their Trails Act takings claims in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>on April 7, 2004. The complaint alleged that railroad rights-of-way running across the Barclay appellants\u2019 property in Kansas were converted into three different recreational trails (the Meadowlark, Sunflower, and Flint Hills trails) pursuant to the Trails Act, and that these conversions constituted Fifth Amendment takings. The government moved to dismiss on the ground that the complaint was not filed within the six year statute of limitations. We decided <em>Caldwell </em>while the government\u2019s motion was pending. Because the initial NITUs for all three trails were issued prior to the cutoff date for the statute of limitations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court dismissed the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">The district court found that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. Utah, </em>414 U.S. 538, 94 S.Ct. 756, 38 L.Ed.2d 713 (1974), and <em>Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co., Inc. v. Parker, </em>462 U.S. 345, 103 S.Ct. 2392, 76 L.Ed.2d 628 (1983), required tolling the statute of limitations for eleven months, three weeks, and one day, during the pendency of <em>Swisher v. United States, </em>189 F.R.D. 638 (D.Kan.1999), a class action alleging Trails Act takings in which the Barclay appellants were class members. The district court nevertheless concluded that the action was not timely filed, applying our holding in <em>Caldwell </em>that the claims accrued on issuance of the original NITUs. The district court rejected contentions that replacement NITUs, rather than the initial NITUs, triggered the accrual of their claims for the Flint Hills and Sunflower trails, holding that subsequently issued NITUs covering the same rights of way \u201cmerely continued in effect the blocking of the reversionary interests begun by the first NITU\u201d and \u201ccould not amount to a separate taking of the property triggering a new claim .... \u201d <em>Barclay, </em>351 F.Supp.2d at 1179. The Barclay appellants timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Renewal\u2019s complaint in the Court of Federal Claims alleged that Trails-Act conversion of a railroad right-of-way running across Renewal\u2019s property in California constituted a taking. The STB authorized abandonment effective May 28, 1995, and the putative trail operator filed a trail use request on May 23,1995. The railroad had removed most of the track and equipment by July 1995, though abandonment had not been consummated under federal law. The STB subsequently issued a NITU on October 23, 1995, and the right-of-way was converted into a trail.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">Renewal filed its complaint in the Court of Federal Claims on December 11, 2003. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the complaint, relying on <em>Caldwell to </em>conclude that \u201cRenewal\u2019s claim accrued on October 23, 1995, the day the NITU was issued,\u201d well outside the six-year limitations period. <em>Renewal, </em>64 Fed.Cl. at 615. Renewal timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b899-12\">We review both the district court\u2019s dismissal for want of jurisdiction and the legal conclusions of the Court of Federal Claims without deference. <em>Lion Raisins, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1373\">*1373</page-number><em>Inc. v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 1356, 1362 (Fed.Cir.2005); <em>Applegate v. United States, </em>25 F.3d 1579, 1581 (Fed.Cir.1994). We agree with the district court and the Court of Federal claims that these actions are time-barred under our decision in Caldwell,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">We explained in <em>Caldwell </em>that \u201c[t]he taking, if any, when a railroad right-of-way is converted to interim trail use under the Trails Act occurs when state law reversionary property interests that would otherwise vest in the adjacent landowners are blocked from so vesting.\u201d <em>Caldwell, </em>391 F.3d at 1233. Abandonment is suspended and the reversionary interest is blocked \u201cwhen the railroad and trail operator communicate to the STB their intention to negotiate a trail use agreement and the agency issues an NITU that operates to preclude abandonment under section 8(d)\u201d of the Trails Act. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that \u201c[t]he issuance of the NITU is the only <em>government </em>action in the railbanking process that operates to prevent abandonment of the corridor and to preclude the vesting of state law reversionary interests in the right of way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1233-34 (emphasis in original). Thus, a Trails Act taking begins and a takings claim accrues, if at all, on issuance of the NITU. We explicitly held in <em>Caldwell </em>that \u201c[wjhile the taking may be abandoned ... by the termination of the NITU[,] the accrual date of a single taking remains fixed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1235. The issuance of the NITU is the only event that must occur to \u201centitle the plaintiff to institute an action.\u201d <em>Creppel v. United States, </em>41 F.3d 627, 631 (Fed.Cir. 1994). Accrual is not delayed until a trail use agreement is executed or the trail operator takes physical possession of the right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">The Barclay appellants and Renewal first argue that <em>Caldwell </em>was wrongly decided and should be overruled. Panels of this court are bound by previous precedential decisions until overturned by the Supreme Court or by this court <em>en banc. Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Fort Howard Paper Co., </em>772 F.2d 860, 863 (Fed.Cir.1985). The court declined to rehear <em>Caldwell en banc, </em>and the Supreme Court denied certiorari. <em>Caldwell v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 366, 163 L.Ed.2d 72 (2005) <em>(mem.). </em>In any event, the majority of these arguments were rejected in <em>Caldwell. </em>To the extent that they are new, they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-13\">The appellants and amici contend that <em>Caldwell </em>was wrongly decided insofar as it relied on federal rather than state law to determine when abandonment and reversion of railroad rights-of-way occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-14\">Renewal argues that because the railroad had removed its track and equipment from the right-of-way by June 1995, effectively abandoning it under California law and granting Renewal \u201cfull and exclusive, undisturbed, and uncontested possession and use\u201d of the property until trail use began, App. Br. of Renewal at 17, the issuance of the NITU in October, 1995 did not block Renewal\u2019s reversionary interest. Thus, Renewal concludes that its claim did not accrue until it was physically ousted from the property when trail use began.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1374\">*1374</page-number>While state law generally creates the property interest in a railroad right-of-way, <em>Preseault I, 494 </em>U.S. at 8, 16, 110 S.Ct. 914,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cthe disposition of reversionary interests [is] subject ... to the [STB\u2019s] \u2018exclusive and plenary1 jurisdiction to regulate abandonments\u201d of railroad rights of way. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 110 S.Ct. 914 (quoting <em>Chi &amp; N.W. Transp. Co. v. Kalo Brick &amp; Tile Co., </em>450 U.S. 311, 321, 101 S.Ct. 1124, 67 L.Ed.2d 258 (1981)). Federal law dictates when abandonment occurs. Thus, Renewal is incorrect that state law governs the timing of the abandonment. Abandonment cannot occur until authorized by federal law, and the NITU precludes abandonment and the reversion that would follow if abandonment were consummated. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d) (2000); 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(d)(1); <em>Caldwell, </em>391 F.3d at 1229; <em>Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>853 F.2d 145, 151 (2d Cir.1988) (\u201cUntil the [STB] issues a certificate of abandonment, the railway property remains subject to the [STB\u2019s] jurisdiction, and state law may not cause a reverter of the property.\u201d); <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>850 F.2d 694, 704 (D.C.Cir.1988) (\u201cNor may state law cause a reverter of a right-of-way prior to an [STB]~approved abandonment.\u201d). Thus, there could be no abandonment until authorized by federal law. The NITU barred the abandonment; abandonment cannot occur after issuance of a NITU while the NITU is in effect. The barrier to reversion is the NITU, not physical ouster from possession. As Renewal itself admits, after issuance of the NITU, \u201cthe easement continued in existence beyond the time when it otherwise would have been abandoned.\u201d Reply Br. of Renewal, at 4. Thus, the NITU triggers accrual.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The Barclay appellants\u2019 state law argument is also without merit. In the case of the Meadowlark trail, they insist that the NITU would not itself block a reversion if the railroad continued to use the right-of-way for railroad purposes after the NITU was issued. They argue that under Kansas law (which assertedly is different from California law), the taking can occur only after federal law authorized abandonment\u2014that is, when the railroad ceases operations and the trail operator assumes physical possession. They thus urge that the trail operator\u2019s physical occupation, and not the Meadowlark trail NITU, blocked the reversion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But even if under Kansas law the reversion would not occur until after federal authorization of abandonment, that state law reversion was still delayed by the issuance of the NITU, and the claim still accrued with the issuance of the NITU. It similarly makes no difference that railroad use may have continued after the NITU issued. The termination of railroad use was still delayed by the NITU.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">The Barclay appellants also contend that <em>Caldwell </em>is distinguishable on a number of grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1375\">*1375</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The Barclay appellants argue that the original NITUs issued for the Flint Hills trail were vacated and that a second taking occurred when a new NITU was issued. Although issuance of a NITU requires that at least one trail operator file a statement of willingness to assume responsibility for the trail before issuance of the NITU, and that trail operator is listed in the NITU, the ordering clause of a NITU is not typically limited to a particular trail operator<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and a railroad is free to negotiate a trail use agreement with any party. <em>See Rail Abandonments\u2014Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails, </em>Ex Parte No. 274 (Sub. No. 13), 2 I.C.C.2d 591, 605-06, 608, 1986 WL 68617 (1986) (\u201cRail Abandonments\u201d); <em>Neb. Trails Council v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>120 F.3d 901, 906 (8th Cir.1997); <em>Goos v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>911 F.2d 1283, 1293 (8th Cir.1990). Nonetheless, it is common that, if after issuance of the NITU the trad operator named in the original NITU becomes unwilling or unable to assume responsibility for the trail, a new operator will be able to be formally substituted by issuance of a new NITU before an agreement with the railroad is reached. It is also common for the original trail operator to become unwilling or unable to serve after an agreement is reached with the railroad, and for the original trail operator to propose to transfer trail use rights and responsibilities to a new trail operator. <em>See Rail Abandon-ments, </em>2 I.C.C.2d at 606-08 (recognizing such \u201cserial trail use\u201d as appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-9\">The regulations provide a mechanism for substituting trail operators and updating NITUs without abandonment. The original and replacement trail operators file a notice in accordance with 49 C.F.R \u00a7 1152.29(f)(1). Then, a new NITU (naming the new trail operator) is substituted for the original NITU (naming the original trail operator). As the regulation provides, \u201c[t]he board will reopen the abandonment or exemption proceeding, vacate the existing NITU or CITU; and issue an appropriate replacement NITU or CITU to the new trail user.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29(f)(2). There is no gap between the original and replacement NITUs. Though formally \u201cvacatfing]\u201d the original NITUs, the STB makes clear that, in substance, it is \u201csubstituting\u201d trail users \u201cin the [same] proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b902-10\">Under these circumstances, we agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the series of STB NITU orders must be viewed as part of a single and continuous government action rather than as new takings. Any other approach would result in multiple potential takings of the same re-versionary interest. In <em>Caldwell, </em>we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1376\">*1376</page-number>jected that approach, following <em>United States v. Dow, </em>357 U.S. 17, 24, 78 S.Ct. 1039, 2 L.Ed.2d 1109 (1958), where the Supreme Court dismissed as \u201cbizarre\u201d the contention that there could be \u201ctwo different \u2018takings\u2019 of the same property, with some incidents of the taking determined as of one date and some as of the other.\u201d So long as abandonment was not consummated, the STB retained jurisdiction over the right-of-way. <em>See Baros v. Tex. Mexican Ry. Co., </em>400 F.3d 228, 236 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Birt v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>90 F.3d 580, 585 (D.C.Cir.1996). Thus, any extensions or modifications of the original NITU were not separate potential takings.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">No different result is required for the Sunflower Trail NITU. The initial Sunflower Trail NITU was set to expire on June 6, 1997. Although a new trail operator filed a request to be substituted and for the issuance of a new NITU on June 6, the STB did not issue the NITU until 10 days later, on June 16, 1997. The Barclay appellants argue that under these circumstances the original NITU became inoperative, abandonment occurred, and the landowners\u2019 interest reverted. The replacement NITU in their view was a distinct government action that affected a new taking. Here again, however, the new NITU in substance merely extended the original NITU<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and listed a new potential trail operator. Moreover, it is clear that the STB had authority to extend the NITU and that abandonment did not occur in the interim. <em>See Birt, </em>90 F.3d at 585-87. In <em>Birt, </em>a landowner argued that the STB abused its discretion by retroactively extending a CITU (the version of the NITU issued in standard abandonment proceedings rather than exemption proceedings) eight days after the CITU expired. The District of Columbia Circuit disagreed, concluding that the STB retained jurisdiction over the right-of-way, and thus had authority to issue the extension, because the railroad did not consummate abandonment while the CITU was expired. <em>Id. </em>at 585-87. The new CITU became merely a continuation of the old. We agree with the District of Columbia Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Birt. </em>Here, the railroad did not consummate abandonment of the Sunflower Trail right-of-way or file a notice of consummation with the STB between June 6, 1997, the day the initial NITU expired, and June 16, 1997, the day the replacement NITU was issued.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus the new NITU was not a separate taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">The Barclay appellants also insist that the Meadowlark Trail NITU did not block their reversionary interest because, unlike the NITU at issue in <em>Caldwell, </em>it contained a 180-day public use condition issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10905. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1377\">*1377</page-number>The public use condition requires offering rights-of-way for sale to parties interested in using the property for, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201chighways, other forms of mass transportation, conservation, energy production or transmission, or recreation.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10905 (2000). Here, at the time of the issuance of the NITU, a trail operator was named and the railroad had stated its willingness to negotiate a trail use agreement. The trail operator alternatively requested the issuance of the public use condition, apparently on the theory that a public use condition would preserve the right-of-way for trail use. In accordance with its policy, the STB issued both conditions simultaneously. The STB in the NITU made clear that the public use condition was \u201csubject to the execution of a trail agreement,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f an interim trail use/ rail banking agreement is executed within the 180-day period specified above, the public use condition will expire to the extent the trail use/rail banking agreement covers the same line segment.\u201d <em>Union Pac.

No. 89X), 1995 WL 569357, (1995) <em>(\u2018Meadowlark NITU\u201d). </em>No agreement was reached under the public use condition, and it expired after 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">The Barclay appellants\u2019 theory appears to be that if the right-of-way were purchased under the public use condition for a use that was within the scope of the right-of-way, for example, continued rail use for mass transit, reversion might not have occurred under state law, and hence that the blockage of the reversion did not occur until the public use condition expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">We do not think that <em>Caldwell </em>can be distinguished on this basis. The primary object of the NITU was to preclude abandonment and thus to enable a trail use agreement. But for the NITU\u2019s trail use condition, the railroad could abandon the line immediately and trigger the reversion, since the public use condition did not itself preclude abandonment. <em>See Fritsch v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>59 F.3d 248, 252 (D.C.Cir.1995) (section 10906 precludes sale or other disposal of the right-of-way, but not abandonment); <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n, 850 </em>F.2d at 701-02 (what is now section 10905 \u201chas no rail banking provision that would preempt state laws that could otherwise result in reversion of rights-of-way to abutting landowners upon a cessation of rail service\u201d). The bar on abandonment effected by the NITU\u2019s trail use condition triggered accrual of the cause of action here just as it did in <em>Caldwell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">\n<em>D</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Finally, the Barclay appellants argue that their Sunflower Trail claims did not accrue when the initial NITU was issued on April 12, 1996, because after the replacement NITU was issued on June 16, 1997, a group of landowners petitioned to reopen the exemption proceeding and vacate both the initial NITU and the replacement NITU. The petitioners argued that the railroad omitted material facts in its notice of exemption and that CKC was financially unfit to serve as trail operator. The STB denied the petition to reopen on December 18, 1998. The petitioners appealed to the District of Columbia Circuit, which affirmed in part and reversed in part on October 22, 1999. <em>See Jost v. Surface Transp. Bd., </em>194 F.3d 79 (D.C.Cir.1999). On remand, the STB further explained its reasoning and again denied the petition on May 8, 2001. That denial was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1378\">*1378</page-number>The Barclay appellants contend that their claim did not accrue until the petition to reopen was finally denied on May 8, 2001, even though the original NITU as extended by the replacement NITU never ceased to be effective. This is merely another version of the argument\u2014rejected in Caldwell\u2014that the original NITU should not be viewed as the taking because subsequent events might render the NITU only temporary. The Sunflower Trail claims accrued when the original NITU issued, regardless of the petition to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">In summary, we adhere to <em>Caldwell </em>and hold that the issuance of the original NITU triggers the accrual of the cause of action. The appellants\u2019 arguments in these cases urging a different trigger, depending on when abandonment occurred under state law, when the last NITU in a series was issued, or when the NITU was no longer subject to collateral attack, merely emphasize the correctness of the <em>Caldwell </em>rule. Appellants\u2019 arguments lead potentially to multiple takings of a single reversionary interest and endless litigation concerning the appropriate date for accrual, thus leaving landowners and the government in a state of great uncertainty as to their respective rights and obligations. Here, as in <em>Caldwell, </em>we conclude that takings law supplies a single bright-line rule for accrual that avoids these adverse consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">The decisions of the district court and Court of Federal Claims dismissing the appellants\u2019 complaints are</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b898-8\">.

Such Notice announces the railroad\u2019s right to abandon railway use and negotiate with a potential trail operator. If an agreement for interim trail use is reached, the right-of-way is rail-banked for possible future railway use. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1247(d). If such an agreement is not reached within 180 days, or an extension thereof, the right-of-way is deemed abandoned and any easements therefor are extinguished in accordance with the applicable state law. <em>See Preseault v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>494 U.S. 1, 7 n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 914, 108 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990) (\u201cIf agreement [for interim trail use with a qualified trail operator] is reached, interim trail use is thereby authorized. If not, the CITU or NITU automatically converts into an effective certificate or notice of abandonment.\u201d). Thus, the statute and the NITU do not make trail use mandatory, and if trail use is not achieved, the statute effects abandonment of railway use and reversion of the right-of-way easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">A Fifth Amendment taking cannot occur simply upon issuance of a NITU, because the deprivation of the reversion has not yet occurred, and may never occur. If railway use is simply abandoned, the easement is extinguished, the property is unburdened, and no taking occurs. Thus the issuance of a Notice of Interim Trail Use or Abandonment is not a <em>per se </em>taking, and no right of compensation arises on issuance of the Notice. My colleagues err in holding that the period of limitations for Fifth Amendment compensation starts to accrue, and that an action can be brought, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1379\">*1379</page-number>immediately upon issuance of the NITU. As explained in <em>Hair v. United States </em>850 F.3d 1253 (Fed.Cir.2003), a period of limitations does not accrue until an issue is actionable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">The basic rule is that the clock of a statute of limitations begins to run from the date the plaintiffs cause of action \u201caccrues,\u201d ... A cause of action \u201caccrues\u201d when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action. \u201cThe earliest opportunity for a complete and present cause of action is that moment when the plaintiff has suffered a legally recognizable harm at the hands of the defendant, such as the time of contract breach or the commission of a tortious wrong.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1260 (quoting 1 Calvin W. Corman, <em>Limitation of Actions </em>\u00a7 6.1 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">As discussed in <em>Preseault v. United States, </em>100 F.3d 1525 (Fed.Cir.1996), the conversion of a railroad right-of-way to a recreational trail can constitute a Fifth Amendment taking. However, the cause of action and right to compensation do not vest until the claim accrues. In <em>Boling v. United States, </em>220 F.3d 1365 (Fed.Cir.2000) this court reiterated that: \u201cIn general, a takings claim accrues when \u2018all events which fix the government\u2019s alleged liability have occurred and the plaintiff was or should have been aware of their existence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1370 (quoting <em>Hopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United States, </em>855 F.2d 1573, 1577 (Fed.Cir.1988)). From my colleagues\u2019 ruling that a taking occurred as soon as the possibility arose for trail conversion as an alternative to abandonment of the right-of-way, I must, respectfully, dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">The general rule in physical takings eases is that the taking is actionable when the property is taken and liability is fixed, not when it is suggested to be taken. In <em>United States v. Clarke, </em>445 U.S. 253, 100 S.Ct. 1127, 63 L.Ed.2d 373 (1980) the Court stated that \u201cphysical takings by governmental bodies that may entitle a landowner to sue for compensation,\u201d 445 U.S. at 256, 100 S.Ct. 1127, occur with the occupation of the property: \u201cCondemnation proceedings, depending on the applicable statute, require various affirmative action on the part of the condemning authority. To accomplish a taking by seizure, on the other hand, a condemning authority need only occupy the land in question.\u201d 445 U.S. at 257, 100 S.Ct. 1127. In <em>Nollan v. California Coastal Comm\u2019n, </em>483 U.S. 825, 832, 107 S.Ct. 3141, 97 L.Ed.2d 677 (1987) the Court made clear that it is the permanent occupation or permanent right of traversal that triggers the owner\u2019s right to compensation, not the commencement of negotiations. <em>See generally United States v. Dow, </em>357 U.S. 17, 78 S.Ct. 1039, 2 L.Ed.2d 1109 (1958) (the taking occurred when the property was occupied, not when the deed was transferred some time later). In <em>Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., </em>458 U.S. 419, 102 S.Ct. 3164, 73 L.Ed.2d 868 (1982) the Court focused on the permanent physical occupation of the property in determining whether a taking had occurred, not the legislative or administrative events that authorized that occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">The NITU is prospective, and requires additional steps by the rail carrier and others before either of the two options authorized by the NITU will take legal effect. <em>See </em>49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1152.29. The NITU does not require that the railroad must consummate an agreement for rails-to-trails conversion. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1152.29(d), (e)(2); <em>see National Wildlife Federation v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>850 F.2d 694, 700-02 (D.C.Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1380\">*1380</page-number>1988). As discussed in the context of whether the issuance of a NITU must be preceded by an environmental impact study, the tentative aspect of the NITU is stressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\">[Ijssuance of an NITU or CITU is not only incidental to the abandonment, but also is itself not a guarantee of eventual trail use. The NITU or CITU serves only \u201cto provide an opportunity for the railroad and prospective trail users to negotiate an agreement; thus, when [the STB issues] a NITU or CITU there is only a <em>possibility </em>that a particular right-of-way actually will be used as a recreational trail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-5\"><em>Goos v. Interstate Commerce Comm\u2019n, </em>911 F.2d 1283, 1293 (8th Cir.1990) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">When the government issued the NITU herein, it was not known whether the right-of-way would be converted to a recreational trail. If the ensuing negotiations had failed, such that the trail did not come into being, there could be no taking based on trail use. A suit for compensation is not ripe until the taking occurs. The panel majority states that \u201cthe termination of railroad use was still delayed by the NITU,\u201d maj. op. at 1374, producing the incongruity whereby despite the delay in abandonment, the majority holds that the cause of action had already accrued. A \u201cdelay\u201d of possible conversion to trail use, while it remains unknown whether trail use will occur at all, is not a <em>per se </em>taking with already vested entitlement to compensation. A taking claim does not accrue until \u201call events have occurred that fix the alleged liability of the Government and entitle the plaintiff to institute an action.\u201d <em>Seldovia Native Ass\u2019n v. United States, </em>144 F.3d 769, 774 (Fed.Cir.1998). The plaintiffs herein could not have sued for compensation while the trail use negotiations were ongoing; the period of limitations cannot accrue before suit could have been brought. <em>Hair, 350 F.3d </em>at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">Indeed, the panel majority reinforces this view in its recognition that \u201cSo long as abandonment was not consummated, the STB retained jurisdiction over the right-of-way.\u201d Maj. op. at 1376. Yet the \u201ckey date for accrual purposes is the date on which the plaintiff\u2019s land has been clearly and permanently taken.\u201d <em>Boling, </em>220 F.3d at 1370 (citing Seldovia). A taking claim cannot accrue any earlier than when the indispensable event required to establish the government\u2019s liability has occurred. <em>See Hash v. United States, </em>403 F.3d 1308, 1318 (Fed.Cir.2005) (\u201cOn the railway\u2019s abandonment of its right-of-way these owners were disencumbered of the railway easement, and upon conversion of this land to a public trail, these owners\u2019 property interests were taken for public use, in accordance with the principles set forth in the <em>Preseault </em>cases.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b907-9\">The panel majority errs in holding that the railroad\u2019s \u201cwillingness to negotiate a trail use agreement,\u201d maj. op. at 1377, is an actionable Fifth Amendment taking. Although my colleagues extol the virtues of a \u201cbright line\u201d for accrual of the period of limitations, citing <em>Caldwell v. United States, </em>391 F.3d 1226 (Fed.Cir.2004), then-choice of bright line would vest compensation rights although no taking may ever occur. The issuance of a Notice of Interim Trail Use is not a taking, whether or not railway use has already been abandoned, and independent of when trail use is successfully consummated. For a taking, \u201cthe alleged harm must be actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Whitmore v. Arkansas, </em>495 U.S. 149, 155, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 109 L.Ed.2d 135 (1990). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>As elaborated in <em>Preseault, </em>100 F.3d at 1530 (\u201cWe find no support in Vermont law for the proposition, propounded by the defendants and accepted by the dissent, that the scope of an easement limited to railroad purposes should be read to include public recreational hiking and biking trails.\u201d), liability for a taking is based on the change in use of the easement from railroad use to recreational trail. Until that change is fixed and its occurrence firm, there is no accrual of the right to recover compensation for such taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">To the extent that <em>Caldwell </em>is construed to hold otherwise, as does the panel majority, <em>Caldwell </em>warrants review. We should sit <em>en bane </em>for this purpose, for the government advises that there are some twenty-two pending cases arising from the National Trails System Act. It is appropriate and necessary for this court to clarify the inconsistencies in our precedent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
