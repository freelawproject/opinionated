He contends that this testimony did not qualify under the Fed.R.Evid. 803(10) \u201cabsence of public record or entry\u201d exception to the hearsay rule because Carbajal did not testify that he had performed a diligent search for the records and because there was no evidence that a diligent search had been performed. However, Carbajal need not have specifically testified that a \u201cdiligent search failed to disclose the record,\u201d as long as the testimony and the relevant circumstances reflected an adequate search. <em>See United States v. Wilson, </em>732 F.2d 404, 414 (5th Cir.1984). The evidence indicates that a diligent search of both of the names by which Valdez was known and their corresponding alien registration numbers was performed by Carbajal. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Valdez\u2019s hearsay objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Valdez argues that the district court violated the Confrontation Clause by admitting, over his objection, copies of two warrants of deportation. He argues that these warrants constitute \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and were not admissible because there was no showing that the persons who completed the warrants were unavailable for trial and because those persons were not previously subject to cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">In <em>United States v. Rueda-Rivera, </em>396 F.3d 678, 680 (5th Cir.2005), this court stated generally that documents in a defendant\u2019s immigration file are analogous to nontestimonial business records. In <em>United States v. Quezada, </em>754 F.2d 1190, 1194-95 (5th Cir.1985), this court held that a warrant of deportation contained in an alien\u2019s INS file properly was admitted under Fed.R.Evid. 803(8)(B), determining that, a warrant of deportation was reliable and admissible because the official preparing the warrant had no motivation to do anything other than \u201cmechanically register an unambiguous factual matter.\u201d In light of these cases and the nature of warrants of deportation, we hold that warrants of deportation do not constitute testimonial hearsay under <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Valdez argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level by 16 levels based on his prior commission of a crime of violence. He contends that the Texas offense of burglary of a habitation, for which he had been convicted in the past, is not a crime of violence because it does not have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another and because it is not equivalent to the enumerated offense of burglary of a dwelling. Valdez acknowledges that this issue is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 457 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Dec. 15, 2005) (No. 05-8542), but he asserts that he is raising the issue to preserve it for further review. <em>Garcia-Mendez </em>considered the Texas burglary of a habitation statute and held that \u201c \u2018burglary of a habitation\u2019 is equivalent to the enumerated [crime of violence] offense of \u2018burglary of a dwelling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, as Valdez concedes, under the existing precedent of this court, the district court did not err in determining that Valdez\u2019s prior burglary offense was a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>Valdez\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Valdez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Valdez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
