McLean\u2019s claim petition, asserting its policy was not in effect on the day of the accident, and moved to strike its name from the claim petition as the alleged carrier for the respondent company. After protracted litigation on this issue the judge of compensation ruled that coverage by Travelers was owed to S &amp; L Steel Company for the June 23, 1970 accident sustained by McLean. Following submission to him of affidavits of costs and services by S &amp; L Steel\u2019s New Jersey and Pennsylvania counsel, the judge of compensation awarded attorney\u2019s fees of $3,000 plus $55 costs to S &amp; L\u2019s New Jersey counsel, and $1,700 plus $626.97 costs to its Pennsylvania counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Generally speaking, the New Jersey Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation is a statutory tribunal which can exercise only those powers which are legislatively conferred upon it or such as are by fair implication incident to the authority expressly granted. <em>Conway v. Mister Softee, Inc., </em>51 <em>N. J. </em>254, 258 (1968). In <em>Mulhearn v. Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>356, 365-6 (1949), Chief Justice Vanderbilt speaking for our Supreme Court, detailed many \u201ccourt\u201d attributes of the Division hut concluded that \u25a0the Division was not a \u201ccourt\u201d but an administrative tribunal in a department of the Executive Branch of State Government. See also, <em>Bonafield v. Cahill, </em>125 <em>N. J. Super. </em>78 (Ch. Div. 1973), aff\u2019d 127 <em>N. J. Super. </em>149 (App. Div. 1974). The statutory authority, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-64, for the discretionary award of attorney\u2019s fees to a successful employee-petitioner does not reach the situation presently before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">It is apparent that if the coverage question disputed by the employer and its insurer had initially been brought to the Superior Court for resolution rather than to the Division as authorized by <em>Williams v. Bituminous Cas. Corp., </em>51 <em>N. J. </em>146, 152 (1948), the court could allow attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>to the employer if successful in the action. <em>R. </em>4:43-9 (a) (6). It would be anomalous to hold that the successful employer is barred from recovering his attorney\u2019s lees and costs from the Division, thus making the choice of forum dispositive of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The employer has been put to effort and expense in litigating the question of insurance coverage. Under these peculiar circumstances, equitable considerations require the insurer to pay a reasonable counsel fee and all out-of-pocket expenses in connection with the same. <em>Cf. Hodes v. Oak Flooring Co., </em>43 <em>N. J. </em>359, 367 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Travelers Insurance Company, in the alternative, contends the attorney\u2019s fees allowed below to S &amp; L Steel\u2019s in-state and out-of-state counsel should be examined closely as to their reasonableness in view of the duplicity of legal services in the context of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">We have reviewed the record in its entirety in light of the affidavits of services filed below by the attorneys for S &amp; L Steel Company and have concluded the awards are excessive and should be reduced to a total fee of $3,000 exclusive of costs, $3,000 of which is allocated to the firm of Milstead and Kidgway and $1,000 to the firm of Fine, Staud, Grossman and Garfinkle.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Accordingly, the amended order of the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation dated October 31, 1974 is modified to order the Travelers Insurance Company to pay attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of S &amp; L Steel Company as follows: Milstead and Eidgway, P.A., attorney\u2019s fees $3,000, costs $55, total $3,055; Fine, Staud, Grossman and Garfinkle, attorney\u2019s fees $1,000, costs $636.97, total $1,636.97. The order as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
