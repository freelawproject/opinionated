The desk was in defendant\u2019s office at police headquarters. The traffic tickets had been issued some months before to another police officer in the department and, after the seizure, that officer and defendant were both indicted for (a) conspiracy \u201cto fix\u201d traffic tickets, (b) obstructing justice and (c) misconduct in office.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The testimony in this case makes it difficult to discern the reason for entering defendant\u2019s office at one o\u2019clock in the morning, breaking open his locked desk and searching through his papers until incriminating evidence was found. Police Chief Harold Melleby testified at the hearing on the \u2019motion to suppress that the traffic tickets were found on top \u2022of the desk (a \"plain view\u201d claim) and that the desk was .not broken open. This evidence was contradicted by the City Attorney, Martin E. McKernan, Jr., who was called as a -witness by the trial judge. McKernan\u2019s persuasive and credible testimony was accepted by the trial judge. Appellant \u2022does not now dispute that the tickets were found after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>desk had been broken open. However, appellant contends that the search was justified as an administrative search by an employer \u201cto monitor and supervise the activities of his subordinate,\u201d and that it was not part of a criminal investigation of defendant as found by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The police chief testified as to the background of this search and seizure conducted in the early morning hours of August 6, 1974. He had previously begun disciplinary proceedings against defendant based upon unrelated matters. Thereafter the chief received reports of emotional outbursts by defendant and of an assault by defendant upon defendant\u2019s wife during a quarrel. The chief claimed that he also received word that defendant was removing some files from his office and had compiled \u201cdossiers\u201d \u25a0\u2014 the gathering of information \u2014 on himself, Detective Kelly and a Mr. Senator e of the County Prosecutor\u2019s Office. (Mr. Finnegan, an Assistant County Prosecutor, may also have been the subject of a reported dossier.) However, Chief Melle'by denied that he was \u201ctoo concerned\u201d over that information being removed by defendant from his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">On August 5, 1974, following defendant\u2019s alleged assault on his wife, the chief consulted with the city attorney, expressing his concern about further violent outbursts by defendant. McKernan then went to see defendant at defendant\u2019s office. At McKernan\u2019s suggestion defendant surrendered his service revolver and made an appointment to see a psychiatrist either for therapy or to verify his sanity. Mc-Kernan also asked defendant for the alleged dossiers but defendant said he had none. They both then left defendant\u2019s office. McKernan returned to the chief\u2019s office, handed over defendant\u2019s service revolver, reported on defendant\u2019s appointment with a psychiatrist and said that the problem was solved.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Despite this the chief said he wanted \u201cto go through\u201d defendant\u2019s office. He asked McKernan\u2019s opinion as to his right to do so. McKernan said he had that right but there was no point in going there at that hour (it was then 10:30 p.m.), and if there was any fear of defendant removing any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>thing from the office, a guard could he posted at the door until morning. However, this did not satisfy the chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The chief called Einnegan and advised McKernan that Einnegan was leaving Margate and was on his way. McKernan asked what Einnegan was going to do and was told that Einnegan would talk to him when he got there. While waiting for Einnegan, McKernan advised the chief against \u201callowing the prosecutor \u2014\u25a0 for us allowing, accommodating and actually providing entrance into a City office for the prosecutor\u2019s office to go through without some kind of a search warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Finally, Einnegan and Senatore arrived. Einnegan said he ought to get into the office and McKernan told him to get a search warrant. It was then midnight. They discussed getting a search warrant the next morning and McKernan said he would not oppose the application. During this discussion efforts were being made to pry open the office door but they were unsuccessful. McKernan\u2019s testimony described the events from this point on as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">Chief Melleby instructed someone to contact Deputy Chief Ferrari\u2019s secretary and order her to come there with the key. So during all this time. As I say, Mr. Finnegan and I were talking, discussing, at times heatedly the entrance of the prosecutor\u2019s office into the Deputy Chief\u2019s office and Mr. Finnegan was indicating this was an obstruction of criminal investigation and so forth and I said that -I really didn\u2019t feel that I was obstructing anything; that my task was simply to insure the fact that the City was not opening itself to any kind of liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">Well, finally, Mr. Finnegan said to me, \u201cI want to tell you that there are, in that office, things which are potentially and immediately damaging to the people of the City of Camden and the people of the County of Camden.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">I said, \u201cWell, Jim, what do you mean?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">He said, \u201cThings that could cause, immediately, violence; things that are very damaging at this moment and cannot wait.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">I got the distinct feeling that whatever was in there couldn\u2019t wait for a search warrant the following morning. I didn\u2019t know what to expect to find in there and I said, I can recall distinctly saying to him, \u201cAre you representing this as an attorney and this is the truth?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-11\">He said. \u201cTes.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>I said, \u201cAre you representing this as a member of the prosecutor\u2019s office?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">He said, \u201cTes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">I said, \u201cWell, in the face of that representation, I can see no\u201d \u25a0\u2014 I said, \u201cI think that the City\u2019s interest, in protecting itself from civil liability, must, given the emergent situation you have presented, must yield * *\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">So, by this time, Deputy Chief Ferrari\u2019s secretary had arrived and she opened the office and that\u2019s how we came to be in the office. During the time I was discussing this with Mr. Finnegan, he also talked about the dossiers and the fact that these dossiers were around and I said, Well, I thought that I said, \u201cMy problem is not the dossiers. I don\u2019t see what the City\u2019s interest is in the dossiers. * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The search party consisted of Chief Melleby, Captain Pauli of the Camden Police Department, Assistant Prosecutor Finnegan and Senatore of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office, with McKernan in attendance. The compartment on one side of the desk was locked and a crowbar or tire iron was obtained and the door was broken open. Piles of paper were removed from the desk and examined. Among them were found the unprocessed traffic tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">The trial judge concluded that the search was for evidence of illegal activity on defendant\u2019s part and was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">* <em>tr </em>* part of a criminal investigation and was not mere supervision of defendant\u2019s work. * * * Additionally, the suspicion of criminal activity, the forcible entry, and the late hour completely remove from consideration the possibility that those who conducted the search were looking for items necessary to conduct the day-to-day business of the police department.\u201d [136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 68]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">Apparently, after discovering the traffic tickets the searchers left without taking any files or other papers pertaining to the business of the police department. The conclusion of the trial judge that this was a search for incriminating evidence to be used against defendant, and not a private search for the purposes of defendant\u2019s employer, is amply supported by the evidence. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N. J. </em>146, 162 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>In these circumstances, we have no need to pass upon the right, in the abstract, of a police officer to search the locked office and desk of a subordinate employee for. business purposes. Cf<em>. United States v. Bunkers, </em>521 <em>F. </em>2d 1217 (9 Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Nasser, </em>476 <em>F. </em>2d 1111 (7 Cir. 1973); <em>Shaffer v. Field, </em>339 <em>F. Supp. </em>997 (C. D. Cal. 1972), aff\u2019d, 484 <em>F. </em>2d 1196 (9 Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Donato, 2</em>69 <em>F. Supp. </em>921 (E. D. Pa.), aff\u2019d o. b., 379 <em>F. </em>2d 288 (3 Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\"> In these circumstances defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy against the intrusion into his locked desk by law enforcement officers investigating his possible criminal activity, examining and seizing papers and effects which he kept there. <em>Mancusi v. DeForte, </em>392 <em>U. S. </em>364, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>2120, 20 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1154 (1968); <em>United States v. Blok, </em>88 <em>U. S. App. D. C. </em>326, 188 <em>F. </em>2d 1019 (1951); see <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 <em>U. S. </em>347, 88 <em>S. Ct. </em>507, 19 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 576 (1967).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the State has failed to prove that the warrantless search was a private search by an employer of facilities occupied by his employee. The search and seizure \u201cresulted from unlawful concert of action\u201d on the part of Chief Melleby and Assistant Prosecutor Pinnegan. <em>State v. Scrotsky, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>410, 416 (1963). Therefore, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\"> In <em>Mancusi </em>the right was upheld despite the fact that the defendant shared his office with other employees. Here, we note, not only was defendant\u2019s desk locked, but the door to his office was also locked and only he and his secretary had a key.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
