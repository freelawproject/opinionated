The trial judge held that the order to pay out of income, being first in time, had priority and that the wage execution be suspended while the earlier order remains in effect. Household Finance Corporation (HF'C), the creditor who obtained the wage execution, appeals from that determination. HFC contends that the wage execution has priority or, in the alternative, that it should be honored concurrently with the order to pay out of income.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On June 5, 1974 HEC obtained a judgment in the Salem County District Court against the debtor, Walter H. Clevenger, and on July 8, 1974 the judgment was docketed in the Superior Court. Meanwhile, on June 18, 1974 Hitchner\u2019s Furniture Store (Hitchner) obtained a judgment in the Salem County District Court against the same debtor, and on June 25, 1974 that court entered an order directing the debtor to make installment payments out of income to satisfy the judgment. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-64. The debtor has been making payments in accordance with that order. Thereafter, on July 24, 1974 HFC obtained an order for a wage execution against the debtor to satisfy its judgment. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-50 to 56. Pursuant to the order for wage execution, the Sheriff of Salem County levied upon the wages of the debtor at his place of employment, Hygrade Bakery. The employer commenced to make deductions from the debtor\u2019s wages and transmitted them to the sheriff under the wage execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">When it came to the attention of the judge that the two orders were operating simultaneously, he, on his own motion directed Hitchner and HEC to appear so that the priority of the orders could he determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>A wage execution authorized by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :17-50 <em>et seq. </em>(Article 7 of Chapter 17, <em>Title </em>2A) is the most direct but is not the exclusive mode of reaching a debtor\u2019s wages to satisfy a judgment against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-64 provides that if a judgment debtor is entitled to or is in receipt of income, property, rights and credits, including income derived from federal, state, county, municipal or other governmental sources, but not income or property exempt by law, the debtor may be ordered to pay the judgment in installments out of such proceeds and on such terms as the court may direct. This section is part of Article 8, Chapter 17 of <em>Title </em>2A, the first section of which, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-57, defines \u201crights and credits\u201d to include wages. <em>White v. Koehler, </em>70 <em>N. J. L. </em>526 (Sup. Ct. 1904), held that salary is income within the meaning of <em>L. </em>1901, c. 177, from which <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-64 is derived. See also, <em>Russell v. Mechanics Realty Co., </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>532 (Sup. Ct. 1916), where a judgment creditor first obtained an order under the 1901 act compelling a debtor to pay a judgment in installments out of his wages. Later, after the adoption of the wage execution provisions of <em>L. </em>1915, <em>c. </em>266 (the source of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A: 17-50 <em>et seq.), </em>the creditor obtained an order for a wage execution in place of the original order to pay out of income. The court held that the proceeding first invoked could be abandoned and was superseded by the wage execution. The case suggests that these are alternate procedures of equal stature. See also <em>R. </em>4:59-1(c) (2). The wage execution is levied upon the employer; the order to pay is directed to the debtor himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-50 provides that when the wages or income or profits due to the debtor are $48 or more a week,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>\u201cthe court <em>shall </em>grant an order directing that an execution issue against the wages * * (Emphasis supplied). Appellant contends that the issuance of the order for a wage execution is mandatory, and, therefore, the Legislature must have intended the wage execution to take precedence over or, at the very least, be honored concurrently with a prior order to pay out of income. In support of the contention that two forms of execution can apply simultaneously, appellants refer to the provisions in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :17-57:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">Nothing contained in this article or in article 7 <em>[N. J. S. A. </em>2A: 17-50 to 56] shall be construed as impairing the rights of an execution creditor under other provisions of this chapter or any law of this state relating to executions, or as against any trust which was created by or the fund held in trust has proceeded from the defendant in execution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We agree with the conclusions of the trial judge and reject appellant\u2019s contentions. Neither mode of reaching wages has precedence over the other, but the order issued first in time will prevail until the judgment upon which it was entered is satisfied. This result conforms to the legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The statutes should be read harmoniously, <em>in pari materia, </em>as they deal with kindred modes of execution available to all judgment creditors. <em>Cf. Cowan v. Storms, </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>336, 343 (Sup. Ct. 1938). Significantly, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-52 provides that \u201cOnly one execution against the wages, debts, earnings, salary, income from trust funds or profits of such judgment debtor shall be satisfied at one time,\u201d and when more than one execution is issued \u201cpursuant to * * * this article [Article 7]\u201d against the debtor \u201cthey shall be satisfied in the order of priority in which such executions are presented to the person or persons from whom such wages * * * are due and owing * * This section further provides, as a result of an amendment made by <em>L. </em>1969, <em>c. </em>292, \u00a7 2, that an execution derived from an order for support of a wife or children shall take precedence if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>served on the same day as the wage execution, even if resented later in the day. Moreover, the statutory scheme is to limit an order to pay and a wage execution to 10% of the debtor\u2019s wages, unless the wages exceed $7,500 a year, in which case the court may order a larger percentage. Identical limitations are found in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :17-56 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-57, by virtue of the amendment to both sections made in 1970 by the same enactment. <em>L. </em>1970, <em>c. </em>287.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The provision relating to an execution to satisfy a support order, the imposition of limits on the portion of wages that may be taken from- a debtor and the provision that' only one wage execution shall be satisfied at one time express a singular legislative intent. That, intent prohibits \u25a0satisfaction of two executions at one time in excess of the prescribed statutory limits when the source of income is the debtor\u2019s wages. The wage execution procedure has no predominant force; it must yield, for example, to an execution upon wages to satisfy a support order presented at any time on the same day as the wage execution. An order to pay out of income and a wage execution combined cannot take more than 10% of a debtor\u2019s wages, unless the annual wage exceeds $7500. Although the statute provides that an order for a wage execution \u201cshall\u201d be granted, satisfaction of the wage execution must be suspended if a prior wage execution is in effect. And the provision in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17 \u2014 55 that the court may modify the order for execution \u201cas shall be deemed just\u201d upon application of either party demonstrates that the Legislature did not intend to give wage executions, an inflexible, mandatory effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We hold that once an order to pay out of income has been entered compelling payment of 10% of a judgment debtor\u2019s wages (of under $7500 a year) a wage execution cannot be satisfied while the prior order to pay remains in effect. We find nothing to the contrary in <em>Berkowitz v. First Dist. Court, </em>108 <em>N. J. L. </em>345 (E. &amp; A. 1931), cited by appellant. The provision in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:17-50 that an order for wage execution \u201cshall\u201d be granted was intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>require its issuance in the ordinary course, not to supersede any prior process against the debtor\u2019s wages. We have previously noted the provision in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A: 17-57 (in Article 8, Chapter 17 of <em>Title </em>2A), that nothing in that article dealing with orders to pay out of income, nor in Article 7, dealing with wage executions, shall impair the rights of an execution creditor under any <em>other </em>provision of law relating to executions. This was intended merely to preserve <em>other </em>means of proceeding against the assets of a debtor, notwithstanding the right to apply for a wage execution or order to pay out of income. It does not mean that a wage execution has priority over other modes of reaching the debtor\u2019s wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\"><em> Cf. </em>15 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1671-1677, providing restrictions on wage executions. <em>R. </em>4:59-1(c) incorporates these restrictions in addition to those imposed by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :17-50 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A: 17-57.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
