J. Super. </em>384 (Law Div. 1975). However, we wish to comment briefly on the following paragraph in the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">To suggest that \u201cfamilies\u201d composed of residents of group homes are to be distinguished from natural families in determining which single-family districts will be considered open to them is to confuse the power to control physical use of premises with <em>the power to distinguish among occupants making the same physical use of them. </em>\u201cIt is of the very nature of the constitutional and statutory zoning principle that all property in like circumstances be treated alike.\u201d <em>Beirn v. Morris, 14 N. J. </em>529, 535 (1954). [at 391; emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">To the extent that the emphasized portion of the above excerpt suggests that a municipality, in the exercise of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>zoning powers, may not under any circumstances or for any legitimate zoning purpose distinguish among occupants making the same physical nse of single-family dwellings, we would consider it overly broad. See, <em>e. g., Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, </em>416 <em>U. S. </em>1, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>1536, 39 <em>L. Ed. </em>3d 797 (1974). <em>Kirsch Holding Co. v. Manasquan, </em>59 <em>N. J. </em>341 (1971), is not necessarily in conflict, since the ordinances there involved were held to be \u201csweepingly excessive, and therefore legally unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
