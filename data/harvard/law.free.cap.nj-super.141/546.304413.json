J. S. A. </em>2A :171-5.8. After a trial <em>de novo </em>on the record, the conviction was affirmed in the Monmouth County Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Defendant appeals, presenting the following issues as it has framed them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">Point I \u2014 The complaints are insufficient as a matter of law. They did not adequately apprise the defendant of the charges against it. Further, the complaints did not eharge a crime because they did not negative the exceptions in the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">Point II \u2014 The State did not carry its burden of proof. No evidence was oifered that the defendant was not within any exceptions set forth in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:171-5.8.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">Point <em>III </em>\u2014 N. <em>J. S. A. </em>2A.T71-5.8 should be declared unconstitutional since the exception in the statute for \u201cworks of necessity and charity\u201d is unconstitutionally vague.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">We have carefully reviewed each of the arguments presented and have concluded that they are clearly without merit. Defendant has additionally contended in a supplemental brief, recently filed, that the classification of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :171-5.8 is arbitrary and not reasonably related to the legislative goal of the statute, and is thus unconstitutional. This issue has been decided adversely to defendant\u2019s position in <em>State v. Monteleone, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>93 (1961), and <em>Two Guys from Harrison, Inc. v. Furman, </em>32 <em>N. J. </em>199 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">The conviction is affirmed essentially for the reasons expressed by Judge Yaccarino in his opinion reported at 134 <em>N. J. Super. </em>76 (Cty. Ct. 1975).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
