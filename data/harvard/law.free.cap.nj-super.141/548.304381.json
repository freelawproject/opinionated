J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ASZ\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in tort against defendant was dismissed below on the ground that New Jersey did not have personal jurisdiction over defendant. They appeal, asserting that defendant\u2019s advertising in travel books which the American Automobile Association (AAA) furnished without cost to its members was a sufficient \u201ccontact\u201d to invoke so-called \u201clong-arm\u201d service and personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Plaintiffs urge us to examine the nature of the advertising thus appearing. Having done that, we understand their anxiety and petition in this regard, for careful consideration of the total circumstances involved conduces to the view that advertising of this nature does indeed exceed the \u201cminimal contact\u201d necessary for long-arm jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">Significant among these circumstances is that the advertising thus appearing is substantially more than a solicitation of business. In addition to being all of that, it is accompanied by AAA assurances that \u201cOfficial Appointment\u201d listings, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>which defendant was one, are of the one-out-of-seven-seen which meets high AAA standards, that each has been \u201cpersonalty\u201d measured and that the therein published rates and services are guaranteed by the endorsed facility to AAA members even as against a change in rates between publications of the volume. Beyond this such officially appointed hotel, motel, resort or restaurant must also pay a \u201cmodest annual fee.\u201d The persuasive attraction of the advertising itself is enhanced by the affirmative endorsement and guarantee of the prestigious American Automobile Association. The guarantees of the presentation sounding more in contract than anything else, this is no \u201cmere inclusion of an advertisement in a publication,\u201d as defendant argues.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"> The following appears in Restatement, <em>Conflict of Laws </em>2d, \u00a7 37 at 156 (1971):<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">Causing Effects in State by Act Done Elsewhere A state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over an individual who causes effects in the state by an act done elsewhere with respect to any cause of action arising from these effects unless the nature of the effects and of the individual\u2019s relationship to the state make the exercise of such jurisdiction unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">We observe that this statement does not even require that the \u201ceffects\u201d be causativety intended. It needs only that they occur. If this is the law in New Jersey^ as we believe it to be, then <em>a fortiori </em>do we have jurisdiction where, as here, the advertising was by its very nature intended to and did in fact cause \u201ceffects\u201d in this State. This \u201ceffects\u201d concept was recognized in <em>Avdel Corp. v. </em>Mecure, 58 <em>N. J. </em>264 at 268 (1971), in which our Supreme Court also observed that, \u201cwe will allow out-of-state service to the uttermost limits permitted by the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Defendant urges that most of the cases defining the long-arm reach from New Jersey have \u201ca much more substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>connection with New Jersey than the case at bar.\u201d The truth of this statement does not diminish the proposition that all that is required is \u201cminimum contacts with it [the forum] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend Traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>International Shoe Co. v. </em>Washington, 326 <em>U. S. </em>310, 316, 66 <em>S. Ct. </em>154, 158, 90 <em>L. Ed. </em>95 (1945). We are satisfied that no such offense results from the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Nor does the fact that previous eases have, for the most part, involved a physical intrusion into New Jersey beyond seductive advertising militate against our policy, accurately described (in a totally different context) in <em>Foris v. Foris, </em>103 <em>N. J. Super. </em>316, 323 (Ch. Div. 1968), as one designed \u201cto obtain, within constitutional limits, jurisdiction over a party defendant in the commercial world in the interest of protecting its citizens.\u201d Noticed there also was \u201cthe State\u2019s interest in the commercial sphere to protect its citizens by diminishing the harsh and arbitrary effect of state boundaries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The policy pronouncements and the standards implicit in <em>Roche v. Floral Rental Corp., </em>95 <em>N. J. Super. 555 </em>(App. Div. 1967), aff\u2019d o. b. <em>51 N. J. </em>26 (1968), which also recognized the wisdom of <em>Phillips v. Anchor Hocking Glass Corp., </em>100 Ariz. 251, 413 P. 2d 732 (Sup. Ct. 1966), are here achieved. We see no valid distinction, in a case where persuasion in New Jersey by a purveyor of goods or services induces our citizenry to the acceptance of those goods or services, based upon where the use occurs. Nor do we see any policy reason to draw a line because a printing press can be shipped to New Jersey but a New York resort cannot. See <em>VanEeuwen v. Heidelberg Eastern, Inc., </em>124 <em>N. J.

Mecure, </em>58 <em>N. J. </em>264, 268 (1971), the relevant question here, as always, is whether there were contacts with this State by the nonresident defendant, and, if so, whether they were sufficient reasonably to justify jurisdiction over him in an action related to those contacts. <em>Id. </em>at 269. It has been pointed out that there is no objective test by which to judge the facts of a particular case to determine if the assertion of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction exceeds the limits of constitutional due process, and that United States Supreme Court cases after <em>International Shoe </em>have failed to develop any precise standard as to what those \u201cminimum contacts\u201d must be. <em>Benjamin v. Western Boat Building Corp., </em>472 <em>F. </em>2d 723, 725 (5 Cir. 1973); <em>cert. </em>den. 414 <em>U. S. </em>830, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>60, 38 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 64 (1973). It is thus clear that \u201ceach case which raises questions of \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 * * * must be decided on its own peculiar and particular set of facts,\u201d <em>Olif v. Kiamesha Concord, Inc., </em>106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>121, 124 (Law Div. 1969), rather than \u201cin a statement of dogmatic rules of all-inclusive principles.\u201d See <em>Velandra v. Regie Nationale des Usines Renault, </em>336 <em>F. </em>2d 292, 295 (6 Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">A broad test is set forth in <em>International Shoe:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">It is evident that the criteria by which we mark the boundary line between those activities which justify the subjection of a corporation to suit, and those which do not cannot be simply mechanical or quantitative. The test is not merely, as has sometimes been suggested, whether the activity, which the corporation has seen fit to procure through its agents in another state, is a little more or a little less. * * * Whether due process is satisfied must depend largely upon the quality and nature of the activity in relation to the fair and orderly administration of the laws which it was the purpose of the due process clause to insure. That clause does not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties or relations. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">But to the extent that a corporation exercises the privilege of conducting activities within a state, it enjoys the benefits and protection of the laws of that state. The exercise of that privilege may give rise to obligations; and, so far as those obligations arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>out of or are connected with the activities within the state, a procedure which requires the corporation to respond to a suit brought to enforce them can, in most instances, hardly be said to undue. [326 <em>U. S. </em>at 319, 66 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 159.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">It is important, however, to pause momentarily at this point to note the <em>caveat </em>in <em>Hanson v. </em>Denckla, 357 <em>U. S. </em>235, 251, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>1228, 2 <em>L.

They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States. However minimal the burden of defending in a foreign tribunal, a defendant may not be called upon to do so unless he has had the \u201cminimal contacts\u201d with that State that are a prerequisite to its exercise of power over him.

S. </em>at 253, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>at 1240; emphasis supplied]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">The facts in this case are gleaned from the affidavits submitted in support of and in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion. I accept their accuracy for the purpose of this discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">Defendant Prank Prosser owns and operates the Green Haven Resort Motel in Lake George, New York. On August 23, 1973 plaintiff Ronald Blessing, a resident of this State, was a guest at the motel. He allegedly sustained bodily injury as the result of a fall on the premises and brought suit here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>(his wife joining <em>per </em>quod) to recover damages from defendant. Service of a copy of the summons and complaint was effected by forwarding the same to defendant at his New York address by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The affidavit filed in behalf of defendant is essentially worthless. It does no more than relate his ownership of the motel, the occurrence of the accident there, and the resultant suit and service of process. It is not disputed, however, that the motel was listed at the time of these events (and may still be) in the accommodations section of the Northeastern Tours Book, a publication of the American Automobile Association (AAA), which contains travel information relating to New York and the New England states. According to the explanatory material in the book, AAA field representatives search for accommodations and restaurants which meet the association\u2019s requirements for recommendation to its membership. Apparently one out of seven satisfies the standards. Every approved accommodation is then listed in a tour book (a number are published, each for a different section of the United States) under the nearest city or community, together with its location, a description of the facilities, and the AAA rating of good, very good, excellent or outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">In addition to being listed, those selected become eligible for the association\u2019s \u201cOfficial Appointment Service,\u201d which, for a \u201cmodest annual fee,\u201d entitles them to display the emblem on the premises and to use it in advertising. The emblem is also placed alongside the listing in the tour book. In return, rates and services must be guaranteed to AAA members.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The motel here involved was an \u201cofficially appointed\u201d accommodation, as indicated by the AAA emblem next to the listing. It is to be noted, however, that the motel was one of a number grouped alphabetically under the caption \u201cLake George.\u201d All those on the tour book page in the record before us display the emblem. Since the list is obviously incomplete, one cannot tell whether there are others that do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>It appears, further, that an establishment may purchase advertising space in the book for the further exposition of its facilities. Defendant here had no such advertisment in the tour book at the time here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Plaintiff, an AAA member, alleged in his affidavit that he first became aware of defendant\u2019s motel by reason of its listing in the annual Northeastern Tour Book, a copy of which he received each Spring. He said further that upon inquiry at the Elorham Park, New Jersey, office of AAA he was told that other members had used the accommodation and found it satisfactory. He added that as a result \u201cof the aforesaid listing in AAA Tour Book as an approved establishment and my further inquiry and literature on defendant establishment, I was persuaded to use this accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">My colleagues find from these facts \u201cadvertising\u201d by the plaintiff which is \u201csubstantially more than a solicitation of business,\u201d and which \u201cdoes indeed exceed the \u2018minimal contact\u2019 necessary for longarm jurisdiction.\u201d Their concept seems to be that the listing is an advertisement which is inserted in the tour book by the establishment itself. It is not. As indicated earlier, it is the AAA which determines for the information and convenience of its members which accommodations are to be listed. The listing is an assurance by the AAA that the accommodation is the one out of every seven which, after inspection, meets AAA\u2019s high standards. It is not, however, a guarantee of the published rates and services.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Such listing is separate and distinct from, and not dependent upon, the purchase of the optional privilege of displaying the AAA emblem alongside the listing and generally in the establishment\u2019s advertising. It is the acquisition and display of the emblem which constitutes a guarantee of Tates and services. But it does not appear that every establishment listed in the tour book also displays the emblem.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">I hasten to add that these comments are in no way intended to be dispositive of the case. They merely place the facts in a clearer and more accurate perspective. The issue remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the same. Specifically, it is this: Where an informational booklet such as the one here involved, covering a geographic area not including New Jersey (but available here) is published by a national automobile association for the convenience of its members, and contains a listing of recommended motels and other accommodations, some of which are permitted to display the association\u2019s recognized symbol, and a New Jersey resident, presumably (in this case) planning a vacation trip to a resort area in the State of New York, consults the publication and selects a particular motel in that place from among those listed displaying the AAA emblem, and sustains an injury while a guest at that motel, does the motel on these facts have sufficient minimum contacts with this State to support long-arm service of process in connection with a suit for damages instituted by the injured person in this jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The majority is of the view that there such minimum contacts with this State do exist. ,But if one strips from their opinion such self-serving and hyperbolic phrases as \u201cpersuasive attraction of the advertising,\u201d \u201cenhanced by the affirmative endorsement and guarantee of the prestigious American Automobile Association,\u201d \u201cseductive advertising,\u201d and the like, what remains is the concept that jurisdiction vests \u201cwhere, as here, the advertising was by its very nature intended to and did cause \u2018effects\u2019 in this State,\u201d citing <em>Restatementl, Conflict of Laws </em>2d, \u00a7 37 at 156 (1971). I find no support for this conclusion either in the facts of the case or in applicable law. The majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Avdel Corp. v. Mecure, </em>supra, is misplaced. In fact, it clearly points the other way.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In <em>Avdel </em>defendant, a resident of New York, ordered rivets from plaintiff, a New Jersey corporation. The subsequent lawsuit was to recover an amount allegedly due on a book account for materials sold and delivered. The affidavits submitted by plaintiff in opposition to defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto dismiss the complaint for lack of <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction\u201d disclosed that defendant entered this State to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>cuss his contract with plaintiff, and that he and members of his family travelled to plaintiff\u2019s plant in New Jersey to return many of the rivets which had been purchased. The court had no difficulty</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-4\">* * <em>* </em>in holding defendant amenable to suit in this state since he ordered a product which he knew would have substantial business effects in this state, and followed up his order with numerous contacts here in relation to that contract. In other words, he purposefully availed himself of the opportunity to engage in a commercial transaction involving activities in this state. See <em>Hanson v. Denckla, supra, </em>357 U. S. at 253, 78 S. <em>Ct. </em>at 1239, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d at 1298. * * * [58 <em>N. J. </em>at 273]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The court\u2019s approach in <em>Avdel </em>was a recognition of the principle that \u201ca nonresident defendant who is not doing business in a state in the traditional sense may nonetheless be amenable to suit in that state <em>where he enters into a contract which will have significant effects in that state </em>[emphasis supplied].\u201d 58 <em>N. J. </em>at 272. See <em>McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., </em>355 <em>U. S. </em>199, 223, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>199, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 223 (1957); <em>cf. J. W. Sparks &amp; Co. v. Gallos, supra. </em>See also <em>Trustees Structural Steel v. Huber, </em>136 <em>N. J. Super. </em>501, 506 (App. Div. 1975), certif. den. 70 <em>N. J. </em>143 (1976); <em>Govan v.

Super. </em>395, 403 (Law Div. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">I do not mean to imply that subjecting a nonresident to the jurisdiction of our courts through long-arm service- of process is limited to that which results from a contract. The expanding law on the subject embraces far more than that. The cases, however, are so varied in nature and scope that a detailed examination of each would require an unnecessary expenditure of time and effort. Illustratively, however, sufficient minimum contacts have been found in these instances: out-of-state manufacture of truck bodies to be installed on chassis where normal usage would almost in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>evitably bring the product into this State <em>(Roche v. Floral Rental Corp., </em>95 <em>N. J. Super. </em>555 (App. Div. 1967)); receipt by clinical pathologists\u2019 society based in Illinois of application for certification from New Jersey residents, publishing technical bulletin, and conducting examinations here <em>(Higgins v. American Soc. of Clinical Pathologists, </em>94 <em>N. J. Super. </em>243 (App. Div. 1967), rev\u2019d on other grounds 51 <em>N. J. </em>191 (1968)); shipment of goods into New Jersey which were purchased here by a New Jersey resident but caused injury in Connecticut to a Connecticut resident <em>(Roland v. Modells Shoppers World of Bergen Cty., </em>supra); personal injury negligence action arising out of collapse of patio deck against owner-builder who had sold house to plaintiff and then moved out of the State <em>(Egan v. Fieldhouse, </em>139 <em>N. J. Super. </em>220 (Law Div. 1976)); action against German manufacturer for injuries from allegedly defective printing press sold to an independent New Jersey distributor and then sold to plaintiff\u2019s employer <em>(Certisimo v. Heidelberg Company, </em>122 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 (Law Div. 1972), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. Van Eeuwen v. Heidelberg Eastern, Inc., </em>124 <em>N. J. Super. </em>251 (App. Div. 1973)); injury to plaintiff in swimming pool accident when defendant, a nonresident, jumped from a diving board, where sole contact with this State was defendant\u2019s visit here at the time <em>(Knight v. San Jacinto Club, Inc., </em>96 <em>N. J. Super. </em>81 (Law Div. 1967)); where Michigan distributor of diesel engines manufactured by an Indiana corporation installed one in Michigan in a tractor owned by a New Jersey resident, and the engine exploded while the vehicle was in this State, injuring the driver, long-arm service on the Michigan corporation was sufficient, it appearing that there was a distributor of the engines in New Jersey with which it had frequent-dealings <em>(Hoagland v. Springer, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">In each of the cited cases the facts met the applicable standards summarized in Note 47 <em>Geo. L. J. </em>342 (1958), and referred to in <em>Hoagland v. Springer, supra, </em>74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 280-281: (1) the nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction within the forum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>and a single event will suffice if its effects within the State are substantial enough to qualify under the third standard; (2) the cause of action must be one which arises out of, or results from, the activities of the defendant within the forum; (3) the assumption of jurisdiction based upon such minimum contact must be consonant with the due process tenets of \u201cfair play\u201d and \u201csubstantial justice,\u201d and must be reasonable. Moreover, in the' case of acts done elsewhere, the above rationale is consistent with the principle enunciated in <em>Restatement, Conflict of Laws </em>2d, \u00a7 50 at 178 (1971) (\u201cForeign Corporations \u2014 Causing Effects in State by Act Done Elsewhere\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">A state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over a foreign corporation which causes effects in the state by an act done elsewhere with respect to any cause of action arising from these effects unless the nature of these effects and of the corporation\u2019s relationship to the state makes the exercise of such jurisdiction unreasonable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>I am thoroughly satisfied, in the light of the foregoing, that the facts of the case before us do not support the attempted long-arm service of process. Defendant\u2019s only \u201ccontact\u201d with this State \u2014 if it amounted to that \u2014 was its listing in the tour book coupled with the appended AAA emblem. There was no evidence here of any direct communication with or solicitation of any specific guests in New Jersey. The purported \u201cadvertising\u201d was a peripheral occurrence, the nature and quality of which did not constitute \u201csome act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State.\u201d <em>Cf. Scheldt v. Young, </em>389 F. 2d 58 (3 Cir. 1968). The proofs reveal only that plaintiff saw defendant\u2019s establishment among those listed and, ostensibly because of the AAA emblem, decided to go there. This is hardly the kind of \u201ceffect\u201d contemplated by the <em>Restatement </em>or anjr of the cited cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">By way of contrast, in <em>Schaffer v. Granit Hotel Inc., </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1 (App. Div. 1970), the female plaintiff, a paying guest at defendant hotel in New York State, was injured while using a toboggan run maintained by the hotel. After she returned to her home in New Jersey she instituted suit, service of process upon the defendant being accomplished by sending a copy of the summons and complaint by registered mail to defendant at its place of business. The trial judge granted defendant\u2019s motion to \u201cdismiss the complaint\u201d on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ground that sufficient minimum contacts with this State had not been disclosed. This court reversed the resultant judgment. These facts were noted: Plaintiffs had made their reservations at the hotel through their local Jewish Center, which had a contractual arrangement with the hotel to take groups of people there for winter weekends. The hotel had similar arrangements with 30 to 40 New Jersey Centers. In addition, it advertised in a Newark paper and also in New York papers circulating in this State. We correctly held that this economic entry into this State, coupled with the hotel\u2019s continued advertising campaign and its solicitation of business from our residents, constituted sufficient \u201c\u2018contact\u2019 to comport with the requirements of due process.\u201d Moreover, defendant by its actions purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within this State, thus invoking the benefits and protection of its laws. 110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 5. <em>Cf. Amercoat Corp. v. Reagent Chem. &amp; Research Inc., 108 N. J. Super. </em>331, 334 (App. Div. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">A situation comparable to <em>Schaffer </em>was involved in <em>Oliff v. Kiamesha Concord, Inc., supra. </em>There suit was instituted in behalf of the infant plaintiff to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by her while she and her parents were paying guests at defendant\u2019s hotel located at Kiamesha Lake, New York. Defendant moved unsuccessfully to set aside the long-arm service of process upon it. The proofs disclosed that defendant maintained direct communication with its guests, whether initiated by its own advertising or through a travel agency, \u201cdirectly soliciting the specific New Jersey resident from time to time, and in the very case at bar succeeded in persuading return visits upon receipt of a deposit directly from the guest.\u201d The trial court had no difficulty concluding \u201cthat \u2018The 'Concord\u2019 availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in this State directly to its intended guest and also through travel agents to whom it paid commissions.\u201d 106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>In my view, the thread purporting to link defendant in this case to New Jersey was too tenuous to constitute a \u201cminimum contact\u201d sufficient to support the long-arm service of process. As noted above, it was not one whereby defendant purposefully availed itself \u201cof the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Denckla, supra. </em>I would, therefore, modify the order below so as to set aside the service of process only, and, as modified, affirm it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\"> Although the point was not raised below or on this appeal, it is important to note that the challenge was to the adequacy of the service of process, not to the sufficiency of the complaint; consequently, defendant\u2019s motion should properly have been to set aside the service of process, not to dismiss the complaint. See <em>Cooke v. Yarrington, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>123, 127 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b576-8\"> If the form of substituted service provided for such cases and employed is reasonably calculated to give a defendant actual notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to be heard, \u201cthe traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice :h <em>* </em>* implicit in due process are satisfied.\u201d <em>Milliken v. Meyer, </em>311 <em>U. S. </em>457, 463, 61 <em>S. Ct. </em>339, 343, 85 <em>L. Ed. </em>278 (1940).

Gilbert, </em>121 <em>N. J. Super. </em>78 (Law Div. 1972), cited by the majority, long-arm service of process was effected by certified mail on the defendant King Pin Alleys, a bowling establishment, cocktail lounge and snack bar located in West Nyack, New York. Plaintiffs in the action were passengers in a car which was involved in a collision with another ear in Demarest in Bergen County. The driver and owner of the other vehicle had been at the King Pin Alley earlier that night, where they imbibed a substantial quantity of beer. They were allegedly intoxicated when the collision occurred. It appeared that King Pin Alleys was frequented by many young persons from Bergen County (at that time (1969) the-age limit for drinking alcoholic beverages was 18 in New York, but 21 in New Jersey). While the New York defendant purchased some supplies in this State and maintained life insurance coverage for its employees and officers through an insurance company here, the trial judge, on the motion to set aside the service of process, indicated that \u201csuch \u2018contacts\u2019 in themselves may be insufficient for New Jersey to exercise jurisdiction in respect of the nonrelated cause of action.\u201d Nevertheless, he denied the motion, holding that \u201cthere do exist compelling reasons for holding this defendant King Pin Alleys, amenable to suit here * *\u25a0 *\u201d The rationale of the case seems to be (1) there was no special inconvenience to the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>ant; (2) the establishment attracted New Jersey minors under 21; (3) the driver\u2019s negligent operation of the vehicle after leaving the tavern in an intoxicated condition was a reasonably foreseeable event; (4) the dangerous effects of the driving in New Jersey could easily have been anticipated, and (5), citing \u00a7 50 of the <em>Restatement, Conflict of Laws </em>2d, \u201cregardless of any other relationship of defendant\u201d to this State, permitting plaintiffs to maintain the suit did not afford \u201ctraditional notions of fair play.\u201d This has no relevancy at all to the facts of the present case, nor can any pertinent rule of law be extracted therefrom. The concept there seems to have been the setting in motion in one state of a cause that results in injury in another.
