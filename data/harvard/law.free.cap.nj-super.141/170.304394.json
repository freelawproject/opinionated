An appeal based on excessiveness of sentence resulted in an affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On May 15, 1975 defendant filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for post-conviction relief, again complaining of the sentence. He was afforded a hearing and his petition was denied on June 20, 1975. Appeal from that denial is before us for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"Atv\">There is absolutely no merit to this appeal. A post-conviction application for modification of a sentence which has already been considered on direct appeal is patently frivolous. It should have been dismissed summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\"><em>A </em>fortiori, an appeal from the denial of the petition should never have been filed. See <em>R. </em>1:4-8 and <em>DR </em>7-102 (A) (2). Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
