Since there is no constitutional right to a jury trial in a probate appeal <em>(James </em>v. <em>Staples, </em>87 N. H. 49: 2 Page, Wills (3d <em>ed.), ss. </em>643, 644), the issue is solely one of legislative intent. Consequently eases in other juris-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>dictions are of little weight and the relative merits of either view calls for a legislative rather than a judicial judgment. See, Fed. R. Civ. P., Rule 39; Model Probate Code (1946) s. 18 (b) and <em>Comment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The holding in <em>James </em>v. <em>Staples, supra, </em>that the Presiding Justice in a will contest had no power to disregard a jury verdict on the issues of sanity and undue influence was changed the following year by the Legislature. Laws 1935, <em>c. </em>120. Thereafter \u201cin probate appeals . . . the verdict or findings of the jury shall be advisory and may be modified or set aside if not satisfactory to found a decree upon.\u201d R. L., c. 370, s. 14. At the time of the 1935 amendment P. L., c. 311, <em>s. </em>11, regulating appeals from the court of probate read as follows: \u201cOn an appeal, if any fact material to the cause shall be disputed, the court may direct an issue proper to try such fact to be framed, and ascertain the same by verdict of a jury.\u201d Two years later a new sentence was added to section 11 by Laws 1937, c. 157: \u201cIn any probate appeal involving the validity of an instrument purporting to be a will in which material facts are in dispute, the court shall, upon request of either part, frame issues and ascertain the facts by the verdict of a jury.\u201d Both section 11 and the 1937 amendment were included in the revision of the Public Laws as R. L., c. 365, <em>s. </em>11, and no change was made in the 1935 amendment which appears in R. L., <em>c. </em>370, s. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">By its express terms R. L., c. 370, <em>s. </em>14, makes a jury verdict in probate appeals \u201cadvisory and may be modified or set aside if not satisfactory.\u201d It is argued, however, that the phrase \u201cascertain the [facts] by the verdict of a jury\u201d in R. L., <em>c. </em>365, s. 11, has the effect of repealing the former statute since it was enacted at a later date. A short answer to this contention is that both statutes were reenacted at the same time in 1941 as the Revised Laws, so \u201cthat the former is to be considered with reference to the latter without repealing or modifying it.\u201d <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Company, </em>90 N. H. 534, 540. If both statutes \u201cmay stand together, the latter does not repeal the former, but they shall both have a concurrent operation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>43 N. H. 415, 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">There is another more persuasive reason why the contention cannot be adopted. In this state repeal by implication \u201cis not to be found if any other reasonable construction may avoid it.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilton Railroad, </em>89 N. H. 59, 61, 62. The purpose of R. L., c. 370, s. 14, in abolishing the rule enunciated in <em>James </em>v. <em>Staples, supra, </em>is unmistakable. It has not been changed in form or substance since its original passage in 1935 and there is no evidence that R. L., <em>c. </em>365, s. 11, was intended to repeal it by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Both statutes may be construed together without inconsistency in either. Under R. L., c. 370, s. 14, the findings or verdict of a jury in probate appeals are advisory only. Under R. L., c. 365, s. 11, where material facts are in dispute in such appeals, the Presiding Justice of his own initiative may and, upon request of either party, must frame issues for an advisory jury. Stated differently this latter statute allowed a litigant in a will case to demand an advisory jury, where material facts are in dispute, whereas formerly this was discretionary with the Presiding Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The Presiding Justice could accept or reject the advisory findings of the jury in whole or in part. Although the evidence was conflicting, we cannot say as a matter of law that the findings and rulings of the Trial Court were erroneous. It appears that the Presiding Justice considered the evidence in favor of the plaintiff as neither false nor incredible but rather in the words of the statute \u201cnot satisfactory to found a decree upon.\u201d In the absence of an abuse of discretion, the order sustaining the appeal and disallowing the will is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The right of the plaintiff to recover for services rendered has not been argued or considered. <em>Lemire </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>93 N. H. 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>Decree for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b526-8\">Blanton, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
