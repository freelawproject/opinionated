Since that contingency happened, the balance in the hands of the appellee, administrator, passes as intestate property. R. L., c. 360. <em>White </em>v. <em>Weed, 87 </em>N. H. 153; <em>Heffenger </em>v. <em>Heffenger, </em>89 N. H. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">The first argument in support of the Probate decree is that the fifth and seventh clauses of the will disclose an intent to disinherit Forrest at least conditionally. \u201cIf testator does not dispose of the whole of his estate by his last will and testament, and such will contains negative words of exclusion, the great majority of states hold that such negative words cannot prevent property from passing under the statutes of descent and distribution.\u201d 2 Page, Wills (1941 <em>ed.) s. </em>929. This majority rule has been adopted in this state in <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>69 N. H. 561, where it was decided that a bequest of \u201cone dollar and no more\u201d to an heir-at-law of the testator will not prevent him from taking his distributive share in property undisposed of by the will. See <em>Loveren </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>69 N. H. 639, 640 and <em>Upton </em>v. <em>White, </em>92 N. H. 221, 225. There is general agreement among commentators as to the validity and existence of this rule. Remsen, The Preparation of Wills and Trusts (2d <em>ed.) </em>364; Rollison, Will Clauses Anno. (1946) 393. Accordingly the appellant is not deprived by the fifth and seventh clauses of the will from taking under the statute of descent and distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>It is further argued that if the property passes intestate the heirs should be determined at the date of the death of the widow. <em>Cf. Kimball </em>v. <em>Lancaster, </em>60 N. H. 264, 273. When property is devised or bequeathed by will to heirs or next of kin, they are to be ascertained as of the date of testator\u2019s death <em>(Simes </em>v. <em>Ward, 78 </em>N. H. 533) or as of the life tenant\u2019s death <em>(Holmes </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>82 N. H. 380) depending in each case on the intention of the testator. In cases of intestacy or partial intestacy the property passes by force of the statute and generally the heirs or next of kin are determined as of the testator\u2019s death. See Anno. 132 A. L. R. 1069. The record discloses no reason to take this case out of the application of the general rule and therefore the appellant is entitled to a decree in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AlzB\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
