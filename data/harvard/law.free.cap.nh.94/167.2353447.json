Release, Two Thirds or Minimum. Any prisoner whose conduct while in prison has been meritorious and whose minimum sentence is three years or more may be paroled by the state board of parole when he has served two thirds of his minimum sentence, provided it shall appear to said board to be a reasonable probability that he will remain at liberty without violating the law and will conduct himself as a good citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">It should be noted in the first place that the statute contains no suggestion that \u201ctime off\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>a reduction in the term of a prisoner\u2019s original sentence, may be \u201cearned\u201d by meritorious conduct. The only advantage which a convict can thus \u201cearn\u201d is the privilege of having his conduct reviewed by the parole board and if it is found to be meritorious, to be paroled, provided there is \u201ca reasonable probability that he will remain at liberty without violating the law and will conduct himself as a good citizen.\u201d Any such order admitting a convict to parole is required by the statute to be conditional (R. L., c. 429, s. 23 and s. 27 as amended by Laws 1943, c. 45, s. 1) and is necessarily subject to the conditions of <em>ss. </em>34, 35 and 36, providing for recommittal in case of a violation of parole. While at liberty on parole, the prisoner is legally in the custody of the parole board, <em>(Id., s. </em>28) and the idea that he shall receive a final and irrevocable deduction from his original sentence is wholly at variance with the spirit and purpose of the statute. The terms of the petitioner\u2019s original sentence were in no way affected by his meritorious conduct or by the recommendation of the board or by the action of the Governor and Council in granting the parole under the statute as it then stood.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Further light as to the significance and effect of a parole is to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>found in the earlier sections of the chapter. Section 22 provides that a convict who has observed all the rules of the prison shall be entitled to release upon the expiration of the minimum term of his sentence, and \u201che shall then be given a permit to be at liberty therefrom during the unexpired portion of the maximum term of his sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Section 23 provides that \u201csaid permit shall be issued by the state board of parole upon such terms and conditions as it shall establish.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Section 24 provides that a prisoner who has violated the rules of the prison \u201cmay be given a like permit after the expiration of the minimum term of his sentence, if there shall appear to said board to be a reasonable probability that he will remain at liberty without violating the law and will\u2019 conduct himself as a good citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Section 25 provides that \u201cin cases of especially meritorious conduct the board may, in like manner, issue such permit at a time in advance of the expiration of the minimum term of sentence, to be computed by deducting therefrom not more than three days for each month of such minimum term of sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Under these sections it is plain that the only relief which a piisoner can \u201cearn\u201d by good conduct is \u201ca permit to be at liberty during the unexpired term of the maximum portion of his sentence.\u201d The provision of section 26 that a prisoner \u201cmay be paroled by the state board of parole\u201d clearly contemplates the issuance of \u201ca permit to be at liberty\u201d as provided in the preceding sections and nothing more. This the petitioner received and subsequently forfeited by his own misconduct. Upon recommittal to the state prison he was bound to serve the balance of his term as originally imposed without any deduction for meritorious conduct which occurred prior to November 18,1942, the date of his recommittal to the state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Inasmuch as the question here presented is purely one of local law, the citation of authorities in support of our conclusion is unnecessary, but reference may be made to <em>Conlon\u2019s Case, </em>148 Mass. 168, and <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Corall, </em>263 U. S. 193, as being generally in accord with the conclusions reached above.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-11\">Johnston, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
