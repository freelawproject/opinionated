H. 299, 300), the defendant is liable to the plaintiffs as holders for value \u201cnotwithstanding [they] at the time of taking the instrument knew him to be only an accommodation party.\u201d R. L., <em>c. </em>366, s. 29; 5 Uniform Laws Anno. s. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Consideration of defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of motions for a nonsuit and a directed verdict raise only the question whether there was any evidence upon which the Court could reasonably find that the balance of the note plus interest equals $1,000. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Malloy, </em>93 N. H. 197. There was testimony by one of the makers that he gave plaintiffs\u2019 agent a note of $600 of a third party, receiving in return $150 in cash and a receipt for $350. The receipt was not produced or its absence satisfactorily explained. Subsequently the agent notified the defendant: \u201cElave some sort of an arrangement whereby if we are lucky and the note which I am holding is paid, there will be a credit of $350 on your obligation.\u201d There was no evidence that this note was ever paid and the Trial Court could properly find that this was not a collectible credit which was or should have been applied on the defendant\u2019s note.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-10\">The credibility of the witnesses as to what payments were made presented factual matters for the Trial Court which, when supported by the evidence, must be upheld on appeal. See, <em>McKeen </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>73 N. H. 410. The defendant\u2019s exceptions are therefore overruled and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-12\">Blandin, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
