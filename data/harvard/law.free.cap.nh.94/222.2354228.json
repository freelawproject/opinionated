If perchance the claim should prevail that in the particular instance referred to the word preceeding heirs is spelled \u201cther\u201d this would lend greater support to our interpretation of the words used.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u201cThe supreme rule . . . [in] the interpretation of a will is the ascertainment of the testator\u2019s intention. ... It is not necessary that the intention . . . should be expressed in a particular form of words, or by the use of technical terms. \u2018It is sufficient if the intention . . . can be gathered from the instrument, read in the light of the competent evidence bearing upon its interpretation.\u2019 <em>Upton </em>v. <em>Hosmer, </em>70 N. H. 493, 495. The testator\u2019s intention is the sole subject of inquiry. It \u2018is determined as a question of fact by competent evidence, and not by rules of law.\u2019 <em>Edgerly </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>66 N. H. 434, 447. . . . When ascertained, such intention is to be given effect, with the exception, however, that the intention cannot be followed when it is impossible or illegal to do so, \u2018for an intention will not avail to create an illegal or an impossible estate.\u2019 <em>Burleigh </em>v. <em>Clough, </em>52 N. H. 267, 271.\u201d <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>75 N. H. 92, 93, 94. See <em>Kennard </em>v. <em>Kennard, </em>63 N. H. 303, 310, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The intention of the testator here seems to us very plain. He sought to and did create two estates, \u2014 the first for the benefit of the grandchildren of his sister or the heirs, they to receive the income of the real estate so long as there were grandchildren alive. We construe the word \u201cthe\u201d to mean \u201ctheir\u201d heirs; to wit, the heirs of the grandchildren. These grandchildren were all living at the time the testator made his will. He knew them and selected them as the objects of his bounty. We need not concern ourselves with the question whether he intended only those grandchildren then living or grandchildren that might be born after his death. There is nothing in the case to indicate there was even any remote possibility of any being born thereafter. All we are required to do is to accept the facts as we find them.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">This bequest gave these grandchildren and their heirs a vested interest in the estate created; to wit, enjoyment of the income, a life estate, so long as one grandchild survived.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The second estate he sought to and did create was a remainder, the corpus of the estate to be constituted of the proceeds of the sale of all his real estate which was subject to a life estate, to be divided equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>among the children of said grandchildren or the heirs. We again construe \u201cthe\u201d to mean \u201ctheir,\u201d the only natural construction. It is easy enough to perceive that the testator wanted to preserve the fee during the lifetime of the grandchildren and their heirs until the death of the last surviving grandchild. When the latter event occurred the sale and distribution was to be made, and the objects of his bounty were then to be the great-grandchildren and their heirs. The testator\u2019s intention so construed becomes clear and unequivocal'and such construction gives it full effect. It recognizes two classes, or groups, whichever designation one prefers, grandchildren and their heirs, great-grandchildren and their heirs. Consistency in interpretation compels this result. <em>Fowler </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>83 N. H. 453, 457. If we say, as we all agree, that in the first instance \u201cgrandchildren or the heirs\u201d means the heirs of the grandchildren, it must necessarily follow that \u201cchildren of said grandchildren (which can mean nothing else than great-grandchildren) and the heirs\u201d must necessarily mean the heirs of the great-grandchildren. Any other construction does violence to the use of very ordinary language. It seems to be conceded that if the scrivener, whether a layman or one versed in the law, had used the word great-grandchildren instead of the words \u201cchildren of said grandchildren\u201d the interpretation to be adopted would be the heirs of the great-grandchildren. But because the word grandchildren comes after the word children or comes last in order it is contended that \u201cthe heirs\u201d mean the heirs of the grandchildren. There seems to be no logic in this, it is too fine a distinction, it is splitting hairs, it is putting aside a grammatical rule that words connected together as these are must be taken and construed together. They cannot be disassociated.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The above contention loses sight of the fact that the great-grandchildren took a vested interest at birth. From then on that interest, recognized in law as a vested remainder, was subject to alienation, assignment, disposal by will, etc., and if not alienated, assigned, bequeathed, or devised, is inherited by the heirs of the owner of said interest. <em>Hayward </em>v. <em>Spaulding, supra. </em>Thompson, Construction of Wills, s. 508. This gives effect to the vested interest rule in force in this state. Wherever possible a future interest will be deemed vested, and vested not only for the purpose of classification but vested in the sense that the interest is not defeated by death during the life tenancy but is transmissible to the heirs of the remainderman, or assignable during the remainderman\u2019s life. <em>Upton </em>v. <em>White, </em>92 N. H. 221, 226, and cases cited; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>82 N.

This is the better and majority rule everywhere. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Pottgieser, </em>176 Ill. 368; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>37 Pa.

R. 306, Anno.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The next question to be considered is whether these great-grandchildren or their heirs take <em>per stirpes </em>or <em>per capita. </em>The trustees are advised they take as follows: Great-grandchildren surviving the last grandchild each take one share <em>per capita, </em>and the representing heirs of the respective deceased great-grandchildren each take the share of a deceased great-grandchild <em>per stirpes.
