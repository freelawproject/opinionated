The injury to this-extent does not arise out of and in the course of the workman\u2019s employment. The proximate cause is the plaintiff\u2019s own failure to use reasonable care to overcome his disability. \u201cThe chargeable disability is only that resulting from accident incurred in employment, and not that caused by the workman\u2019s carelessness preventing or delaying recovery from the accident.\u201d <em>Neault </em>v. <em>Company, </em>86 N. H. 231, 232. See <em>Perreault </em>v. <em>Company, </em>87 N. H. 306; <em>V\u00e1llee </em>v. <em>Company, </em>89 N. H. 285; 105 A. L.

Only actual injuries, past, present and future, are compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">\n<em>Judgment for $31.50.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b50-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
