The house was built, and paid for by her, and she lived in it until March, 1852. In 1850, James Todd obtained a judgment against Robert Fleming; <em>aj\u00fc. fa. </em>was issued, and levy made upon the lot, without mentioning the house occupied by Sarah. The property was sold by the sheriff to William Lewis, plaintiff below, and the deed acknowledged to him, 15th Dec., 1851. At the time of the sale, Lewis knew, and was informed, that the house was the property of Sarah Fleming. William Coleman <em>et </em>al., the defendants below, at the request of Sarah Fleming, and for her benefit, in March, 1852, before Lewis obtained possession of the premises, removed the house, and this action on the ease was brought against them by Lewis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-12\">The court (Burrell, P. J.) charged the jury that the frame house was a fixture, and admitting the contract between Robert and Sarah Fleming, and Lewis\u2019s knowledge of it, the judgment of Todd was a lien on all fixtures, and Lewis, as sheriff\u2019s vendee, could hold all the judgment was a lien on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-13\">The jury found for the plaintiff $56 damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-14\">This charge was the error assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-15\">Banks, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0_\">cited Rogers <em>v. </em>Gibson <em>et al., </em>4 <em>Y. </em>111; Heister <em>v. </em>Fortner, 2 <em>Bin. </em>40; Church <em>v. </em>Griffith, 9 <em>Barr </em>117; White\u2019s Appeal, 10 <em>Barr </em>252; Mitchell <em>v. </em>Freedly,</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b292-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>Id. </em>198; Harlan <em>v. </em>Harlan, 8 <em>Harris </em>306; Wells <em>v. </em>Bannister, 4 <em>Mass. </em>514; Taylor <em>v. </em>Townsend, 8 <em>Mass. </em>411; Doty <em>v. </em>Graham, 5 <em>Pick. </em>487.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-6\">Drum, for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Asm\">Buildings erected on the premises, or substantial additions to a house, are not removable: <em>Gibbons on Fixtures </em>35; 13 <em>Law </em>Lib.; 1 <em>Kent Com. </em>343; 1 <em>Taunt. </em>21.
