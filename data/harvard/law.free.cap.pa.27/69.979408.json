The viewers were appointed at April sessions on the petition of citizens of Little Britain township. During the same sessions, the court, on motion of the attorney for the petitioners and affidavit filed, substituted another for one of the viewers previously appointed. On the 31st July the report of the viewers was filed, laying out the road prayed for byv certain courses and distances. This report stated that five of the viewers who are named appeared and were \u201c sworn, and viewed the ground, and do return for public use the following road,\u201d and the five signed the report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-17\">On the 14th August, 1855, exceptions were filed to the report, alleging that the substitution of the viewer at the instance of petitioners was irregular, and without notice to the landholders through whose premises the road passes. And that, though five of the persons viewed the ground' and agreed upon a route, it was afterwards changed by four of them, the fifth not having gone upon the ground when the alteration was made. This report was read and confirmed nisi on the 22d August, 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-18\">Depositions were taken, and after argument the court overruled the exceptions, on the 18th December, 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-19\">On the 20th December, 1855, the court, at the instance of the exceptant's counsel, granted a rule to show cause why reviewers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>should not be appointed; but afterwards refused to grant it on the ground that the petition was presented too late.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">The regular sessions of the court were held in April, August, November, and January. The November sessions had been adjourned to December for hearing, arguments. By a rule of the court it is provided that <em>\u201c </em>all petitions relative to roads shall be presented during the regular term, and no petitions will be heard at any of the adjourned sittings of the court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">The refusal to set aside the report, and the denial of the review, were the errors assigned.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-8\"><em>Frazer, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACV\">If one of the viewers did not view the line of the road as reported, it cannot be sustained, and the testimony proves this. Five must view: Act 13th June, 1836 ; <em>Bright. Purd. </em>715, 725. The 52d section requires that five of the viewers \u201c <em>shall view the place in </em>question:\" Road in Middlecreek and Union Townships, 9 <em>Barr </em>69; New Hanover Road, 6 <em>Harris </em>220; Maytown Road, 4 <em>Y. </em>479.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-9\">The court should have granted the review. The petition was presented at the next term after report made (the November Term). A review is a matter of right: 1 <em>Dall. </em>11; 3 <em>Yeates </em>263; 1 <em>Watts </em>400 ; 5 <em>Id. </em>203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-10\">The rule adopted by the court is a violation of the letter and spirit of the act, and deprives the party of a right which the act gives Mm.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-11\"><em>Alexander </em>and <em>Dickey, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ake\">The evidence shows that five of the viewers viewed the premises. One of the viewers did not specially view the part altered. It was not necessary to walk over each foot of the ground. He signed the report wherein he says he did view, and he cannot <em>be </em>received to contradict Ms own report.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-12\">There is no law or rule which requires notice of proceedings on the petition to be given to the landholders through whose property the road passes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b70-13\">The rule under which the petition for a review was rejected was a legal and valid one: <em>Purd. Dig. </em>694, \u00a7 21; Snyder <em>v. </em>Bauchman, 8 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>335; Dubosq <em>v. </em>The Guardians of the Poor, 1 <em>Binn. </em>415; Barry <em>v. </em>Randolph, 3 <em>Binn. </em>277. A review is matter of right only when applied for regularly. This application was irregular and out of time, and therefore there was no error in refusing it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b70-14\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b70-15\">Black, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYk\">1. When the Court of Quarter Sessions have appointed a full set of road viewers, one or more of the number may be stricken off and others substituted. We presume it was done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>in this case for good reasons. It was not necessary to give notice that it would be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">2. The report of the viewers says that five of them examined the road. The record is therefore regular on its face, and shows every fact that is necessary. The deposition which is said to contradict this is not on record, and we can take no notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">3. A rule of court prescribing the time or times when a road petition shall be presented is perfectly valid provided it takes away no right given by.the general law of the land. Of course no court would or could declare that a petition for review should not be presented at all during the term when the Act of Assembly has said it may be done. But the court may set apart a particular portion of the term for such purposes, and lawfully refuse to be interrupted in their other business for the rest of the session. The rule of the Lancaster Quarter Sessions, under which the petition in this cas\u00e9 was refused, is such as that court had a right to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
