Watson Carr, to recover four bonds amounting to $2500, payable to John Thompson or bearer, issued by the Chartiers Coal Company, incorporated by the legislature of Pennsylvania. The special verdict finds the following facts in th.e case: the capital stock of the company was not to exceed $200,000 in 10,000 shares of $20 each, and by the act of incorporation, it was provided that each stockholder shall be liable in his individual capacity for the debts and performance of all contracts entered into by the company, to the amount of the balance unpaid on the stock of said stockholder, so that the subscribed stock of each stockholder shall be liable for the said debts and contracts. On the 7th February, 1850, the whole of the stock was subscribed, 250 shares being taken by the defendant, who at the time paid $500 on account of his subscription. On the 18th October following, he received the company\u2019s certificate for 250 shares. On the 20th August, 1850, the treasurer of the company drew on Carr for $375, the amount of the sixth and last instalment due on his stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-14\">In their stock ledger on the 9th February, 1850, the company charged themselves with certain coal lands, contracts for harbour, and lands at harbour, assigned and conveyed by one Remington to the company, valued and appraised, at $100,000, and receipted for by Remington to the subscribers to the capital stock of the company, among whom was Carr, who had a receipt for $2500. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>This sum with his cash payments of $10 upon each share appeared on the books of the company to his credit, balancing the charge for his stock, $5000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\">On the 1st October, 1850, the president and directors of the company (Carr being one of the directors, and secretary, and present at the meeting) for the purpose of raising means to meet the existing liabilities of the company contracted in the construction of their road, &amp;c., authorized bonds of the company to be issued to the amount of $60,000, in sums of not less than $100 nor exceeding $1000, bearing interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, redeemable in three years from their respective dates. Of the bonds So issued the four in this suit are part, and being pay-, able to Thompson or bearer, Le Eevre became the holder of them without any transfer in writing from Thompson, who was a stockholder and treasurer of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-7\">At a meeting of the directors of the company, Carr being present, the following preamble and resolutions were adopted :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-8\">\u201c Whereas but $10 on each share of the capital stock have been called in or paid by the stockholders, and whereas on the organization of this company a prospective value or estimate was placed upon contracts or lands conveyed to the company by Z.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av3s\">This is an action by the holder of several bonds of \u201c The Chartiers Coal Company\u201d against a stockholder in said company, to recover a sum alleged to be due and unpaid on his subscription to the stock. The action is brought under that clause in the charter which declares that\u201c each stockholder shall be liable, in his individual capacity, for the debts and performance of all contracts entered into by said company to the amount of the balance unpaid on the stock of said stockholder, so that the subscribed stock of said company, whether paid in or not, shall be liable for said debts and contracts:\u201d <em>P. L. </em>1850, p. 940. The defendant below alleged that the stock taken by him was. paid up in full, and the special verdict finds the facts in the case. We are to decide whether the facts so found amount to a payment or not. It appears from the verdict of the jury that 250 shares were subscribed by the defendant on .the 7th February, 1850, the par value of which amounted in the aggregate to $5000. It further appears from the entries in the stock ledger of the company, set forth in the verdict, that conveyances of coal land in fee, contracts for coal land, contracts for harbour, and lands at harbour, &amp;c., as per conveyances and assignments of Z. W. Remington to the company,\u201d were \u201cvalued and appraised at, and receipted for, by Z. W. Remington to the original subscribers to the capital stock of the company.\u201d The amount credited to S. Watson Carr on this account, for money receipted for by Z. W. Remington, is 2500 dollars. The residue of Mr. Carr\u2019s subscription was paid in cash. The jury find that each stockholder paid <em>in cash </em>only ten dollars on each share, and was credited on the books with the additional sum of ten dollars per share, \u201c in the lands -and contracts aforesaid.\u201d There is nothing in the special verdict tending to show that there was any fraud in this transaction. The charter authorized the company to \u201c purchase land not exceeding 1000 acres,\u201d and \u201cto employ its capital in purchasing and holding the lands aforesaid, with the improvements,\u201d &amp;c. There was, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>fore, nothing in this arrangement with Remington which exceeded the' corporate powers of the company. The corporation, being indebted to Remington for the lands necessary for its business operations, was bound to collect the subscriptions to its stock and to pay the money over to Remington in satisfaction of that debt. A payment by the stockholders directly to Remington, with the assent of the corporation, produced the same result, and was in law a good payment <em>pro tanto </em>on their several subscriptions to the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In making their contract with Remington the parties took the precaution to have the lands \u201cvalued and appraised.\u201d We are \" bound to presume that this was fairly done. There is nothing in the verdict to repel this presumption. It is true that the preamble to the resolutions of the 11th March, 1852, two years after the payment, states that \u201c on the organization of the company a <em>prospective </em>value or estimate was placed on contracts and lands conveyed to the company by Z. W. Remington, and that, contrary to the estimates at the time of the organization of the company, 100,000 dollars in cash subscriptions prove insufficient to carry out the plans and purposes contemplated by this charter.\u201d What has Mr. Carr to do with an error in the judgment of the company in regard to the value of their purchase from Remington ? If through errors of judgment in carrying on their business, they find themselves unable to \u201c carry out their plans,\u201d what is that to him ? If they took lands at a \u201cprospective value,\u201d never realized, it is nothing more than many individuals and corporations have done before. Such an error in management or in their judgment of the value of a purchase, made without fraud, forms no ground for rescinding the contract. Even if Mr. Carr had been the owner of an interest with Remington in the lands conveyed to the com\u2018pany, the contract could not be rescinded without his consent. But, as we understand the verdict, it does not appear that Mr. Carr had any interest in the lands whatever. We infer from the facts stated in it that he satisfied $2500 of Remington\u2019s claim against the corporation, and in consideration of doing so, received a credit for an equal amount on his subscription to the stock. This transaction was neither illegal nor improper. It could not be invalidated by the subsequent discovery that the company had made a bad bargain with Remington. Nothing short of Mr. Carr\u2019s voluntary consent could give validity to the resolutions of the 11th March, 1852, invalidating the payment made by him through Remington. No inference can be drawn from his presence when the resolutions were adopted, beyond that of his assent to them as a whole. If he did assent to them as a whole, he had certainly a right to avail himself of the provisions made for those who were \u201c unable or neglected\u201d to pay a second time. The verdict finds that he belonged to that class, and that he tendered his old certi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ficate and offered to receive a new one for one-balf tbe amount according to the resolutions, and that this was refused by the president of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">We are of opinion that Mr. Carr\u2019s subscription to the stock of the company was paid up in full by cash for one half of it, and the arrangement with Remington for the other half;- that the resolutions of 11th March, 1852, invalidating that payment, are binding only on those who consented to them; that the presence of Mr. Carr when the resolutions were adopted, authorizes <em>no </em>other inference than that he assented to them as a whole; and that he has fully complied, or offered to comply, with the terms of the resolution which provided for cases like his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">This view of the case renders it unnecessary to consider the other points. But we do not desire to have any doubt on the question whether the holder of bonds issued by a corporation, payable to bearer, may maintain an action on them in his own name. Such bonds are not strictly negotiable under the law merchant, as are promissory notes and bills of exchange. They are, however, instruments of a peculiar character, and being expressly designed to be passed from hand to hand, and by common usage actually so transferred, are capable of passing by delivery so as to enable the holder to maintain an action on them in his own name. Possession is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The judgment of the court below is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
