In 1841, by codicil to his will, testator gave and bequeathed to his son Dyer all his personal property, to hold for the uses and purposes expressed in his last will, until the youngest son arrives at the age of 21. \u201c The meaning of the above bequest is that the personal property aforesaid shall be unconditionally the property of the said Dyer Loomis, Jr., at the time Hiram, my youngest son, attains the age of 21 years.\u201d Afterwards, in April, 1841, a contract was entered into between the father and his son Dyer, by which, in consideration of the personal property and use of the father\u2019s real estate, the son was to maintain his father during life, and provide for and educate the minor children until they arrive at the age of 21.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-7\">Testator died in 1842. The respondent proved the will and took upon himself the executorship thereof. Afterwards, in 1854, he filed an account, showing a balance due him of $464.72. To pay this balance,'the legacies, and a judgment obtained against him as executor in 1842, revived, in 1845, and again in 1849, the other heirs not being parties, he obtained from the Orphans\u2019 Court, 26th June, 1854, an order to sell, and sold the real estate of testator. Exceptions to the confirmation of this sale and his account were filed, the whole matter was referred to an auditor, and while thus pending the relator presented her bill .in equity. This set forth, <em>inter alia, </em>that the principal debt, the judgment above-mentioned, had lost its lien by lapse of time, and was originally contracted for use of respondent: that testator, in his lifetime, made advancements to respondent, paid his debts, and supported his family, and that a large amount of personal property of testator was in hands of respondent, and should be divided. Certain interrogatories to respondent were propounded, to be answered by him. He was asked to be required to come to a fair account, pay the debts and legacies out of the personal estate, and be perpetually enjoined against the sale of the real estate. Respondent demurred to and answered the bill. The court overruled the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-8\">The respondent, in his answer, alleged that the said debt was contracted after .the making of the will and codicil: that it was not for his use: that the judgment had been revived from time to time against him: that under the contract referred to, the testator had conveyed all his personal property to respondent: that he had no funds of testator in his hands : that the account filed was just and true: that the debts and legacies could not be paid except by sale of the land, and that all the matters complained of, set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the' bill of complainant, are within the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court and remediable there only.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-6\">The court below dismissed all those portions of the bill relating to the personal estate of Loomis, Sr., and enjoined and restrained the respondent from further proceeding at law on the order of sale granted by the Orphans\u2019 Court, and also enjoined him not to commence any legal proceedings for the purpose of procuring the sale of said real estate for the payment of debts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">The errors \u00bfssigned were: 1. In sustaining the bill of the complainant and in not dismissing it for want of jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">2. In adjudicating and ruling that the executor who had paid,, debts of his testator while they were liens, and had not a sufficiency of personal assets to meet the advancement, could not, after the expiration of ten years from the death of the decedent, have a sale of his real estate for the payment of the balance of his administration account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-9\">3. In perpetually, restraining respondent from further proceedings at law on the order of sale granted by the Orphans\u2019 Court, and perpetually restraining him from commencing any legal proceedings for the purpose of paying any debt, balance of executors\u2019 account, or legacies out of the land.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-10\">Babbitt, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_i\">The entire jurisdiction of the sale of real estate of a decedent is conferred upon the Orphans\u2019 Court, and the manner of proceeding prescribed must be pursued: Act of 21st March, 1806.

There is no clause in the Act of Assembly relating to equity powers that even seems to give the Common\u2019Pleas such a jurisdiction.. The discovery clause is intended to provide the court -with means of trying its own cases. The prevention clause was not intended to create any interference between different co-ordinate courts in the jurisdiction exercised by them, and especially to allow the Common Pleas to draw to itself the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court. The specific relief clause refers only to acts <em>in pais, </em>and not at all to acts that are directed by a co-ordinate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">And there is no need of such a jurisdiction in the Common Pleas, for the Orphans\u2019 Court is of itself a court of equity. It has all the powers of discovery that are needed for the complete exercise of its jurisdiction. And it sits as a court of equity, and, in a rude way, uses the forms of a court of equity when it orders land to be sold for the payment of debts; and certainly the Court of Common Pleas cannot sit in error, even in this form, over its decrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Decree. \u2014 November 7th, 1856. This cause came on for hearing at the present term on appeal by the defendants from the final. decree of. the Court of Common Pleas of Erie county; and now, upon due consideration, it is ordered and decreed that the said decree be reversed and set aside, and. that the plaintiff\u2019s bill be dismissed at her costs, and the record is remitted to the said Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
