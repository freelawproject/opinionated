Patrick Smith renounced, and John Smith took out letters testamentary, and <em>died intestate before the commencement of this proceeding. </em>This proceeding, and the decree in the Orphans\u2019 Court, are against Peter Swoope, the surviving administrator of said John Smith, deceased. Francis Smith, after the date of his will, and before his death, purchased a house and two lots of ground in the town of Newry, for $800, and put up a new house on the same, at a cost, of $500 or $600, for his daughter Sarah, the lot. and improvements costing testator $800 or $900. The deed for said lots was taken in the name of Francis Smith, who proposed to make a conveyance to his daughter, and was prevented from doing so at the time, by Montgomery alleging that under the then present circumstances, he did not wish it done; and the title was suffered to remain in Francis Smith till his death. Montgomery and .wife, however; took possession of this property in 1841, immediately after its purchase, lived in it up to the time of the death of Francis Smith in 1844, and have continued to live in it up to this date, claiming it as their own, and have never paid any rent to Francis Smith or to any other person for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-8\">The appellant contended that this house and two lots of ground were an advancement, and, together with an admitted credit of $96, fully paid and satisfied the said legacy. But if the property did not amount to a full payment of the legacy, it was a payment <em>pro </em>tanto, to the amount of the cost of the property and improvements at the time they were given to Sarah by her father. To determine these questions, and to ascertain the amount due said Sarah on her legacy, if any, a feigned issue was directed to the Common Pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-9\">The jury found for the plaintiff, and that John Smith had paid $111.20, and the Orphans\u2019 Court decreed the balance of the'legacy to be paid to Sarah Montgomery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-10\">From this decree Peter C. Swoope, surviving administrator of John Smith, deceased, appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-11\">The errors assigned were: That the Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction to decree the payment of the legacy. That the proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ings were irregular in not making the representative of Francis Smith, deceased, a party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-6\">That the court erred in charging the jury, that \u201c as the advancement was not in kind with the legacy, it was a question of iutention whether it was an ademption of the legacy,\u201d and in throwing the burden of proof on defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-7\">Calvin, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3T\">The Orphans\u2019 Court is not the proper tribunal. The' legacy is not payable out of the real estate: Gallarny\u2019s Appeal, 6 <em>Barr </em>37. If the court had jurisdiction no demand was made as required by Act of 24th February, 1834, \u00a7 52, or security given as provided for in the same Act, \u00a761.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-8\">If the proceeding in the Orphans\u2019 Court could be sustained, then it is not against the proper parties. The administration of Francis Smith\u2019s estate was vacant. The administrator of John Smith had nothing to do with the payment of the legacy. The act specially requires notice to be given to the executor, as well as the devisee or heirs of the testator. And before the passage of it the only way to recover a legacy was by suit against the executor. Holliday <em>v. </em>Summerville, 3 <em>P. R. </em>533; McLanahan <em>v. </em>McLanahan, 1 P. <em>R. </em>96; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Hamburgh, 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>217; Ganse <em>v. </em>Wiley, 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>509.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-9\">That they were a gift and intended to be in addition to the legacy, was to be proved by the party alleging it: Act of 8 April, 1833, \u00a7 16; <em>Hood on Ex'rs. </em>192; 2 <em>Sto. Eq. </em>\u00a7 1110, and note 3; 2 <em>Sto. Eq. </em>508, note 2; Philips <em>v. </em>Gregg, 10 <em>Watts </em>158; 2 <em>Sto. Eq. </em>613, \u00a7 1202; <em>Id. </em>p. 503, \u00a7. 1110.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b60-10\">Blair, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am8\">The devise is to John Smith, \u201che yielding and paying thereout,\u201d &amp;c., It cannot be contended that these words do not explicitly charge it upon the land. In Hoover <em>v. </em>Hoover, 5 <em>Barr </em>355, the words were \u201c yielding and paying, out of the same,\u201d and the Court held it clearly a charge upon the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-11\">The question of proper parties is now raised for the first time, but it. is of no avail, for the point is decided in Downer\u2019s Appeal, 9 <em>Barr </em>333. There was no interest of the estate involved which required the aid or protection of an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>on the estate of Francis Smith.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b60-12\">In order for any subsequent gift or provision by the father to operate as an ademption of the legacy, it is essential that it should be <em>ejusdem generis: Sto. Eq. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1109, 1111; Robinson <em>v. </em>Whittey, 9 <em>Ves. </em>578, 1 <em>Brown C. C. </em>426, 5 <em>Myl. &amp; C. </em>29; Bengough <em>v. </em>Walker, 9 <em>Ves. </em>508; Will\u2019s Appeal, 10 <em>Harris </em>330.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b60-13\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b60-14\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A26\">That the legacy in question was charged upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the land devised by Francis Smith to his son John, results by the most necessary implication from the terms of the will. He \u201c yielding and paying thereout\u201d are the terms in which rent is usually reserved, and indicate, indubitably, the intention of the testator to charge the legacies on the land. It is suggested that there is a blending of personal property with the real in the devise. Be it so. In Hackadorn\u2019s Appeal, 1 <em>Jones </em>89, it was admitted that where the real and personal estates are blended and put into one fund, the land is charged with the payment of legacies; and the authorities there cited abundantly justify the admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">This position then, that the legacy was charged on the land devised to John, answers the two first assignments of error, for, first, it results that the Orphans\u2019 Court had jurisdiction under our Act of 1834; and next, that John, having accepted the land thus charged, the legacy became, as to him, a personal charge, and he, or after his death his representative, was the proper party against whom to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">3d error. There is no ground for alleging an ademption of this legacy. Ademption takes place where a parent bequeaths a legacy to a, child and afterwards gives a portion to the same child, which is <em>ejusdem generis. </em>If there be nothing on the face of the will, and no circumstance in proof, to indicate an intention to give a double portion, the advancement will be a satisfaction or ademption of the legacy: <em>Williams on Exrs. </em>2d vol. 828; <em>Story\u2019s Equity Jur. </em>\u00a7 1111, and note.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">But here, granting the house and lot to have been given to the daughter, it was not of kin with this pecuniary legacy, and could not therefore of itself adeem it. But it was not given. The father purchased it and took the title in his own name, and there is no evidence that he ever conveyed it to his daughter or her husband. The parol proof was insufficient to pass the title. The use and occupation were all that Montgomery and wife seem to have had, and it is not pretended that these extinguished the legacy. The charge of the court upon the feigned issue was quite as favourable to the appellant as it ought to have been, and he has no reason to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">And now, August 15th, 1855, this cause having been heard by counsel and considered by the court, it is ordered and decreed that the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of the county of Blair be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
