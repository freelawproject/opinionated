Blackistone, who died intestate on or about the 29th of July, 1874, in said county; that a certain paper writing without date, was filed in said Court on the 4th of August, 1874, purporting to be the nuncupative will of the said deceased, and that such was not his last will and testament; that the proof of the same was irregular, defective, informal and not in conformity with the laws of the State; and further that at the time when said pretended nuncupative will was made, the deceased was not of a sound and disposing mind, memory and understanding, and capable of making a valid deed or contract; that said will, if made at all, which the petitioner denied, was obtained by fraud and undue influence; that the petitioner was the only surviving aunt of the deceased, who died, leaving no widow, child, brother or sister, father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, or uncle, grandchild, or great grandchild, and that she was the only heir-at-law of the deceased, and was not present at the time when said pretended nuncupative will was alleged to have been made. The petition prayed a plenary proceeding to test the validity of the alleged will, and that letters of administration upon the personal estate of the deceased might be granted to the petitioner.

Corns; I cannot remember whether any one was in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>room all the time, for my attention was taken up with what Mr. Biackistone was saying to me; I don\u2019t remember whether any one was in the room until Mr. William J. Biackistone began taking down what he said ; Mrs. Shanks might have been coming and going ; I can\u2019t tell who was in the room after it was taken down, this testimony was given to me; he repeated it to Mr. Wm.

Corns ; this was a little after light, it may have been between five or six, or between six or seven o\u2019clock, it was before the doctor got there; his mind was as correct as I had over seen it when this disposition was made by him; immediately after making these requests, his voice became choked and cloudy and he could not go on.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">On cross-examination, the witness stated:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-6\">Mrs. Shanks is my niece; I have stated all that I understood Biackistone to say, wliat he was addressing to me, he was still talking; I think I have stated all that he addressed to me, that I remember, I don\u2019t think I have forgotten anything ; I did not go to Mr. Blackistone\u2019s house at the same time that Wm.

Mr. Blackistone always called-Mrs. Shanks cousin, and seemed to he exceedingly fond of her, and seemed to .he so because she came to take care of his affairs ; zro woznan could have taken better care of his affairs than she took care of his.

A. T. Pindell, in behalf of the caveator, testified as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-9\">I am a minister in the Protestant Episcopal Church ; I was called as a minister of the Gospel to visit Mr. Blackistone, at his residence, in his last sickness. I reached there about thirty minutes before he died. I at once approached the bedside of the deceased; am uncertain whether he knew me or not; Col. Benj. E. Taylor seemed to he trying to take down what he wished should be his will. As in my opinion, time was precious from the appearance of near dissolution, I asked Col. Taylor if I would be seriously interfering with his business, if I had prayers with the dying man, he said no, I prayed with him about three minutes, was about to inquire as to his spiritual state, when Col. Taylor asked him what he wished to be done with the rest of his property, the sick man <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>seemed to be unable to comprehend, when Col. Taylor requested me as being the nearest to him, to ask the sick man the following question : What disposition do you wish to make with the remainder of your property? This I asked him in a loud and clear voice; he tried to answer, but his speech was so thick that we could not understand him; Col. Taylor, who was sitting near the foot of the bed, then said to me, I have here written down his wish, that the bulk of his property shall go to Mrs. Shanks, but we do not know yet, what disposition he wishes to be made of the remainder ; ask Mr. Blackistone, to whom he wishes to give it, as there are some poor relatives in town, to whom he wishes to give something. I said to the sick man, you have stated that you wanted Mrs. Shanks to have the bulk of your property, but there is a balance not yet disposed of, to whom do you wish to leave it? His eye was fixed upon me, when I propounded the question, with a rather stupid stare, he kind of shook his hands and made an effort to speak, but had evidently lost the power of plain speech, for different parties put different interpretations on what he said; I think Col. Taylor said he wants to divide it amongst three poor relations in Baltimore; Mrs. Shanks, who was standing nearest to him, said no, that is not it, he means to say that he wants the boys in the store to have fifty dollars apiece ; acting upon these suggestions, I asked him distinctly if he wished certain poor relatives in Baltimore to have it, or if he wished to give it to the boys in the store, he made a struggling motion with his body, and muttered with his lips as if he wanted to say something, but it was all in vain. Being of the opinion that he was not at that moment in a condition to attend to matters, either temporal or spiritual, I gave place to his unwearied nurse, Mrs. Shanks, and retired from the room; his dissolution seemed to be so rapid, that it appeared only loud strong calls could command his attention, and he would relapse in a kind of drowsy state as soon as he was let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>alone. I left the room, because I thought I could he of no use to him, and gave place to the nurse. I did not hear one intelligible expression from him whilst I was in his room, not one expression that I could comprehend or understand ; I was sent for in a great hurry, went down in a great hurry, entered the house hurriedly, and am of the impression that Ool. BlackistQne held in his hand a paper, which he afterwards told me contained an expression of Mr. William D. Blackistone\u2019s will; I do not know what became of the paper; Ool. Taylor was writing when T got thei\u2019e; when I entered the sick chamber, Ool. Taylor was engaged in writing down what I supposed the sick man had just stated, but I learned afterwards from Col. Taylor, that the reason why I was not interrupting proceedings, by having prayers, was, that the Col. was merely making a copy of what had already been written down as the sick man\u2019s will, so as to go on and add to it a further expression of his wishes, as I have already stated; he was not able to make any of us understand what he wished to be done with the remainder, and hence, the Colonel\u2019s work amounted to.nothing; immediately after Mr. Blackistone\u2019s death, Col. Blackistone met me in the hall, with a folded paper in his hand, and said to me, holding the paper up, I hold here a statement of what\u2019 Mr. Blackistone wishes to be done with his property ; he gives the most of it to my daughter, Mrs. Shanks, who has been here nursing him, when none of his other relatives would come near; I did not examine the paper, or any paper whatever in the house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">Col. Benjamin E. Taylor testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">I knew Wm. D. Blackistone; I knew him about fourteen or fifteen years; I reside about a mile from where he died; he married a half-cousin of mine, who died about one or two months before he did; I was sent for on the morning that he died ; I got there, I suppose, about eight o\u2019clock, A, M., I don\u2019t suppose he lived, after I got there, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>more than an hour, or an hour and a half; I went immediately to his room, and those surrounding his hed, asked if he knew me \u2014 I say those, because I mean more than one asked if he knew me ; there were Mrs. Shanks, Millard Corns, and others ; be said that he did \u2014 it was Ben Taylor ; where is Jennie \u2014 that is, my wife; I told him she would be there as soon as the horse could be hooked up to bring\u2019 her there ; I stayed there a few moments, and went out to make some few inquiries ; I returned, and went out several times, and was back and forward in the room, and found him about the same, during the time since I first came : I found that there was a paper ; Col. Win. J. Blackistone stated there was a paper purporting to be his wishes, and also stated the purport of it; I had a conversation\u2014 really I cannot say whether to Herbert Blackistone \u2014 about this paper, or he to me ; it was a subject of conversation between us ; I know that Herbert Blackistone asked me to get some further expression of W. B. Blackistone\u2019s wishes ; I did not go immediately \u2014 it was a task I did not like to perform, and I asked Hr. Altervater in regard to his condition; he went into the sick room and returned, and stated to me that I might go in and try, that he W. H. Blackistone, had spoken intelligently to him; 1 then went'in, sat upon the bed, asked for pen, ink and paper ; they were furnished ; and for the will that it was said had been made; it was furnished me; it was without date or signature ; I copied it; I don\u2019t know where that copy is now, for I threw it down on the bed ; (paper purporting to be the nuncupative will of W. H. Blackistone, is shown witness ;) that paper, nor any part of it, is in my handwriting ; I would not be willing to swear that that is the identical paper from which I copied ; T have no recollection of that paper, nor any mark by which I could identify it; it was written on a piece of foolscap ; the copy of the paper purporting to be William H. Blackistone\u2019s nuncupative will was copied by me, but I never copied any such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>thing as that, (laying down the paper purporting to he W. D. Blackistone\u2019s nuncupative will,) there is a portion in those brackets relating to the accounts that I did copy, the rest I have no recollection of copying, I may have heard of those, really my understanding is different, I am in hopes the paper I copied may be found; I copied the entire paper that was shown to me; after copying that paper I stated to Wm. D. Blackistone that I wanted to k^\u00f3w what he was going to do with his property, he stated it had all been fixed, that he had left Mary Adaline, meaning Mrs. Shanks, the store, and cannot say whether one or two horses, a wagon, and there his articulation became thick ; it was my impression that he intended to convey to me the wishes of the paper that I had copied ; I told him that he had made a full disposition of his property, and that if there were any other parties that he wanted to leave the balance to I would like to know, I was ready to take it down Avith pen, paper and ink; I mentioned three female orphan cousins in Baltimore to whom I knew he had been formerly attached ; about that time others about the bedside spoke in different ways, whether they should raise him up or give him a little medicine, or something about bodily comfort I could not say ; the Rev. Mr. Pindell and Dr. Grittings came in just about that time, and after I got there I asked Mr. Pindell to question him in reference to the further disposition of his property, and I think he got no articulate answers, at least he did not impart them to me. I really believe he was capable of wishing, but not able to express the wish fully. I only remember this, that before he died I'was by his bedside, that Millard Corns asked him if there was any one he Avished to see, he said his dear wife, this was not a half hour before he died; don\u2019t think it was more than twenty minutes; Mrs. Shanks immediately said, do you know who this is, I was standing immediately before him, he said Benny, and I went out and told the Rev. Mr. Pindell that he was dying ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>it was about one or one and a half hours after I got there that he said he wanted to see his dear wife ; on cross-examination the witness testified further :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\">(The paper purporting to he the nuncupative will shown witness.) As I said before, the paper which I copied was without date or signature, it was on foolscap similar to this, and its general purport down to the brackets is similar to the one I copied ; the top of this is similar to the one I copied, the bottom not; Mr. Blackistone said everything had been fixed; I am sure I did read it to him, I heard him express wishes similar to those expressed in this paper, after I had copied this, I asked him what disposition he had made of the balance, he expressed wishes similar to what I copied, I don\u2019t wish you to think I said it was similar to this in every respect, the most important part was similar to this. I do not believe I copied this paper entire, but I really believe I did copy it, down to tbe brackets, in reference to accounts and administration I beard mentioned, but I cannot say whether I wrote that down or not; I have no recollection what was said in reference to accounts or administration, or who said it; I don\u2019t know whether this conversation was carried on in or out of tbe room; there was a general conversation going on; I beard about this account and administration in and out of the room ; I cannot say where I hoard it; I believe I was the most intimate friend of the deceased; never heard him say anything about leaving bis property to Mrs. Shanks, or any one else ; my business kept me from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">Dr. Altervater, testified as follows : I was acquainted with William D. Blackistone for about nine or ten years ; generally I was his family physician; I attended him in his last illness ; he died of cholic ; he was liable to attacks of rheumatism, ever since I have know him, but more freqirent lately; on cross-examination the witness said: I arrived at bis bouse on the morning of bis death \u2014 about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>six o\u2019clock; his mind was clear, and capable of transacting business; his mind was clear to the time he died, but his senses \u2014 physical\u2014were impaired by approaching dissolution ; the articulation was good when I first went there, but his voice was husky then ; it became impaired very soon afterwards ; on Monday night, when I saw him, I did not think him dangerously sick; did not until the morning of his death; did not encourage any fears of death to his family or himself; I told him I thought he would get well, until the morning of his death ; he died at his residence about half-past nine o\u2019clock, on the Philadelphia Road, on the 29th of July.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">It was admitted by the attorneys respectively for the caveator and caveatee, that the personal estate left by Wm.

When the nuncupation was reduced to writing within six days after utterance, the witnesses thereto, \u00a5m. J. Blackistone, Millard Corns, George Cloman and Adaline Anderson, solemnly swore that the testamentary words were spoken by the testator in <em>their </em>presence, the said testator <em>\u201c </em>at the same time <em>bidding us </em>(the said witnesses,) <em>to bear witness that such toas his last loill and </em>testamentThe <em>\u201crogatio testium,\u201d </em>the most important element, is here fully and explicitly shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-5\">It was right, and the exercise of proper caution and prudence that the supposed nuncupation was reduced to writing and attested within six days after the speaking thereof by the testator. A nuncupative will may be reduced to writing, together with the attestation or testimony in support of the same, at any time within six days after the making of the will, whether the widow or next of kin be present or not, but cannot be probated within fourteen days after the death of the testator, unless opportunity is afforded the widow or next of kin to contest the same. <em>Code, Art. </em>93, <em>sections </em>307 and 322; <em>Welling vs. Owings, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>470.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-6\">On the 4th of August the witnesses to the speaking of the will, were taken before the Orphans\u2019 Court and examined, and the testamentary language of the testator thus ascertained, reduced to writing and sworn to by the witnesses. iSTo administration was granted, nor does it appear that any wish was then expressed to have the will admitted to probate, or to have letters granted. The first request to have the will admitted to probate and to order letters to be granted, was made by the appellee on the 12th of August, in the presence of the caveator and next of kin, who was then in Court. The same day, the witnesses to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the will were examined, and cross-examined by the attorney for,the caveator in open Court, and upon' the conclusion of this testimony, the caveatee renewed her request, August 19th. The caveator produced her testimony in support of the caveat and petition,\u2019 and the order of the Court admitting the will to probate, was not passed, until August 26th, more than fourteen days after the death of the testator and in the presence of the next of kin.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-5\">That portion of the will which was written by Wm. J. Blackistone, at the request of the deceased, embraces nearly or quite all the bequests to Mrs. Shanks, the appellee, in the nuncupation propounded, in the Court below. The desire that she should have all the store accounts, and that she should administer upon the estate, was expressed by the deceased as part of the directions to the draughtsman, who attempted, but for some unexplained, reason, failed to write a will. The instructions given to the draughtsman in regard to the will, were partially written before the death of the testator, and fully written subsequent to his death. Inefficiency on the part of the writer prevented the full writing of the will, and when Col. Taylor desired to write it out, the \u201cact of God \u201d had intervened, and the sick man was physically unable to say more than that \u201c it had all been fixed,\u201d thereby showing that the directions given by him were intended to operate after death as his will. A partially written, but unfinished will, under such circumstances, will be admitted to probate as a valid nuncupative will. <em>Dorsey\u2019s Testamentary </em>Law, 51, 60 ; 1 <em>Harris &amp; McHen., </em>509 ; <em>Boofter vs. Rogers, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>44-53 ; <em>Weems vs. Weems, </em>19 Md., 348; <em>Bayldon vs. Bayldon, </em>2 <em>Eng.

Blaclristone deceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Some of the witnesses by whom the nuncupation was proved, were legatees, and objection was made below to their competency; this objection does not appear to be urged in the brief of the appellant. Nor would it avail, since the decision in <em>Estep vs. Morris, </em>38 <em>Md., </em>417, and in <em>Harris vs. Pue, </em>39 <em>Md., </em>535, in which it was held that by the Acts of 1864 and 1868, a party who takes an interest under a will has been made a legal and competent witness to prove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">There being no valid objection to the competency of the witnesses in this case, the only question upon the appeal, is whether their testimony is sufficient to establish the alleged nuncupation, as a valid unwritten will of Wm. D. Blackistone deceased. A careful examination of the testimony has brought us to the same conclusion which was reached by the Orphans\u2019 Court, and in our opinion their order admitting the will to probate ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">The requisites to constitute a valid nuncupative will, under our Code, <em>Art. </em>93, <em>see. </em>306, have been clearly defined in <em>Dorsey vs. Sheppard, </em>12 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>192 ; <em>O\u2019Neill vs. Smith, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>569, and <em>Biddle vs. Biddle, </em>36 <em>Md., </em>630. In those cases the alleged nuncupation was held to be unsupported by the proof. But the present case is dissimilar from them in every essential particular. Without recapitulating the testimony; it is sufficient for us to state as the conclusions which it clearly establishes :</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">1st. That the testator was of sound and disposing mind at the time of making the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">2nd. That he had the <em>animus testandi, </em>or present intent to dispose of his property by will, and used apt words of disposition.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AtL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>(Decided 8th December, 1874.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">3rd. The will has been proved by four witnesses, who all testify substantially in the same way, as to the words of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">4th. The <em>rogatio testium </em>is clearly proved; or to use the language of the Code, the testator at the time of pronouncing the will, \u201c requested the persons present, or some of them, to bear witness that such was his will, or to that effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">5th. It is proved that the will <em>\u201c </em>was made in the time of the last sickness of the deceased, and in the house of bis habitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">The testimony shows conclusively, that the nuncupation was made, when the testator was in immediate apprehension of death, and when he had not the time or opportunity to make a written will; which in <em>O\u2019 Neill vs. Smith, </em>was defined to be. the meaning of the terms of the Code, \u2022requiring such wills to be made <em>\u201c in the time of the last sickness of the deceased.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Being of opinion that all these requisites of the law have been complied with, in this case, we have no hesitation in \u25a0affirming the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">\n<em>Order affirmed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
