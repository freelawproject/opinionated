TIad or not the twelve years statutory bar of limitations accrued on the 28th day of August, 1867? Or to phrase the question diiferently, was not the bond above twelve years standing on that day ? The bond was drawn, executed and delivered on the 28th day of August, 1855. It was a perfect bond on that day. It was suable on that day. The right of action was perfect and complete on that day. The 28th of August, 1855, is to be reckoned in computing the age of the bond. On the 27th of August, 1867, it was twelve years old; on the 28th of August, 1867, it was above twelve years standing. To the last moment of the 27th of August, 1867, it was a perfect bond, and the remedy on it complete; when that day had expired, the remedy on it as a bond or contract was forever gone and extinct. <em>Carroll vs. Waring, </em>3 <em>Gill &amp; John., </em>491; <em>Presbrey vs. </em>Williams, 15 <em>Mass., </em>193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-6\">2nd. If the statutory-bar of limitations had accrued on the 28th of August, 1867, did the payment of interest then made by one obligor without the knowledge or consent of his co-obligor, operate to bind the latter, or warrant the inference in law of an <em>assumpsit </em>or promise on his part to pay the bond? Clearly not. In the case of a bond, payment by one obligor after the bar has attached, cannot be construed as in any way affecting his co-obligor, when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>made without his knowledge or consent, when in order to do so, the payment must not only operate to <em>create a remedy, but malte a new contract. </em>In the case of a bond after the bar has attached, the new promise is the substantive ground of action, the bond is simply offered in evidence as the inducement to and consideration for the promise. The bond is only an ingredient of the new contract sought to be enforced. This is the case whether the contract sought to be enforced, rests on an express promise or a promise implied from an acknowledgment. It is no less a new contract if it rests on an implied promise than if it arose out of an express promise to pay. When the bar attaches all community of interest is gone, and all supposed agency to bind each other is at an end. The bond as an active and efficient contract has ceased to operate. It may form one and the chief ingredient of a new contract, but as an available contract it is dead. <em>Ellicott vs. Nichols, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>85; <em>Bell vs. Morrison, et al., </em>1 <em>Peters, </em>371, 372 <em>and </em>373; <em>Felty, Admr. of Young vs. Young, </em>18 Md., 167; <em>Lamar vs. Manro, </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>61; <em>Bush vs. Stowell, </em>71 <em>Penn., </em>208.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b398-5\">Alvey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYu\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The declaration in this case is in assumpsit, but treating it as either in debt on the single bill, or in assumpsit founded on a promise by Leonard, made after the remedy on the single bill had become barred by the Statute of Limitations, in neither aspect could recovery be had against Hughlett, who has pleaded the Statute of Limita,tions as it applies to an action of debt on the single hill, together with the pleas of not indebted and never promised as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The single bill was made on the 28th day of August, 1855, and as no time was sj&gt;ecified for its payment, it was payable on demand. The action was instituted on the 9th of May, 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>The theory of the plaintiff, as set forth in his prayer for instruction to the jury, which was refused, is, that because Leonard, one of the obligors in the single bill, made a payment of interest due thereon, on the 28th of August, 1867, such payment amounted to a recognition of the debt, and an implied promise to pay it, whereby the running of the Statute was prevented, as well with respect to Hughlett as to Leonard. And in order to fix upon Hughlett liability resulting from such supposed recognition and implied promise, the plaintiff contends that the statutory period of twelve years, had not elapsed and become a complete bar to the single bill on the 28th of August, 1867, the date of the payment of interest; it being conceded, as it well might be, that if the bar was complete at that time, no promise, whether express or implied, by one obligor, would either revive the remedy on the single bill, or support an action of assumpsit on the promise, as against a co-obligor. <em>Ellicott vs. Nichols, </em>7 <em>Gill, </em>85; <em>Bell vs. Morrison, </em>1 <em>Pet,. </em>351.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">But whether the statutory period, as applicable to the remedy on the single' bill, had elapsed or not, is wholly immaterial. If it had elapsed, and the Statute had become a complete bar, then it is conceded, that payment of interest by Leonard, could not give a right of action as against Hughlett; and if the statutory period had not elapsed, still, the payment of interest, and the implied promise resulting therefrom, could not defeat the bar of the Statute as to Hughlett; nor indeed could it either give a right of action on the implied promise, or prevent the bar of thei Statute to an action on the single bill against Leonard.) One deed may be substituted for another, but a simple contract cannot be substituted for a deed, unless the deed be released or cancelled. <em>Add. on Contr. </em>1077. There cannot be a contract under seal, and a simple contract between the same parties for the payment of the same debt. There will be a merger of the simple contract, whether the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ties wish it or not, for the two contracts are incompatible, and, except where one is intended to be simply collateral to the other, they cannot exist together, and the higher must prevail. <em>Price vs. </em>Moulton, 10 <em>C. B., </em>561.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In the case of <em>Carroll vs. Waring, </em>3 <em>Gill &amp; John., </em>491, where it was sought to avoid the operation of the Statute of Limitations pleaded to a bond, upon the ground that interest had been paid within the statutory period, the Court said: \u201c The payment of interest, if it had been precisely or definitely alleged in point of time, it is clear, both upon reason and authority, would not have had that effect that is, to avoid the operation of the Statute : \u201cbecause the language of the statute of this State, <em>in the case of a Bond, </em>is positive and peremptory, that no bond shall be good and pleadable, or admitted in evidence, after the principal debtor and creditor have been both dead twelve years, or the debt, or the thing in action, above twelve years standing, saving to the creditor the usual benefits, or exceptions of infancy, &amp;c. It is also incontrovertibly established that not even an express acknowledgment of the debt will revive the remedy upon the bond, when barred by the operation of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">But, assuming that the twelve years had elapsed, and become a complete bar to the remedy on the single bill, on the 28th of August, 1861, it is quite clear that the mere payment of interest on the debt would raise no such promise as would support an action for the amount due on the note. Nothing less than an <em>express promise </em>to pay the amount due thereon, made after the Statute had become a bar to the remedy on the bond itself, will suffice to maintain an action of assumpsit to recover the amount due. In such case, the bond, although the remedy thereon be bar-red by the Statute, may be given in evidence, as the inducement to, or as explanatory of, 'and as furnishing the legal basis of the express promise to pay the amount remaining due on the bond. This has been expressly de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>cided by the cases of <em>Lamar vs. Manro, </em>10 <em>Gill &amp; J., </em>50, and <em>Young vs. Mackall, </em>4 Md., 362. It follows that the plaintiff could not recover, in any aspect of the case, as against Hnglilett; and the Court below was therefore right in rejecting the plaintiff\u2019s prayer ; and as the granting of the. prayers offered by the defendant could operate no injury to the plaintiff, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b401-5\">(Decided 9th February, 1875.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
