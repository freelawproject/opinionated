K. at the time of the conveyance that he had purchased the property' with the money of his wards. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>and wanted to convey it to him to place it beyond the reach of his creditors, and for the purpose of securing it to his said wards. The property was afterwards sold by K. and the whole purchase money was paid to the guardian. A surety on the guardian\u2019s bond, was sued on said bond and compelled to pay moneys misappropriated by the guardian. On a bill filed by the surety to make K. liable for having under the circumstances of the case permitted the guardian to receive the purchase money of the property, it. was Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b132-5\">1st.

It further appeared from the testimony offered on the part of the appellant, although denied by Haines and Knell in their answers, that Haines told Knell at the time of the conveyance, that he had purchased the property with moneys belonging to his wards, and wanted to convey it to him, Knell, in order to place it beyond the reach of his creditors, and for the purpose of securing it to the infant children.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The conveyance was made in 1861, and the legal title remained in the testator until 1866, when the property was sold, and <em>the whole purchase </em>money paid <em>to Haines, the guardian. </em>It is not pretended that Knell, the testator, ever received it, or in any manner appropriated to his own use, one dollar of the trust funds belonging to the wards, but it is contended that he is liable for having under the circumstances of this case, permitted the guardian to receive the purchase money of the property. But in this view we do not concur. Knell\u2019s relation to the property was altogether different from that of a stranger who unlawfully enters upon and receives the rents and profits of property belonging to infants. Here the property did not in fact belong to the wards. True, they had a lien upon it for the moneys used by the guardian in its purchase and improvement, and if the moneys thus used constituted the whole original purchase money, a Court of Equity would, upon application, have decreed it as belonging to them. On the other hand, however, the infants had the election, either to claim a <em>lien upon the property </em>for the moneys thus used by the guardian, <em>or to sue </em>his bond for a breach of his trust. Haines was permitted to remain as guardian, and no steps were taken to assert the lien upon the property. At the time the property was sold he was still the guardian, and as such entitled by law to receive all moneys belonging to his wards. On no theory, can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>the liability of Knell be maintained under such circumstances, except that of collusion with the guardian in committing a breach of his trust. The evidence in support of this branch of the case rests mainly upon the testimony of the witness Mentzel, and the appellant himself, in regard to conversations had with Knell, the testator, <em>in </em>1869, several years after the sale of the property and the receipt by the guardian of the purchase money. It seems that in these conversations Knell denounced Haines as a rascal, and said that in 1864, Haines was embarrassed and conveyed this property to him in order to place it beyond the reach of his creditors, and to secure it to the children, whose money he had used in its purchase and improvement. These statements were voluntarily made by Knell, and that too after suit had been brought against the appellant, as surety on the guardian\u2019s bond. Now, it can hardly be inferred from these declarations, that <em>he Jmeiv, or had reasonable grounds to believe </em>in 1864, when Haines received the purchase money, he intended to commit a breach of his trust. At that time not only was Haines the lawful guardian, but the appellant admits, that up to that time, and even for several years after-wards he had the most unbounded confidence in his honesty and integrity. But it is unnecessary to extend this opinion by a review at length of the testimony. It has been carefully considered and we are all agreed that it is insufficient to prove a co<em>operation or collusion </em>on the part of Knell, the testator, with the guardian in the misapplication or appropriation by him of the moneys belonging to his wards.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The objection to the testimony of the appellant cannot be sxistained. The admissibility of testimony depends upon the competency of the witness at the time he testifies, and cannot be affected by what may happen afterwards. When the testimony of Armitage was taken, Knell, the testator was alive, and under the Evidence Acts of 1864, chap. 109, and 1868, ch. 116, he was a competent witness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The fact that Knell died before the hearing, cannot render the testimony thus taken inadmissible.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b136-7\">(Decided 1st July, 1874.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">For these reasons the decree below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
