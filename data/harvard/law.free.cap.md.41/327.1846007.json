The Steamer Massachusetts was purchased in New York for $20,000, from A. J. Richardson hy Samuel J. Pentz, and it was conveyed to him and his brother, the appellant, by bill of sale dated Vth of February, 1863, and recorded at the Baltimore Custom House on the 21st of March, 1865. On the 24th of June, 186T, Samuel J. Pentz and the appellant mortgaged said steamer to the Old Town Savings Institution of Baltimore to secure the sum of $20,000 loaned to Samuel. By bill of sale dated the 14th of May, 1868, and recorded the same day, Samuel J. Pentz conveyed his one-half interest in the steamer to Joseph White. Previous to this, White was authorized by Samuel J. Pentz to take charge of the steamer. The steamer was repaired during the year 1868., in the City of Baltimore, the home port and the residence of the appellant, by the plaintiffs at the instance and request of White who stated that he was master and part owner thereof, and that the appellant was the other part owner. White obtained no authority from the appellant to have the work done. The repairs were reasonable, and necessary for the running of the vessel, and were made upon the credit of the vessel and her owners, and were charged upon the hooks of the plaintiffs to \u201cSteamer Massachusetts and owners.\u201d A part of the bill for repairs was paid by White. The appellant testified that he did not know that his name was on the register as part owner of the steamer, until some two or three years after the hill of sale from Richardson was recorded, she having been bought by Samuel J. Pentz, and that he never exercised any act of ownership over said vessel, except the execution of the mortgage aforesaid, which was executed by him at the instance and for the benefit of his brother Samuel, who got the entire amount of $20,000 loaned by the bank. That he never took possession of said steamer, nor appointed, nor joined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>in the appointment of officers for her, nor run her or interfered with her running, nor received anything from her earnings. That Samuel J. Pentz asked his permission to let White take charge of the vessel as captain, but he refused; that his brother came a second time and said White could raise enough money to pay for necessary repairs and expenses, and that he (the appellant) would not be made responsible for a dollar ; but he still refused ; that he -never passed a word with White about the vessel; the details for her management was arranged between White and his brother Samuel; that he was not a party to it; the vessel was entirely under the control of his brother Samuel and White, they having exclusive possession of her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\"><em>Exception. </em>The plaintiffs offered the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">1, If the jury believe from the evidence that J.

If the jury shall find from the evidence that John W. D. Pentz never took possession of the steamer Massachusetts, and never exercised acts of ownership over her, except as to the mortgage, and the explanation thereof given by him, and that said Pentz never run, or authorized the running of said steamer, or authorized White to repair said steamer, or appointed officers for her, then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover, although the jury may find that White ordered said repairs for said steamer on behalf of the owners.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-7\">6. If the jury find that said steamer was taken possession of by said White, under authority from Samuel J. Pentz, and that said White, acted as captain, by authority of himself and said S. J.

Reese </em>and <em>John </em>Carson, for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">White, in ordering the repairs, acted in his relation or capacity as owner, and not as master. Being himself a half owner, his acts must necessarily be referred to his higher capacity as principal or owner, and not master. But for one owner to bind his co-owner for repairs made at the home port where his co-owner resides, there must be express authority from such co-owner, or a holding out amounting to such authority; no such authority results from the relation of co-ownership per <em>se. </em>The question is always one of agency, to be found by the jury. 1 <em>Far. Mart. Law, </em>87 ; <em>Brodie vs. Howard, </em>84 <em>Eng. Com. Law, </em>117 ; <em>Hackwood vs. Lyall, </em>84 <em>Eng. Com. Law, </em>124 ; <em>Myers vs. Willis, </em>86 <em>Eng. Com.

D. Pentz ever gave White authority expressly to order these repairs, or held White out as possessing such authority ; this disposes of the whole case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-8\">Both the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers are erroneous and calculated to mislead the jury, because they base the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover, upon White\u2019s acts in his relation as master and not as owner. And even if it be held that the plaintiffs\u2019 first prayer submits to the jury the question of Pentz\u2019s liability by reason of White\u2019s acts being done in the capacity of part owner, it is erroneous and misled the jury, because they were not further instructed to find that Pentz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>had given express authority to White, or held him out as having such authority to bind him. As the prayer now .stands, the jury wore directed to find against Pentz, though they might believe that White was in nowise the agent of Pentz.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first prayer is further erroneous and calculated to mislead the jury, because it bases Pentz\u2019s liability upon White\u2019s relation as owner and master combined, which combination of relation to the vessel has no legal significance in fixing Pentz\u2019s liability, though the jury may from the form of this prayer have inferred otherwise.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-6\">But suppose White\u2019s acts are not to be referred exclusively to his relation as owner, but also as master, what then ? Does it follow that by his mere relation as master, he was authorized to bind the general owners, irrespective of the questions how he was appointed, and by whom he was appointed, or the place where the repairs were done ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 prayers, granted by the Court below, assert the proposition that because White was master, and ordered repairs, therefore Pentz as general owner was responsible for them. This doctrine of the liability of general owner for the acts of the master, from his mere relation to the vessel as master, was long since repudiated by this Court, and the law held otherwise. <em>Henderson vs. Mayhew, </em>2 <em>Gill, </em>393 ; <em>Stirling and Ahrens vs. Loud, &amp;c., </em>33 <em>Md., </em>436; <em>Stirling, et al. vs. Navassa Phosphate Co., </em>35 <em>Md., </em>140.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b345-8\">Whatever may have been the law heretofore, the whole current of modern authority is to this point\u2014 <em>whose agent is the party ordering the repairs? </em>The whole question is one of agency, aud the law is now so held by the highest tribunals of this country and Great Britain. <em>Myers vs. Willis, </em>84 <em>Eng.

Pentz. That he did not consult J. W. D. Pentz and obtain his consent. That J. W. D. Pentz was not in possession of the steamer; did not appoint her master; and had nothing to do with her running or earnings. White therefore, as master, was not J. W. D. Pentz\u2019s agent, and did not bind him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">But even if White was master, he is not the general agent of the owners. 1 <em>Parsons\u2019 Mar.

White\u2019s two capacities, as owner and master, together; they ignore the question of agency, whether White acted as master or owner ; they ignore the fact that the repairs were made at the home port; and they ignore the facts showing that Pentz; was out of possession, and that White had exclusive possession of the vessel.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-6\"><em>Frederick T.

To create this relation there must be a transfer or conveyance of some sort from the legal owner to the owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>and that arrangement, or the fact that it exists must be known to the material man to exempt the legal owner from responsibility for necessary repairs. <em>Saxton vs. Reed, Hill &amp; Denio, N.

The appellant, in his testimony, says he was very seldom on board of her, took no interest in her, and did not know she needed repairs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b347-9\">The appellees\u2019 prayers were properly granted, whether White be considered as master, or master and managing owner.

The main question presented by the record is, whether the captain had the authority under such circumstances, to pledge the credit of the appellant for the repairs thus ordered? It is a question of importance to the commercial interests, and it is to be regretted, that the decisions in this country are so conflicting. Without examining at length, the many cases in which this question has been considered, it is sufficient to say, that in some States it has been held, that the relation of master and owner, <em>per se, </em>confers upon-the former, authority to bind the latter for necessary repairs, either in a <em>foreign port, </em>or in the <em>home port </em>where the owner resides. <em>Glading vs. George, </em>3 <em>Grant\u2019s Cases, </em>290; <em>Winsor vs. Maddock, </em>64 <em>Penn., </em>231; <em>McCready vs. Thorne, </em>49 <em>Barbour, </em>438; <em>Provost vs. Patchin, </em>5 <em>Selden, </em>235.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">In other States this authority has been limited to a foreign port, or to the home port where the owner did not reside, and was not within easy access of the master. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>Jordan vs. Young, </em>37 <em>Maine, </em>276; <em>Elder vs. Larrabee,45 Maine, </em>594; <em>Woodruff vs. </em>Stetson, 31 <em>Conn., </em>61; <em>Fox vs. Holt, </em>36 <em>Conn., </em>571; <em>Taylor vs. Steamer Commonwealth, U.

B., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO6\">\u201cUnder the general authority which the master of a ship has, he may make contracts, and do all things necessary for the due and proper prosecution of the voyage in which the ship is engaged. But this authority does not usually extend to cases where the owner can himself personally interfere, as in the home.port, or in a port in which he has beforehand appointed an agent, who can personally interfere to do the thing required. Therefore, if the owner, or his general agent, be at the port, or so near to it as to be reasonably expected to interfere personally, the master cannot, unless specially authorized, or unless there be some usual custom of trade warranting it, pledge the owner's credit at all, but must leave it to him, or to his agent, to do what is necessary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The rule thus laid down was fully approved and sanctioned by the Court of Common Pleas, in <em>Gunn vs. Roberts, </em>9 <em>Com. Pleas, </em>331, <em>(Law Rep.,) </em>in which it was held, that the .master had no authority to bind the owner for necessary repairs, either at the home port where he resided, or at a foreign port at which the owner had an agent appointed for that purpose. In that case, as in this, it was contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>that the captain was the general agent of the owner, but, Brett, J., said, \u201cThat proposition cannot be supported in the fullest sense of the terms in which it was stated. The captain has authority to bind the owners to pay for supplies, or repay money advanced, only when the necessity of the case gives him that authority. In order to give rise to that authority, it has for many years been recognized that two things are necessary; first, it must appear that the money borrowed or goods supplied, were necessary for the use of the ship ; secondly, it must be shown, also that it was <em>reasonably </em>necessary that the captain should obtain or order them on the owner\u2019s credit. If the captain be in a foreign port, and the owner is not, there, and there is no agent of his there, and the captain has not himself been put in funds by the owner, then it may be reasonably necessary that he should order supplies on the owner\u2019s credit for the necessary purposes of the ship, but if he is in port in the owner\u2019s country, and the owner is there with means to pay for goods, or credit to order them for himself, the owner is the master of affairs, and there is no necessity for the captain to order them, or to pledge the owner\u2019s credit, and so there is no necessity for the captain\u2019s making a contract to bind the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u201c The leading case on the subject is <em>Arthur vs. Barton, </em>and the opinion there expressed by Lord Abinuer, as a summary of all the previous authorities, has always been held as a correct expression of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The Justice further says : \u201c McLachlan, in his work on Merchant Shipping, 131, correct1 y states the law as \u25a0follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201cAs appears from those early cases, but especially the last, there are well defined limits to the exercise of this authority on the part of the master. <em>First, </em>in cases where the owner or his agent is at the port of the ship\u2019s anchorage, or so near to it as to be reasonably expected to interfere personally, the master cannot, without <em>special au</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>thority </em>for the purpose, pledge the owner\u2019s credit for the ship\u2019s necessities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We have quoted at length from the opinion of the Court in this case, because it is the latest decision in England, and states correctly, we think, the law on the subject. Aftqr all, this question as to the authority of the captain to pledge the credit of the owner for necessary repairs and supplies, rests upon and must be determined by the general principles which govern the law of agency. To a certain extent at least, the captain is and must be treated necessarily as the agent of the owner, and as such, clothed with authority to do whatever may be considered fairly to be within the scope of his appointment. He must of course have the power to do whatever may be <em>necessary </em>to enable him to prosecute the voyage. If he should be in a foreign port and repairs are necessary to be done, and the owner is not there, and has no agent there authorized to act for him, the captain must, from the necessity of his position, be considered as having the authority to order such repairs to be done. But in the home port, where the owner resides, where he can be consulted and where he can personally interfere, no such necessity exists, and there is no reason why the captain should pledge his credit even for necessary repairs, without special authority for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">If then, the captain, as such, had no authority in this case to pledge the credit of the appellant for the work done and materials furnished, does the fact that he was <em>part-owner </em>at the time, confer upon him any greater authority ? This question as well as the question in regard to the power of the captain, depends upon the fact as to whether he was authorized by his co-owner to pledge the credit of the latter. In other words, it depends upon the question of agency. In <em>Brodie vs. </em>Howard, 84 <em>Eng. Com. Law, </em>109, Jervis, C. J., says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201c I think it is now perfectly well understood that these and all similar cases depend upon the question, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>whom was the contract made; and that again depends upon the question of principal and agent, \u2014 was the party who gave the order for the repairs the agent of the party sought to he charged? Before we consider that, it may he as well to understand what is the position of \u2018part-owners ! of a vessel. They may be partners generally, or partners in a particular adventure; but that they are not necessarily partners is clearly determined by the case of <em>Helme vs. </em>Smith, 7 <em>Bing., </em>709. A part owner, therefore, has not a general authority to bind his co-owners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<author id=\"b353-5\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akt\">I am of the same opinion. It is well established that part-owners of a ship are not in the position of ordinary partners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">But although the mere relation of co-owners does not confer this authority, yet it may be implied from the acts and conduct of the parties. As for instance, where the co-owner upon whose order the materials have been furnished and the work done, has been held out by the other co-owner as having such authority, or where by previous dealings, such authority has been recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">From what we have said, it follows, that the Court erred in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers. We find no error in the refusal to grant the defendant\u2019s prayers. Although the captain in this case had no express authority from the appellant to order these repairs, yet if the latter subsequently ratified the contract thus made, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. As the case will be remanded for a new trial, we do not propose to comment upon the evidence tending to prove such ratification on the part of the appellant. It is sufficient to say there was evidence on this subject, which ought to have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The proposition of law embraced in the third prayer may be correct in itself, but has no application to the facts in this case. The question here is not whether White was the captain of the appellant, a registered part-owner, or the captain of an owner <em>pro hac vice, </em>or the captain of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>charter party, and this prayer which is based upon the decision in <em>Mitcheson vs. Oliver, </em>85 <em>Eng. Com. Law, </em>419, has no application here.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b354-10\">(Decided 15th January, 1875.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The fourth, fifth and sixth prayers were also properly refused. The defendant was the <em>registered </em>owner of one-half of this steamer, and by his solemn deed of mortgage executed more than two years after the registration, he again declared himself as part-owner. So far then as these plaintiffs are concerned he must be considered as part-owner, regardless of any private understanding between himself and his brother to the contrary. Having thus held himself out to the public as part-owner, if he permitted, or suffered White to assume, and remain in, charge of the steamer as captain, the latter must be treated in a suit by third jiarties, as the captain in charge, by and with the <em>privity </em>and <em>consent </em>of the appellant. And although as captain he had no authority to pledge the credit of the appellant for the work done and materials furnished by the appellees, yet he will be held liable, if by his acts and conduct he has ratified the contract thus made by the captain.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">What will amount to a ratification, must depend upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In speaking of the ratification of unauthorized acts of agents this Court in <em>Maddox vs. Bevan, et al., </em>39 <em>Md., </em>491, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\"><em>\u201c </em>In many cases it may be inferred from his receiving and holding the fruits of the contract. Long acquiescence also, without objection, and even silence o\u00a3 th'e:: principal, will, in many cases, amount to a conclusive presumption of the ratification of an unauthorized act,:'especially where such acquiescence is not otherwise to be accounted for, <em>or such silence </em>is either contrary to the duty of the principal or has a tendency to mislead the agent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and new trial aioarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
