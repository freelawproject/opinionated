The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder conviction and imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>concurrent terms of three to five years for each of the other convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Judicial Court heard the defendant\u2019s appeal and affirmed the convictions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass. 495 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In October of 1984, Silva filed a pro se motion for a new trial. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b) &amp; (c), 378 Mass. 900-902 (1979). A judge of the Superior Court appointed a lawyer from the Committee for Public Counsel Services to represent the defendant in the matter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appointed counsel then filed a \u201csupplement\u201d to the defendant\u2019s pro se motion and a memorandum of law in support thereof. The trial judge having retired, another judge of the Superior Court, after holding a hearing thereon, denied the motion and supplement thereto on December 4, 1985, without any accompanying memorandum or written decision. The defendant\u2019s appeal from that denial is now before this court, and we affirm the denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The facts of the case, as set out in the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court in 388 Mass. at 497-500, were largely derived from the defendant\u2019s own pretrial statements which were in turn substantiated by his trial testimony. On January 12, 1979, the defendant came upon an automobile parked next to a Norton pharmacy with its engine running. <em>Id. </em>at 499. He jumped into the vehicle intending to take a \u201cjoy ride\u201d and then, as he shifted into gear, noticed there was an elderly woman sitting in the passenger seat. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 500. The defendant \u201cpanicked\u201d and drove off. <em>Ibid. </em>The woman, Diane Dion, told him she suffered from high blood pressure and had just returned from a doctor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>office. <em>Id. </em>at 499.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As the defendant drove through the grounds of the Paul A. Dever School in Norton, the victim slumped forward in her seat and passed out. <em>Ibid. </em>After unsuccessfully attempting to resuscitate the victim, the defendant put her in the back seat of the automobile and later transferred her to the trunk. <em>Ibid. </em>He testified that he thought Mrs. Dion was dead. <em>Id. </em>at 499, 500. He drove the vehicle to a cart path on the grounds of the Dever School and, with the victim still shut up in the trunk, set the automobile on fire. <em>Id. </em>at 499.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant remained nearby until the automobile was totally engulfed in flames. <em>Ibid. </em>A doctor testified at trial that the victim was alive when the fire started and had died as a result of the fire. <em>Id. </em>at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">When present counsel filed the \u201csupplement\u201d to the defendant\u2019s earlier pro se motion for a new trial, he based the claim for relief on trial counsel\u2019s allegedly ineffective representation of the defendant on two occasions during the course of the trial. Those occasions were when trial counsel failed to object to (1) the judge\u2019s statement to the jury that he did not believe that they could return a \u201cnot guilty verdict\u201d, and (2) the judge\u2019s omission of an instruction that the defendant could not be convicted of felony-murder unless the jury found that the underlying felonies involved circumstances demonstrating the defendant\u2019s conscious disregard of the risk to human life. The defendant, through his present counsel, contends that on each of those two occasions trial counsel\u2019s failure to object and otherwise protect his rights, amounted to \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>an ordinary fallible lawyer . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). We shall discuss those two issues separately, in the order in which they were argued in present counsel\u2019s brief, and state our basis for affirming the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">1. The defendant had been indicted for first degree murder. The defendant himself admitted that he had committed acts which warranted at least a verdict of manslaughter, and his obvious trial strategy was to attempt to persuade the jury to return a verdict of that lesser crime. Just prior to the judge\u2019s instructions, trial counsel strenuously beseeched the jury to return a verdict of manslaughter. He commenced his closing argument by stating, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any question that [the defendant], on that tragic day, set into motion a chain of events that led to Mrs. Dion being burned in the trunk of that car\u201d and continued by exhorting the jury, \u201c[F]ind him guilty of the correct crime.\u201d In the course of reviewing the possible verdicts on the murder indictment, he stated, \u201cNow, we come to the next type of crime, which I submit to you is what [the defendant] is guilty of in this case if you listen to what the judge tells you. He is guilty of involuntary manslaughter,\u201d and went on to ask that the jury \u201c[f]ind him guilty of the correct charge, and that charge is, he is guilty of manslaughter.\u201d Trial counsel concluded by urging, \u201cDo what you have to do; and I\u2019m asking you now that, if you listen to [the judge], I think you will agree with me that [the defendant] who took that life tragically is guilty of manslaughter and not murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The final arguments of trial counsel and the prosecutor were followed by the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, during the course of which the judge stated: \u201cThe jury always has the province to make its own conclusion in spite of the evidence and conceivably to enter a not guilty verdict. I don\u2019t see how on the evidence there could be such a verdict \u2014 a complete vin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>dication \u2014 but, however, that\u2019s for the jury to determine.\u201d Trial counsel made no objection to that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Considering the quoted statement of the judge, standing alone, it might be argued that it constituted an invasion of the exclusive province of the jury in judging the credibility and weight of the evidence and finding the facts of the case. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 572-573 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 365, 369-370 (1977). On the other hand, it could be argued that if the statement were considered in context, it was consistent with the position which trial counsel had espoused throughout the trial and in his closing arguments as the theory or strategy of the defense, and that the defendant was not deprived of an available defense but rather was given the benefit of the only conceivable defense available on the facts admitted by the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 228 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bertrand, </em>385 Mass. 356, 367-368 (1982). <em>Commonwealth v. Sielicki, </em>391 Mass. 377,382(1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In any event, it would serve no useful purpose to continue to identify or to discuss arguments on either side of the present issue because in this particular case there are circumstances which compel us to affirm the judge\u2019s denial of the motion for new trial insofar as the motion was based on the present claims of error in the trial judge\u2019s instruction and of ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to object thereto. It is undisputed that trial counsel made no objection to the instruction when it was given. It is also undisputed that the defendant\u2019s first appellate counsel made no attempt to raise the issue during the appeal which resulted in the decision published in 388 Mass. 495 (1983). The defendant has made no claim that first appellate counsel was incompetent or that he rendered ineffective assistance to the defendant in the prosecution of that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">It has long been and is still \u201cthe unbroken practice both under the statute [and now under rules of practice] and at common law respecting motions for new trial not to examine anew the original trial for the detection of errors which might have been raised by exceptions taken at the trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dascalakis, </em>246 Mass. 12, 24 (1923). <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>wealth </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>358 Mass. 506, 510-511 (1970). \u201cAlthough a trial judge may not be compelled by a motion for a new trial to review and reconsider questions of law which could have been raised at the trial, he nevertheless has the power to do so at his discretion. If he does so, his rulings on the questions may be presented to this court on appeal or exceptions.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 229 (1973). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blondin, </em>324 Mass. 564, 566567 (1949). There is nothing in this case to indicate that the judge who denied the motion for a new trial either intended to exercise, or exercised, his discretion in favor of considering questions which could have been, but were not, raised at the trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venuti, </em>315 Mass. 255, 261-262 (1943). <em>Commonwealths.McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. at 230-231.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">2. The trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the Massachusetts law of felony-murder as it stood at the time of the trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass, at 504-505 (\u201cjudge\u2019s charge was free of error when it was given\u201d). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matchett, </em>386 Mass. 492, 502-507 (1982). Nearly three years after the trial, the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matchett, supra, </em>enunciated a new standard for instructions on common law felony-murder. In <em>Matchett, </em>the court held that where the underlying crime is not inherently dangerous to human life,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the judge must instruct the jury that it cannot find the accused guilty of felony-murder unless it finds \u201cthat the [crime] involved circumstances demonstrating the defendant\u2019s conscious disregard of the risk to human life.\u201d 386 Mass. at 508. See <em>Commonwealth v. Silva, </em>388 Mass. at 503-504. See also Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law 65-66, 70 (3d ed. 1982); LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>\u00a7 7.5 (b) (1986). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>387 Mass. 644, 650-651 &amp; n.3 (1982), the court gave <em>Matchett </em>limited retroactive effect and extended its reach to cases where the underlying crime was unarmed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The defendant now claims that he was deprived of a substantial defense because his trial counsel did not have the foresight to object to the felony-murder charge which, at the time of trial, was entirely correct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass. at 505. There are several reasons why the defendant is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">a. Since the instructions of the trial judge were free from error when given, the failure of trial counsel to object to those instructions could not amount to \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention\u201d or \u201cbehavior . . . falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. at 96. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978) (\u201cmanifestly unreasonable\u201d). <em>Commonwealths.Bertrand, </em>385 Mass. at 368369 (\u201cillogical, uncomprehensible, or in the circumstances incorrect\u201d). Contrast <em>Commonwealth v. Rossi, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 257, 258-260 (1985). We will not judge the performance of trial counsel by hindsight. <em>Commonwealth v. Adams, </em>374 Mass, at 729. In this instance, an objection to the instruction would not have accomplished anything material for the defense at trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">b. The defendant was not ultimately deprived of any substantial defense because the defendant\u2019s first appellate counsel raised and the Supreme Judicial Court fully reviewed his claim that the judge\u2019s felony-murder charge erroneously omitted a <em>Matchett </em>instruction. See 388 Mass. at 505. Assuming, but not deciding, that <em>Matchett </em>applied,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the court addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>issue pursuant to its powers under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, as in effect prior to St. 1979, c. 346, \u00a7 2,* ******<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and held that failure to give the <em>Matchett </em>instruction created no risk of a miscarriage of justice because \u201ceven without application of the felony-murder doctrine, the proof of malice was overwhelming.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass, at 505-506. But see <em>id. </em>at 510-512 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quigley, </em>391 Mass. 461, 467 (1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1115 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>400 Mass. 334, 341 (1987). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matchett, </em>386 Mass, at 511. Certainly the evidence \u2014 consisting largely of admissions by the defendant \u2014 was indicative of a conscious disregard for human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Where, as here, the highest appellate court in the jurisdiction has held that there was no risk of a miscarriage of justice resulting from the underlying error claimed to have been committed by the trial judge,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we fail to see how there could properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>be a later finding that the defendant was deprived of an \u201cavailable substantial ground of defense.\u201d Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>400 Mass, at 341. If the claimed error did not create the risk of an erroneous result, the failure of counsel to object to that error at trial likewise could not have affected the result. Although the initial focus of the two inquiries is different \u2014 the judge\u2019s conduct of the trial when determining whether there was a miscarriage of justice and the behavior of counsel when determining whether the defendant had ineffective assistance \u2014 in this situation the two inquiries conclude with the same question: whether there was a substantial chance the jury would have acted differently had things gone as the defendant now claims they should have gone. Where an appellate court has already answered that question in the negative, a claim based upon the same issue but newly attired in the garb of ineffective assistance of counsel is duplicitous and amounts to mere \u201cMonday morning quarterbacking.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bernier, </em>359 Mass. 13, 18-19 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 59,61-62(1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The defendant is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-7\"> With the defendant\u2019s consent the court ordered that two other counts of larceny of a motor vehicle be placed on file without \u00e1 change of plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b247-8\"> The defendant has been represented by different counsel at three different stages of this case and, to avoid any confusion, we refer to them as follows: \u201ctrial counsel\u201d refers to the counsel who represented the defendant at the pretrial and trial proceedings through the jury verdict; \u201cfirst appellate counsel\u201d refers to counsel who represented him through the appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court resulting in the decision in 388 Mass. 495 (1983), and \u201cpresent counsel\u201d refers to counsel representing him in the present appeal from the denial of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b248-6\"> That day Dion\u2019s daughter, Beatrice Miller, had driven Dion to a doctor\u2019s appointment and, following the appointment, had driven to Haskins Pharmacy in Norton and left Dion in the car while she went inside. 388 Mass, at 497.

The <em>Matchett </em>holding was limited to cases involving offenses such as extortion (see 386 Mass, at 508), but, along with the holding in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>387 Mass. 644, 651 (1982), it has been more generally applied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Currie, </em>388 Mass. 776, 784-785 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>396 Mass. 234, 234-235 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 194, 196-197 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> The Supreme Judicial Court did not decide whether the underlying crime of kidnapping is inherently dangerous to human life. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass, at 505. Contrast Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law 63-64 (3d ed. 1982) (kidnapping properly classified as \u201cdangerous\u201d crime for purposes of common law felony-murder rule); LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law \u00a7 7.5(b), at 211 &amp; n.24 (modem felony-murder statutes list <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>kidnapping as a crime involving a significant prospect of violence). If the court had decided that kidnapping was inherently dangerous, <em>Matchett </em>would not have applied. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>388 Mass. 536, 543-544 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Currie, </em>388 Mass, at 785; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>17 Mass.

Furthermore, there was strong evidence that the kidnapping in this case was effectuated in a manner inherently dangerous to human life. Consequently, had the Supreme Judicial Court not found that the direct proof of malice was overwhelming, and if it found that kidnapping is not an inherently dangerous crime in all cases, it nonetheless might well have found failure to give a <em>Matchett </em>instruction was harmless error in this case. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Currie, </em>388 Mass, at 785-786; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>333 A.2d 72, 83 (Me. 1975) (\u201cWe see no reasonable possibility that the jury, if [properly] instructed would have found that the act of sodomy was not committed in a manner dangerous to human life\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b253-13\"> In its opinion (388 Mass, at 505 n.5), the court undertook to review the <em>Matchett </em>issue pursuant to \u00a7 33E \u201cas appearing in St. 1979, c. 346 \u00a7 2.\u201d Although that statute restricted review under \u00a7 33E to cases in which the defendant was convicted of first degree murder, the Supreme Judicial Court had held that \u00a7 33E review of \u00e1 second degree murder conviction was proper if the offense occurred before July 1, 1979, as did the offense in this case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 16 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b253-14\"> The Supreme Judicial Court reviewed this issue under G.
