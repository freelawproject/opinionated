L. c. 249, \u00a7 4), the plaintiff, Commissioner of the Metropolitan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>District Commission (MDC), sought to reverse an April, 1982, decision of the Civil Service Commission (commission) which ordered the MDC to reinstate Alexander Vafides to his former position as tunnel inspector. The commission found that Va-fides\u2019s employment had been wrongfully terminated. The MDC claims that the commission lacked jurisdiction to reinstate Va-fides because he had retired from his position upon learning that he had been terminated. A judge of the Superior Court ordered Vafides reinstated. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Vafides, a disabled veteran entitled to preference under G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A, was one of several tunnel inspectors<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who were laid off by the MDC for lack of funds on September 17, 1981.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They appealed to the commission pursuant to G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 43, and in April, 1982, the commission, adopting the findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>and following the recommendation of the hearing officer, ordered reinstatement.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Prior to the commission\u2019s decision, Vafides retired. In order not to defer retirement benefits, he had to elect retirement within sixty days of the notice of termination. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10 (3). Whether the retirement occurred before or after the filing of his appeal to the commission is a matter of dispute. The record is not clear on this point, but the date of his retirement is irrelevant to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">In the Superior Court action in the nature of certiorari brought by the MDC against the commission the tunnel inspectors were permitted to intervene. The MDC and the Commission were able to settle the claims for reinstatement of the tunnel inspectors other than Vafides. Only his case remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">At a hearing in the Superior Court an assistant attorney general, on behalf of the commission, moved to remand the matter to the commission for it to consider the factual and legal issues raised by Vafides\u2019s retirement upon his right to reinstatement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The MDC assented to the motion, and the trial judge remanded the matter to the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">An administrative magistrate found, on remand, that Vafides had been employed as a tunnel inspector for nineteen and one-half years, that prior to his termination in September, 1981, he had made no plans to retire, and that his retirement was \u201cthe direct result of his layoff.\u201d He \u201capplied for retirement benefits solely in contemplation of his termination in an effort to secure some measure of financial stability for his family.\u201d The administrative magistrate recommended reinstatement because the commission had found the layoff to be unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>While adopting the findings of fact of the magistrate, the commission ruled, without discussion, that \u201cthe appellant did in fact retire and therefore the commission lacks jurisdiction. \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial judge disagreed and concluded that since Vafides would not have retired \u201cbut for the erroneous action taken by the MDC, he is entitled to be reinstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">That holding, based on the administrative record, accords with the normal rules governing employment and other contracts. Just as an employee is relieved of the adverse consequences of a decision to terminate his employment which is induced by fraud, coercion, or duress, see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wayland, </em>374 Mass. 249, 259 (1978), he is relieved of a decision made in reasonable reliance on misinformation received from his employer. Such a decision cannot be considered an informed choice or a voluntary retirement. See <em>Covington </em>v. <em>Department of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984). See also <em>Scharf v. Department of the Air Force, </em>710 F.2d 1572, 1575 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation., </em>701 F.2d 36, 39-40 (5th Cir. 1983). Compare <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>591 F.2d 688, 690-691 (Ct. Cl. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">\u25a0While the focus of the findings of the administrative magistrate, adopted by the commission, was directed to the wrongful, rather than the misleading, nature of the MDC\u2019s action, her findings, together with those made by the commission in 1982, show that Vafides was, indeed, misinformed in material ways. This conclusion is substantiated by the administrative record.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">In 1982, the commission found the appellants were informed \u201cthat their positions were being eliminated because of a lack of subsurface construction\u201d; that \u201c[n]ot one of the appellants had ever been employed in subsurface construction\u201d; and that other employees (senior tunnel inspectors) having similar duties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>were unaffected by the layoffs. The reference to a lack of future subsurface construction and the statement that construction would be almost wholly in the areas of bridges and buildings, would reasonably lead a tunnel inspector, like Vafides, to doubt that future employment was likely. See <em>Covington </em>v. <em>Department of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>750 F.2d at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">More important, the termination notice, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>which provided information as to appeal and retirement rights, suggested that both avenues were open and in no way indicated that there was any inconsistency between pursuing an appeal and taking retirement. See <em>Covington, </em>750 F.2d at 943., 944. See also <em>Gonzalez, </em>710 F.2d at 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We recognize that we have recast the findings of the commission in terms of the erroneous nature of the information given to Vafides. We conclude, however, that the two sets of findings, the original ones and those on remand, together with the notice of termination, leave no doubt that his decision to retire was not voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">There is, moreover, another basis for our decision. The MDC, being the appellant in this proceeding in the nature of certiorari, has the burden of showing error on the record of the commission\u2019s 1982 decision. This it has not done, as the later findings of the administrative magistrate do not suffice to show that Vafides\u2019s retirement was voluntary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The MDC\u2019s reliance on <em>Worcester </em>v. <em>Civil Serv. Commn., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 278, 283 (1984), is misplaced. That case, construing G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 39 &amp; 41, held that those provisions give employees faced with separation from employment for lack of funds a clear choice: they can either avoid separation and voluntarily accept demotion with restoration to their previous status as soon as funds are available, or contest the layoff and exercise the rights provided for in G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41 \u2014 appeal to the commission and judicial review. That case has no application where, as here, Vafides does not appear to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>have had that statutory choice,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and where he was given incorrect information<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> as to the choices available to him. Other cases cited by the MDC, <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Treasurer of Cambridge, </em>310 Mass. 484, 487-488 (1941), and <em>Jones v. Wayland, </em>374 Mass. at 252 n.3, 259-261, are inapposite. In <em>Bell, </em>the court found the relinquishment of duties voluntary, and in <em>Jones </em>no issue was raised as to whether the resignation was knowingly and voluntarily made. See <em>Jones </em>at 252, n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We hold that the commission\u2019s original decision was correct. Vafides was not barred from contesting the layoff, and the commission could grant relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-6\"> An anachronistic misnomer. The commission found that employees working under the classification of tunnel inspectors were not employed to do subsurface work. At oral argument the panel were informed that they perform office duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-7\"> The MDC letter terminating Vafides\u2019s employment is not reproduced in the agency record appearing in the record appendix. The only termination letter applying to a veteran contained in the agency record is a letter to Robert Bell, who also appealed from the MDC termination. Since the commission decision suggests that the letters were similar and the MDC has not inserted anything in the record to indicate otherwise, we treat Vafides as having received a comparable notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The letter to Bell indicated that for purposes of economy the MDC had to initiate a reduction in work force. It also suggested that his job (\u201cas well as [those <em>of] </em>other employees serving in the same position\u201d) would not be needed in the future since the type of construction the MDC will be engaged in \u201cwill almost wholly relate to bridges, highways, structures and buildings rather than the sub-surface construction that has been so large a part in the past.\" The letter notified Bell that he had an opportunity for a full hearing, and that he should also be aware that as an employee with fifteen or more years of service, he was entitled to certain rights within the State\u2019s retirement system. Copies ofG. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 39-45, and of c. 32, \u00a7 16, were included.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">General Laws c. 31, \u00a7 41, requires that copies of \u00a7\u00a7 41-45 be given to employees. Nothing in any of those provisions would warn an employee of possible consequences of retirement on his rights to appeal. The letter in no way suggested that the right to a hearing and the right to retirement benefits are inconsistent. To the contrary, the letter suggested that both were available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> The commission found that because \u201cthe appointing authority used as its rationale the lack of subsurface construction in laying off [Vafides] where [he was] never assigned to that task [he was] unfairly singled out.\u201d See note 3, <em>supra. </em>It also found that Vafides had not been accorded the preference to which he was entitled as a disabled veteran. See G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b601-13\"> The judge recognized that Vafides, who was sixty-six years old at the time of termination in 1981, would probably follow a reinstatement by a second retirement but explained that Vafides would then be entitled to a different retirement pay and other adjustments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> Federal regulations, 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 752.401(c)(3) (1987), specifically provide that where \u201cvoluntary action\" is \u201cinitiated by the employee\u201d he is excluded from the category of employees entitled to take an appeal from agency action. It does not appear that there are similar State regulations. For purposes of this decision, we assume that an informed voluntary retirement may preclude an appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\"> We do not intimate that in an initial proceeding before the commission the appointing authority would have the burden of showing a retirement to be voluntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b604-7\"> The commission\u2019s 1982 decision indicates that Vafides\u2019s position was not one classified under G. L. c. 31 and that his rights under G. L. c. 31, \u00a7 41, are by reason of G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 9A. The latter statute provides that veterans holding certain positions in the service of the Commonwealth are to be involuntarily separated from such positions only in accordance with the provisions of G. L. c. 31, \u00a7\u00a7 41-45.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b604-8\"> This is on the assumption made in note 6, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
