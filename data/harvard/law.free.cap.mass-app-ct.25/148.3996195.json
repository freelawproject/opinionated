G. L. c. 275, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We could very well dismiss the appeal for lack of prosecution because none of the thirteen \u201cissues\u201d enumerated at the outset of the defendant\u2019s brief has been argued within the meaning of Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See <em>Lolos </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>338 Mass. 10, 13-14 (1958); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>370 Mass. 746, 758 (1976); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Samuel, </em>398 Mass. 93, 95 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number><em>Kamishlian, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 931, 934 n.3 (1985).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We would be tempted to do so were it not for one point concerning the instructions to the jury which commands our attention and requires a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The judge gave acceptable instructions on the presumption of innocence and on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element of each of the offences charged. He gave no instruction whatsoever on the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We think it too clear for argument that the omission constituted error. \u201cThe judge\u2019s iteration that the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the crime charged lay on the Commonwealth did nothing to convey the weight of that burden. That the judge stressed the presumption of the defendant\u2019s innocence did not inform the jury of the standard required to overcome that presumption.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Kelleher, </em>395 Mass. 821, 826 (1985). Of like import are <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>380 Mass. 545, 548 (1980), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>391 Mass. 123, 133 (1984) (\u201cThe jury\u2019s knowledge of which party had the burden [of proof] did not inform them with respect to the extent of that burden\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">It is true, as the Commonwealth points out, that the defendant failed to object to the omission. Such a failure is hardly decisive in this area (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>381 Mass. 753, 756-758 [1980]) because, as we have said on more than one occasion, \u201cserious misdirection about reasonable doubt . . . can scarcely avoid creating a substantial risk of miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 805 (1985). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dupree, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 945,946 (1986). In the present case, the evidence as to whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the defendant had threatened to kill the officers was sharply conflicting. The police testified to such threats and that they had been larded with vulgarity; the defendant denied any threats and testified to remarks which were in no sense minatory and which could be repeated in polite company. The evidence of guilt was not overwhelming (compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>373 Mass. 116, 128 [1977], <em>S. C., </em>381 Mass. 306 [1980]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>380 Mass. at 547, 549-550; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rembiszewski, </em>391 Mass, at 134-135; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelleher, </em>395 Mass. at 827-828), and we find ourselves unable to conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">We recognize that the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has recently held that there is no violation of Federal due process if a judge who has instructed properly on the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt refuses, in the exercise of his discretion, to give an instruction on the meaning of reasonable doubt. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Olmstead, </em>832 F.2d 642, 644-646 (1st Cir. 1987). However, the necessity for a proper instruction on the meaning of reasonable doubt is a matter of State law, which, in this area, requires more than the First Circuit does. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>381 Mass. at 761.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A5j\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-15\"> The defendant was acquitted on a companion charge of being a disorderly person. G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b175-7\"> The brief is reminiscent of the one criticized in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richard, </em>377 Mass. 64, 65 (1979), <em>S. C., </em>398 Mass. 392, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1010 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> We are satisfied that the omission was the result of oversight, perhaps because the defendant had not requested an instruction on the point. The judge made clear during a bench conference that he is conversant with the <em>Webster </em>charge <em>(Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 [1850]) on the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
