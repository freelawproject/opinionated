He was then sentenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>The evidence presented in the Commonwealth\u2019s case could have warranted the jury in finding that the victim had voluntarily gone with the defendant in his car to look for the victim\u2019s brother, that the defendant later refused to take her home and that he threatened her with a gun (which she did not see). The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence could additionally have supported findings that the defendant forced her to perform fellatio and to have sexual intercourse. The evidence offered in the defendant\u2019s case could have warranted the jury in finding that the victim had gone for a ride with him and agreed to smoke some marihuana, that she agreed to have sex with him, and that she first willingly performed fellatio and then engaged in sexual intercourse. The trial, therefore, came down to a contest of credibility between the victim, who testified and claimed that she had been raped and threatened with a gun she never saw, and the defendant, who did not testify but told the police that he and the victim had smoked marihuana together and had engaged in consensual sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">We agree with the defendant\u2019s contentions that (a) the judge\u2019s indication in his preliminary instructions to the jury venire that he did not think witnesses intentionally lie and (b) the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury, despite a written request to do so, that no adverse inference was to be drawn from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify, could have combined in the minds of the jurors improperly to prejudice his defense. Therefore we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The judge\u2019s indication to the jury venire in preliminary instructions that he personally did not believe that witnesses lied was objected to by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, who made a motion that the jury venire be excused and another venire be brought to the courtroom. The defendant\u2019s counsel also disclosed to the judge that the defendant\u2019s entire case was based on the issue of consent, that \u201cthe defense must call [the victim] a liar because she has claimed to have been raped,\u201d and that \u201cinadvertently your comments may have endorsed [the victim\u2019s] position.\u201d The judge denied the motion to excuse the venire, but indicated that he would instruct further. No further instructions were given on the issue of witness credibility until the closing jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Preliminary instructions by a judge to a criminal jury venire may be considered in deciding whether the instructions as a whole were correct, proper and fair. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corliss, </em>371 Mass. 266, 267 (1976). The judge\u2019s comment, although undoubtedly made in good faith, may have had the unfortunate effect of suggesting to the jurors that the victim\u2019s testimony should be found to be credible, despite the defendant\u2019s assertion that the victim had fabricated the accusations. There were instructions at the close of the case about the jury\u2019s role in deciding issues of credibility. We do not think those instructions effectively negated the impression that may have been created by the judge\u2019s comment at the outset of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Moreover, the effect of the comment has to be considered in conjunction with the instruction given on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel filed timely requests for jury instructions, which included request no. 13, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">\u201cThe prosecution bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt every essential element of the crimes charged against Mr. Green. Mr. Green has absolutely no burden to introduce any evidence whatsoever, and you are to draw no adverse inference from the fact that he did not testify in this case. Your function is solely to determine whether or not the prosecution has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Green in fact committed the crimes charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The judge instructed in language which differed from the requested instructions, as he had discretion to do. The judge failed, however, to advise the jury that no adverse inference should be drawn against the defendant because of his failure to testify. He added the following general comments about defendants who choose not to take the witness stand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201cThe provisions of the constitution and the statute were framed with a due regard to those who might prefer to rely upon the presumption of innocence, which the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>gives to everyone. And not wish to be a witness. It is not everyone who can safely venture onto the witness stand, although entirely innocent of the charge against him. Excessive timidity, nervousness when facing others, and attempting to explain transactions of a suspicious character and offenses charged against him will often confuse and embarrass a person to such a degree as to increase rather than remove prejudices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a mistrial based upon the latter language. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held \u201cthat a state trial judge has the constitutional obligation, upon proper request, to minimize the danger that the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 305 (1981). This court has stated that language about the defendant\u2019s right to remain silent \u201cdoes not avoid the necessity for such an instruction. The proscription against drawing adverse inferences from a defendant\u2019s failure to testify on his own behalf is not a necessary corollary of his constitutional right to remain silent. It is a related but distinct proposition, evidenced by the fact that, prior to <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609 (1965), it was permissible in several States for courts to charge juries that a defendant had a constitutional right not to testify but that the jury could draw any inference it thought proper from his exercise of that right.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 676, 677 (1984). \u201cIf a defendant does not testify a Ijjudge must be very careful in regard to the instructions to the jury on this point and even an unintended suggestion that might induce the jury to draw an unfavorable inference is error.\u201d Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1874 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We agree with the Commonwealth that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object with precision to the omission of \u201cno adverse inference\u201d language from the instruction. We think, however, that the conjunction of (a) the judge\u2019s personal observations in the preliminary instructions that have been discussed previously and (b) the instruction given on the defendant\u2019s elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>tion not to testify, which failed to caution the jury not to draw an adverse inference from the defendant\u2019s election not to testify and which contained the language quoted above, could have led the jury to conclude that the victim\u2019s testimony was to be believed, despite the defendant\u2019s claim that her testimony about the use of force was fabricated. Moreover, the combination of the judge\u2019s opening remark and the failure to instruct as requested may have suggested to the jury that the defendant could not have taken the witness stand without lying. In a case which boiled down exclusively to an issue of credibility, and in which \u201cthe defendant was the only person in a position to contradict any of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 410 (1979), a new trial is necessary to ensure that justice is done. We are not persuaded otherwise by the arguments of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The judgment on indictment no. 83218 is reversed and the verdict on that indictment is set aside.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-15\"> The defendant was also convicted on companion indictments for indecent assault and battery and assault and battery, which were placed on file with his consent and which are not before us. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 437-438 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\"> The defendant, on request made to the Superior Court within thirty days from the date of this order, may also have a new trial on indictment no. 83219 for indecent assault and battery and on indictment no. 83220 for assault and battery.
