After receiving a letter from the board stating that it had received information that the restaurant was in violation of the regulation, the plaintiff sought a variance. When, subsequent to a hearing, the variance was denied, he sought judicial review of the agency action in the Superior Court. A judge of that court affirmed the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">In his appeal to this court, the plaintiff argues that the board\u2019s decision failed to comply with G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8), which requires that every agency decision be accompanied by a statement of reasons, and that the application of the board\u2019s regulation to the plaintiff conflicts with another regulation, 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.6 (1982), with which he has complied. We agree with the plaintiff that the board\u2019s findings are inadequate, and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment and order the case remanded to the board for additional findings and for any revision of its decision that may be appropriate in light of those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">1. <em>Applicability of G.L.c. 30A to the board\u2019s proceedings. </em>Although the parties acted on the assumption that the appeal from the denial of the variance was pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a714, that assumption is not obvious. The governing statute was G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A, as in effect prior to St. 1986, c. 267, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>&amp; c. 642, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5The former \u00a7 13A<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> did not provide for a hearing on a petition for a variance from the board\u2019s regulations. The only provision allowing a deviation from the regulations was found in the fourth paragraph of former \u00a7 13 A. That paragraph prohibited construction or alteration prior to receiving board approval of plans showing compliance with the board\u2019s regulations. The paragraph also contained the following proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">\u201c[I]f the . . . board determines that compliance with said rules and regulations is impracticable in the particular case, it may provide for modification of, or substitution for, such rule or regulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Since the statute which allowed, in certain cases, noncompliance with board regulations did not require that the applicant be given an agency hearing, and since such a hearing does not appear constitutionally required, see <em>Lotto </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass. 775 (1976); cf. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Board of Assessors of Granby, </em>387 Mass. 117,121 (1982), the board\u2019s hearing and decision was not an \u201cadjudicatory proceeding\u201d as defined by c. 30A, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>School Comm. of Franklin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Educ., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 683, 689 &amp; n.6 (1984), <em>S.C., </em>395 Mass. 800, 806 &amp; n.5 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The board, however, by regulation, recognized the advantages of affording the applicant a hearing. See <em>Yerardi\u2019s Moody St. Restaurant &amp; Lounge, Inc. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Randolph, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 296, 302 (1985). The regulations in effect at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>time of the hearing, 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 4.1.1.4 and \u00a7 4.2 (1982), provided that \u201cthe applicant may initiate an adjudicatory proceeding before the Board\u201d and that such a hearing shall be conducted in accordance with c. 30A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus the board, by its regulations, bound itself to conduct the hearing pursuant to c. 30A. <em>Northbridge </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>394 Mass. 70, 76 (1985) (agency must follow its own regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">2. <em>Inadequacy of findings. </em>Chapter 22, \u00a7 13 A, provided that the board shall make rules \u201cdesigned to make public buildings accessible to, functional for, and safe for use by physically handicapped persons,\u201d and, as we have indicated, also allowed for the modification of, or variance from, such rules when application was \u201cimpracticable in the particular case.\u201d The board by regulation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> explained the factors it would weigh in determining whether to grant a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">The decision of the board, insofar as it gives reasons for denying the variance, is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The only ground mentioned is the fact that the plans submitted by the plaintiff, on the basis of which a letter of compliance was issued, did not show a change in level in the restaurant. As matter of policy, the board could determine that a hardship created by a failure to submit accurate plans requires more to persuade the board of the need for a variance, cf. <em>DiGiovanni </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Rockport, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 339, 348-349 (1985), than does a request for a deviation preceding construction. Title 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.11 (1982), however, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>at least in a situation where the violation is due to an honest mistake,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> indicates that other factors are also to be weighed. Indeed, a review of the transcript, particularly the questions asked by members of the board, reveals that the board considered options other than ramps at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">By ordering a remand to the board for findings in accordance with c. 30A, \u00a7 11(8), we do not imply that the decision must be changed, although the board may, of course, do so or allow the plaintiff to submit a substitute plan to provide more access. What the board is required to do is to articulate its reasons for the denial of the variance. The reasons should include taking into account the facts which bear on the concept of \u201cimpracticability\u201d set forth in the board\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">3. <em>Possible conflict with 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.6. </em>There is no merit to the plaintiff\u2019s argument that the board could not apply the regulation mandating that the restaurant be constructed on one level or that ramps be provided because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>another regulation, 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.6 (1982),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provided for a required number of accessible tables according to a formula. We see no necessary conflict between the two provisions. It does not appear that compliance with the accessibility regulation is intended to be a substitute for compliance with the floor level requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">For the reasons stated in part 2 of this opinion, the judgment is reversed and a new judgment is to be entered annulling the decision of the board and remanding the case to the board for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b68-9\"> The regulation in effect at the time of the hotel\u2019s design and construction was numbered \u00a7 12.2 (1977). It was subsequently recodified as 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 17.2 (1982). The 1977 regulation was essentially the same as the 1982 regulation quoted in the text. The current (1986) regulation is identical to the 1982 regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\"> Unless otherwise indicated, the portions of former G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A, discussed herein are substantially similar to the current version of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b69-9\"> As appearing in St. 1986, c. 642, \u00a7 2, \u00a7 13A now provides for an opportunity for a hearing prior to a finding of noncompliance and also explicitly provides for judicial review of any board decision under \u00a7 13A. We do not consider whether the 1986 amendment requires a hearing on a petition for a variance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\"> Under c. 30A, \u00a7 1(1), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, an \u201c\u2018adjudicatory proceeding\u2019 means a proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties or privileges of specifically named persons are required by constitutional right or by any provision of the General Laws to be determined after opportunity for an agency hearing.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\"> These regulations read in full: \u201c4.1.1.4: Upon receipt of a notice of action pursuant to Section 4.1.1.3, the applicant may initiate an adjudicatory proceeding before the Board in accordance with the Provisions of Standard Adjudicatory Rules of Practice and Procedure 801 [Code Mass.

The Board further finds that a letter was issued on May 1, 1980, from this Board, stating that the Board had reviewed the plans and found them to be in compliance with the Regulations. The petitioner relied on that letter and acted under the assumption that the plans that were submitted to this office <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>showed a change in level in the Seasons Restaurant. However, after reviewing the plans on file in this office, the Board finds that the plans on which the May 1, 1980 letter was issued, did not show a change in level in the restaurant. Therefore, the restaurant was constructed in violation of Section 12.2 with respect to the change in level in the restaurant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">\u201cThe petitioner further stated that the raised level in the restaurant contains 52 seats and the accessible level contains 86 seats.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b71-9\"> For purposes of this opinion, we accept the plaintiff\u2019s statement, as apparently did the board, that the erroneous submission was due to an honest mistake. If the facts be otherwise, different considerations may be relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\"> The regulation provided: \u201cWhere seating is fixed, the number of accessible tables shall be computed by the formula contained in Section 23.4 and shall be proportionally distributed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
