The agreement contained a warranty provision and an arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">After Grovecrest transferred ownership to the plaintiffs, a dispute arose as to the construction of the house, in particular, certain alleged defects in the foundation. The plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Worcester Division of the District Court Department seeking damages from Grovecrest and Bradgate Associates, Inc. (Bradgate was apparently the contractor). During the pendency of the case, the matter was referred to binding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>arbitration. The arbitrator found for the plaintiffs against both defendants in the amount of $18,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The defendants filed a motion in the District Court to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. The basis for their motion was that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority by awarding punitive or multiple damages under G. L. c. 93A. There was, the defendants argued, no evidence to justify the c. 93 A award. A District Court judge denied the defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the award. The defendants then appealed the matter to the Appellate Division of the District Court. By decision dated February 13, 1987, the Appellate Division dismissed the report, concluding that the measure of damages was an issue of fact for the arbitrator and final (even if grossly erroneous), and, as there was no allegation of fraud or any indication on the record that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority, that no error was shown. The defendants appealed from that decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In its decision, the Appellate Division, sua sponte, raised the issue whether the District Court had jurisdiction to act on a motion to vacate an arbitration award. It expressed doubt that there was jurisdiction but stated that because no party had raised or briefed the issue, it would proceed to decide the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">On appeal, neither party has raised the question of lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter. However, \u201c [i]t is our duty to note and decide a jurisdictional question, \u2018regardless of the point at which it is first raised,\u2019 and whether any party has raised it.\u201d <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 670 (1984), quoting in part from <em>Litton Business Syss. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>383 Mass. 619, 622 (1981). See Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3), 365 Mass. 757 (1974).

Section 12(a), as appearing in St. 1960, c. 374, \u00a7 1, provides that, \u201c [ujpon application of a party, the <em>court </em>shall vacate an award if . . .\u201d (emphasis supplied). Section 16, also as appearing in St. 1960, c. 374, \u00a7 1, defines \u201ccourt\u201d as \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction of this state.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is nothing in G. L. c. 251 that further defines the meaning of the word \u201ccourt.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, \u00a7 17, as appearing in St. 1960, c. 374, \u00a7 1, specifically refers to the Superior Court as the forum where \u201c [a]n initial application [to vacate] shall be made[.] \u201d Although that statute is nominally concerned with venue, it has strong jurisdictional overtones.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to rule on the defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The ruling of the District Court denying the defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award is annulled, and a new order is to be entered in that court dismissing that motion for lack of jurisdiction in that court to grant the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-5\"> In <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falzarano, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 591, 592-593 n.2 (1979), <em>S.C., </em>380 Mass. 18 (1980), the court stated that proceedings in that case in the Probate Court to stay arbitration proceedings under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 <em>2(b), </em>were a nullity as \u201c [tjhe Probate Court was without jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings, jurisdiction over them being limited to the Superior Court. G. L. c. 251, \u00a7 <em>2(b) </em>(as appearing in St. 1960, c. 374, \u00a7 1).\u201d The Supreme Judicial Court noted that the parties agreed that the Probate Court was an improper forum, citing to \u00a7 <em>2(b). </em>See 380 Mass, at 20 n.6. The instant case, however, does not involve a motion to stay arbitration proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\"> General Laws c. 251 is modeled after the Uniform Arbitration Act, with some variations.

L. c. 218, \u00a7 19, which is concerned with the civil jurisdiction of the District Court Department, gives no specific authority to that Department to rule on a motion to vacate an arbitration award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b554-9\"> General Laws c. 251, \u00a7 17, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">\u201cAn initial application shall be made to the superior court for the county in which the agreement provides the arbitration hearing shall be held or, if the hearing has been held, in the county in which it was held.
