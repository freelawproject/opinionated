The arresting officer testified that when he arrested the defendant, he was in the driver\u2019s seat of his truck. Although the truck was well into a parking lot of a twenty-four hour service station, the engine was running. The defendant testified that he arrived at the service station, went inside the attendant\u2019s building, and bought cigarettes. He and the attendant, with whom he was friendly, then went outside, got into the truck, and were there chatting for about forty-five minutes. The engine was not running. During this period, the defendant drank four or five cans of beer. In instructing the jury, the judge stated in critical part that there is \u201coperation\u201d of a vehicle \u201cwithin the meaning of the law, when . . . [the vehicle] is stopped in the ordinary course of its operation. . . .\u2019\u2019In the context of this case, we conclude that the instruction was misleading and, without clarification, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">I. <em>The Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We recite the evidence more fully. Shortly before 2:00 a.m. on June 11, 1984, Seekonk police officer George Casey drove into the parking lot of the station which he described as \u201cbigger than the average gas station.\u201d There were two vehicles in the lot, the attendant\u2019s car which was parked close to the building and the defendant\u2019s tow track, which was pulled up to and parallel with the car. The defendant sat behind the wheel, and the attendant was in the passenger\u2019s seat. Casey stated that the engine was running and that he had to tell the defendant to turn it off.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">In direct contradiction of Casey\u2019s testimony, the defendant related that, in the middle of the evening, he had consumed two beers while at home watching television. A little after 1:00 a.m. he drove to the gas station, pulled into the lot, turned off the engine, and went into the attendant\u2019s building to buy cigarettes. He began a conversation with the attendant, with whom he was friendly. A short time later, the two went outside and got into the defendant\u2019s track, where the defendant drank beer and they sat talking until Casey\u2019s arrival about forty-five minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>To strengthen his assertion that he had not left the engine running throughout this time, the defendant described the weather as hot and humid. This weather and time period would have caused the truck to overheat had the engine been idling while he and the attendant sat and talked. He added that, considering the cost of gas at that time (June, 1984), he would never have let the engine idle for forty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">II. <em>The Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In the present situation, there is no evidence which would warrant a reasonable inference that the defendant\u2019s ability to drive had been diminished before he arrived at the gas station. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>398 Mass. 63, 68 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Otmishi, </em>398 Mass. 69, 70-71 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 1008, 1010-1111 (1987). In those cases there was no reason to reach the issue of whether the defendant was operating the stopped vehicle because there was evidence that warranted a reasonable inference that the defendant had previously driven the vehicle while intoxicated. The evidence of this defendant\u2019s intoxication is limited to the time he spent at the gas station. Consequently, whether he drove while under the influence of intoxicating liquor depends upon whether his truck was \u201cin operation\u201d during the time period when he was stopped at the station.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The only instructions given by the trial judge relevant to that determination were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">\u201cThe expression \u2018operation of a motor vehicle\u2019 covers not only all the well known and easily recognized things drivers do as they travel on a street or highway, but also any act which would tend to set the car in motion. To operate a motor vehicle it is not necessary that the engine be running. The manipulation of any mechanical part of the vehicle, or use of any electrical agency, which, alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motor power of the vehicle is sufficient in law to constitute operation. Furthermore, a driver continues to operate his motor vehicle, within the meaning of the law, when it is stopped in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>the ordinary course of its operation, or even for some mechanical reason such as a stalled engine or lack of gasoline.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\u201cOperation\u201d has many meanings depending upon the context in which the term is used. See <em>Boardman\u2019s Case, </em>365 Mass. 185, 192 n.5 (1974), and cases therein collected. The instruction given in this case reflects three basic situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">The first is illustrated by the case of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Uski, </em>263 Mass. 22 (1928). In that case the defendant was convicted of operating his automobile while under the influence of liquor by a jury that was instructed that the defendant would be guilty of that offense if they found that he \u201cgot into his automobile which was standing in the street and manipulated the machinery of the motor for the purpose of putting the automobile into motion, the defendant being in the car and in a position to control its [movements], . . . whether the automobile moved or not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. The court stated that \u201c[a] person operates a motor vehicle within the meaning of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, when, in the vehicle, he intentionally does any act or makes use of any mechanical or electrical agency which alone or in sequence will set in motion the motive power of that vehicle.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">This portion of the instructions was properly given. If the jury accepted Officer Casey\u2019s testimony (that the engine was running) their verdict could be based upon the penultimate sentence of the instruction (\u201cthe manipulation of any mechanical part of the vehicle, or use of any electrical agency, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>alone or in sequence, will set in motion the mot[ive] power of the vehicle is sufficient in law to constitute operation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">A second situation encompassed by the model instruction is that in which a vehicle is caused to move without the power of its engine. Thus, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>254 Mass. 566 (1926), the defendant was held to have operated his motor vehicle when he \u201cmoved the gear shift from reverse into neutral, in consequence of which the car moved forward and down . . . [an] incline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">There is no suggestion that the defendant\u2019s truck was ever observed moving, with or without the engine running. It follows that the second sentence of the model instruction (\u201cTo operate a motor vehicle it is not necessary that the engine be running\u201d) was, at best, inapplicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The third situation grows out of cases such as <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>229 Mass. 19 (1918),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where the court stated: \u201cThe word \u2018operated\u2019 is not. . . limited to a state of motion produced by the mechanism of the car, but includes at least ordinary stops upon the highway, and such stops are to be regarded as fairly incidental to its operation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">If the jury believed the defendant\u2019s testimony that, when he arrived at the gas station, he shut the engine off and did not thereafter turn it on,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the phrase \u201cstopped in the ordinary course of its operation\u201d becomes crucial. The jury, however, were never instructed as to how that phrase was to be construed. \u201cIf a salient point of the case was not adequately covered and the attention of the judge was called to that fact at the close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>of the charge, the exceptions must be sustained. The test of the charge is the impression created by it as a whole, and much must be left to the discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benders, </em>361 Mass. 704, 707 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We are not saying that it was error to include the final sentence of the model instruction in the charge. We think to have omitted that sentence would have been unfair to the Commonwealth. However, it is the defendant\u2019s testimony which, if believed, makes the question whether the truck was \u201cstopped in the ordinary course of its operation\u201d a most \u201csalient point.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Had the jury been instructed fully on the point, the defendant\u2019s guilt or lack thereof would have turned on the question whether the stop at the station was \u201cfairly incidental to . . . [the] operation\u201d of the vehicle. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>229 Mass. at 22. If they believed the defendant\u2019s testimony, it was open for the jury to find that, after purchasing his cigarettes, the defendant remained to visit with the attendant for a period of such duration that at the time of his arrest the stop at the station was no longer incidental to his operation of the truck. On the instruction given, the jury could have concluded that, although the truck was stopped at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest, the stop was in the ordinary course of operation because at some point the defendant would have to leave the station. No matter how great that probability of departure, the when and the how of his leaving were matters of speculation. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>398 Mass. at 67-68 n.5, quoting from <em>State </em>v. <em>Pritchett, </em>53 Del. 583, 598-599 (Del. Super. Ct. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">No objection was taken to the instruction, but we conclude that the failure to instruct further and to explain the meaning of the phrase here at issue created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. In the first instance, it took from the jury any consideration of the defendant\u2019s legitimate theory of defense to the indictment. Moreover, the jury recognized the importance of the issue. After twenty-three minutes of deliberations, they asked the trial judge: \u201cWe, the jury, request clarification of the operation section of the Mass. law as it pertains to this case.\u201d Clarification was not given. Rather than instructing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>the jury along the lines of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>229 Mass. at 22, that there is no operation of a vehicle within the meaning of the statute when the stop is not incidental to the driving, the judge repeated his earlier charge, the model instruction, with its troublesome final sentence. It is for these reasons that we conclude that, in the circumstances, reversal of the conviction is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">III. <em>Other Bad Acts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">In addition to the results of the defendant\u2019s breathalyzer test (.25) and Casey\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s eyes, speech, and breath, there was evidence to show that, when arrested, the defendant threatened Casey\u2019s life, telling him that the next time he saw Casey directing traffic, he would run him over. The defendant objected to this testimony but was overruled. On cross-examination of Casey, the defendant elicited that Casey brought formal charges against the defendant for those threats and that the defendant pleaded guilty. Further, on cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor made fleeting reference to the facts that Casey had found a substance in the defendant\u2019s truck which the defendant tried to explain away to Casey as \u201cwhite powder.\u201d Defense counsel took no objection and on redirect stated: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get it out in the open.\u201d He then brought to the jury\u2019s attention the facts that, in addition to threatening a police officer, the defendant also had been charged with and pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine. There was a strategy: when guilty, the defendant was willing to say so. He now claims prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">As these questions could recur at any retrial, we consider them. As to the evidence of the defendant\u2019s threats against Casey\u2019s life, we repeat the rule that \u201cotherwise relevant evidence is not rendered inadmissible simply because it may indicate that the defendant has committed another offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>378 Mass. 116, 125 (1979). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Palmariello, </em>392 Mass. 126, 138-139 (1984). We think that a trial judge could conclude that the threats were relevant to the question of whether the defendant was intoxicated (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doyle, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 786, 796 [1981]) and that the probative value of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>was not substantially outweighed by its potential for prejudice. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 732 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lovell, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 177-178 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">We cannot predict what reference, if any, will be made to a \u201cwhite powder\u201d or to cocaine at any retrial. In the present instance, the matter arose in respect to the defendant\u2019s posture as a truthful man. The prosecutor was attempting to show that the defendant told Casey that the substance was \u201cwhite powder\u201d and that he knew that to be untruthful. The questions of relevance, probative value, and the potential for prejudice are best left for the trial judge to resolve on the basis of the state of the evidence at the time the issue arises, if it does. We will not say that the evidence would be inadmissible in all circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fleury-Ehrhart, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 429, 434 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aza\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Essentially, the instruction mirrors Model Jury Instructions for Criminal Offenses Tried in the District Court Department 3.06 (1981). In delivering the instructions, the judge in this case substituted the word \u201cmotor\u201d for the word \u201cmotive\u201d in the penultimate sentence of the model instructions. It should also be noted that the defendant, by written request, asked that the jury be instructed: \u201cThe expression \u2018operation of a motor vehicle\u2019 covers not only all the well known and easily recognized things drivers do as they set the car in motion. The manipulation of any mechanical part of the vehicle, or use of any electrical agency, which alone or in sequence, will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle is sufficient in law to constitute operation.\u201d As can be seen, the critical difference between the instruction given and the one requested is that the defendant\u2019s proposed instruction requested, in effect, that the final sentence in the model instruction be omitted by the trial judge in charging the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b635-9\"> See also <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Crowell, </em>273 Mass. 356, 358 (1930) (\u201cIt is settled law in this Commonwealth that a driver continues to operate a car on the highway during the time it is stopped in the ordinary course of its operation for soliciting trade or in calling for and delivering merchandise\u201d); <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>310 Mass. 1, 3 (1941) (\u201cThe usual operation of the vehicle as it proceeded along its designated route included the ordinary stops for the reception and discharge of passengers\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b635-10\"> Additionally, if the jury did not accept Casey\u2019s testimony, then there is no evidence on whether at the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest the keys were in the ignition or, even if there were such evidence, at what point the defendant put the keys in the ignition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
