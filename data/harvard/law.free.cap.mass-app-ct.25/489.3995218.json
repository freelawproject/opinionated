L. c. 41, \u00a7 81BB, is a sequel to <em>Independence Park, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Barnstable, ante </em>133 (1987) <em>(Independence Park I), </em>and, again, the developer claims protection under G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 127P. That statute, the developer asserts, precludes the board of health (board) from making a recommendation under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, which is more onerous than the board\u2019s regulations. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>to dismiss under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), and the developer brings this appeal. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">1. <em>Board of health \u201cGround Water Regulation.\u201d </em>The board\u2019s recommendation was that the developer connect all buildings to the public sewer. In order to determine the relation of that recommendation to the board\u2019s regulation, we turn to the \u201cGround Water Protection\u201d regulation, promulgated under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 31, which is set forth in full in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The regulation\u2019s stated purpose is to protect ground water; it also states that \u201chigh density housing can . . . cause serious deterioration of . . . groundwater by nitrate contamination,\u201d and that housing units should be on one-acre parcels in- order that the maximum recommended nitrate limit not be exceeded. After those introductory comments, the regulation provides that, in \u201czones of contribution to a public supply well\u201d (the subdivisions here involved are in such a zone), subdivisions \u201cwithin 3,000 feet\u201d of a municipal sewer line must connect all lots to the town sewer if any lot in the subdivision is less than one acre. In such zones all new multi-family and commercial buildings within 3,000 feet of a municipal sewer line must also connect to the public sewer. Outside such zones, new construction within 3,000 feet of a sewer line may be required to be connected to the town sewer if the board makes certain determinations. Variances to the regulation may be granted by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The complaint alleges that no lot within the subdivisions here involved is within 3,000 feet of a municipal sewer line. If the regulation is dispositive, this allegation, if true, would relieve the developer from a duty to connect. The regulation\u2019s tie-in requirement where lots or buildings are within 3,000 feet of a municipal sewer line in zones of contribution implies that where lots or buildings are not within 3,000 feet there is no such obligation. This inference is strengthened by the provision which permits the board in certain cases to order a tie-in outside zones of contribution for new construction, but here, too, only for construction which is within 3,000 feet of a town sewer line. No such discretion to order a tie-in is reserved for lots <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>not within 3,000 feet of a sewer line, whether within or without such zones of contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">This reading is the ordinary meaning of the regulation, whether looked at by laymen, see <em>Cochis </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Canton, </em>332 Mass. 721, 726 (1955) (board of health likely to be composed of laymen), or by lawyers. See <em>Glorioso </em>v. <em>Retirement Bd. of Wellesley, </em>401 Mass. 648, 650 (1988), and cases cited (\u201ca [regulatory] expression of one thing is an implied exclusion of other things omitted from the [regulation]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">2. <em>Relation of regulation promulgated under G.L. c. Ill, \u00a7 31, to recommendation under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, and effect of G.L. c. Ill, \u00a7 127P. </em>The board claims that the regulatory scheme and the recommendation procedure under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, are independent of one another and that, under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, a portion of which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the board is authorized to make \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d recommendations to \u201cadjudicate\u201d the health and safety of a particular project without regard to any regulation. The developer, according to the board, is not entitled to protection under G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 127P,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> from any such recommendations made by the board during this review process.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\u201cWhen a definitive plan of a subdivision is submitted to the planning board ... a copy thereof shall also be filed with the board of health .... Such health board . . . shall, within forty-five days after the plan is so filed, report to the planning board in writing, approval or disapproval of said plan, and, in the event of disapproval, shall make specific findings as to which, if any, areas shown on such plan cannot be used for building sites without injury to the public health, and include such specific findings and the reasons therefor in such report, and where possible, shall make recommendations for the adjustments thereof. Failure of such board ... to report shall be deemed approval by such board .... When the definitive plan shows that no public or community sewer is to be installed to serve any lot thereon, approval by a board of health . . . shall not be treated as, nor deemed to be approval of a permit for the construction and use on any lot of an individual sewage system . . ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Such evisceration of \u00a7 127P is not warranted. We stated in <em>Independence Park I, ante </em>at 134, that the purpose of \u00a7 127P is plain. \u201cThe statute is designed to give a developer who has filed a plan the benefit of regulations which were in effect at the time that plan was filed \u2018during the time such plan is being processed\u2019 \u201d (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">One of the critical concerns of a municipality in approving a subdivision plan is sewage disposal, a subject vested exclusively in the board of health. See <em>Fairbairn </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Barnstable, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 171, 176 (1977). While this concern was made more explicit in G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, prior to its 1978 amendment,* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the importance of sewage disposal as a matter for the board of health remains evident in the statute. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>See also G. L. c. 83, \u00a7 11, giving the board of health the power to require an abutter to a way in which there is a common sewer to tie in to such sewer. Sewage matters are also one of the primary concerns of the State environmental code. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. 15.00 (1986). Because of the importance of sewage disposal, and because that concern applies to almost all construction, the subject is an appropriate one for local and State regulation. If the board may ignore its sewage disposal regulations in its recommendations under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, the protection afforded by G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 127P, to developers of subdivisions against changes in the State environmental code or against changes in regulations of local boards of health becomes meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">A more harmonious reading of the two statutes, <em>see Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 585-586 (1981), and one which follows the general principle that an agency must follow its own regulations (see <em>Northbridge </em>v. <em>Natick, </em>394 Mass. 70, 76 [1985]; <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Cambridge, ante </em>47, 49-50 [1987]), is that, when a board regulation covers the subject at issue, the board\u2019s recommendation must be consistent with the regulation. In such cases, the board\u2019s function under G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, is to complement its regulation and fill any interstices which may appear in applying the regulation to a particular subdivision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>5J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>While the Legislature has not imposed the same requirements for boards of health as it has for planning boards, and the former, unlike the latter, are not under mandate to adopt regulations, there is no doubt that G. L. c. Ill, \u00a7 127P, was added by St. 1981, c. 750, \u00a7 1, because of the same legislative purpose as led to the passage of the strict requirements of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81Q. See <em>Pieper </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of South-borough, </em>340 Mass. 157, 163 (1959). The Legislature wanted \u201ca prospective subdivider [to] know in advance . . . what will be required of him\u201d in areas covered by the State environmental code or board of health regulations. See <em>id.; Castle Estates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Park &amp; Planning Bd. of Medfield, </em>344 Mass. 329, 334 (1962). See also the discussion in <em>Daley Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Randolph, </em>340 Mass. 149, 153-154 (1959), showing legislative concern with provisions which seem to authorize arbitrary action by \u201coverzealous city planners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The judgments of dismissal are reversed, and the matters are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this decision. If the plaintiff is entitled to judgment, summary or otherwise, the matter should be remanded to the board for new recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\n<em>GROUND WATER PROTECTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The Board of Health, Town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, in accordance with, and under the authority granted by Section 31, of Chapter 111, of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, hereby adopted the following rules and regulations after a public hearing at a meeting of the Board held on September 6, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>PURPOSE: The protection of ground water in the Town ofBarnstable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The ground resources of the Town of Barnstable are its sole source of water supply. It is now known and demonstrable that public supply wells draw water from a substantial land area. It is known from experience that high density housing can over time cause serious deterioration of ambient groundwater by nitrate contamination. It has been proven that nitrate contamination in drinking water can be a serious public health problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Calculations performed by Cape Cod Planning and Economic Development Commission indicate that housing units placed on one acre parcels will produce the maximum recommended planning limit of 5 ppm. nitrate-nitrogen in groundwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">Proposed subdivisions within 3,000 feet of a municipal sewer line shall connect all building lots in the subdivision to the Town sewer if any lots in the subdivision are less than one acre and are located within a zone of contribution to a public supply well. Zones of contribution will be determined by the Board of Health.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">All new multi-family dwellings within a zone of contribution to a public supply well within 3000 feet of a municipal sewer line shall connect to the public sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">All new commercial structures within a zone of contribution to a public supply well within 3000 feet of a municipal sewer line shall connect to public sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">Outside of the Zones of Contribution to Public Supply Wells, any new construction on lots of less than 1 acre that are within 3000 feet of a sewer line shall be considered for mandatory connection to said line if the Board of Health determines that onsite sewage disposal systems will contribute to the degradation of the water quality of private wells, lakes, ponds or coastal embay ments.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-14\">VARIANCES to the regulation may be granted by the Board of Health after a hearing during which the applicant proves that the installation of onsite sewage disposal systems will not have a significant adverse [e]ffect on surface or subsurface public or private water resources. The Board in granting variances will consider if strict interpretation of this regulation would do manifest injustice to the applicant; however, the applicant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>demonstrate that the same degree of environmental protection required by this regulation can be achieved by other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">This regulation is to take effect on the date of publication of this notice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b517-7\"> The first paragraph of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, as amended by St. 1978, c. 422, \u00a7 1, reads in part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> In relevant part, G. L. c. 111, \u00a7 127P, as inserted by St. 1981, c. 750, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">\u201cWhenever a person has submitted a subdivision plan, ... the land shown on such plan shall be governed by provisions of the state en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>vironmental code, or of the provisions of local board of health regulations which differ from said code, which are in effect at the time of first submission of said plan.

L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U, as amended by St. 1972, c. 749, \u00a7 1, contained the proviso \u201cif a municipal sewerage system will service the proposed subdivision, then failure of the board to make such a report within forty-five days after the plan is filed with their office shall be deemed approval by [the] board.\u201d Compare the present statute, see note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
