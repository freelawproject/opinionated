Convicted of lewd and lascivious behavior<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant claims he was entitled to a required finding of not guilty because, as matter of law, the complained-of conduct did not occur in a \u201cpublic place.\u201d He also claims that the judge\u2019s charge misled the jury as to what is meant by \u201cpublic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Although G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, does not use the term \u201cpublic\u201d, the court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 117 (1980) , for constitutional reasons, held that the statute must be construed to require that the conduct occur in public. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 537 (1978) ; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. 13, 15-16 (1981) .</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Before turning to the difficulties of defining \u201cpublic\u201d, we recite briefly the facts which could\" have been found by the jury. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979) . The defendant arrived at the house on July 11, 1986, at about noon. At home at the time were the customers (a married couple), their two children and two other young children. The husband, who had returned that morning from a tiring business trip, took the children outside to take them away from the wet pesticide. He and the defendant had previously discussed whether it would be safe to have the children in the house while the spraying was in progress. The defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>explained that it would take approximately twenty minutes for the pesticide to dry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u201cCommon night walkers, common street walkers, both male and female, common railers and brawlers, persons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex, lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior, idle and disorderly persons, disturbers of the peace, keepers of noisy and disorderly houses, and persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished by imprisonment in a jail or house of correction for not more than six months, or by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>After speaking to his wife, who c\u00e1me out of the house a little later and who was going to take the children to lunch, the husband went back inside. He looked for the defendant in the living room and then went to the second floor to his bedroom to take a nap. There he saw the defendant standing about eighteen inch\u00e9s from the window engaged in the conduct described earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">That the defendant was near the window is not sufficient evidence of public conduct. In this case there was no testimony that one could see through the window from the lawn below, nor was there testimony as to the height of the window' in relation to the lower part of the defendant\u2019s body. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. at 18. The only evidence as to what could be seen from outside the house came from the wife, who stated that she could not see into the window from the ground. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>296 Mass. 459, 460, 462 (1937) (defendant could be seen from neighboring building standing in middle of room naked and flashing a mirror); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>273 Mass. 229, 231 (1930) (public bathroom).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The question is, therefore, whether the defendant\u2019s conduct in the bedroom was \u201cpublic\u201d as defined by our cases. Acknowledging \u201cgreat difficulty in attempting to define specifically the conduct proscribed by the \u2018lewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u2019 provision,\u201d the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. at 115-116 and 117-118, adopted a definition which, insofar as relevant here, prohibits \u201cthe commission of conduct <em>in a public place, . . </em>. when the conduct committed . . . involves the touching of the genitals ... for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense, <em>by a person who knows or should know of the presence of a person or persons who may be offended by the conduct\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">This definition appears to require both: 1) that the conduct be in a public place; and 2) that it be by a person who knows or should know of the presence of another person or persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>who may be offended. Earlier, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 537 (1978), the court had held that \u00a7 53 was not applicable \u201cto private conduct between two people in the home in which they both lived.\u201d The <em>Templeman </em>decision limited the \u201c \u2018lewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u2019 provision ... to \u2018public\u2019 conduct in the same sense as the \u2018disorderly persons\u2019 provision.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>That definition is strict. With respect to a \u201cdisorderly person\u201d charge, the court has \u201cinsisted on a purpose to cause \u2018public\u2019 inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or on reckless creation of a risk thereof, and ha[s] defined \u2018public\u2019 to mean \u2018affecting or likely to affect persons in a place to which the public or a substantial group has access.\u2019\u201d Ibid., quoting from <em>Commmonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 585-586 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The customers\u2019 home, in the circumstances recounted, was not a place which meets the <em>Templeman </em>definition. It is not a place to which the \u201cpublic or a substantial group has access. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The term \u201cpublic\u201d has recently been construed in connection with G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35 (unnatural and lascivious acts).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. 13, 16 (1981). That case involved consensual activities by two adults in acari\u00f1a parking lot abutted by multi-storied buildings. In <em>Ferguson, </em>at 16, the court, citing Model Penal Code \u00a7 251.1 comment (Official Draft 1980), said, \u201cthe rationale of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35, is to prevent the open flouting of community standards regarding sexual matters.\u201d The opinion explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cA place may be public at some times and under some circumstances, and not public at others [citations omitted]. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>The essential query is whether the defendant intended public exposure or recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons .... The Commonwealth must prove . . . that the defendant acted upon an unreasonable expectation that his conduct would remain secret.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The significance of the citation to the comment to the Model Penal Code \u00a7 251.1 is that the Code\u2019s formulation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not focus on \u201cwhether the lewd act occurs in a \u2018public\u2019 place,\u201d but rather \u201crecasts this element of the offense in terms of the known likelihood of observation by persons who would be affronted or alarmed.\u201d Comment 2, at 452, continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cMany places that are public in a property sense may be extremely private in terms of the likelihood of casual observation. Since the rationale of this provision is to prevent the open flouting of societal conventions, it should not condemn as debauchers of public morality persons who desire privacy and who take reasonable measures to secure it. Thus, for example, \u2018petting\u2019 on a deserted beach should not be punished as a public nuisance. On the other hand, erotic behavior may be a source of affront and alarm even though it is done on private property. Indeed, even if the place in question is not only privately owned but also limited in access, a lewd act done with knowledge of a likelihood of affronting others there present should be covered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The <em>Ferguson </em>opinion clearly concurs with the Code that public places are not always public for purposes of such statutes. The opinion also suggests, by citations to the Code and to the older cases of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>128 Mass. 53, 53-54 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>(1880) (\u201copen\u201d intentional conduct in a home of another), <em>Commonwealth v. Cummings, </em>273 Mass. 229, 231-232 (1930) (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>296 Mass. 459 (1937), that, even if occurring on <em>private </em>property, intentional exposure or reckless disregard of a substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons is proscribed by G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35. In other words, <em>Ferguson </em>may be taken to modify the <em>Templeman </em>requirement (376 Mass. 537) that the place be one \u201cto which the public or a substantial group has access.\u201d Cf. also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 272 (1983) (G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, \u201copen and gross lewdness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We return to the facts to review, under the <em>Ferguson </em>standard, the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That the husband actually saw the defendant is insufficient. \u201cConduct is not established as public merely because another person actually observes the conduct.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. at 16. Here, however, the evidence disclosed that the defendant was aware that the husband and wife, as well as four children, were about the premises. There was also evidence that from the window the defendant had an unobstructed view of the lawn and driveway where the family members were gathered shortly before he was interrupted. Had he looked, he would have seen that the husband was no longer outside. On the other hand, both the husband and the defendant testified to the conversation concerning safety of the pesticide and the fact that the spray would remain wet for twenty minutes. In this close case, whether the defendant \u201crecklessly disregarded a substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons\u201d, <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. at 16, is a question \u201csusceptible to conflicting interpretations\u201d and, hence, is one \u201cwithin the peculiar province of the jury.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scagliotti, </em>373 Mass. 626, 629 (1977). Accordingly, it was not error to deny the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>This does not end our inquiry because there is a problem with the judge\u2019s charge. The <em>Ferguson </em>decision, as indicated earlier, states that the essential inquiry is whether the defendant was reckless \u201cin disregarding] a substantial risk of exposure\u201d. Because of the importance of the <em>Ferguson </em>language to the judge\u2019s charge, the paragraph of <em>Ferguson </em>discussing the open flouting of community standards is quoted in full in the margin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The trial judge, following some, but not all, the language in <em>Ferguson, </em>charged the jury on the meaning of \u201cpublic\u201d, both before the jury deliberated and later in response to a question from them in the course of their deliberations. In his initial charge, he required that the defendant\u2019s conduct be \u201cin some sense public.\u201d He defined \u201cpublic\u201d as a place \u201cwhere [the defendant had] no expectation of privacy\u201d and explained that the statute\u2019s purpose is \u201cto prevent the possibility\u201d that a person\u2019s conduct might give offense to persons present in a place where the defendant has no \u201cexpectation of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>After the jury had begun their deliberations, in response to a request to repeat the instruction on lewd and lascivious behavior, the judge once again informed the jury that, in order to convict the defendant, they had to find that he committed the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201c[i]n a place which is public in the sense that the defendant had no expectation or should have had no expectation of privacy or knew or should have known that he did not have any expectation of privacy or knew or should have known that . . . members of the public <em>might be . </em>. . <em>exposed </em>to this (inaudible) misconduct. You\u2019d have to find . . . that the act was committed in a place ... in which the defendant had no expectation of privacy.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Although the defendant did not object to the charge and first raises the point on appeal, we think it clear that the jury may have convicted the defendant by merely finding that he should have known that there was \u201ca possibility\u201d that his conduct \u201cmight give offense to persons present in a place where he had no expectation of privacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The judge never mentioned the requirement that, in order to convict, the jury must find that the defendant \u201crecklessly disregarded a substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> More important, the instruction, by discussing thepos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>sibility of giving offense, and by laying stress on the defendant\u2019s expectation of privacy rather than on the risk of exposure, or even on the expectation of secrecy, unfairly skewed the charge against the defendant. A common definition of privacy, contained in Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1804 (1971), is \u201cfreedom from unauthorized oversight or observation.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Even if the risk of exposure was insignificant, the defendant could hardly urge that he expected to be free of <em>unauthorized </em>observation in the home of his customer. Although the jury may have considered another definition, e.g., see note 11, <em>supra, </em>we do not know that this ordinary use of the word \u201cprivacy\u201d was not the one they had in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">In sum, taking the charge as a whole, we think that the criterion of possibility, rather than probability, when coupled with the repeated emphasis on privacy in the charge, may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>resulted in a serious risk of a miscarriage of justice and that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-11\"> The defendant was acquitted of a charge of larceny of property over one hundred dollars.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\"> General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 53, as appearing in St. 1983, c. 66, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-9\"> The court in <em>Templeman </em>indicated that the limitation was adopted because otherwise there would be \u201ca serious question whether the statute . . . could be applied to conduct that took place before the point was decided. \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b209-10\"> General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 35, is a statute which, like \u00a7 53, does not have any explicit statutory language requiring that the acts be \u201cpublic.\u201d We do not see any reason to treat G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, differently from c. 272, \u00a7 35, for purposes of defining \u201cpublic.\u201d Both are directed to open flouting of community standards. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. at 538 (as to c. 272, \u00a7 16), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. at 16 n.l.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b210-8\"> As indicated in note 10, <em>infra, </em>the court\u2019s use of both the terms \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d may cause some uncertainty as to the degree of culpability required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\"> Section 251.1 entitled \u201cOpen Lewdness\u201d provides: \u201cA person commits a petty misdemeanor if he does any lewd act which he knows is likely to be observed by others who would be affronted or alarmed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\"> In <em>Ferguson </em>four Justices considered that the Commonwealth had not produced sufficient evidence to show that conduct in an automobile in a certain parking lot, at night, in subzero temperature was \u201cpublic.\u201d Three Justices thought otherwise. <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. at 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\"> \u201cThe rationale of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 35, is to prevent the open flouting of community standards regarding sexual matters. See Model Penal Code \u00a7 251.1, comment (1980). The statutory object is to prevent the \u2018possibility that the defendant\u2019s conduct might give offense to persons present in a place frequented by members of the public for reasons of business, entertainment, or the like.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scagliotti, supra. </em>However, the statute is not designed to punish persons who desire privacy and who take reasonable measures to secure it. Model Penal Code, <em>supra. </em>A place may be public at some times and under some circumstances, and not public at others. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catlin, </em>1 Mass. 8 (1804), with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>296 Mass. 459 (1937). The essential query is whether the defendant intended public exposure or recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>273 Mass. 229, 231-232 (1930); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>128 Mass. 52, 53-54 (1880); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catlin, supra </em>at 8-9; Model Penal Code, <em>supra; </em>67 C.J.S. Obscenity \u00a7 11 (1978). Conduct is not established as public merely because another person actually observes the conduct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Catlin, supra. </em>The Commonwealth must prove that the likelihood of being observed by casual passersby must have been reasonably foreseeable to the defendant, or stated otherwise, that the defendant acted upon an unreasonable expectation that his conduct would remain secret.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. at 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> The entire discussion of \u201cpublic\u201d in the judge\u2019s initial charge, was as follows: \u201cAnd you have to find that such conduct was in some sense public. Now public in that sense means not private. A private place is one that aboards [sic] the defendant removal from the public or a place where the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>conduct is removed from the possibility that one\u2019s conduct would give offense to the public. The statutory object here is to prevent the possibility that one\u2019s conduct might give offense to persons present in a place where he has no expectations of privacy. The Commonwealth must prove that the likelihood of being observed must have been reasonably foreseeable to the defendant or stated otherwise that the defendant acted upon an unreasonable expectation that this conduct would remain secret. If you are to convict the defendant of this you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that each of these elements of the crime has been committed. That where was an un \u2014 that there was an intentional act, an intentional lewd or lascivious act and that that act took place somewhere which was public as I define that. Where he had no expectations of privacy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> The <em>Ferguson </em>opinion, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>while using the terms \u201cintentional\u201d and \u201creckless\u201d also uses language evoking concepts of negligence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>e.g., \u201creasonably foreseeable\u201d and \u201cunreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">The Model Penal Code\u2019s definition of a similar offense, see note 6, <em>supra, </em>requires that a defendant \u201cknow[ ]\u201d that his lewd act is likely to be observed.\u201d The comment, quoted above, <em>supra </em>at note 6, with its reference to \u201creasonable\u201d also suggests terminology applicable to negligence. It should be noted, however, that the Code establishes requirements \u201cconsiderably more rigorous than simple negligence as usually treated in the law of torts. See Wechsler, <em>Foreword, Symposium on the Model Penal Code, </em>Colum. L. Rev. 589, 592 (1963).\u201d Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02, comment 4 at 243, n.31 (Official Draft 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Because of the elasticity of the term \u201cpublic\u201d as used by the authorities, we recognize the difficulties which were faced by the trial judge in charging the jury in this case. Whatever the degree of culpability required, however, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jasmin, </em>396 Mass. 653, 657 (1986), we think the judicially imposed requirement that the crime be \u201cpublic\u201d for purposes of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, demands more that a \u201cpossibility\u201d of giving offense to persons present in a place where the defendant has no expectation of \u201cprivacy.\u201d Until the degree of culpability receives further clarification, judges, in the interest of caution, would be well advised to charge that the offense requires either that the defendant \u201cintended public exposure or recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of exposure to one or more persons.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>384 Mass. at 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\"> The first definition of privacy in Webster\u2019s is divided into two parts: (a) and (b).
