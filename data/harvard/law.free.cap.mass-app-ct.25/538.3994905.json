In preparation for trial, the defendant requested her videotape. The Commonwealth advised that it did not exist. Her numerous requests for an explanation of its loss were ignored until the morning of her trial, immediately before which there was an evidentiary hearing on her motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that the Commonwealth had lost exculpatory evidence. The motion was filed nine days prior to trial, along with defense counsel\u2019s affidavit describing how the Commonwealth had ignored his numerous demands for an explanation of how it had lost the videotape. Notwithstanding the facts set out in the affidavit and the ample time to make appropriate explanation, the Commonwealth\u2019s only answer was the prosecutor\u2019s hearsay testimony that the videotape was blank and that, therefore, the camera had \u201cmalfunctioned.\u201d The judge found that there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth and denied the motion. The judge also ruled, at trial, that the defendant could ask no questions concerning the existence of a videocamera at the police station and the loss of the videotape. The only evidence at trial was the conflicting testimony of the officers and the defendant. As seen from the verdicts, the jury believed the officers. We conclude that the defendant was denied a fair trial and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">I. <em>The Evidence at Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Raymond LaRoche testified that at about 11:50 p.m. on January 10, 1986, he was in his cruiser patrolling along Route 2 near the Route 111 intersection in Acton. He noticed that, as the defendant drove, she was \u201cswaying from the travel lane to the passing lane back and forth approximately four times\u201d without using her directional signals. She was driving at about twenty-five or thirty miles an hour in a zone which allowed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>a speed of forty-five miles an hour. LaRoche followed her for about a quarter of a mile. As they approached the Route 111 left exit ramp, the defendant drove from the right travel lane over to the exit. LaRoche \u201cimmediately activated\u201d his blue lights and siren. The defendant did not stop until some one to two hundred yards later \u201cin front of an apartment complex.\u201d She pulled into the complex parking lot \u201coff to the side of the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">When LaRoche asked the defendant for her license and registration, she \u201cfumbled through everything.\u201d It took her a \u201cwhile\u201d- to find her license, and she could not produce her registration. LaRoche asked her why she was having a problem \u201cnavigating\u201d her car and she replied that LaRoche should know, that she had been drinking again, as if LaRoche \u201cknew her or something.\u201d LaRoche had \u201cnever met her before.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">LaRoche had his flashlight on and could see the defendant very well. He \u201cnoticed her eyes to be very bloodshot and glassy . . . [a]nd her speech was heavily slurred.\u201d He asked her to get out of the car, and when she did so, LaRoche had to hold her up by her arm to \u201cget her away from the roadway to further check her, for the fear of her possibly falling into the traffic, whatever.\u201d As he talked with her he smelled a \u201cstrong odor of alcohol coming from her breath . . . [a]nd again, very unsteady on her feet.\u201d At that point, LaRoche concluded that she was \u201cheavily under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d and arrested her. He handcuffed her and walked her to the cruiser, \u201cholding her arm the whole time to make sure she didn\u2019t fall over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">On cross-examination, LaRoche was asked to draw a diagram on a blackboard tracing the route of the defendant\u2019s travel. Because the questions concerning the diagram were asked with little regard for a reader of the trial transcript, we cannot describe the diagram drawn by LaRoche. All that we know is that the defendant\u2019s travel route involved a rotary, \u201cNo U Turn\u201d and \u201cNo Left Turn\u201d signs, \u201clittle cement buckets\u201d with light reflectors used as barriers at various places, an overpass, and the exit ramp from Route 2 onto Route 111. The parking lot where the defendant pulled over was \u201c[m]aybe 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>yards or so, not too far\u201d from the Route 111 overpass of Route 2. Although the exit ramp was \u201cvery wide,\u201d there was no breakdown lane on the Route 2 exit ramp or the Route 111 overpass.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">LaRoche stated that, although he usually conducts a field sobriety test consisting of the suspect walking an imaginary straight line, he did not do so with the defendant. He did not feel it would be safe because the defendant \u201ccould have fallen into the road and got hit by the car.\u201d He agreed that he \u201ccould have\u201d gone to the parking lot on the other side of the vehicle. LaRoche could not remember what kind of shoes the defendant was wearing. When asked whether the defendant was \u201ccooperative\u201d with him, LaRoche answered \u201c[n]ot necessarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">James Cogan was the desk officer on duty when LaRoche arrived at the police station with the defendant. He was standing behind the \u201cbooking desk.\u201d Cogan did not see her walk into the station or over to the desk. However, as she stood at the counter, she was \u201csort of swaying back and forth.\u201d Her eyes were \u201cextremely glassy,\u201d \u201cwatery and bloodshot,\u201d and she had an \u201cextremely strong odor of alcohol on her breath.\u201d When Cogan asked her questions concerning her personal history, he frequently had to repeat the questions. The defendant \u201cwould just look at . . . [him] and not answer.\u201d It seemed to Cogan that the defendant \u201cwasn\u2019t paying attention at times, although she was looking right at . . . [him].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">On cross-examination, Cogan stated that there is a straight line on the floor of the booking area for purposes of a sobriety test. However, when he is the booking officer, he never gives sobriety tests. As he could not see the defendant\u2019s feet, he could not say whether she was wearing boots.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">According to the defendant, she went to the Marriott Hotel in Newton on the night in question to meet a former instructor and business associate who was arriving from California and was to stay at the hotel during his visit. They planned to meet for dinner at the hotel at about 7:00p.m., but when the defendant checked at the front desk, he had not yet arrived. She left a message at the desk that she would be in the cocktail lounge. At about 7:45 p.m. , she checked again. In the meantime, as she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>waited, she got into a conversation with two men in the lounge. When her friend had not arrived by 8:30 P.M., she decided that he had missed his flight. She arranged to have her dinner, which required a wait of an hour. Throughout this time and at dinner, which she had with the men she had met, the defendant had four wine spritzers (white wine with soda and ice). She had a cup of coffee after dinner and left the hotel at about 11:00 p.m. The defendant, who lived in Concord and worked in Maynard, had arranged to spend the night with her sister in Leominster because she had an 8:00 a.m. meeting in Worcester.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">Although the defendant knew her way to her sister\u2019s home from Route 2, her sister, knowing that it would be late, had given her directions for a quicker route with which the defendant was unfamiliar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As she drove, the defendant changed lanes twice, trying to make up her mind which would be quicker, the way she knew or the route her sister had described. She elected the way she knew, Route 111. She had crossed to the passing lane to take the left exit off Route 2 onto Route 111 when she realized she was being signalled to stop. Because she did not want to stop on the ramp and because there was no breakdown lane, she continued until she thought that it would be safe to pull over.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">When her license was not in her wallet, she searched through her purse and found it. The registration should have been in the glove compartment. She thought that the reason it wasn\u2019t there when she looked was because her three children use her car while at home from college during holiday and summer vacations.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Denying that she swayed or stumbled as she walked, the defendant stated that because there was snow and ice on the ground, she was wearing her boots, which were high-heeled. Although the walking was \u201cdifficult,\u201d she did not stumble. She denied that the four wine spritzers which she had consumed, as well as dinner and coffee, over the four-hour period at the hotel in any way influenced her ability to drive. She agreed that she did not give any signals on changing lanes, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>she stated happened only two and not four times and which she attributed to her indecision as to the route she would take.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">II. <em>The Lost Tape.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">We learn from the docket entries that the complaint was brought on January 13, that there was a pretrial conference on March 17, at which time trial was scheduled for May 21, that it was thereafter continued to June 13, and that the motion to dismiss and accompanying affidavit were filed on June 4. The following facts are taken from defense counsel\u2019s affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Because defense counsel knew it was standard procedure for the Acton police to videotape the booking process in arrests made for violations of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(a)(l), he asked for the videotape of the defendant\u2019s booking. The affidavit does not disclose the date of his request or to whom it was made. In any event, he was advised that the videotape could not be found. He relayed that fact to an assistant district attorney, whom we shall refer to as the first prosecutor. It was then mid-April, and the first prosecutor told defense counsel that he would look into the matter and get back to him with an explanation. On May 20, not having heard from the first prosecutor, defense counsel sought and obtained a continuance of the trial. His associate called the first prosecutor\u2019s office, leaving a message for him to call defense counsel. When the first prosecutor did not return the call, the associate called again the next day. On this call, the associate was informed that the first prosecutor was on vacation and that another specifically identified person, whom we shall refer to as the second prosecutor, would call him back and discuss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">After waiting a week to hear from the second prosecutor, the associate again called the prosecutor\u2019s office and was advised that another specifically identified prosecutor (the third) had been assigned to the case. The associate spoke with the third prosecutor, who advised him that she would call him the next day, May 29, with information concerning the videotape. When the third prosecutor did not call, calls were made to her, but they were not returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">On June 2, defense counsel spoke with the first prosecutor and asked him about the videotape. The first prosecutor advised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>defense counsel that he was no longer connected with the case. Defense counsel also spoke with the third prosecutor, who was either uninformed or forgetful of the trial date. When reminded of the videotape problem, the third prosecutor told defense counsel that she would get back to him. At this point, it seems almost needless to state that the third prosecutor never did \u201cget back\u201d to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">A fourth prosecutor represented the Commonwealth at the evidentiary hearing on the motion and trial. . He did not deny any of the allegations set out in defense counsel\u2019s affidavit. He called LaRoche to the stand, who recited the facts leading up to the defendant\u2019s arrival at the police station. Cogan was next, and he related that, when the defendant was brought to the counter, he turned on the overhead videocamera, pressed the \u201cplay/record\u201d button, recited the date,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and then asked the defendant questions concerning her personal history. When he finished with his questions, he stopped the videotape, ejected it from the machine, and placed it with the paperwork relating to the defendant\u2019s arrest. This packet (the papers and the tape) \u201cgoes to the prosecutor or whatever.\u201d There had been no indication of a malfunction in the videocamera when Cogan was the operator. He had \u201cno idea that there was any malfunction whatsoever.\u201d Cogan went on to add that he had been unaware of any problems with the machine \u201cuntil just at this time this morning when I came in and they said that to me, I had no idea that there was a tape problem at all.\u201d Cogan had not seen or heard about the videotape from the night of the defendant\u2019s arrest until the time of his appearance for her trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">At the conclusion of Cogan\u2019s testimony, the judge asked the prosecutor whether the videotape itself was available. The prosecutor \u201cimagine[d]\u201d that the tape was available but that \u201cit would be blank.\u201d The judge pressed the prosecutor as to whether he had made an attempt to \u201clocate\u201d the videotape. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>this point, defense counsel objected to any unsworn \u201ctestimony\u201d from the prosecutor. The prosecutor was then sworn as a witness and testified as follows: \u201cI spoke to the police prosecutor for the Town of Acton. He explained to me, I asked him about the tape which was made, or should have been made on January 10th. He stated to me that the camera was not working on that night and that the tape procedure \u2014 that the procedure was not actually videotaped. He had looked at the tape. There was nothing on it. And that was the extent of the \u2014 I never asked to see the videotape myself, and I do not have it here today.\u201d Defense counsel moved to strike the prosecutor\u2019s testimony on hearsay grounds. The judge responded to the motion by asking the prosecutor whether he had any further evidence to present on the motion to dismiss. As he did not, defense counsel called the defendant to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">When Cogan advised the defendant that a videotape was being made, she told him that she did not have an attorney, that she did not know whether her \u201crights were being violated,\u201d and that she did not know if it was \u201clegal\u201d for him to make a videotape of her. Cogan told her that it was standard procedure. The defendant stated that Cogan gave her no indication that there was anything wrong with the camera while she was being videotaped.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In denying the motion to dismiss, the judge did not employ the balancing test set out in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>439 F.2d 642, 653 (D.C. Cir. 1971), and adopted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>397 Mass. 1, 14 (1986). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arra, </em>630 F.2d 836, 848-849 (1st Cir. 1980). Instead, he found no evidence of destruction, concealment; or bad faith by the Commonwealth in its failure to produce the videotape. Further, notwithstanding the undisputed events described by defense counsel in his affidavit, the judge suggested that it was the defendant\u2019s burden to do more when he also found that the defendant had failed to subpoena the videotape or summons those persons in control of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">HI. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">\u201c[W]e have repeatedly stressed the need for <em>prosecutors and police </em>to do their utmost to <em>preserve and present </em>\u2018exculpatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>evidence which is available to the prosecution\u2019 (emphasis supplied).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass. 749, 754 (1988), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>397 Mass. at 13-14, which quoted from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Redding, </em>382 Mass. 154, 157 (1980), and cited <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass. 301, 307-310 (1984). Notwithstanding these admonitions, the Commonwealth\u2019s conduct in the present case can be described as anything from sloppy to cavalier. Its argument on appeal is that the defendant has no cause to complain because the missing or unavailable videotape cannot be deemed to be either lost or exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">First, the Commonwealth relies upon the prosecutor\u2019s hearsay testimony, given over the defendant\u2019s objection, to put forth the following reasoning: because the police prosecutor told the trial prosecutor (in what appears to have been an eleventh hour telephone conversation) that the videotape of the defendant\u2019s booking was blank and that, therefore, the vid-eocamera malfunctioned, the tape is nonexistent rather than lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Even were the trial prosecutor\u2019s hearsay testimony admissible,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the police prosecutor\u2019s explanation is no more than an assumption, that is, because the videotape is blank the camera had to have been malfunctioning. However, not even Cogan could state with specificity what happened to the videotape once it left his control. There is nothing in the police prosecutor\u2019s statement to show that he was familiar with or had examined the camera. The operator of the camera, Cogan, stated that he never had any indication of a malfunction in the machine. More important, it appears that the tape does in fact exist. What the Commonwealth refuses to come to grips with is the simple fact that the defendant will not and need not accept without question the hearsay statement that the videotape is blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Equally flawed is the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s claim that the videotape would exculpate her is no more than an \u201cunsubstantiated allegation\u201d contradicted by the evidence presented at trial. To be sure, the defendant admitted that she had been drinking. The question for the jury, however, was not whether she had been drinking but whether her drinking had diminished her ability to drive safely. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 173 (1985). Any conclusion on this record that the videotape has no exculpatory potential could rest only on an arbitrary preference for the officers\u2019 testimony over that of the defendant. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>397 Mass. at 13-14 (the defendant\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth had lost an exculpatory tape recording of a conversation [of which he had no personal knowledge] between one of his three victims and a deceased detective was rejected as \u201cconjecture and surmise, contradicted by evidence in the record,\u201d that is, the testimony of all three victims, as well as other witnesses, as to the defendant\u2019s guilt). In the present case, the record shows no more than a direct conflict in the testimony of the witnesses having personal knowledge of the facts in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The Commonwealth asks that because the defendant refused to take a breathalyzer, we infer that the videotape would not have been exculpatory. But see G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24(l)(e), as appearing in St. 1980, c. 383 (evidence of refusal to submit to testing is inadmissible in a criminal \u201cproceeding\u201d [emphasis supplied]). Any force in such an inference would be minimized, however, by the considerations that her refusal should have prompted even greater care with the videotape and that she requested it from the outset and without the slightest hint or suggestion of knowledge on her part that the videocamera had \u201cmalfunctioned\u201d or that the videotape could not be produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">We conclude on the record before us that the defendant sufficiently demonstrated that the lost or destroyed evidence was potentially exculpatory and that the culpability of the Commonwealth, the materiality of the evidence, and the potential prejudice to the defendant must now be weighed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>397 Mass. at 14; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Willie, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>400 Mass. 427, 432-433 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass. at 754-755; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 544, 547-548 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Had the Commonwealth made appropriate response from the outset to defense counsel\u2019s inquiries and requests, it might have been able to show that the videocamera had malfunctioned and that the videotape of the defendant\u2019s booking is, through no one\u2019s fault, blank. Instead, the Commonwealth chose to do nothing. There is no competent evidence to show the condition of the machine on January 10, 1986, the steps taken (if any) to preserve the evidence, or the condition of the videotape at the time of trial. On the other hand, there are unchallenged factual allegations by defense counsel in his affidavit which demonstrate a strong disinclination by the Commonwealth to provide either the videotape or an explanation for its inability to do so. If there is no evidence of bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth as the judge so found, there is nonetheless ample evidence of the Commonwealth\u2019s culpability by reason of negligence or inadvertence. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass, at 757 n.7; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 547-548.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\u201c [Videotapes are \u2018on balance, a reliable evidentiary resource.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>397 Mass. 351, 359 (1986). Consequently, videotapes should be admissible as evidence if they are relevant, they provide a fair representation of that which they purport to depict, and they are not otherwise barred by an exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahoney, </em>400 Mass. 524, 527 (1987). A videotape can be evidence of sobriety as well as inebriation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>397 Mass, at 357-359. The videotape might also have assisted the defendant in showing whether the officers exaggerated in their descriptions of her appearance and demeanor, thereby calling their credibility into question. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shipps, </em>399 Mass. 820, 826-827 (1987). See generally Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases \u00a7 9.02 (3d ed. 1986). In view of the evidence presented at trial, set out in detail in part I of this opinion, we conclude that the videotape would have been material to the defendant\u2019s case and that its loss was substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>prejudicial to her. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Charles, </em>397 Mass, at 14; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. at 548-549; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gabbidon, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 535-536 (1984), <em>S.C., </em>398 Mass. 1 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 516 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">All that remains to be considered is the proper remedial action to be taken. We do not think that the circumstances warrant a dismissal of the complaint. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lam Hue To, </em>391 Mass, at 313-314 (1984). It was error to refuse to allow the defendant to question about and comment upon the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to produce the videotape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 485-486 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richenburg, </em>401 Mass. 663, 669 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olszewski, </em>401 Mass, at 758. As she had that right at her first trial, it follows that she has that right at any retrial. Because of the Commonwealth\u2019s refusal to provide the defendant with a timely explanation for the loss of the videotape, the defendant could not have tested the assertion that the videocamera malfunctioned even had it been offered through competent testimony. Any explanation that could be offered now concerning a malfunctioning of the videocamera would be, at best, mere speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that at any retrial of the defendant she is free to question and comment about the fact that she was videotaped but the Commonwealth does not now have that evidence. Any evidence that the defendant\u2019s videotape is blank or that there was a malfunctioning of or defect in the videocamera must be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed. Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> As the defendant\u2019s conviction on the latter charge was placed on file without objection by her, the appeal therefrom is not properly before us. Were it here, we would affirm on the basis of her testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b568-8\"> \u201c [T]ake Route 2 to 190 to Route 12.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b570-7\"> We think it reasonable to infer from this act that the videocamera had audio recording capability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b570-8\"> It is apparent from Cogan \u2019 s testimony that not one of the four prosecutors assigned to this case ever made an inquiry of Cogan about the videocamera or the videotape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> Because defense counsel\u2019s objection should have been sustained on hearsay grounds, we do not consider the alternative ground for the objection, that it was inappropriate for the prosecutor to assume the role of a witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
