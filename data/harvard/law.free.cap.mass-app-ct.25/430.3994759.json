Liability was imposed because the commission found that Alan\u2019s unincorporated company, Advanced Advertising (Advanced), is the alter ego of Arthur\u2019s former company, Adrian Advertising (Adrian). Alan claims that the findings of the commission do not support this conclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm the order of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Alan does not challenge the findings that his father engaged in unfair labor practices or that his father entered into binding collective bargaining agreements. Nor does he argue that the commission\u2019s subsidiary findings are not supported by substantial evidence. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2 The question before us is whether the subsidiary facts found by the commission, including the factual inferences drawn therefrom, support its ultimate finding that an alter ego relationship exists. See <em>Medi-Cab of Mass. Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>401 Mass. 357, 369 (1987) (reviewing court not empowered to draw different inferences from the facts found by the agency). See also <em>Southport Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>315 U.S. 100, 106 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Before turning to the facts found by the commission, we consider briefly the alter ego doctrine and the criteria for its application. The doctrine is one of several, not always neatly separable, principles developed by the NLRB to prevent employers from evading labor obligations<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by changing the form of their business operations. When what appears to be a new company is, in reality, a \u201cdisguised continuance\u201d of the old employer, <em>Southport Petroleum Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>315 U.S. at 106, it is \u201cappropriate to treat two nominally separate business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>entities as if they were a single continuous employer.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Allcoast Transfer, Inc., </em>780 F.2d 576, 579 (6th Cir. 1986), quoting from <em>Alkire </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>716 F.2d 1014, 1018 (4th Cir. 1983). <em>Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 v. Pratt-Farnsworth, Inc., </em>690 F.2d 489, 507 (5th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 932 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Criteria have been developed by the NLRB to determine whether an entity is an alter ego of another business. These are listed in <em>Crawford Door Sales Co., </em>226 N.L.R.B. 1144, 1144 (1976), and seem widely accepted. Alter ego status is usually found where there is a substantial identity of \u201cmanagement, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers, supervision and ownership.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Allcoast Transfer, Inc., 780 </em>F.2d at 579. <em>NLRB v. Al Bryant, Inc., </em>711 F.2d 543, 553-554 (3d Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1039 (1984). <em>Fugazy Continental Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>725 F.2d 1416, 1419 (D.C. Cir. 1984). <em>Goodman Piping Prod., Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>741 F.2d 10, 12 (2d Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Factors additional to those listed in <em>Crawford, </em>226 N.L.R.B. at 1144, have also been held significant and sometimes even crucial. The Federal courts are not wholly in agreement on these criteria, and we have not found or been referred to any Massachusetts appellate court decisions discussing the alter ego principles applied by the N.L.R.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Alan would have us deem critical an \u201c[ujnlawful motive or intent\u201d by the employer as discussed in the First and Eighth Circuits. See <em>Penntech Papers, Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>706 F.2d 18, 24 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 892 (1983), and <em>Crest Tankers, Inc. </em>v. <em>National Maritime Union, </em>796 F.2d 234, 237 (8th Cir. 1986) (\u201ca critical part of the inquiry into alter ego status ... is whether the employers acted out of anti-union sentiment or to avoid a labor contract\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Neither the NLRB, see <em>Crawford Door Sales, </em>226 N.L.R.B. at 1144, nor the Supreme Court has insisted on an unlawful intent. <em>See, Howard Johnson Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit Local Joint Executive Bd., </em>417 U.S. 249, 259 n.5 (1974). Other circuits have explicitly rejected unlawful motive as a strict prerequisite. <em>Goodman Piping Prod., Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>741 F.2d at 12 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Cir.). <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Allcoast Transfer, Inc., </em>780 F.2d at 581 (6th Cir.).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The commission urges us not to impose a rigid requirement. Although we have no doubt that an employer who \u201cmakes changes in its business operation [deliberately to] get rid of the union ... is more likely to be an alter ego,\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Tricor Prod., Inc., </em>636 F.2d 266, 270 (10th Cir. 1980), on the evidence in this case, we need not decide whether or to what extent proof of anti-union bias or evasive intent is an essential factor. Implicit in the commission\u2019s decision is a finding of anti-union animus on the part of both Alan and Arthur.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The National Labor Relations Board\u2019s broad jurisdiction removes from the commission\u2019s supervision most employers significantly engaged in interstate commerce. The commission, nevertheless, exercises supervision over some employers and union groups significantly larger than those involved in the present case. Neither the commission nor this court can now anticipate whether anti-union intent or some other additional factor must be taken into account in circumstances which may exist in different and perhaps more substantial controversies in which \u201calter ego\u201d principles may be invoked. We leave for development by the commission, subject to judicial review, on a case by case basis, the factors of employer behavior which are appropriate to further the policies of G. L. c. 150A. See <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Al Bryant, Inc., </em>711 F.2d at 552; <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 721, 728 (1987). Cf. <em>Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 </em>v. <em>PrattFarnsworth, Inc., </em>690 F.2d at 511. But see <em>J.M. Tanaka Constr., Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>675 F.2d 1029, 1033 (9th Cir. 1982) (no one factor controlling); <em>Goodman Piping Prod., Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>741 F.2d at 11 (analysis should be \u201cflexible\u201d); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Allcoast Transfer, Inc., </em>780 F.2d at 581-582 (total circumstances of each case should be examined).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Turning to the relevant facts found by the commission, we find no error in its conclusion that Alan\u2019s enterprise was the alter ego of Arthur\u2019s. Arthur purchased Adrian Advertising, a print shop, in April, 1981. Its prior owner had had a collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>bargaining agreement with Local 391, International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades (union), covering David Richard (Richard), Adrian\u2019s sole employee at the time of sale. This affiliation with the union enabled Arthur\u2019s predecessor to obtain a union label agreement, a necessity for acquiring and keeping a politician-clientele. After his purchase, Arthur and the union entered into a new union label agreement and a \u201csuccessorship\u201d agreement which bound Arthur to honor the terms of the collective bargaining agreement signed by his predecessor. When Arthur began to operate Adrian, he had two employees: Richard, who had formerly been employed by Adrian; and Arthur\u2019s niece, Donna Souza (Souza), who worked on a part-time basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Approximately three months after acquiring Adrian, Arthur moved the print shop to a building Arthur owned and in which Alan operated another print shop, New Bedford Signcrafters, Inc. (Signcrafters). Signcrafters had originally been founded by Arthur in 1971. He transferred his stock to Alan in 1976 for one dollar, under a written agreement which provided that Arthur could continue to use Signcrafters\u2019 equipment and that such equipment would not be sold without his permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">After the move, Alan gave Richard work assignments for both Signcrafters and Adrian, and Richard used Signcrafters\u2019 equipment for Adrian\u2019s customers. Alan\u2019s wife, Carol, answered the telephones of both shops and did their bookkeeping without being compensated by Arthur.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Because of poor business, Alan closed out Signcrafters in late 1982 and went to work for Adrian.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At Adrian, he assumed a managerial role. He supervised Richard, assigned him work, ordered materials, and dealt with union problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Matters with the union became tense in 1983. Adrian failed to give Richard benefits to which he was entitled under the collective bargaining agreement and also failed to require Souza to become a union member. During this period, Alan conducted most of the discussions with the union. He learned in June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>that his father wished to retire. In June, the union wrote Arthur and Alan revoking Adrian\u2019s right to use the union label.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">On July 6,1983, the union filed unfair labor practice charges against Adrian with the NLRB.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The union sent Alan and Arthur another letter in August, 1983, threatening to bring criminal charges against Adrian for persisting in using the union label without authorization. Another letter from the union demanded that Souza\u2019s employment be terminated for failure to pay union dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On September 13, 1983, Alan and the union\u2019s business manager agreed to revisions of the collective bargaining agreement. This was done, as Alan explained to the union representative, because Arthur was leaving the business and Alan was to be the sole owner of the company. The business manager sent Alan a letter dated September 13, setting forth the agreed terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">At about that time, the union filed a second unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB and filed criminal charges in the New Bedford District Court, alleging fraudulent use of the label by Adrian.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Alan, enraged, told the union business manager on September 19, \u201cYou blew it. There\u2019s not going to be a union here. You blew it by filing that thing in court and at the Labor Board, and I\u2019ll see you in court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">On October 6, 1983, Arthur called a meeting of Alan, Richard, and Souza, and announced that he \u201chad had it,\u201d that he was quitting, and was giving up the business. He fired Richard and Souza. Alan immediately told Richard and Souza that he was taking over and asked both of them to stay. They agreed to do so. Richard returned to the same project he had been working on before the meeting and continued doing the same work the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>The next workday, Alan and Arthur arrived in court with counsel for a hearing on the union\u2019s criminal charges and saw Richard was there on behalf of the union.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When Richard returned to work,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Alan, upset, called Richard an obscene name, and told him, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy for going down there .... You\u2019re fired. Get out.\u201d The union by letter informed Arthur and Alan that Richard\u2019s firing was motivated by his union activity and hence violated the collective bargaining agreement and Federal labor laws. The union sought a meeting and also information relevant to other contract violations. Alan and Arthur failed to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">During October, Alan began using the name Advanced Advertising but continued to fill Adrian\u2019s backlog of orders and also continued to use its equipment and to use invoices imprinted with Adrian\u2019s name. Carol did the bookkeeping, and Arthur painted signs on an \u201cas needed basis.\u201d When new invoices in the name of Advanced were printed in November, they bore a logo similar to Adrian\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Alan attempted to retain Adrian\u2019s political clientele by obtaining a label from another union. Permission was revoked early in 1984 when the second union learned of Adrian\u2019s labor difficulties with Local 391 and few politicians remained customers of Advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Charges of unfair labor practices were filed by the union with the commission in December, 1983. A complaint issued, and, after hearings, the commission reached the decision now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The commission\u2019s findings, cast in terms of the factors listed in <em>Crawford Door Sales, </em>226 N.L.R.B. at 1144, discussed earlier \u2014 substantial identity of management, business purpose, operation, equipment, customers, supervision and ownership \u2014 establish that Alan gradually assumed responsibility for Adrian\u2019s management, particularly its labor relations; see <em>J.M. Tanaka Constr., Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>675 F.2d at 1034; that the business purpose of Advanced was the same as Adrian\u2019s; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>that both were print shops; that both operated in the same location with much the same equipment; that Advanced filled Adrian\u2019s backlog of customer orders; that the loss of political customers and the resulting difference in customer identity was caused by Adrian\u2019s wrongful use of the union label; see <em>Charles T. Reynolds, Sr., </em>139 N.L.R.B. 519, 524 (1962); that Alan had supervisory duties and had set the work assignments at both Adrian and Advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Those findings provide strong support for the commission\u2019s conclusion that Advanced is the alter ego \u201cor disguised continuation of Adrian Advertising.\u201d The commission was warranted in not finding the evidence concerning Advanced\u2019s ownership conclusive in Alan\u2019s favor.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See <em>Crawford Door Sales Co., </em>226 N.L.R.B. at 1144, where lack of identity of ownership did not preclude a determination of alter ego status, particularly since ownership remained in the family. See also <em>J.M. Tanaka Constr., Inc. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>675 F.2d at 1034-35; <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Campbell-Harris Elec., Inc., </em>719 F.2d 292, 296 (8th Cir. 1983); <em>Fugazy Continental Corp. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>725 F.2d at 1420, cases holding that lack of identical ownership does not, in itself, prevent alter ego status. Contrary to Alan\u2019s contention, the cases he cites do not provide a small business exception.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Cf. G. L. 150A, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The commission held Arthur and Alan jointly and severally liable under the collective bargaining agreements and ordered them to remedy several unfair labor practices. Alan claims that he cannot be legally held to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement he never signed, even if he is found to be an alter ego employer. Alan confuses the remedies available against an entity found to be a successor with those available against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>one having alter ego status. A successor with knowledge of its predecessor\u2019s unfair labor practices may be held liable for such practices, but it may not, without more, be held bound by the terms of its predecessor\u2019s collective bargaining agreements. <em>Golden State Bottling Co. </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>414 U.S. 168, 184-187 (1973). In contrast, an entity properly deemed to have alter ego status may be held responsible for both the unfair labor practices and the collective bargaining agreements of its predecessor. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Tricor Prod., Inc., </em>636F.2d at269-270. <em>Carpenters Local Union No. 1846 </em>v. <em>Pratt-Farnsworth, Inc., </em>690 F.2d at 507. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Campbell-Harris Elec., Inc., </em>719 F.2d at 295. <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Amateyus, Ltd., </em>817 F.2d 996, 998 (2d Cir. 1987). See <em>Howard Johnson Co. </em>v. <em>Detroit Local Joint Executive Bd., </em>417 U.S. at 259 n.5. Moreover, Alan, to a large extent, is being held liable for actions which were solely his. He was the one who repudiated the agreement he had negotiated with the union in preparation for his taking over the business, and he was the one who fired Richard after the takeover.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">In sum, we conclude that the ultimate finding of alter ego status and the imposition of joint and several liability on Alan were warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\n<em>Order of the Labor Relations Commission affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-15\"> Alan also argues that Advanced is not a \u201csuccessor\u201d to Adrian. We need not discuss this issue since, contrary to Alan\u2019s assertion that the commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>did not rule which of two labor law doctrines, \u201csuccessor\u201d or \u201calter ego,\u201d here applies, the commission, in the concluding part of its decision, ruled squarely that Advanced was the alter ego of Adrian. In a footnote, the commission explained that even if the record supported a conclusion that the two businesses were separate entities, the \u201csuccessor\u201d principle would make Alan liable for certain unfair labor practices of his father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\"> Although the titles in his brief suggest otherwise, counsel acknowledged at oral argument that he was not making a G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e), claim. Since the record of the entire proceedings is not before us, we, in any event, would be unable to decide whether there was substantial evidence to support the decision. Had Alan wanted to make a G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7)(e), claim, he could have designated the record of the entire proceedings. See G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(4), and <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, </em>382 Mass. 580, 590 (1981). Cf. <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 562, 565 (1985), <em>S.C., </em>397 Mass. 498 (1986) (disagreeing with another point).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\"> The policies of the Federal Act and of G. L. c. 150A have been said to be the same, <em>R.H. White Co. </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>310 Mass. 510, 515 (1942), and Federal labor precedents are routinely cited by both appellate courts in Massachusetts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b460-9\"> Alan was a member of the union from February 7,1983, to June ,1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\"> The charges were filed shortly after a dispute between Richard and Carol during which Richard said, \u201cI quit.\u201d Adrian reinstated Richard without full back pay in early August after the union withdrew its charges from the NLRB.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b461-10\"> The commission made no finding whether either of the charges was filed prior to the September 13th meeting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b462-9\"> No hearing was held although there was some discussion in chambers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The sign on the building still read \u201cAdrian Advertising.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b463-7\"> In addition to the legal conclusion that ownership alone is not determinative of the alter ego question, there was evidence before the commission that after Alan took over the business, the older generation continued to receive benefits. In October, 1983, Advanced began making payments of $175.00 per week to Arthur\u2019s wife (Alan\u2019.s mother). The nature of these payments was not made clear, although Alan claimed they were rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b463-8\"><em> Universal Elec.
