(Wayside), had held a license for the sale of all alcoholic beverages not to be drunk on the premises (G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15, as most recently amended by St. 1981, c. 351, \u00a7 68) in a building located on land owned or controlled by Wayside\u2019s principals which was located on the Boston Post Road in Sudbury. In that month the building and the portion of the premises containing the building were sold to a stranger to these proceedings who thereafter conducted an auto parts business on what he had purchased. By reason of the eleventh paragraph of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 23, as appearing in St. 1935, c. 440, \u00a7 23, Wayside\u2019s license was due to expire on December 31, 1983. On November 14, 1983, Wayside made application to the selectmen as the \u201clocal licensing authorities\u201d (G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 371, \u00a7 2) for renewal of its license for the year 1984. The sworn application represented on its face that the renewed license would be exercised at the location which had been sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">1. The selectmen, who knew better and that the license had not been transferred to another location (G. L. c. 138, \u00a7\u00a7 15A and 23), properly concluded (a) that the application did not and could not \u201ccover[] the same licensed premises\u201d within the meaning of the first sentence of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 16A, as appearing in St. 1970, c. 352, and (b) that the second sentence of \u00a7 16A, as so appearing, required that the application be \u201ctreated as [one] for a new [<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] license [in accordance with] all the procedures set forth under\u201d G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15A.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">2. The selectmen denied the application on December 23, 1983. They were correct in doing so because the premises described in the license, which was about to expire, had been sold and Wayside had not secured other premises to which the license could be transferred. The fourth sentence of G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1935, c. 440, \u00a7 12, which applies to original applications for all types of license, is explicit that \u201c[e]ach license shall describe the premises to which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>applies.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The corollary of this imperative is that local licensing authorities cannot issue any type of license to an original applicant unless he owns or controls the premises to which the license will apply. <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>201 Mass. 204, 207-209 (1909). <em>New City Hotel Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>347 Mass. 539, 542 (1964). <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>349 Mass. 794, 798 (1965). Compare <em>Bushway-Whiting Ice Cream Co. </em>v. <em>Mayor of Somerville, </em>308 Mass. 148,152(1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">3. There is no need to recite the history of the extensive administrative proceedings on Wayside\u2019s application which were subsequently had before the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (commission) and the selectmen and which culminated in the commission\u2019s order of August 12, 1985, that the selectmen \u201creinstate the . . . license ... to be valid for a period of ninety days\u201d so as to afford Wayside a reasonable length of time to sell \u201cthe license\u201d and its assets. The Superior Court judge, in proceedings brought by the selectmen under G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14, appears to have overlooked the fact that there is nothing in G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 67, as most recently amended by St. 1971, c. 477, \u00a7 4, which authorizes the commission to issue or order the issuance of a license which, for the reasons set out in part 2 hereof, the licensing authorities could not have issued in the first instance. Quite to the contrary, \u00a7 67 provides that the commission cannot override a decision of the local authorities to deny an application for an original license or an application to transfer an existing license to another location.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Scituate, </em>334 Mass. 1, 3 (1956). <em>Largess </em>v. <em>Nore\u2019s, Inc., </em>341 Mass. 438, 441-442 (1960). <em>Selectmen of Barnstable </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>373 Mass. 708, 714-715 (1977).

L. c. 138, \u00a7 77, have already given Wayside an additional period of more than five months (from mid-July, 1983, until the end of December) in which to do something constructive about transferring the license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b499-8\"> G.
