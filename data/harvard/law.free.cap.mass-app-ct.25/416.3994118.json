One Stout was later identified as the reporter and joined as a party defendant, but the action was then dismissed as to him by agreement. As the plaintiff\u2019s brief on appeal nowhere complains of so much of the judgment as disposes of the action as to Lamothe (who is not shown to have been responsible for the publication of the article in question), we treat the Lowell Sun as if it had been the only defendant named in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Grant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"age-dedup-0\">The plaintiff has appealed from a summary judgment entered in the Superior Court which dismissed this action for libel brought by reason of the defendant\u2019s publication on February 5, 1983, of the newspaper article bearing the headline \u201cOfficer assaulted; two men charged\u201d which has been reproduced in the appendix to this opinion. The judge who heard the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment concluded that the article was defamatory of the plaintiff but allowed the motion because (in his view) the evidence appearing in the affidavits and discovery documents on which the motion was submitted was insufficient to warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant, as required by <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 858 (1975), when (as here) the plaintiff is a private person. We affirm, but for a different reason.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The only basis for the action, as stated in the complaint, is that the article defamed the plaintiff by falsely charging him with having committed a crime (see <em>McAvoy </em>v. <em>Shufrin, </em>401 Mass. 593, 597-598 [1988]) when it said that the plaintiff had been arrested \u201cafter assaulting a police officer when he arrived on the scene.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The threshold question, which is one of law, is whether the average reader (see <em>Pritsker </em>v. <em>Brudnoy, </em>389 Mass. 776, 782-783 [1983]), taking the quoted statement in context, could properly conclude that it accused the plaintiff of having assaulted a police officer as opposed to simply reporting the undisputed fact that the plaintiff had been arrested on a charge of assaulting an officer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>279 Mass. 176, 188 (1932); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>400 Mass. 786, 791-792, 795 (1987). We are of opinion that that question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The headline of the article (\u201cOfficer assaulted; two men charged\u201d), taken by itself, is not defamatory of the plaintiff because it does not identify him. <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Venture Magazine, Inc., </em>574 F. Supp. 1563, 1573 (D. Mass. 1983). The only statement which has evoked the plaintiff\u2019s displeasure (\u201cafter assaulting a police officer when he arrived on the scene\u201d) appears in the first paragraph of the article. However, the substantially similar language of the fourth paragraph of the article (\u201cthe two then assaulted Sgt. Roger Lamothe as he arrived on the scene, according to police\u201d), which is not the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, makes clear that the first paragraph does nothing more than paraphrase something reported by the police. That thought is reinforced by the fact that every other part of the article dealing with the facts leading up to the arrest is expressly attributed to the police (see, e.g., \u201c[pjolice said\u201d [used twice]; \u201csaid police\u201d [used twice]; and \u201caccording to police\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The article is found in a column entitled \u201cPolice log,\u201d which appears to be a daily feature of the defendant\u2019s newspaper. The balance of the column is broken down into sections entitled \u201cAlcohol related offenses\u201d and \u201cArrests.\u201d The first of those sections names three individuals seemingly unrelated to the plaintiff and identifies the offence with which each has been charged. The second names five other unrelated individuals and identifies the particular charge on which or the reason why each was arrested. It is only a lack of detail which distinguishes those sections from the article concerning the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>We are of opinion that no reasonable reader, taking the only statement complained of in context, could properly conclude that the defendant was accusing the plaintiff of having assaulted an officer as opposed to reporting the fact that the plaintiff had been arrested on a charge of assaulting an officer. Compare <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Providence Journal Co., </em>508 F.2d 656 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 828 (1975) (overall text of articles made clear defendant was not imputing guilt as a murderer); <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Venture Magazine, Inc., </em>574 F. Supp. at 1570-1571 (\u201cThe report, although it does not explicitly state that it is based on courtroom observations, is clearly a report of a trial. The article cannot be reasonably interpreted as implying that the statements about Ricci are based on facts occurring outside the trial\u201d). Contrast <em>Commercial Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>149 F. 704, 705, 706-707 (6th Cir. 1907) (jury question whether the article accused the plaintiff of murder or merely stated that he had been arrested for murder). On this record, the offending statement fell within the scope of the conditional privilege delineated in Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611, comment h (1977), and recently endorsed in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>400 Mass. at 794-795. See also <em>MiGi, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gannett Mass. Broadcasters, Inc., ante </em>394, 396-397 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> \u201c[W]e are not confined by the issues or theories advanced by the parties. We may decide cases on issues not raised by the parties.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 746 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\"> See G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u00a7 13A &amp; 13D.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b443-8\"> There is no dispute that the plaintiff was arrested on February 5, 1983, and charged with assault and battery on a Lowell police officer. See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell Div. of the Dist. Court Dept., </em>398 Mass. 800 (1986), in which the complaint against the defendant for that offence was ordered dismissed for reasons having nothing to do with the merits of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\"> It is clear from various discovery documents which were before the motion judge that the police had in their possession an official arrest report which set out their version of the facts leading up to the plaintiff\u2019s arrest. That report, although marked for identification in the course of two different depositions, has not been reproduced in the plaintiff\u2019s record appendix and is thus not before us. See <em>Kunen </em>v. <em>First Agricultural Natl. Bank, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 684, 687-691 (1978), and <em>Pastene Wine &amp; Spirits Co. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Commn., </em>401 Mass. 612, 615-616 (1988). However, the tacit assumption underlying a number of the arguments in the briefs is that the newspaper article in question had its origin in some sort of police report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
