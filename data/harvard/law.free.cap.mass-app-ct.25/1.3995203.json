See <em>Bolduc </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>355 Mass. 765, 767 (1969); <em>Aldoupolis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>386 Mass. 260, 268, 271-276, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Savoy </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>459 U.S. 864 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">The following is a summary of the salient features of the sentencing and commitment as they appear from the transcript of the 1982 hearing on disposition and from the original papers in no. 038513. The prosecutor recommended some form of from and after sentence. Defense counsel had no objection to such a sentence but remarked that \u201c[ijt\u2019s hard to know what we are giving a from and after sentence from.\u201d He directed the judge\u2019s attention to the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>386 Mass. 291 (1982), concerning the defendant\u2019s previous (Worcester) sentences and advised the judge that there were further questions concerning those sentences which were not finally resolved until the decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 1103 (1984), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 17 (1985). The judge halted the proceedings long enough to read the decision in the 1982 <em>Layne </em>case. As the Worcester sentences were consecutive rather than concurrent, there was an obvious need for specificity in identifying the particular sentence or sentences after which any new sentence would commence. Contrast <em>Carlino </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>355 Mass. 159, 160-161, 162 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">It was in light of the foregoing that an experienced trial judge said (according to the transcript of the hearing) that the sentence he would impose on no. 038513 would be \u201cserved from and after the sentence [singular] that he is now serving.\u201d The clarity of that language was immediately clouded by an explanation that \u201c[t]hat does not make it from and after <em>any </em>sentence which he may be required to serve\u201d (emphasis supplied). It will be noted that the judge\u2019s language, whatever its intended meaning, was in sharp contrast with the specific language recommended in <em>Henschel </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number><em>rection, </em>368 Mass. 130, 133 (1975), for use when a judge intends a new sentence to commence after all sentences previously imposed, namely, \u201cfrom and after the expiration of all previous sentences which the defendant has been ordered to serve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">The language of the sentence was immediately reflected in the minutes of the session clerk (\u201cfrom and after sentence [singular] defendant is now serving at MCI Walpole\u201d) and was duly embalmed in the mittimus issued on the day of sentence (\u201cto take effect from and after a sentence [singular] said defendant is presently serving at. . . Walpole\u201d). The language found its way onto the docket as \u201c[fjrom and after sentence [singular] defendant is now serving December 24, 1982 at M.C.I. Walpole.\u201d So matters rested until 1986, when the Department of Correction raised a question as to the expiration date of the 1982 sentence and the Commonwealth filed the present motion to \u201c[c]orrect [clerical [e]rror [p]ursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 42.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">The stated basis of the motion is that the 1982 sentence did not express the judge\u2019s intention that the sentence \u201crun from and after all the Worcester sentences the defendant was to serve, not simply from and after the Worcester sentence he was then serving.\u201d That theme was echoed by the Commonwealth in its first memorandum submitted in support of the motion and at the hearing held on April 2, 1986.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the course of that hearing the judge said, \u201cI think I intended sentences\u201d [plural];<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> elsewhere he spoke of \u201cmy intent.\u201d Although the judge\u2019s intention at the time of sentencing might have been a relevant consideration on a timely motion by the defendant (not the Commonwealth) to revise or revoke the sentence in proceedings under Mass.R.Crim.P. 29(a), the judge\u2019s intention at that time was irrelevant to a motion under Mass.R.Crim.P. 42 to correct a \u201cclerical mistake . . . arising from oversight or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>omission\u201d in recording the sentence actually pronounced or ordered by the judge. Were it otherwise, every sentence would be subject to change at any time if the judge who imposed it could be persuaded by one of the parties that what he had said on an earlier occasion did not reflect what he had meant. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Layne, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. at 18-20 (judge\u2019s intention or expectation as to effect of sentence irrelevant to question whether relief from sentence can be granted under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30[a], 378 Mass. 900 [1979]).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In his memorandum and order of April 4, 1986,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judge said that the sentence \u201cas recorded by the [c]lerk . . . was not what I said. It is entirely apparent from the colloquy prior to sentencing that such a sentence [as that recorded] would be meaningless.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge made no finding as to what he had in fact said. The latter part of the foregoing, when read in light of the judge\u2019s remarks as to his \u201cintent,\u201d gives rise to doubt whether the judge was explaining the reason for his belief that the clerk had not recorded what he (the judge) had said or whether the judge was reconstructing his intention at the time of the hearing on disposition. But what the judge had to say about the actions of the clerk does not account for the fact that the stenographer at the hearing on disposition apparently heard the judge say, \u201cFrom and after the sentence [singular] that he is now serving\u201d and nothing more except, \u201cThat does not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>it from and after any sentence which he may be required to serve.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">After careful consideration of a confusing record we find ourselves unable to determine whether the judge, in acting on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, (A) was engaging in a permissible correction of a clerical error on the part of the clerk in recording the sentence actually ordered or (B) was engaging in an impermissible revision of a sentence which was not in accord with his present recollection of his intention at the time of sentencing. In such circumstances, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. Compare <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 57, 61 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Accordingly, the order entered on April 4, 1986, on Suffolk indictment no. 038513 is reversed; the mittimus issued on that date is quashed; a new order is to enter denying the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to \u201ccorrect\u201d the record; and the mittimus issued on December 24, 1982, is to be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b29-7\"> The argument as to intention is perpetuated in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b29-8\"> The meaning of this statement is unclear because the Worcester sentences were consecutive and the defendant could not have been serving more than one of them on December 24, 1982.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b30-6\"> The order purported to \u201ccorrect\u201d the sentence to read as follows: \u201cM.C.I. Walpole \u2014 Max 7 years \u2014 Min. 5 years from and after the sentence the defendant is now serving and the sentences imposed on the defendant and which he is waiting to serve as of December 24, 1982.\u201d It would appear that the judge did not quarrel with the fact that his first use of the word \u201csentence\u201d had been in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b30-7\"> The sentence would not have been meaningless. It would have had the meaning attributed to it by the Department of Correction and advocated by the defendant, namely, that the new sentence would be served concurrently with the third of the nine to ten year Worcester sentences which the defendant had previously been ordered to serve. Once that is understood, the judge\u2019s remark comes through as additional evidence of a mistake on his part rather than a mistake in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b31-8\"> The Commonwealth does not appear to have made any motion to correct the transcript under Mass.R.A.P. 8(e), as appearing in 378 Mass. 934 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
