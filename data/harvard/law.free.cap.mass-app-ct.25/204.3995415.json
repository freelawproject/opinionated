The plaintiff then brought an action in the Superior Court seeking damages for breach of her. employment contract. After a bench trial, the judge found that, although the dean had had cause to discharge the plaintiff, he had not dismissed her on that basis. Rather, the dean had discharged the plaintiff as if she were a probationary employee who could be let go at any time during the probationary period. The judge further found that the defendant\u2019s normal probationary period for its employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>was inapplicable to the plaintiff. He concluded that, because the plaintiff could not be discharged as a probationary employee, her dismissal constituted a breach of her employment agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the facts found by the judge, we conclude that, if the plaintiff was not a probationary employee, she was nonetheless an employee who was fired in good faith for reasons amounting to just cause. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">I. <em>The Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">As found by the judge, the facts are as follows. Pursuant to an oral employment agreement, the plaintiff began work at the department on January 7, 1980. Her employment was to continue only until such time as a new chairman of the department should be appointed. It was anticipated that the appointment would be made in \u201cabout one year. \u201d However, that appointment also \u201ccould be made sooner.\u201d In any event, once the appointment was made the plaintiff\u2019s employment was to end, and she would not thereafter be entitled to further employment at, or any benefits from, Harvard University (the university). Her salary was set at the rate of $21,000 a year, or $ 1,750 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">At the time of the plaintiff\u2019s employment, the university had in effect a personnel manual which applied to all new non-faculty, noncollective bargaining employees. The plaintiff was such an employee. Section 3-1 of the manual provided that the first three months of employment would be a probationary period. During that time, the employee and the employee\u2019s supervisor (here, the dean) were to consider and evaluate the suitability of the employment placement. Any \u201cdecision to terminate the staff member should be made within the three month probationary period if at all possible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">Problems began soon after the plaintiff started work. Her relationships with certain (but not all) faculty members within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>the department \u201cbecame strained and acrimonious.\u201d When' some time in March the dean polled the department faculty members concerning the plaintiff\u2019s job performance, the results were not good. Some of the faculty members found the plaintiff difficult to work with, not helpful to them in carrying out their employment obligations and, in general, not a good administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Matters apparently came to a head on March 20, 1980, when the plaintiff sent a memorandum to the department\u2019s executive committee concerning a specific faculty member. She complained of his ability and personality in \u201cintens[ej\u201d words of \u201cvehement disparagement. \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dean learned of the memorandum, and he met with the plaintiff on March 24th. By that time, the dean had concluded \u201creasonably and in good faith\u201d that the plaintiff \u201cwas not the type of person who fulfilled the needs\u201d of the department and that she was \u201cnot a facilitator who could meet the requirements of the job description for her position.\u201d When the dean met with the plaintiff on March 24th, he discussed her job performance and told her that her memorandum to the executive committee was \u201cill-conceived. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">On March 28, 1980, the dean advised the plaintiff in writing that \u201cregretfully, we have to terminate your services.\u201d She was instructed to turn in her keys and identification badge that day and that upon doing so, she would \u201cbe given a check for . . . [her] next two weeks pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">This letter of discharge prompted the plaintiff to write to the president of the university and set out what she perceived to be the \u201cdishonest and sometimes irrational administrative conduct\u201d of three department members who, she accused, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>\u201cencouraged\u201d by the dean. She levelled charges of dishonesty concerning \u201cfudging the budget\u201d and \u201cdeliberate efforts to mis-allocate federal as well as private funds.\u201d The plaintiff diagnosed one of the main problems of the department as being the dean\u2019s decision \u201cto confide\u201d only with those faculty members having the \u201cmost widely acknowledged mental problems.\u201d Those faculty members were identified by the plaintiff in her letter. She advised the president that, if she did not hear from him within a week, she would relate her observations to the Federal and private funding agencies involved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">It appears from the transcript that the plaintiff sought and received some type of review within the university concerning her dismissal. She did not, however, meet with success.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">II. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">No contention was made at trial that the plaintiff, during her employment interview, was shown the personnel manual in its entirety or that her attention was directed to \u00a7 3-1 of the manual. The defendant did present evidence that the plaintiff was orally advised of the probationary period during her interview; however, the plaintiff denied that fact. The judge resolved this dispute in the testimony in the plaintiff\u2019s favor on the following basis: \u201cMemories here can be faulty but where it would have been so easy for Harvard, in negotiating with the plaintiff for employment, to have given her a copy or extract of the relevant pages of the manual or to have given her, upon making the actual offer of employment, a letter containing its provisions, I will resolve the doubts here against Harvard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">We think it implicit from the judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law that he construed the plaintiff\u2019s employment agreement to be one for a definite period of time (from January 7, 1980, until a new chairman should be appointed) and, therefore, that the plaintiff was not an at-will employee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>suming without deciding that the judge was correct in his conclusions that the plaintiff\u2019s employment was neither at-will nor subject to a period of probation, we do not think that it follows that her discharge was in breach of the employment agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Even if the plaintiff\u2019s employment was for a set, specific period of time, neither her agreement with the university nor the law guaranteed her employment for that period irrespective of her job performance. See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Hildreth &amp; Rogers Co., </em>332 Mass. 496, 499 (1955). According to the terms of the plaintiff\u2019s letter of appointment to her position, she was subject to removal \u201cfor grave misconduct or whenever . . . [her] duties are not satisfactorily discharged.\u201d We need not look to \u201cgrave misconduct\u201d and instead construe (for purposes of this case) \u201cnot satisfactorily discharged\u201d as meaning for just, good, or due cause at least, but not more.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Terms such as \u201cjust cause\u201d and like phrases have been construed in similar or analogous contexts as meaning: \u201c[T]here existed (1) a reasonable basis for employer dissatisfaction with a new employee, entertained in good faith, for reasons such as lack of capacity or diligence, failure to conform to usual standards of conduct, or other culpable or inappropriate behavior, or (2) grounds for discharge reasonably related, in the employer\u2019s honest judgment, to the needs of his business. Discharge for a \u2018just cause\u2019 is to be contrasted with discharge on unreasonable grounds or arbitrarily, capriciously, or in bad faith.\u201d <em>G &amp; M Employment Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>358 Mass. 430, 435 (1970). See also <em>Amoco Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Dickson, </em>378 Mass. 44, 47-48 (1979), and cases therein collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">On the facts found by the judge, the plaintiff\u2019s dismissal was for cause. That basis was not recited to the plaintiff on March 28th because the dean \u201cpreferred] to act under his assumed broader authority that he would be properly exercising if the plaintiff was a probationary employee.\u201d The judge further found that, in discharging the plaintiff, the dean \u201cacted consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>erately, with restraint, and with no ulterior motive.\u201d His action was in no way retaliatory to the plaintiff because of her allegations and views of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Further, the dean\u2019s failure to recite the cause with specificity in his letter of dismissal to the plaintiff may well have been motivated by his consistently considerate and restrained attitude toward the plaintiff. Cf. <em>Cort v. Bristol-Myers Co., </em>385 Mass. 300, 306 (1982) (\u201cAs a kindness to an employee in his seeking future employment, an employer may well not state its reasons fully and accurately\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The important point is that the plaintiff, notwithstanding the letter of dismissal, knew why her employment was terminated. The testimony of the plaintiff (as well as the dean) and the letters she wrote to the executive committee and the president (after her discharge) show that she knew she was having difficulty and problems in performing the obligations of her employment, even though she attributed those difficulties to other members of the department. Any notions the plaintiff might have entertained that she was doing her work diligently and competently and that her conduct was appropriate were reasonably dispelled on March 24th, when the dean met with her and discussed her job performance and \u201cill-conceived\u201d memorandum to the executive committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">HI. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">As there was just cause for the plaintiff\u2019s discharge, her dismissal did not constitute a breach of her employment agreement. Accordingly, the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a new judgment dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-9\"> The plaintiff also filed a notice of appeal from the judgment in her favor. The basis for her appeal is unknown. Although the appeal was entered in this court, the plaintiff failed to file a brief as either an appellee or an appellant, and she did not appear at oral argument. We have allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s appeal pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 19(c), 365 Mass. 868 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\"> In her memorandum, the plaintiff charged that the faculty member\u2019s judgment was \u201cseriously impaired,\u201d that his \u201cuse of authority\u201d was \u201cinappropriate and potentially liability-creating,\u201d that she should not \u201callow\u201d him to feel \u201cencouraged\u201d by silence on her part to \u201cmake rash, inaccurate and intentionally destructive statements\u201d about her, that his criticisms of her were \u201ctotally delusive and bespeak a distorted administrative perception,\u201d that he had \u201cranted and raved\u201d at her, that he \u201cseems compelled to sacrifice someone to satisfy his need to be important,\u201d that he would \u201cfalsify\u201d a situation to \u201cstrengthen his position,\u201d and that he had \u201caberrant perceptions\u201d about the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-9\"> There is nothing in the record to show that the plaintiff further discussed her allegations with the president or with any funding agency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b233-10\"> See <em>Mahoney </em>v. <em>Hildreth &amp; Rogers Co., </em>332 Mass. 496, 499 (1955), and cases therein cited.
