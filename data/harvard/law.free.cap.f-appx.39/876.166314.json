Patterson\u2019s appellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal but addressing whether Patterson\u2019s counsel conclusively provided ineffective assistance of counsel at either Patterson\u2019s plea hearings or sentencing hearing and whether any other meritorious claims exist.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We have thoroughly reviewed the record and find no evidence on the face of the record that Patterson\u2019s attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel at either his plea hearing or at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-22\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b896-19\"> Patterson was notified by counsel of his right to file a supplemental brief raising issues he deemed significant and has elected not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
