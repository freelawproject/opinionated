Moune further contends the Board abused its discretion in finding that he failed to establish a prima facie case that it is more likely than not that he would suffer torture if returned to Cameroon. <em>See Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595 (4th Cir.1999); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2) (2001). We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find no abuse of discretion in its denial of the motion to reopen. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(b)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the Board\u2019s denial of relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
