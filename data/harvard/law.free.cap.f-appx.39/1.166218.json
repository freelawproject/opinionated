Johnson contends that the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to convict him because he was entrapped as a matter of law. He also argues that the district court erred in failing to reduce his sentence for his role as a minor participant in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-26\">This Court must affirm the conviction if there is substantial evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, to support the verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence is substantial, this court inquires whether there is evidence sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996). Where the entrapment defense is presented to the jury and rejected, the jury\u2019s verdict should not be overturned unless no reasonable jury could have found that the government disproved either of the ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>ments of the entrapment defense: predisposition to commit the crime or inducement to commit the crime. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>231 F.3d 508, 516 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">In this case, the Government presented evidence tending to undercut both Johnson\u2019s claim of inducement and his claim of the absence of predisposition. Whether to credit this evidence or accept Johnson\u2019s conflicting testimonial evidence was a question for the jury. <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>35 F.3d 143, 148 (4th Cir.1994). Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">Regarding Johnson\u2019s challenge to his sentence, we review the district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 606 (4th Cir.1998). As the record discloses that Johnson played an essential role in the conspiracy at issue, the lower court did not err in denying a downward departure adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2001). Accordingly, Johnson\u2019s sentence is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
