He appeals from his 57 month sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-23\">The probation officer recommended that Flores-Ramirez\u2019s sentence be enhanced because the possession of the firearm was in connection with a drug trafficking offense. At sentencing, Flores-Ramirez objected to this recommendation and presented evidence to the contrary. The sentencing judge found Defendant\u2019s evidence to be incredible. The district court\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses generally is not reviewable on appeal. <em>United States v. Saunders, </em>886 F.2d 56, 60 (4th Cir.1989). We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s factual determination that Flores-Ramirez\u2019s possession of the firearm was in connection with a drug trafficking offense. <em>See United States v. Uwaeme, </em>975 F.2d 1016, 1018 (4th Cir.1992) (providing standard). Accordingly, we affirm Flores-Ramirez\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
