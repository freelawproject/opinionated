Stewart\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), addressing whether the magistrate judge fully complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Stewart\u2019s guilty plea, and whether the district court committed error in sentencing Stewart, but stating that in his opinion there were no meritorious issues for appeal. Although advised of his right to do so, Stewart has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-13\">We have reviewed the record and find that the magistrate judge adequately complied with the mandates of Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Stewart\u2019s guilty plea. We further find that Stewart\u2019s sentence was proper; the ten month sentence on the drug distribution count was within the properly calculated guidelines range, and the sixty month sentence on the firearm count was mandated by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no other meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Stewart\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-15\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-16\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
