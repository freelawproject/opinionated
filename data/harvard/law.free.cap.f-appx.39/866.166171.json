Smith sought damages for pain and suffering, alleging that employees of the Center committed medical malpractice in failing to remove one of several sutures used to repair a wound to his ear. He asserts that the suture caused him pain and discomfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-18\">To prevail on a \u00a7 1983 medical treatment claim, one must allege acts or omissions evidencing deliberate indifference to a serious medical need. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). Deliberate indifference can be established by showing that the medical treatment was so grossly incompetent, inadequate, or excessive as to shock the conscience or to be intolerable to fundamental fairness. <em>See Miltier v. Beorn, </em>896 F.2d 848, 851 (4th Cir.1990). An assertion of negligence or malpractice in diagnosis and treatment does not present a constitutional claim. <em>Estelle, </em>429 U.S. at 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-20\">Smith\u2019s allegation does not amount to a charge of deliberate indifference to a serious medical need, but is a claim of malpractice not actionable under \u00a7 1983. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
