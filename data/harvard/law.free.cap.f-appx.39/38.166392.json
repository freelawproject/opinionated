He contends that the there was no interstate transportation of the victim until after the kidnapping crime was already completed. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea as supported by a sufficient factual basis for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 652 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Under \u00a7 1201(a), kidnapping is the unlawful seizure or confinement of a person, held for ransom, reward, or otherwise, willfully transported in interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>Here, the undisputed facts show that Hernandez-Montoya abducted a 12-year old girl with the purpose of having sex with her, took her to Sampson County, North Carolina, and then to Texas and Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Hernandez-Montoya\u2019s argument that the kidnapping and interstate travel are separate incidents based on an eight-day delay before the victim was taken from North Carolina is flawed. The statute contemplates separate events forming a single offense, a kidnapping followed by the interstate transportation of the victim. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>716 F.2d 234, 237 (4th Cir.1983). A pause in interstate transportation will not undermine a federal kidnapping conviction. <em>See United States v. Toledo, </em>985 F.2d 1462 (10th Cir.1993) (affirming kidnapping conviction where victim was held for several days prior to interstate travel). The interstate travel requirement merely necessitates that the victim was held against her will while crossing state lines. <em>Id. </em>at 1468. As there is no dispute that the victim was being held against her will when she was removed from North Carolina, the length of her confinement in North Carolina is inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Having heard sufficient evidence to establish every element of the offense, the district court did not abuse its discretion in accepting Hernandez-Montoya\u2019s plea of guilty. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
