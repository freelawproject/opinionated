The indictment did not charge, and the jury was not instructed, as to specific drug quantities in Counts 1, 2, 4 or 5. On December 23, 1999, Brown was sentenced to life imprisonment on the conspiracy count (Count 1); to three concurrent 480 month terms on the distribution counts (Counts 2, 4, and 5); and a consecutive 60 month term on the firearms count (Count 3). The sentencing order was silent as to the guideline application but the transcript of the sentencing hearing indicates that the life sentence on the conspiracy count was arrived at by the cross-reference in Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Dl.l(d)(l) to the first degree murder guideline in Guideline \u00a7 2A1.1, reasoning that the murder occurred during the course of a drug trafficking conspiracy and fell within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1111. On appeal to this court, the only question in the brief was this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-17\">WHETHER THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN AP<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>PLYING THE CROSS-REFERENCE IN FINDING PATRICK FURMAN BROWN COMMITTED FIRST DEGREE MURDER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">a. GUIDELINES, CROSS REFERENCE AND FEDERAL MURDER STATUTES.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">b. FIRST DEGREE MURDER REQUIREMENTS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">c. DISCUSSION OF ISSUES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Brief, p. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Under the discussion of issues section, the brief describes Brown\u2019s position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">The sole issue Mr. Brown is raising on appeal is whether there is sufficient evidence of premeditation to support the lower court\u2019s finding that a first degree murder occurred in order to apply the cross reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Brief, p. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">On July 27, 2000, we affirmed in an unpublished opinion, <em>United States v. Brown, </em>No. 99-4948, 225 F.3d 655 (table), and decided only the issue of the imposition of the life sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Brown\u2019s petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court raised two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-13\">Whether in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina erred in holding that drug amounts set forth in 21 U.S.C. 841(b) are a sentencing factor rather than an element of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-14\">Whether in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina erred in finding that Patrick Furman Brown committed first degree murder and that the murder was related to the drug conspiracy in applying the cross-reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-17\">The Supreme Court then, in the case at hand, entered its order of February 20, 2001, 531 U.S. 1136, 121 S.Ct. 1072, 148 L.Ed.2d 950, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-18\">No. 00-6846. <em>Brown v. United States. </em>C.A. 4th Cir. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>granted. Certiorari granted, judgment vacated, and case remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Reported below: 225 F.3d 655.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-19\">Although the only question raised on appeal to us was whether or not there was sufficient evidence of premeditation to support the finding of the district court that a first degree murder had occurred in order to apply the cross-reference to first degree murder under the Sentencing Guidelines, we are of opinion that on the facts of this case as related above, <em>Apprendi </em>having been decided on June 26, 2000 and the <em>Apprendi </em>mandate having issued on July 26, 2000, between the sentencing by the district court on December 23, 1999, and our decision on July 27, 2000, the case should have been remanded by us for re-sentencing in the fight of <em>Apprendi </em>under such decisions as <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>457 U.S. 537, 562, 102 S.Ct. 2579, 73 L.Ed.2d 202 (1982), which held that the law in effect at the time of a decision by an appellate court is the law which should be applied by that court in a criminal case on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-20\">We required supplemental briefing in view of <em>Apprendi, </em>which raised the issues discussed below. <em>Apprendi </em>held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d After reviewing Brown\u2019s convictions and sentences for plain error in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Promise, </em>255 F.3d 150, 154 (4th Cir.2001) <em>(en </em>banc) (discussing plain error standard of review), <em>petition for cert, filed, </em>Sept. 20, 2001 (No. 01-6398).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Brown argues four issues on remand. First, Brown argues on remand that \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional after <em>Apprendi. </em>The case on which he relies for support was vacated and the Ninth Circuit, sitting <em>en banc, </em>concluded that \u00a7 841 was not facially unconstitutional. <em>See United States v. Buckland, </em>259 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g en banc granted, </em>265 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir.2001), <em>en banc, </em>277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002). Moreover, we recently held that # 7F8E # 841 is not facially unconstitutional.\u201d <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 232 (4th Cir.2001). We hold that Brown is not entitled to relief on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Second, Brown challenges the district court\u2019s jurisdiction as to Counts 2, 4, and 5. He contends that, in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>the indictment is defective because it failed to charge the quantity of crack cocaine as an element of the offense in Counts 2, 4, and 5, thereby depriving the district court of jurisdiction. We hold that the indictment properly charged the offenses for which Brown was convicted. <em>See Promise, </em>255 F.3d at 160 (finding indictment sufficient where it charged defendant with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute \u201ca quantity of cocaine and cocaine base\u201d). There is no constitutional or like rule forbidding Congress from making unlawful the possession or distribution of a controlled substance without reference to quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Third, he contends that his life and concurrent forty-year sentences are invalid after Apprendi.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>Promise, </em>we applied <em>Apprendi </em>to drug offenses in \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 and held that \u201cthe specific threshold [drug] quantity must be treated as an element of an aggravated drug trafficking offense, <em>i.e., </em>charged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156-57 (footnotes omitted). Here, drug quantity was not charged in the indictment or submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Brown received a life sentence on Count 1. The district court applied the murder cross-reference under USSG \u00a7 2A1.1, which sets a base offense level of 43, resulting in a presumptive life sentence in all cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court then sentenced Brown to three 480 month concurrent sentences for Counts 2, 4, and 5. Brown also received a consecutive five-year sentence on Count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Because the murder occurred during the course of the conspiracy, the district court properly included the murder as relevant conduct. Relying on drug quantity in the pre-sentence report, the district court, however, improperly assumed that the maximum sentence under \u00a7 846 was life imprisonment. Under <em>Apprendi, </em>since drug quantity was not included in the indictment, the maximum sentence for Count 1 is 20 years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Imposing a life sentence by using the murder cross-reference violated the guidelines, which state: \u201cWhere the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline range.\u201d USSG \u00a7 5Gl.l(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore find that there is error and that the error is plain. <em>Promise, </em>255 F.3d at 156-57, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">As to Counts 2, 4, and 5, the district court sentenced Brown to three 40 year sentences, running concurrently with his life sentence. No drug quantity was charged, therefore, the maximum sentence for Counts 2, 4, and 5, like Count 1, is 20 years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). <em>United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 309, 151 L.Ed.2d 230 (2001). Since drug quantity was not charged in the indictment, the maximum prison term for his multiple convictions is 85 years. Count 1, 2, 4, and 5 each carry a 20 year sentence. Count 3 carries a five-year term. USSG \u00a7 5G1.2(d) states: \u201cIf the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\u201d Under the sentencing guidelines, the four 20 year terms and one five-year must be imposed consecutively for a total of 85 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Because Brown\u2019s life sentence exceeds the total statutory maximum prison term of 85 years for multiple convictions involving an unspecified amount of drugs, we hold that the error in Brown\u2019s life sentence affects his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518-19 (4th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 309, 151 L.Ed.2d 230 (2001); <em>United States v. White, </em>238 F.3d 537, 542-43 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 1074, 121 S.Ct. 2235, 150 L.Ed.2d 225 (2001). Thus, Brown \u201ccan demonstrate that [his] sentence is \u2018longer than that to which he would otherwise be subject.\u2019 \u201c <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>261 F.3d 397, 403 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Angle, </em>254 F.3d at 518), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>Oct. 31, 2001; <em>cf. United States v. Roberts, </em>262 F.3d 286, 292 (4th Cir.2001) (holding that defendants\u2019 substantial rights not affected where sentencing guidelines stacking rules required imposition of consecutive sentences totaling 240 years for one defendant and 380 years for the other).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Having concluded that there is plain error affecting Brown\u2019s substantial rights, we exercise our discretion to notice the error. <em>Cotton, </em>261 F.3d at 404-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Accordingly, we vacate Brown\u2019s life sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with USSG \u00a7\u00a7 5Gl.l(a), 5G1.2(d) and <em>White, </em>238 F.3d at 543. We affirm the judgment of conviction in all other respects. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court, and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-15\">. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em>was decided on June 26, 2000. 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\">. Brown urges us to reconsider our decision in <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192 (4th Cir.2000) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to judge's exercise of sentencing discretion within statutory range, so long as defendant\u2019s sentence is not set beyond maximum term specified in substantive statute), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001). We decline to do so because \"a panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court[;][o]nly the Supreme Court or this court sitting <em>en banc </em>can do that.\u201d <em>Mentavlos r.

We agree with the Seventh Circuit which recently addressed this guideline provision in <em>United. States v. Westmoreland, </em>240 F.3d 618, 636 (7th Cir.2001). The court stated, \u201cit is not possible to apply the cross-reference in a manner that produces a sentence greater than the statutory maximum applicable to the charged crime____Therefore, even though the murder cross-reference will always allow for a life sentence, the Guidelines require that the cross-reference only increase the defendant\u2019s sentence at most to the statutory maximum associated with the charge on which the defendant was convicted.\u201d 240 F.3d at 636.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
