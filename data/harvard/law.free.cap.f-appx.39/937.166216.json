He was sentenced to a term of forty-six months imprisonment and thirty-six months of supervised release. Ward admittedly violated the terms of his supervised release. At his revocation hearing, the district court sentenced Ward to twenty-four months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-21\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 1994 &amp; Supp.2001). Moreover, if the court has considered the relevant factors and the applicable policy statements, it has the discretion to impose a sentence outside the ranges set out in the sentencing guidelines. <em>See Davis </em>at 642-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-22\">We find the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Ward to twenty-four months imprisonment. Ward provides no basis for his assertion that the court sentenced him based on \u201csecret information\u201d provided by his probation officer or out of \u201cpunitive animus.\u201d We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
