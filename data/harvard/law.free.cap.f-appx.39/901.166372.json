We dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-25\">Defendants assert an entitlement to partial dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal because Plaintiffs failed to file objections to those aspects of the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that were adverse to their claims. We agree. <em>Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 154, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985); <em>Wells v. Shriners Hosp., </em>109 F.3d 198 (4th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we grant Defendants\u2019 motion and dismiss all of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp. 2001) against Defendants in their official capacities; Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim for assault; Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment claim for unreasonable search; Plaintiff Beth Ann Lea\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim for false arrest; Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim for malicious prosecution; Plaintiffs\u2019 state law tort claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress; and Plaintiff Beth Ann Lea\u2019s state law tort claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-26\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants as to Plaintiff Saul Lea\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>claims for false arrest under \u00a7 1983 and false arrest and malicious prosecution under North Carolina law de novo. <em>See Higgins v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>863 F.2d 1162, 1167 (4th Cir.1988). Summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact, given the parties\u2019 burdens of proof at trial. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-49, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In determining whether the moving party has shown that there is no genuine issue of material fact, we assess the factual evidence and all inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 255; <em>Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth Univ., </em>84 F.3d 672, 675 (4th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">With these standards in mind, we affirm the order granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants as to Plaintiff Saul Lea\u2019s claims for false arrest under \u00a7 1983 and false arrest and malicious prosecution under North Carolina law on the reasoning of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
