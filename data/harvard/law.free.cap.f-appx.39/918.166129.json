The district court did not have the benefit of our recent decision in <em>United States v. Emmanuel, </em>288 F.3d 644 (4th Cir.2002), when it recharacterized Barber\u2019s filing as his first \u00a7 2255 motion. Thus, we grant a certificate of appealability, vacate the district court\u2019s orders, and remand in light of <em>Emmanuel </em>for the district court to provide Barber with notice of its intention to re-characterize his filing and an opportunity for him to respond by proceeding with the recharacterization to a \u00a7 2255 motion <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or by electing to have the district court address the merits of the petition for a writ of audita querela as filed. <em>See id. </em>at 649-50. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequat\u00e9ly presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b939-9\"> If Barber chooses this route, we express no opinion on the timeliness of the motion or the claims Barber may seek to raise through amendment. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001); <em>Hill v. Braxton, </em>277 F.3d 701 (4th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Pittman, </em>209 F.3d 314 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
