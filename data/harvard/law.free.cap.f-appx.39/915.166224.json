On appeal, Brasington challenges the two-level increase in his offense level for use of a special skill to facilitate the former offense. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.3 (1998). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-21\">Brasington, a DirecTV dealer and installer, modified the internal computer microchips of satellite access cards. He then sold many of the modified cards, enabling the purchasers to obtain DirecTV programming for which they had not paid. We conclude that his ability to modify the microchips constituted a \u201cspecial skill\u201d under USSG \u00a7 3B1.3 and that the district court did not clearly err in enhancing Brasington\u2019s offense level by two levels. We note in particular that Brasington\u2019s actions required a level of sophistication far beyond that of the ordinary computer user, and we find that the facts of this case are more akin to those in <em>United States v. Petersen, </em>98 F.3d 502 (9th Cir.1996) (holding that self-taught ability to hack into computer systems warrants special skill assessment), than those in <em>United States v. Godman, </em>223 F.3d 320 (6th Cir.2000) (remanding for resentencing upon finding that using commonly available desktop publishing software to produce counterfeit Federal Reserve Notes does not require sophisticated skill level warranting enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3B1.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
