Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Vargas raises only one issue on appeal, contending that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to accept his guilty plea. Under Rule 11(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \u201cthe court should not enter a judgment upon [a guilty] plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Furthermore, there is \u201cno absolute right to have a guilty plea accepted,\u201d and a district court may \u201creject a plea in [the] exercise of sound judicial discretion.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and record on appeal and are satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Vargas\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Vargas\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
