He contends that the district court erroneously found that his possession of a firearm was \u201cin connection with\u201d another felony and thus improperly enhanced his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">The stipulated facts indicate that Gosnell was apprehended by law enforcement officers after a radio check revealed the vehicle he was driving was stolen. Gosnell was removed from the car, placed on the ground, and handcuffed. Upon being brought to his feet, a loaded Smith and Wesson 9 millimeter luger semi-automatic pistol fell from his waist area to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">Gosnell pled guilty to violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), possession of a firearm after having previously been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. The district court increased Gosnell\u2019s base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) because he used or possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense, possession of a stolen vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-17\">Without the enhancement, Gosnell\u2019s sentencing guideline range would have been 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. The enhancement yielded a range of 84 to 105 months, and Gosnell was sentenced to 84 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-19\">In this circuit, enhancing a sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) involves a two-part analysis. <em>See United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1004 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>Cir.1996) (analyzing the \u201cin connection with\u201d language in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(c)(l)). The government must first prove that the defendant possessed the gun, and then prove that the gun was connected to another felony offense. <em>Id. </em>There is no dispute that Gosnell possessed the weapon. At issue here is the proper application of the \u201cin connection with\u201d aspect of the section 2K2.1(b)(5) guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">In <em>Nale, </em>this court analogized the \u201cin connection with\u201d language of section 2K2.1(c)(l) to the phrase \u201cin relation to\u201d found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). 101 F.3d at 1003-04. In a later case, the court noted that \u201cin connection with\u201d has the same meaning in section 2K2.1(b)(5) as it does in section 2K2.1(c), and, in both cases, a meaning that is deemed analogous to the \u201cin relation to\u201d language used in section 924(c). <em>United States v. Garnett, </em>243 F.3d 824, 828 &amp; n. 6 (4th Cir.2001); <em>accord United States v. Routon, </em>25 F.3d 815, 818 (9th Cir.1994) (finding that 924(c) is \u201can appropriate guide for interpreting section 2K2.1(b)(5)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Accordingly, under the logic of <em>Nale </em>and <em>Garnett, </em>to satisfy the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement, the government must prove that the firearm had \u201c\u2018some purpose or effect with respect to\u2019\u201d the felony, and that the gun at least facilitated, or had the potential of facilitating, the offense. <em>See United States v. Lipford, </em>203 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir.2000) (citations omitted) (analyzing \u201cin relation to\u201d requirement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)). Although the nexus requirement is not satisfied when the presence of the firearm is accidental or coincidental, it is sufficient \u201cif the firearm was present for protection or to embolden the actor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Possession that is contemporaneous to but independent from another felony is merely coincidental to the felony. <em>Id. </em>at 267; <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>115 F.3d 1185, 1191-92 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">This court has found that if a firearm is carried for protection or intimidation during commission of a drug trafficking offense, it is carried in relation to the drug trafficking offense. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d 649, 654 (4th Cir.1997). In <em>Mitchell, </em>the evidence indicated that the defendant transported a loaded firearm in the passenger compartment of his automobile to a drug exchange. The court determined that \u201csuch evidence may support a conclusion that the weapon provided the potential to facilitate the drug transaction and that its presence in the vehicle was not coincidental.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Gosnell contends that, based on the facts, his possession of the firearm at the time of his arrest was not \u201cin connection with\u201d his operation of a stolen vehicle, but was merely \u201ccoincidental to\u201d that offense. He points out that he did not in any way reach for the firearm or attempt to draw it, but merely let it fall to the ground, and that the government presented no evidence of how long he had been driving the vehicle, or whether he had previously been in the vehicle with the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">The district court concluded that an \u201cemboldening role ... is served by someone who possesses the firearm while knowingly in possession of stolen property.\u201d Reasoning that it is \u201ca matter of common knowledge\u201d that \u201cmany police shootings involved police that stop stolen vehicles,\u201d the district court inferred that the pistol emboldened Gosnell to maintain possession of the stolen vehicle. The district court also stated that \u201cbased on the stipulated facts of the ignition being popped [the vehicle having a broken driver\u2019s window, cracked steering column, and destroyed ignition, and Gosnell driving without an ignition key], that anybody who had this property would, obviously, have to believe that it had been stolen ... and, that the possession of a firearm by the driver of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>car in that circumstance is sufficiently in connection with ... that continuing offense to qualify for the enhancements under 2K2.1(b)(5).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Gosnell argues that these circumstances only provide evidence that he committed the offense of possession of a stolen vehicle and do not directly and sufficiently address whether he possessed the weapon in relation to that felony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">The driver of a car in such a vandalized condition would almost certainly have a heightened concern for the possibility of a traffic stop at which a law enforcement officer would immediately recognize that the automobile had been stolen. This would clearly carry with it a continuing appreciation for the enhanced risk accompanying the enduring use of such a vehicle and would sufficiently establish that the gun emboldened Gosnell to continue his felonious venture notwithstanding the obvious risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">However, we note that, to satisfy the \u201cin connection with\u201d element, this court has never required the amount of evidence of an emboldening role that exists in this case, nor proof of numerous incidents of simultaneously possessing a vehicle and weapon. <em>But cf. Routon, </em>25 F.3d at 819 (concluding that there was sufficient evidence to support a section 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement when a defendant brought a gun with him whenever he rode in an illegally possessed car and kept the gun within a short distance of himself while driving). Gosnell was carrying a loaded pistol in the waistband of his pants while knowingly driving a stolen car. Given the available inferences, that is sufficient. <em>See Mitchell, </em>104 F.3d at 654. As Gosnell acknowledges, the government need not prove that he used the gun, but need only prove that he possessed it in connection with another felony. The stipulated facts establish that Gosnell carried the gun for protection from, or intimidation of, anyone who might try to interrupt his dominion over the vehicle or try to detain him, even though he ultimately chose not to use it for such purposes. <em>See id. </em>The pistol therefore \u201cprovided the potential to facilitate\u201d Gosnell\u2019s possession of the stolen vehicle and its presence was not coincidental to that crime. <em>Id. </em>Given the record, there is a sufficient basis for enhancement pursuant to section 2K2.1(b)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">For the reasons set forth, we conclude that the district court did not err in applying the guideline enhancement. Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
