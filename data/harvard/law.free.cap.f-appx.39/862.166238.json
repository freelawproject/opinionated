A jury subsequently convicted Bill-ups of retaliating against a witness, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1513(b)(2) (West 2000). The jury also convicted Christopher Davis of aiding and abetting that retaliation, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1513(b)(2) and 2 (West 2000). Billups appeals his sentence for his conspiracy conviction, arguing the district court erred in applying a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 (2000). Billups and Davis also challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support their convictions under \u00a7 1513(b). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-10\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s application of an enhancement for obstruction of justice in computing Bill-ups\u2019s sentence for conspiring to distribute cocaine base. This court reviews sentencing determinations de novo and the underlying factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217 (4th Cir.1989). At Billups\u2019s sentencing hearing, two witnesses testified that Billups repeatedly threatened a former co-conspirator while they were housed together at the South Central Regional Jail (SCRJ). The second witness, Clarence Woolfolk, also testified that Billups and Davis assaulted him at the SCRJ after he was identified as a future witness against Billups. Because an obstruction of justice enhancement may be applied based on threats or intimidation of a co-defendant or witness, whether direct or indirect, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(a)), we find no error in the application of this enhancement to Billups\u2019s sentence in appeal No. 01-4100.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">Furthermore, our review of the trial transcript from Billups\u2019s and Davis\u2019s trial for their assault on Woolfolk indicates that there is sufficient evidence to support their convictions. Several witnesses testified that both Billups and Davis struck Woolfolk. An SCRJ inmate also testified that he saw Billups and Davis engage in a brief conversation before attacking Woolfolk, just moments after Billups said: \u201cThere\u2019s the snitch and he\u2019s going to get his.\u201d We find that this testimony provides proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis aided Billups in knowingly causing physical injury to Woolfolk in retaliation for Woolfolk\u2019s testimony against Billups. <em>See United States v. Cofield, </em>11 F.3d 413, 419 (4th Cir.1993) (providing elements of a charge under \u00a7 1513(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Accordingly, we affirm Billups\u2019s sentence in No. 01-4100, as well as Billups\u2019s and Davis\u2019s convictions in No. 01-4713 and No. 01-4738, respectively. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
