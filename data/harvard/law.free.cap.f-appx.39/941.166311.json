However, proceedings under \u00a7 3582 constitute extensions of the original criminal proceeding, <em>see United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000), and the statute governing appeals from such proceedings \u201cdoes not provide for appellate review of a sentencing court\u2019s discretion in setting a sentence anywhere within a properly calculated sentencing range,\u201d <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794-95 (4th Cir.1990) (discussing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (1994)). Accordingly, because Vural\u2019s sole claim on appeal is unreviewable, we deny Vural\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel and dismiss this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
