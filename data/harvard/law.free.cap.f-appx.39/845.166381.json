Following a jury trial, the district court sentenced Hamilton to 120 months imprisonment. Bailey was sentenced on a guilty plea to 97 months imprisonment. Hamilton also was sentenced to five years, and Bailey to three years, of supervised release, and both were assessed mandatory special assessments. Both timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-15\">On appeal, Hamilton claims that he was denied a fair trial by allegedly prejudicial comments made by the government during closing argument. Specifically he claims error in the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his name appearing in a notebook of drug contacts used by another conspirator, after the notebook\u2019s owner was unable to locate Hamilton\u2019s name in the notebook during his trial testimony. We have held prosecutorial misconduct to be reversible where the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were in fact improper, and where such improper comments prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights such that he is deprived of a fair trial. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>1 F.3d 235, 240 (4th Cir.1993). Our review here is for plain error because Hamilton failed to object below. Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>134 F.3d 235, 239 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-16\">The witness testified at trial that he \u201cprobably\u201d had written Hamilton\u2019s name in the notebook, but that he was unable to \u201csee it right off-hand.\u201d In closing argument, Hamilton\u2019s attorney initiated the discussion of the notebook, and then the prosecutor referenced the notebook where the witness kept notes of his drug transactions, stating that it reflected two dates after which Hamilton\u2019s name appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-17\">We find that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were neither improper nor did they im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>pugn the integrity of Hamilton\u2019s conviction. The notebook was a trial exhibit, thereby providing evidentiary support for the prosecution\u2019s statements. Moreover, the contested remarks were made by the prosecutor during rebuttal and in response to Hamilton\u2019s counsel\u2019s closing remarks where he initiated discussion of the notebook and the witness\u2019s failure to locate Hamilton\u2019s name in it. Finally, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the statement was improper, we find that the statements did not prejudicially affect Hamilton\u2019s substantial rights such that he was deprived of a fair trial, given the other evidence against him, which included the testimony of five witnesses who testified they saw Hamilton sell drugs. Accordingly, we affirm Hamilton\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Bailey\u2019s sole claim on appeal is that his ninety-seven month sentence on a single count of conspiring to distribute marijuana violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment charged him with an unspecified amount of marijuana. The United States filed a separate information pursuant to 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2002), alleging more than 1000 kilograms of marijuana. Bailey pled guilty to the charge without a written plea agreement, specifically reserving the right to contest the drug amount. At his sentencing hearing, Bailey lodged a timely objection pursuant to <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The district judge found by a preponderance of evidence, consistent with the statements in the presentence investigation report, that the amount of marijuana involved in the conspiracy to which Bailey pled guilty was 1216 kilograms, and sentenced Bailey to ninety-seven months. The United States has confessed error by the district court relative to Bailey\u2019s sentence because his prison sentence exceeds the statutory maximum sentence of sixty months under 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(D) (West Supp.2002). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Cromartie, </em>267 F.3d 1293, 1296 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">We affirm Bailey\u2019s conviction. However, because it is clear that Bailey\u2019s sentence violates <em>Apprendi, </em>we vacate his sentence and remand the case for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
