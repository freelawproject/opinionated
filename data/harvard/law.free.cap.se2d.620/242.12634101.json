Abernethy, appeals the trial court's entry of judgment following a jury verdict, holding that Romer Gray Taylor (Romer) entered into a valid contract to convey his entire estate to his brother, plaintiff, Harvey C. Taylor, Jr. For the reasons discussed herein, we reverse and remand this matter for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Romer was a lifelong resident of Burke County, North Carolina. Plaintiff was Romer's older brother. Defendant was Romer and plaintiff's nephew. Romer never married and had no children. Plaintiff moved to Pennsylvania after World War II and has continued to reside there. In 1978, plaintiff assisted Romer in the acquisition of a backhoe. On 7 October 1997, Romer executed a holographic will, which left his entire estate to defendant. On 22 October 1997, plaintiff filed a document with the Burke County Register of Deeds, which purported to be a contract to make a will between himself and Romer and was dated 10 July 1978. This contract stated that Romer would \"immediately make a valid will devising to HARVEY C. TAYLOR and his heirs, assigns, and successors the entire estate of said ROMER GREY TAYLOR.\" The contract further provided that Romer agreed not to revoke the will made pursuant to its provisions. The contract was executed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Romer died on 18 January 1998. Following his death, defendant offered the holographic will for probate. Plaintiff instituted this action on 12 February 1998 seeking specific performance of the contract to make a will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter initially came on for trial at the 29 August 2000 session of court. The jury found the signature of Romer on the contract to make a will was not genuine. Based upon this finding, the trial court dismissed plaintiff's action. Plaintiff appealed. On 19 March 2002, this Court filed an opinion finding error in part and remanded the case for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Morgan at the 1 December 2003 session of superior court. The trial judge submitted a single issue to the jury: \"Is the signature on the document labeled Plaintiff's Exhibit A and entitled `Contract to Make a Will' the genuine signature of Romer Gray Taylor?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff following the jury's determination that it was indeed Romer's signature on the contract. The trial court directed the administrator CTA to deliver the entire estate to plaintiff. From entry of this judgment, defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We first address defendant's second argument in which he contends the trial court erred in permitting plaintiff's wife to testify concerning her conversations with the decedent, as well as permitting her to testify to conversations between plaintiff and Romer, which she overheard, as this violated Rule 601 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence.

We therefore hold that plaintiff's wife was an \"interested person\" for purposes of Rule 601(c), and as a result, the trial court erred in admitting her testimony concerning oral communications she had with Romer. For these same reasons, plaintiff's wife should not be allowed to testify as to any conversations she overheard between her husband and Romer concerning Romer's intent to leave everything to plaintiff. Plaintiff does not contend that the admission of his wife's testimony was harmless and had no prejudicial effect on the outcome of the trial. As this testimony was inadmissible, we order a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Based upon this holding, we need not address the remainder of appellant's arguments presented to this Court.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Specifically, defendant assigns as error the admittance of: (1) Exhibit 1(a), which is an original handwritten letter from Romer to plaintiff dated 3 April 1958; (2) Exhibit 1, which is the original envelope postmarked 3 April 1958 in which Exhibit 1(a) was mailed; (3) Exhibit 2(a), which is an original handwritten letter from Romer to plaintiff dated 23 March 1958; (4) Exhibit 1, which is the original envelope postmarked 25 March 1958 in which Exhibit 1(a) was mailed; and (5) Exhibit 1(e), which were defendant's answers to plaintiff's request for admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"`Hearsay' is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" N.C.

Plaintiff also offered these exhibits to corroborate Romer's plan or intent to make a will in favor of plaintiff, and rebut defendant's assertion that \"Romer would never have signed anything\n   like that.\" Furthermore, the letters were properly authenticated by one of Romer's nephew's, Chris Taylor, pursuant to Rule 901(b)(2) of the Rules of Evidence. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 901(b)(2) (2004). Therefore, these letters were admissible. As such, it was proper for Chris Taylor to read one of them to the jury for the purpose of demonstrating Romer's motive in executing the contract to make a will, as well as corroboration of Romer's subsequent actions, that is, the execution of the contract. This argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In defendant's fourth argument, he contends the trial court erred in allowing plaintiff's expert witness, Charles Perrotta, to give his opinion as to the genuineness of Romer Taylor's signature on the contract to make a will.

We caution the lower court that upon remand this new trial is to be conducted based on the evidence presented at\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   trial. This evidence may or may not be the same as that presented at the previous trial. It is not the role of the trial judge upon retrial to follow the path taken by the judge in the previous trial. The judge must submit issues to the jury based on the evidence presented at the current trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   REVERSED AND REMANDED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Judges WYNN and HUDSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
