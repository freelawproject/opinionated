At the 23 February 2004\n   criminal session of the Superior Court in Guilford County, the court dismissed one count each of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and second-degree kidnaping. A jury found defendant guilty of one count of assault inflicting serious bodily injury, two counts of assault inflicting serious injury, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and two counts of second-degree kidnaping. Based on its findings of aggravating factors, the court sentenced defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment totaling more than sixteen years with credit for time served. Defendant appeals. For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that defendant is entitled to a new trial on all charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State's evidence tended to show that sometime after Christmas 2002, Melanie Hope Hunt gave a written statement to Greensboro police stating that defendant had severely beaten her and restrained her against her will over the course of the past month and half. Hunt reported that between 9 through 13 November 2002, the defendant stabbed her five times with such force that the knife became stuck in one of her arms. She further stated that the defendant punched her so hard that she struck a wall, leaving an imprint and forcing the pair to move to a different motel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Hunt told police that on 17 or 18 November 2002, the defendant beat her in the face, and twisted her arm until it fractured. After initially refusing to take her to get medical treatment, defendant ultimately agreed to take Hunt to a hospital in High Point. Defendant instructed her to tell hospital staff that she had fallen out of the attic and broken her arm and that the stab wounds were puncture wounds she received trying to climb over a fence. Hunt further stated that on 24 and 25 December 2002, defendant beat her, threw her to floor on her broken arm, hit her in the stomach and back, and whipped her legs with a belt. She stated that on 25 December 2002 defendant would not allow her to see her family, and threatened to beat her each time she requested to go.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At trial, Hunt admitted writing these statements, but insisted that they were not true. She testified that she had written them only because she had caught the defendant in bed with another woman, and that she had written affidavits three different times asking the State to dismiss all the charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State introduced expert medical testimony from the physician who treated Hunt at High Point Regional Hospital on 19 November 2002. Dr. Kevin Largen testified that Hunt's fractured arm was inconsistent with a fall from an attic, and more likely was caused by a twisting of the bone. He also noted that Hunt had bruises of different ages and a large abrasion on the upper part of her right arm. Based on Hunt's inconsistent statements and her delay in seeking treatment, Dr. Largen concluded that Hunt was a victim of domestic violence and contacted hospital social worker Karen Chance. Mrs. Chance testified that Hunt told her that defendant had been beating her regularly for the past twelve years and that he refused to get her treatment in Greensboro because she was a known victim of abuse at the hospitals there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer S.V. Petteway of the Greensboro Police Department testified that on 26 December 2002 Hunt approached him at the Dollar General Store on High Point Road. He testified that as soon as Hunt began talking to him the defendant fled the store. Hunt told the officer that the defendant had been holding her for days, would not let her contact her family, had beaten her constantly and broken her arm. Officer Petteway took Hunt to her grandmother's house in Randolph County where she was admitted into a domestic violence shelter. Shelter manager Dolly Weeks testified that Hunt had told her that defendant had beaten her, broken her arm, and stabbed her five times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it admitted and published to the jury evidence of a prior conviction for assault inflicting serious injury. He contends that the admission of such evidence was improper under N.C.R. Evid. 404(b) and was inherently prejudicial under the holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under Rule 404(b), evidence of a defendant's other crimes, wrongs or acts is inadmissible to show that the defendant acted in conformity therewith, but may be admissible \"for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake, entrapment or accident.\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 404(b) (2002). In contrast to Rule 404(b), Rule 609 allows for the admission of a prior conviction for the limited purpose of impeaching a defendant's credibility as a witness if the evidence of the convictions is \"elicited from the witness or established by public record during cross-examination or thereafter.\" N.C.

In his dissent, adopted by our Supreme Court, Judge Wynn noted that the defendant must be granted a new trial because:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   admitting the bare fact of a defendant's prior conviction, except in cases where our courts have recognized a categorical exception to the general rule . . ., violates Rule 404(b) . . . as well as Rule 403, as the bare fact of a prior conviction is\n   <em>\n    inherently\n   </em>\n   prejudicial such that any probative value of the conviction is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 327-328,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=559%20S.E.2d%205\">\n    559 S.E.2d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, the State elicited the testimony of Greensboro Police Officer Wall, who described the underlying facts of an assault committed by the defendant upon Hunt in 1995. However, he did not testify that this assault resulted in a criminal conviction. Following Officer Wall's testimony, the State introduced a certified copy of defendant's criminal conviction for assault inflicting serious injury resulting from the events described by Officer Wall. The trial court admitted both the testimony and the exhibit under Rule 404(b). Defendant did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While the trial court properly admitted Officer Wall's testimony under Rule 404(b), it erred in admitting the evidence of defendant's prior conviction pursuant to Rule 404(b). As in\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson,\n   </em>\n   the bare fact of a non-testifying defendant's prior conviction was admitted and published to the jury under Rule 404(b) after testimony had been elicited to establish the factual basis underlying that conviction. Because we are unable to distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Wilkerson,\n   </em>\n   we conclude that the trial court committed prejudicial error entitling defendant to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although we grant defendant a new trial as discussed above, we also address defendant's other assignments of error which could arise in a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant next contends that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury, in case No. 03 CRS 51797 (\"Count Two\"), that a knife is a deadly weapon as a matter of law for the charge of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury arising out of the events of 6 November 2002.

Instead, defendant maintains that the only evidence of the nature of the knife and its manner of use was in the prior inconsistent statements of Hunt which were not offered as substantive evidence. The State's evidence, including the documents from the domestic violence hearing which were admitted as substantive evidence, tended to show that the defendant stabbed Hunt five times with a knife causing wounds still visible some eight weeks after the assault. This evidence could adequately support an inference by the jury that the defendant assaulted Hunt with a deadly weapon. Thus, the court did not err in denying the defendants motion to dismiss the charge of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant also argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the second-degree kidnaping charges arising from the events of 18 November (03 CRS 071958) and 25 December 2002 (03 CRS 071959).

See G.S. \u00a7 14-39(a).\") Again defendant argues that the only evidence on this point was in the prior inconsistent statements of Hunt, which were not substantive evidence. However, staff from High Point Regional Hospital testified that defendant restrained Hunt by refusing to allow her to seek medical treatment for a broken arm on or around 18 November 2002. Officer Petteway also testified that on 26 December 2002 Hunt told him that the defendant had been holding her against her will for days and would not let her contact her family.

This is precisely the same scenario found in\n   <em>\n    Ezell.\n   </em>\n   As for 6 November 2002, defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury under N.C.
