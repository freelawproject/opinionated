Defendants appeal from the trial court's order granting a permanent injunction prohibiting defendants' operation of the racetrack. Because we hold that the trial court's order failed to make sufficient findings of fact to support its conclusion that the track was a nuisance\n   <em>\n    per accidens,\n   </em>\n   we reverse and remand for additional findings of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court made the following findings of fact that have not been challenged on appeal. The parties to this action all live on multiple-acre tracts of land in an unzoned rural area in Chatham County. As of 2001, each of the plaintiffs had lived in their homes for at least nine years. They were attracted to the area because of the relative peace and quiet, seclusion, and isolation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants' son rode ATVs in the area for a number of years and, in approximately 1998, began competing in ATV races. At the time of the trial, he had become a professional ATV racer. In late 2001, defendants constructed a dirt racetrack on their property. The track, which took up approximately three cleared acres of defendants' property, had both an outer loop and an inner loop, with the outer loop measuring approximately 1/5 to 1/4 of a mile in distance. In November 2001, defendants also obtained a building permit to construct a 16 by 20 foot building with restrooms next to the track. The permit was for a business with an \"open air arena\" for up to 50 spectators, with parking for up to 50 vehicles. Only the foundation for the building had been built at the time of trial and defendants indicated that they had abandoned the building project. The permits, however, remain in effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although the track had not been fully completed, defendants began to run ATVs on the track in early December 2001. Plaintiffs filed suit on 5 November 2002, alleging claims for nuisance and trespass and seeking an injunction against use of the racetrack. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction on 26 January 2003, pending resolution of the lawsuit. On 22 December 2003, following a bench trial, the trial court entered a final judgment concluding \"that the Defendant[s'] use of the Track and operation of ATVs and testing of ATVs... on the Track constitutes a private nuisance per accidens in fact.\" The court further concluded \"that the only reasonable and sure means for eliminating the nuisance caused by use of the Track\n   is to ban its use entirely by any ATV vehicle, whether 2 wheel, 3 wheel, or 4 wheel.\" The court, therefore, entered a permanent injunction barring defendants from operating or allowing others to operate any ATV on the track or from constructing a new track or similar facility on their property. Defendants have appealed from the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"`It is well settled in this jurisdiction that when the trial court sits without a jury, the standard of review on appeal is whether there was competent evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact and whether its conclusions of law were proper in light of such facts.'\"\n   <em>\n    Keel v.

The law does not concern itself with trifles. Practically all human activities, unless carried on in a wilderness, interfere to some extent with others or involve some risk of interference, and these interferences range from mere trifling annoyances to serious harms. Each individual in a community must put up with a certain amount of annoyance, inconvenience or interference, and must take a certain amount of risk in order that all may get on together. But if one makes an unreasonable use of his property and thereby causes another substantial harm in the use and enjoyment of his, the former is liable for the injury inflicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 619,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=124%20S.E.2d%20809\">\n    124 S.E.2d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants do not dispute that the trial court made the necessary findings of fact, but contend that those findings are not supported by competent evidence. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs' testimony and exhibits provide ample support for the trial court's findings of fact. Defendants, however, contend that the findings are unsupported because of the lack of any \"objective measurement of the sound generated by ATVs operating on the track,\" the failure of plaintiffs to offer testimony from disinterested or impartial witnesses, and defendants' characterization of plaintiffs' testimony as exaggerated. These factors all relate to the credibility and weight to be afforded the testimony. Such questions must be resolved by the trial court and are not a basis for overturning a finding of fact.\n   <em>\n    Cartin v.
