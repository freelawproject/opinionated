For the reasons discussed herein,\n   we hold that both defendants received a trial free of prejudicial error, but we vacate the trial court's imposition of attorney's fees upon Jacobs and remand his case for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State's evidence presented at trial tends to show the following: In the early morning hours of 30 July 2002, defendants, William Robert Parker (\"Parker\"), Sharrone Brayboy (\"Brayboy\"), and George Allen Locklear (\"Locklear\") drove to a residence in Shannon, North Carolina, owned by Lee Otis Chavis (\"Mr. Chavis\"). At approximately 1:00 or 1:30 a.m., Mr. Chavis heard a knock at the front door of his residence. When Mr. Chavis opened the door, Parker and Brayboy were standing on the front steps. Parker and Brayboy were dressed in \"real thin blazers\" that had the letters \"DEA\" on them, and they both had a \"badge\" on their belts \"like a detective would wear it.\" Parker and Brayboy informed Mr. Chavis that they were looking for him. Mr. Chavis noticed that Parker was holding a \"chrome looking\" handgun in his hand. After Mr. Chavis asked to \"see the warrant[,]\" Brayboy, who was holding a double-barreled shotgun, told Mr. Chavis that if he did not open the door, he would be shot. Parker and Brayboy thereafter entered Mr. Chavis' residence, forced him to the floor of the living room, and bound his hands behind his back with plastic handcuffs. Parker and Brayboy then attempted to subdue Goldie Chavis (\"Mrs. Chavis\"), Mr. Chavis' wife. Mr. Chavis convinced Parker and Brayboy to allow Mrs. Chavis to use the restroom. Mrs. Chavis thereafter went to her bedroom in an effort to change clothes. After she changed her clothes, Parker and Brayboy bound Mrs. Chavis' hands behind her back and brought her to the living room. Mr. Chavis heard Parker and Brayboy searching the rooms of his residence, and he heard Brayboy \"yank[] out all the drawers and all the dressers[.]\" Eventually, Parker and Brayboy encountered Mr. Chavis' son, Benson Chavis (\"Benson\"), in a back bedroom of the residence. Parker and Brayboy bound Benson's hands behind his back and brought him into the living room as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As Parker and Brayboy were \"tearing up everything in the bedroom[,]\" McMillian entered the residence. Parker and Brayboy called McMillian \"Sarge,\" and they informed the Chavises that \"they were going to need to talk to him to see what they were going to do\" and that \"there w[ere] some more guys across the road raiding a house[.]\" Parker, Brayboy, and McMillian thereafter left the Chavis residence. After the three men left the area, Benson freed himself from his handcuffs and cut Mr. and Mrs. Chavis' handcuffs. Following a search of their residence, the Chavises determined that the three men had taken several firearms and approximately $1,700.00 in cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After leaving the Chavis residence, Parker, Brayboy, and McMillian joined Jacobs and Locklear, who were waiting outside the residence. The five men left in two vehicles, one of which was an older model Chevrolet Caprice that had been used by the Robeson County Sheriff's Department. At a subsequent meeting at Locklear's residence, the five men divided Mr. Chavis' firearms and cash, as well as crystal methamphetamine taken from the Chavis residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Robeson County Sheriff's Department Detective Reggie Strickland (\"Detective Strickland\") was dispatched to the Chavis residence to investigate the incident. The Chavises informed Detective Strickland that their assailants had fled in \"a brown-ish, burgundy-ish or older model patrol car[.]\" After conversing with several other law enforcement officers, Detective Strickland determined that Brayboy was involved in the incident. Brayboy was arrested on 6 August 2002 and interviewed by Detective Strickland. Following the interview, Detective Strickland arrested Parker at Locklear's residence in Maxton, North Carolina. Statements made by Parker during his interview led Detective Strickland to arrest Jacobs on 8 August 2002. At the time of his arrest, Jacobs was in police custody on another charge. McMillian thereafter contacted law enforcement officials and turned himself in on 12 August 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 4 November 2002, defendants were indicted separately for first-degree burglary, robbery with a dangerous weapon, impersonating a law enforcement officer, and three counts of second-degree kidnapping. Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   cases were thereafter joined, and their case proceeded to trial the week of 22 September 2003. Following the close of the State's evidence, the trial court dismissed both charges of second-degree kidnapping of Benson. On 29 September 2003, the jury found both defendants guilty of first-degree burglary, robbery with a dangerous weapon, impersonating a law enforcement officer, second-degree kidnapping of Mr. Chavis, and second-degree kidnapping of Mrs. Chavis. After making findings of fact in aggravation and mitigation and determining that he had a prior felony record level II, the trial court sentenced Jacobs to a total of 131 to 176 months imprisonment. After making findings of fact in aggravation and mitigation and determining that he had a prior felony record level III, the trial court sentenced McMillian to a total of 109 to 150 months imprisonment. Defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although they submitted a joint record on appeal, defendants filed separate briefs with this Court. We note initially that neither defendant provided argument in his brief for all of his original assignments of error. Pursuant to N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6) (2005), the omitted assignments of error are deemed abandoned. Therefore, we limit our present review to those assignments of error properly preserved by defendants for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jacobs' Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The issues in Jacobs' appeal are whether the trial court erred by: (I) denying his motion to suppress his custodial statement; (II) admitting evidence of his prior bad acts; (III) admitting evidence of Parker and Brayboy's prior inconsistent statements; (IV) limiting the cross-examination of a State's witness; (V) admitting McMillian's statement into evidence; (VI) sentencing him in the aggravated range; and (VII) imposing attorney's fees upon him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    I.

N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-977(f) (2003) requires the trial court to \"set forth in the record [the] findings of fact and conclusions of law\" supporting its determination. In the instant case, the record indicates that although the trial court failed to make any written findings and conclusions to support its denial of Jacobs' motion to suppress, the trial court did provide rationale from the bench. Our Supreme Court has previously stated that \"[i]f there is no material conflict in the evidence on voir dire, it is not error to admit the challenged evidence without making specific findings of fact. . . . In that event, the necessary findings are implied from the admission of the challenged evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Phillips,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8564413\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/300/678/#p685\">\n    300 N.C. 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=268%20S.E.2d%20452\">\n    268 S.E.2d 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457 (1980) (citations omitted). As there is no material conflict in the evidence of this case, we conclude that the trial court did not err by failing to make written findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Prior to trial, Jacobs filed a motion to suppress his custodial statement to Detective Strickland, arguing that he had \"asserted his right to counsel prior to the interrogation\" by Detective Strickland on 8 August 2002. At the suppression hearing, defense counsel questioned Robeson County Sheriff's Department Lieutenant James Carter (\"Lieutenant Carter\") regarding a\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   waiver form signed by Jacobs on 6 August 2002. Lieutenant Carter testified that Jacobs was taken into custody on that date for the alleged armed robbery of another individual, James Morgan (\"Morgan\"). Lieutenant Carter testified that after he read the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to him, Jacobs \"signed [the wavier form], and that was the end of it.\" Lieutenant Carter elaborated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. He wouldn't give you a statement?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A. That was the end of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. Did you ask him to make a statement?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Yes, sir, I did, and he didn't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Q. He didn't.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   A. That was the end of that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Q. Now, did you ever question him again after that questioning?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A. No, sir.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further testimony from the suppression hearing revealed that although Lieutenant Carter did not thereafter question Jacobs regarding the Morgan incident, Detective Strickland did question him regarding the Chavis incident. On cross-examination, Detective Strickland testified that when he questioned Jacobs on 8 August 2002, he was not aware that Jacobs had an attorney appointed to represent him regarding the Morgan incident, but that he \"knew [Jacobs] was in jail on other charges not related to\" the armed robbery of the Chavises. Detective Strickland acknowledged that he initiated the questioning of Jacobs on 8 August 2002, and he testified that Jacobs willingly waived his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights and confessed to the Chavis incident while in custody for the Morgan incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We recognize that the waiver form signed by Jacobs on 6 August 2002 indicated that he was \"willing to make a statement and answer questions\" and that he \"d[id] not want a lawyer at th[at] time.\" However, we also recognize that \"a criminal defendant who has been advised of and has waived his [Fifth Amendment] rights has the right to terminate a custodial interrogation by indicating `in any manner, [and] at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we conclude that by refusing to offer a statement to Lieutenant Carter on 6 August 2002, Jacobs invoked his Fifth Amendment rights to avoid custodial interrogation regarding the Morgan incident, notwithstanding his prior waiver of that right. However, we are not convinced that Jacobs' invocation of his rights to avoid custodial interrogation regarding the Morgan incident impacted Detective Strickland's subsequent interrogation regarding the Chavis incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While the immediate effect of a defendant's invocation of his or her Fifth Amendment rights is the same regardless of which right is invoked in particular,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., Murphy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"796045\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/342/813/#p823\">\n    342 N.C. at 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=467%20S.E.2d%20428\">\n    467 S.E.2d at 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that interrogation must immediately cease upon invocation of right to remain silent) and\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that the confession arising from the second interrogation was admissible during the defendant's murder trial because law enforcement officials had \"scrupulously honored\" the defendant's right to \"cut off questioning\" regarding the robberies.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175104\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/423/96/#p104\">\n    423 U.S. at 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175104\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/423/96/#p104\">\n    96 S.Ct. at 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6175104\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/423/96/#p104\">\n    46 L.Ed.2d at 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As detailed above, Lieutenant Carter testified that \"[t]hat was the end of that\" when Jacobs refused to make a statement regarding the Morgan incident, and that he did not thereafter question Jacobs regarding the charges. Detective Strickland testified that he questioned Jacobs regarding the Chavis incident on 8 August 2002, approximately two days after Jacobs was questioned regarding the Morgan incident. Detective Strickland testified further that he issued fresh\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings to Jacobs prior to questioning him regarding the Chavis incident. There is no indication that the second interrogation focused on the Morgan incident, which, although similar in nature to the Chavis incident, is nevertheless different \"in time and place of occurrence\" and not so like the Chavis incident as to outweigh the other factors suggesting that law enforcement officials \"scrupulously honored\" Jacobs' Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. Therefore, in light of the foregoing, we conclude that the second interrogation of Jacobs was not unconstitutional under the facts of this case, and the trial court did not err by admitting the statement obtained by law enforcement officials during the interrogation.

These charges arose from Jacobs' alleged involvement in a scheme whereby individuals would dress and act like law enforcement officials in an effort to obtain property from others. At trial, the State offered evidence tending to show that two days after the incident involving the Chavises, Jacobs and Brayboy went to Morgan's residence dressed as law enforcement officers, presented Morgan with a pink slip of paper, and informed Morgan that they had \"a search warrant to search the house.\" Morgan testified that Jacobs and Brayboy \"had on black fatigues[,]\" that \"[o]ne of them had on a sheriff's T-shirt[,]\" and that \"[t]he other one had just regular police right across the front of [his shirt] and had on boots.\" Morgan further testified that \"[o]ne of them had a 12-gauge,\" and that \"[t]he other had a .45.\" Morgan recalled being bound by plastic handcuffs and placed on the floor of the kitchen while Jacobs and Brayboy took property from his residence, and he remembered Jacobs and Brayboy stating that they were \"carrying [the property] outside to run it in, the numbers, [to] check and see if [it was] stolen or anything.\" Morgan stated that after they took property from his residence, Jacobs and Brayboy placed him in the back seat of an \"old brown police car[]\" and transported him to \"the woods\" in Maxton. Morgan recalled Jacobs and Brayboy thereafter removing his handcuffs, searching him again, and rebinding his hands together with duct tape. Morgan testified that Jacobs then ordered him to walk in front of the car, where Jacobs shot him in the feet with the shotgun. On appeal, Jacobs contends that \"[b]eyond the relevant evidence that they dressed as law enforcement officers and robbed [Morgan] at his home,\" the remaining evidence of the Morgan incident was prejudicial and thus should have been excluded.

The Morgan incident occurred two days after the incident involving the Chavises, and, as detailed above, it also involved the assailants' entry into the victim's residence under the auspices of legitimate law enforcement activity. The assailants in both the Morgan and Chavis incidents were dressed as law enforcement officers and displayed a \"search warrant\" as well as firearms in an effort to gain entry into the respective residences. Once inside, the assailants in both incidents bound their victims by using plastic handcuffs and\n   searched the residences for \"illegal\" items. At the conclusion of both incidents, the assailants left in what was consistently described as an older model law enforcement vehicle. The record reflects that the trial court was aware of the possible prejudice stemming from the dissimilarities of the incidents (including the fact that Morgan was shot), and it repeatedly instructed the jury regarding the limited purposes for which the evidence of the Morgan incident could be used. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not err by admitting evidence of the Morgan incident. Accordingly, Jacobs' second argument is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Jacobs next argues that the trial court erred by allowing the State to question Parker and Brayboy regarding their prior inconsistent statements.

Over Jacobs' objection, the trial court allowed Parker and Brayboy to review their statements and the State to impeach both witnesses by use of the statements.

While we note that the trial court has discretionary power regarding the limits of cross-examination aimed at impeaching a witness, we also note that \"[t]he discretionary power of the trial judge is to confine the cross-examination within reasonable limits.

Nevertheless, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the trial court erred by limiting Jacobs' cross-examination, we are not persuaded that Jacobs is entitled to a new trial. Morgan's testimony focused on his own kidnapping and robbery rather than those charges Jacobs faced at trial. Brayboy provided a similar account of the incident and detailed Jacobs' involvement in it during his testimony. Morgan's statement to Detective Carter was admitted into evidence along with his photographic identification of Brayboy and Jacobs. Defense counsel was allowed to question Morgan regarding his current incarceration, his conviction for possession of a firearm on educational property, his conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon, his conviction for driving after consuming an alcoholic beverage, his conviction for resisting a public officer, and his conviction for violating a domestic violence order. With respect to the plea transcript, although after examining the document the trial court concluded and instructed the jury that \"[t]here is nothing in those papers, in writing. . . . requiring James Morgan to testify in this case[,]\" the trial court instructed defense counsel that he was allowed to \"ask [Morgan] if he got some consideration for his testimony here today[.]\" In light of the foregoing, we conclude that Jacobs has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any error of the trial court. Accordingly, we overrule Jacobs' fourth argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Jacobs next argues that the trial court erred by allowing Detective Strickland to read McMillian's custodial statement to the jury. Jacobs asserts that the statement was not properly redacted prior to its introduction. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-927(c)(1) (2003) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   When a defendant objects to joinder of charges against two or more defendants for trial because an out-of-court statement of a codefendant makes reference to him but is not admissible against him, the court must require the prosecutor to select one of the following courses:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   a. A joint trial at which the statement is not admitted into evidence; or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   b. A joint trial at which the statement is admitted into evidence only after all references to the moving defendant have been effectively deleted so that the statement will not prejudice him; or\n   c. A separate trial of the objecting defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In the instant case, the State sought to introduce McMillian's statement at trial in an effort to demonstrate McMillian's role in the Chavis incident. Prior to the statement being read by Detective Strickland, the parties and the trial court had extensive discussions regarding what portions of McMillian's statements should be redacted. The State initially sought to replace the references to Jacobs with the word \"someone.\" However, after discussing the issue with defense counsel and the trial court, the State agreed to take out all references to Jacobs by name. Detective Strickland thereafter read McMillian's statement in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   I, Bruce Lee McMillian, want to make the following statement. On July the 29th, 2002, I got to the barn about 11:00 or 11:30 p.m. George Allen [Locklear] and myself rode to Jonesville and back around by Modes' old store. We followed Sharrone [Brayboy] and [William] Robert [Parker] because he did not have any turn signals on the old brown Caprice. I asked George where we were going, and he said, \"Just follow them. We're fixing to get one.\" . . . I said, \"What, you are not going to rob nobody, are you?\" George said, \"No, they are.\" We followed them what seemed like through half of Robeson County to get there. We turned around at a stop sign, and I knew where we were at. Then, I knew who they were going to rob. Sharrone and Robert pulled up in a man's yard. We went right past the house and parked on the dirt road where we could see the house. We probably sit on the dirt road about 5 minutes. We rode back to the stop sign and turned around. I stopped where they pulled out from. I got out of the car, walked to the house and told Sharrone, \"Let's go.\" I did not have no police shirt on. I did not have a gun or nothing. I walked back out of the house and got into the car and was still waiting on Sharrone. Sharrone finally came out of the house and got in the car, and we left. When we were going down the road, Sharrone pulled out a lot of money and some dope in a clear, plastic bag. I think it was crystal meth. We went back to the barn. . . . I left and went to the other house in Laur[i]nburg and got everybody some food. We all ate and went to bed. That was it on that one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On appeal, Jacobs contends that because \"the redacted statement used the pronoun `we' as a place holder for the defendant, the admission of the Statement violated [Jacobs'] Constitutional right to confront witnesses.\" We recognize that our courts have previously held that \"the introduction of a nontestifying defendant's confession that does not mention a codefendant could implicate the codefendant and violate [his rights] if it is clear that the confession is referring to the codefendant.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Cricket had been wanting to make a lick. The white boy, William Parker, said \"What about Lee Otis [Chavis], the man you know?\" I said, \"Who, Lee Otis?\" He said, \"Yes, the crank man.\" I told him them was old people; if anything went down, to be real gentle with him because he had by-pass surgery. The white boy said, \"Don't you know where everything is? Just tell me where it's at, and I will get it.\" He was talking about the money and the dope and scales. Monday night, George Allen [Locklear] came to the house and picked me up in a green Cavalier. When I got to the barn, the white boy and Sharrone were already dressed with police shirts. The white boy, William Parker, said, \"We are ready, but we don't know how to get there.\" I drove the brown Caprice . . . by the house and pointed it out to the white boy and Sharrone. George Allen were following us in a green Cavalier. The green one was sitting at the barn when they come and picked us up. We went on past the house to the stop sign. We went straight across for about 2 miles and pulled off the shoulder of the road. I got in the car with George Allen, and we rode back by the house and parked on the dirt road so we could watch Lee Otis' house. We had told them to turn the porch light off when everything was all right. We kept sitting and waiting and waiting, and they never came out. We pulled in front of the house and the white boy came out. I could hear Cricket telling someone that, \"Sharrone won't come out of the house.\" Someone went in the house and told Sharrone to, \"Let's go.\" We left the house and stopped about 4 or 5 miles down the road and put licensed drivers under the steering wheel. I got in the Caprice and started driving it. We went back to the barn. I don't want to go any further at this point due to the fact of being charged with conspiracy for being tied into this case. There was two or three of us that got licked because Sharrone . . . held out with the money or it was him or the white boy. Their figures did not add up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   On appeal, McMillian contends that the replacement of his name with the word \"someone\" implicated him in the incident and thus violated his Confrontation Clause rights.

The State presented overwhelming evidence to establish McMillian's guilt notwithstanding Jacobs' statement, including testimony from Mrs. Chavis and Brayboy which tended to show that McMillian entered the Chavis residence during the incident and was referred to by the name \"Sarge.\" As detailed above, McMillian's own statement to law enforcement officers describes his involvement in the incident, including his \"g[etting] out of the car, walk[ing] to the house and t[elling] Sharrone, `Let's go.'\" In light of the foregoing, we conclude that any error related to the introduction of Jacobs' statement was harmless.

However, after reviewing the record in its entirety, we are not convinced that the trial court abused its discretion by denying McMillian's motion to sever the trial. McMillian was not identified as a participant in any stage of the Morgan incident, and the trial court twice instructed the jury regarding the limited use of the evidence, including that it was limited to \"the defendant Curl[e]y Jacobs\" and \"received solely for the purpose of showing that he was aware - that is, he, Curl[e]y Jacobs - was aware of a common plan, scheme, or design involved in the charge or the crime in the present case. . . .\" \"If we were convinced that juries were unable to separately evaluate the guilt or innocence of defendants tried jointly because of a tendency to determine guilt by association at trial, we would never uphold joint trials of criminal defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

On remand, the trial court may engage in any proceedings necessary to comply with the instructions detailed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As to Jacob's Appeal: No error in part; vacated and remanded in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As to McMillian's Appeal: No error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Judge BRYANT concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Judge LEVINSON concurs in part and dissents in part.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-121\">\n   LEVINSON, Judge concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   I concur in the majority opinion except to the extent it vacates those portions of the judgments which purportedly impose attorney fees against Jacobs. The majority reasons that, because Jacobs did not have an opportunity to be heard concerning the number of attorney hours or the total fee, he is entitled to another hearing. This is, in my view, erroneous for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   First, there has been no appeal from, and the record is completely devoid of, any judgments or orders which require Jacobs to pay attorney fees. The criminal judgments on appeal only provide, \"[a] civil judgment is to be placed against defendant for attorney fees.\" As there is\n   <em>\n    nothing\n   </em>\n   in the record on appeal to suggest what, if anything, the court ever entered on attorney fees, there is likewise\n   <em>\n    nothing\n   </em>\n   for this Court to address. The majority opinion attempts to vacate, in part, an order that may never have been entered; may have actually been entered only after some subsequent notice and hearing; and may require defendant to pay $0. We cannot know because such an order is not before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Secondly, the trial court has only indicated its intention to enter a subsequent order. In this regard, the trial court did exactly that which our appellate precedent requires: it declined to enter a civil judgment against defendant for an amount certain\n   <em>\n    until some later time\n   </em>\n   when he would have an opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
