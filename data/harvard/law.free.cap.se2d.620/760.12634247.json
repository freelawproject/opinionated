Lambert, III's supervisor instructed him to patrol a particular block of Lakeview Avenue in Richmond, Virginia, because of several recent shootings and a homicide in the area. One morning while patrolling the area, Officer Lambert observed a red automobile parked in an alley in a manner that would not allow a wide emergency vehicle to pass through the alley. Officer Lambert got out of his patrol car and, as he approached the vehicle, four men standing nearby quickly walked away in different directions. When he reached the red car, Officer Lambert saw the defendant, Tavares Lamont Brown, asleep in the passenger seat holding a partially-burned, hand-rolled cigarette in one hand and a lighter in the other. Officer Lambert woke Brown up, took the items out of his hands, and asked him to step out of the vehicle. The record does not reflect Officer Lambert observed any drug related items in the vehicle or around Brown. Further, Officer Lambert testified that he later smelled the cigarette and \"did not believe it to be marijuana\" because \"it smelled like tobacco.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A subsequent search of Brown's pockets produced a folded $5.00 bill. Laboratory tests showed that the hand-rolled cigarette and the folded money contained traces of cocaine and heroin, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brown was charged with possession of cocaine and possession of heroin, violations of Code \u00a7 18.2-250. He filed a motion to suppress the evidence arguing that it \"was obtained during a warrantless and unlawful search.\" At the suppression hearing, Officer Lambert testified that Brown was seized \"when [Officer Lambert] approached the vehicle and saw the hand[-]rolled item in his hand.\" Officer Lambert further testified that, based on his 19 years of law enforcement experience during which he saw over 100 hand-rolled cigarettes each containing a controlled substance, he \"knew\" Brown's hand-rolled cigarette contained a controlled substance. On cross-examination, Officer Lambert agreed that some people roll their own tobacco cigarettes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, the trial court denied Brown's motion to suppress, finding Officer Lambert had probable cause to search Brown:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In looking at the totality of the circumstances and looking at the car blocking an alley, four males standing near the car and then dispersing when the police officer shows up, the fact that this gentleman is sound asleep in the car at 7:30 a.m. in the morning, the fact that this officer testified that the smoking item in his experience of more than hundreds of times he's encountered the situation it has never contained just tobacco, his strong belief about the fact that it contained an illegal substance, I believe he had probable cause to arrest this individual and any search subsequent to that arrest was legal and valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a bench trial, the trial court found Brown guilty on both charges and sentenced him to a total of 20 years imprisonment with 16 years and 6 months suspended. The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Brown then appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Brown argues here, as he did in the trial court and Court of Appeals, that Officer Lambert did not have probable cause to arrest him and, therefore, the evidence of cocaine and heroin should have been suppressed as the fruit of an unconstitutional search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution safeguards the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.\n   <em>\n    Camara v.

Thus, the circumstances relevant to the probable cause determination are the position of the red car in an alley in an area Officer Lambert had been instructed to patrol, the dispersal of four men when Officer Lambert approached the red car, finding of Brown asleep in the car at 7:30 a.m. with a partially-burned, hand-rolled cigarette in his hand, and the strong belief of Officer Lambert that the hand-rolled cigarette contained a controlled substance based on his prior experience with hand-rolled cigarettes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The red car's position and the dispersal of the four men could indicate criminal activity under some circumstances; however, here, the basis for such indication could no longer be supported when Officer Lambert found Brown asleep in the car. Brown was not engaged in any activity implicating the position of the car or the other men. The Court of Appeals also referred to the area as a \"high crime\" area, but this characterization and the directive to patrol the area were based on a recent history of violent crimes and, again, provided no support to the proposition that the sleeping Brown was engaged in such activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Officer Lambert's experience with controlled substances and his observation of a hand-rolled cigarette in Brown's hand undoubtedly\n   support Officer Lambert's suspicion that Brown may have been engaged in criminal activity. We have considered a number of instances in which an officer's expertise and training made his observation of an item suspected to contain contraband a significant factor in the probable cause analysis. In none of these cases, however, has that fact alone supported a finding of probable cause when the suspicious item is also capable of legitimate use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Matthews v.

We observed that although in the officer's experience people kept drugs in film canisters, law-abiding citizens used film canisters for legitimate purposes, and we concluded that no probable cause existed because the only other evidence to support a finding of probable cause in that case was a report from an informant who was not shown to be reliable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=400%20S.E.2d%20191\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We have found that the requisite probable cause for a warrantless search of a vehicle existed based on the police officer's belief that a hand-rolled cigarette held by a passenger contained marijuana combined with the passenger's actions in attempting to hide or get rid of the hand-rolled cigarette.\n   <em>\n    Hollis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2124917\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/va/216/874/#p877\">\n    216 Va. at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=223%20S.E.2d%20887\">\n    223 S.E.2d at 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
