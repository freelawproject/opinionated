For the reasons stated within, we reverse the trial court's award of attorneys' fees and costs to plaintiffs pursuant to Rule 37 and award of certain costs pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 6-20, and affirm as to all other issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence presented tended to show that on 6 November 1999, Ray Allen Oakes (\"Oakes\") was descending the exit ramp from Interstate 85 (\"I-85\") to South Main Street in Graham, North Carolina. Oakes entered the intersection on a green light, attempting to turn north. Wooten, traveling south on South Main Street, failed to stop for the red light at the I-85/Main Street intersection and collided with Oakes's vehicle. Wooten stated that she had looked down and did not realize the light was red until shortly before she reached the intersection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Oakes was injured in the collision and was taken to Alamance Regional Medical Center for treatment. He underwent various treatments for back injuries over the next year, culminating in surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Oakes brought a negligence action against Wooten and her husband, the owner of the car, in January 2002. Oakes's wife, Wendy Oakes (\"Wendy\") (collectively \"plaintiffs\"), also joined as a plaintiff in an action for loss of consortium. The jury found defendants negligent and awarded Oakes $119,000.00 in damages, but did not award consortium damages to Wendy. Defendants' motion for a new trial was denied, and plaintiffs were awarded costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7A-314, 6-20, and 1A-1, Rules 36 and 37(c).

Oakes's brother, Lynn Oakes (\"Lynn\"), a passenger in the vehicle, also testified that the light was green when Oakes entered the intersection. Lynn stated that he saw Wooten's vehicle on his blind side after they had entered the intersection, and began to call out a warning to \"[w]atch out[,]\" but was unable to complete the warning because Wooten had already struck Oakes. Wooten testified that she was driving at approximately twenty-five miles per hour, that her attention was drawn away from the road and that when she looked again at the light, it was red. Wooten further testified that prior to the collision, no part of her vehicle crossed the stop line, and that only the front end of her car crossed the stop line into the intersection when she came into contact with Oakes's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When taken in the light most favorable to defendants, the evidence fails to show that anything would have put Oakes on notice that Wooten would not obey the traffic light in time to avoid the collision. As in\n   <em>\n    Cicogna,\n   </em>\n   Oakes testified that he surveyed the intersection and did not see Wooten. Wooten testified that she was not traveling at a high rate of speed and did not cross the stop line until Oakes had already turned in front of her. Lynn testified that he attempted to shout a warning but was unable to complete it before the impact. Even when viewed in the light most favorable to defendants, there is no evidence that Oakes failed to keep a proper lookout and exercise reasonable care in entering the intersection. Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We next address defendants' related contention that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict as to contributory negligence. \"The standard of review of directed verdict is whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, is sufficient as a matter of law to be submitted to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Di Frega v.

These included Wooten's failure to admit her violation of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-158(b)(2), failure to keep a proper lookout, failure to use due care, and failure to maintain proper control. The Order also listed Wooten's failure to admit full fault for the collision, lack of contributory negligence, that Wooten was acting as an agent for her husband, and that serious injury occurred to Oakes as a result of the accident. The Order finally listed Wooten's denial that she was the sole proximate cause of Oakes's herniated disc at L4-5 and neurological symptoms, the exact amount of Oakes's medical bills, and that Oakes had suffered a permanent diminution of wage-earning capacity. Following the list of denied admissions, the Order contained a detailed list of the expenses incurred in establishing the matters denied. The trial judge found no reasonable grounds for defendants to deny the matters set forth in the Request for Admissions and granted plaintiffs' motion for attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   A review of the record shows that defendants made a number of qualified responses to plaintiffs' Requests for Admissions on 14 May 2002, prior to any discovery or depositions by either party, and before medical care providers and treating physicians were identified by plaintiffs in this matter. A review of the qualified responses in Wooten's Answer to Request for Admissions shows that Wooten admitted that she was the wife of Steven, and that she was driving a car registered to him with his permission. Wooten also stated in response to the request regarding the seriousness of Oakes's injury that Oakes had told her at the scene of the accident that he was not seriously hurt. Wooten denied the question regarding the specifics as to Oakes's medical conditions on the grounds that she had no medical training. Finally, Wooten stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [A]s I approached the intersection and went under the bridge and last checked the light it was green and then I believe I looked down to my radio although I am not certain for a few seconds and when I looked back up near the intersection, the light had turned red. I applied my brakes as hard as possible and attempted to stop prior to reaching the crossing of the intersection although I was unable to stop completely and I slid somewhat out into the intersection and contact was made with Mr. Oakes' vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   At the time the responses were made, when discovery had not yet begun, Wooten lacked knowledge to admit matters regarding Oakes's medical condition and contributory negligence. Wooten's qualified denial as to her actions in failing to stop for the light was consistent with the evidence presented at trial and the trial court's findings of proof as to defendant's negligence. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   our statutes state that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   No failure to stop as required by the provisions of [\u00a7 20-158(d)] shall be considered negligence or contributory negligence per se in any action at law for injury to person or property, but the facts relating to such failure to stop may be considered with the other facts in the case in determining whether a party was guilty of negligence or contributory negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-158(d) (2003). As a violation of the statute is not negligence\n   <em>\n    per se,\n   </em>\n   defendant had reasonable grounds to believe she might prevail in the negligence actions, based on her qualified denials. Defendants, therefore, met their burden of proof in showing that at the time for request of admission, reasonable grounds existed to believe that they might prevail on some matters denied, and good reasons, i.e. defendants' lack of knowledge, existed for the failure to admit other issues at that time. Accordingly, we find the trial judge abused her discretion in awarding plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule\n   37(c). We, therefore, do not address defendants' related assignment of error that the trial court erred in its findings as to expert witness testimony concerning causation in awarding Rule 37 damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In their next assignment of error, defendants contend that the trial court committed reversible error in taxing certain costs against defendants pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 6-20 and 7A-305.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 6-20, we reverse those awards of attorneys' fees and costs to plaintiffs, and remand for entry of a new order as to costs consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Judges McCULLOUGH and LEVINSON concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
