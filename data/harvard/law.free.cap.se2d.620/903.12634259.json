We find no error in part, and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The evidence presented at trial may be summarized as follows: On the morning of 14 November 2000, Tammy Cush was discovered dead in her apartment. Her husband returned home and found his wife's naked body lying in their bedroom. She had two stab wounds to the neck which, according to expert testimony, caused her death. A jar of coins was spilled on the living room floor. Silver coins from this jar were missing, as were the Play Station and VCR. Mrs. Cush's purse had been emptied of the money inside, and food was strewn on the kitchen floor. A trail of vegetables led towards defendant's apartment. The victim's VCR and Play Station were found in defendant's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to police questioning the next day, defendant admitted having entered the victim's home on the evening of 13 November 2000. He stated he had seen Mrs. Cush lying naked in the bedroom with a hole in her neck trying to breathe. Defendant contended that he slipped in a pool of warm blood, vomited in the toilet, took the VCR and Play Station, and returned to his apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ronald Pritt testified that defendant told him he killed the victim. Pritt was incarcerated in jail at the same time defendant was incarcerated at the Catawba County jail. Defendant told Pritt that, on the night of the murder, he went to Mrs. Cush's apartment intending to kill her husband. Mrs. Cush backed out of \"the plotting and planning to kill her husband\", and defendant returned to his apartment. Later, defendant explained, he \"forgot something\" and returned to Mrs. Cush's apartment with a pair of scissors. When he walked in the door, Mrs. Cush had \"started yelling at him, throwing her - all wild, and he blanked out and when he came back to, he had blood all over him. She was laying on the floor.\" Defendant told Pritt he had asked \"the Gideons\" who visited the prisoners in jail to pray that Mrs. Cush's killer would be found because it would \"throw the officers off, saying he didn't do it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Robert Howie testified that defendant told him he had killed his girlfriend. Howie was incarcerated in jail at the same time defendant was incarcerated at the Catawba County jail. Defendant said his girlfriend \"had broke[n] up with him and he wanted to have sex with her one more time.\" When she refused to have intercourse with him, \"[h]e lost it and stabbed her in the neck, turned her over, and had sex with her.\" Defendant also told Howie he had spilled a jar of coins in the victim's apartment and had gone through the coins looking for money to buy beer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant presented no evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After denying defendant's request to submit second degree murder to the jury, the court instructed the jury on first degree murder on the theories of malice, premeditation and deliberation and the felony murder rule. In addition, the court instructed the jury on robbery with a dangerous weapon and the lesser-included offense of larceny. The jury convicted defendant of first degree\n   murder based upon both theories, and robbery with a dangerous weapon. For first degree murder, defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole; for the armed robbery, defendant was sentenced to 77-102 months imprisonment. From these convictions and judgments, defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant first argues the trial court committed plain error by eliminating the option of not guilty of first degree murder in its final mandate to the jury and, in a related argument, by omitting the option of not guilty of first degree murder on the verdict sheet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues these omissions so tainted the proceedings against him that a new trial on the first degree murder charge is required. After very careful review, we are compelled to agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The underlined portions of the following instructions given by the trial court play a significant role in our evaluation of this assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Defendant has entered pleas of not guilty as to each charge. The fact that he has been charged is no evidence of guilt. Under our system of justice when a Defendant pleads not guilty, he is not required to prove his innocence.

Under the first degree felony murder rule?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   ANSWER:\n   <em>\n    yes\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We conclude the trial court's failure to provide a not guilty final mandate constituted error, and next turn to whether this error constitutes plain error, requiring a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We first consider the jury instructions on murder in their entirety in determining whether the failure to provide a not guilty mandate constitutes plain error. The trial court judge correctly instructed the jury that if it did not find the requisite malice, premeditation and deliberation, it \"would not return a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder on the basis of malice, premeditation, and deliberation\" and must then consider whether the killing was done consistent with the requirements of the felony murder rule. Likewise, the concluding portion of the jury instruction on felony murder mirrored the one concerning malice, premeditation and deliberation in that it stated that the jury \"[would] not return a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder under the felony murder rule[]\" if the State failed in one or more of the elements of felony murder. The instruction, then, in the absence of a final not guilty mandate, essentially pitted one theory of first degree murder against the other, and\n   <em>\n    impermissibly suggested\n   </em>\n   that the jury should find that the killing was perpetrated by defendant on the basis of at least one of the theories. Telling the jury \"not [to] return a verdict of guilty\" as to each theory of first degree murder does not comport with the necessity of instructing the jury that it\n   <em>\n    must or would\n   </em>\n   return a verdict of not guilty should they completely reject the conclusion that defendant committed first degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Secondly, we consider the content and form of the first degree murder verdict sheet in determining whether the failure to provide a not guilty mandate constitutes plain error. Here, the trial court initially informed the jury that it was their \"duty to return one of the following verdicts: guilty of first-degree murder or not guilty.\" However, the verdict sheet itself did not provide a space or option of \"not guilty.\" And while the content and form of the verdict sheet did not compel the jury to return a verdict of guilty insofar as it stated \"if\" it found defendant guilty of first degree murder, we repeat our observation that it failed to afford exactly that which the court initially informed the jury it would be authorized to return - a not guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thirdly, we consider the instructions and verdict sheet for the armed robbery/larceny offenses in determining whether the failure to provide a not guilty final mandate for the murder charge constitutes plain error. As to these taking offenses, the trial court judge\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   provide a not guilty mandate. After instructing the jury that it must consider the offense of larceny should they reject the armed robbery, the court properly charged the jury, \"If you do not so find or if you have a reasonable doubt as to one or more of these things, it would be your duty to return a verdict of not guilty as to that charge.\" Rather than help correct the failure to provide a similar not guilty mandate with respect to the first degree murder charge, the presence of a not guilty final mandate as to the taking offenses likely\n   <em>\n    reinforced\n   </em>\n   the suggestion that the jury should return a verdict of first degree murder based upon premeditation and deliberation and/or felony murder. Likewise, the content and form of the verdict sheet on the taking offenses, which\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   afford a space for a not guilty verdict, also likely\n   <em>\n    reinforced\n   </em>\n   the suggestion that defendant must have been guilty of first degree murder on some basis:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   We the jury unanimously find the Defendant, Michael Lane McHone:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2713 Guilty of Robbery with a Dangerous Weapon\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   ___ Guilty of Larceny\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   or\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   ___ Not Guilty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Our review of binding precedent suggests that, even where the trial court has given instructions on,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   burden of proof, presumption of innocence, and/or provided some qualifying remarks such as \"\n   <strong>\n    if\n   </strong>\n   the State has proven the elements you should return a verdict of guilty\", a new trial has been awarded for the failure to provide a not guilty final mandate.\n   <em>\n    See Ward,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8559928\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/300/150/\">\n    300 N.C. at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=266%20S.E.2d%20581\">\n    266 S.E.2d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ramey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8575192\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/273/325/#p329\">\n    273 N.C. at 327-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20S.E.2d%2056\">\n    160 S.E.2d at 58-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Overman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8568554\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/257/464/#p468\">\n    257 N.C. at 467-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20S.E.2d%20920\">\n    125 S.E.2d at 923-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the fact the trial court judge provided similar instructions here does not necessarily foreclose the necessity of a new trial. And, as our Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Ramey\n   </em>\n   informs, \"the fact there was plenary evidence upon which the jury [might return a verdict of guilty]\" does not remedy the failure to provide a not guilty mandate.\n   <em>\n    Ramey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8575192\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/273/325/#p329\">\n    273 N.C. at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20S.E.2d%2056\">\n    160 S.E.2d at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   We recognize that the jury could not have genuinely misunderstood its role in passing on the guilt or innocence of defendant. Even so, the trial court's inadvertent omission tipped the scales of justice in favor of conviction and\n   <em>\n    impermissibly suggested\n   </em>\n   that the defendant must have been guilty of first degree murder on some basis. We conclude that the jury instructions on first degree murder, considered in context and in their entirety, amount to plain error. This conclusion is based not only on the importance of the jury receiving a not guilty mandate from the presiding judge, but also on the form and content of the particular verdict sheets utilized in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant next argues that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the armed robbery charge against him due to insufficiency of the evidence.
