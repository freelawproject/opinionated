The limitation in section 5 of the Judiciary Act, restricting the Sunday jurisdiction of magistrates to the arrest, committal or discharge of a person charged with an offense \u201cin a criminal case\u201d does not apply, because this is not a \u201c criminal case \u201d within the purview of that statute.</headnotes>\n<history data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b320-10\">People ex rel.

(L. 1895, ch. 601, \u00a7 5; L. 1901, ch. 466, \u00a7 1398; L. 1910, ch. 659, \u00a7 71.) The present law is very broad. The magistrate has full jurisdiction \u201c to preserve the peace \u201d on Sunday; and this power is entirely independent of his power to \u201ccommit or discharge\u201d in criminal cases.' (2 R. S. 275, \u00a7 7.) The disorderly conduct sections of the act under which this Burke woman was committed created no crime, but were mere regulations to preserve the public peace. This is true of all of the well known petty offenses of which the magistrates have jurisdiction to make final disposition. (Steinert v. Sobey, 14 App. Div. 505; Matter of Erbe, 13 Misc. Rep. 404; Neuendorff v. Duryea, 69 N. Y. 557; 6 Daly, 276; Lindenmuller v. People, 33 Barb. 548; People v. Hogan, 20 How. Pr. 76.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b321-5\">Werner, J. :</author>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The relator was imprisoned under a commitment which recited that she had been found guilty of disorderly conduct which, in the opinion of the magistrate, tended to a breach of the peace. She was arrested in New York city on Sunday,' Eebr\u00faary 25th, 1912, taken directly before a city magistrate, where she pleaded not guilty and was summarily convicted and sentenced. By her petition for a wri of habeas corpus she challenges the legality of her conviction on the ground that the magistrate had no power to hear, try and determine her case on Sunday. At Special Term the writ was dismissed and the relator remanded. At the Appellate Division the order was unanimously affirmed, whereupon the relator ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>pealed to this court. If it were not for conflicting decisions in similar cases by the Appellate Divisions of the first and second departments (People ex rel. Price v. Warden, etc., 73 App. Div. 174; People ex rel. Ryan v. Supt. State Reformatory at Bedford, 149 App. Div. 749), we should be content to affirm the order herein upon the opinion below, but in view of this conflict of decisions we deem it proper to briefly state our views upon the question involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\">The relator relies upon the decision of the Appellate Division in the second department in the case of People ex rel. Ryan v. Supt. State Reformatory at Bedford (supra), where the conclusion was reached that the city magistrates of Hew York city have no authority to hold court on Sundays except for the limited purposes specified in section 5 of the Judiciary Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 30). That section provides that <em>\u201cA </em>court shall not be opened, or transact any business on Sunday, except to receive a verdict or discharge a jury. An adjournment of a court on Saturday, unless made after a cause has been committed to a jury, must be to some other day than Sunday. But this section does not prevent the exercise of the jurisdiction of a magistrate, where it is necessary to preserve the peace, or, in a criminal case, to arrest, commit or discharge a person charged with an offense.\u201d The last sentence of this section is obviously the only one which applies to magistrates and, as to-them, it imposes the duty to exercise jurisdiction on Sunday <em>\u201c where it is necessary to preserve the peace, or, in a criminal case, to arrest, commit or discharge a person charged with an </em>offense.\" Upon the meagre record before us we think this statute in itself is broad enough to confer the jurisdiction which was exercised, for the commitment recites that the relator was found guilty of disorderly conduct which tended to a breach of the peace,. and the statute declares that a magistrate may exercise jurisdiction on Sunday <em>\u201c </em>where it is necessary to preserve the peace.\u201d This provision we deem ample to confer such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>jurisdiction as may be necessary to the complete disposition of all minor offenses in which the gist of the charge is the disturbance of the public peace. It is not necessary, however, to rest our decision upon this single ground, since we think there are other controlling considerations which lead to the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In the so-called Inferior Criminal Courts Act (Laws 1910, ch. 659, sec. 71) which relates to the Magistrates\u2019 Courts of Hew York city, we find a general provision for holding courts , on all days, including .Sunday. \u201c There shall be a city magistrates court held <em>daily </em>in every court district and * * * each court shall be open every day at nine o\u2019clock in the morning and shall not be closed before four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, and the city magistrate assigned thereto shall be in attendance thereat except during a reasonable recess <em>and except that the afternoon session may he dispensed with upon Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, </em>other than days upon which general elections are held, when each court shall be open until the polls close.\u201d There is nothing in the context of this statute which suggests any limitation upon the jurisdiction of the Magistrates\u2019 Courts on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The only difference between these days and the other days of the week is as to the time of sitting. \u2022 On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays the afternoon sessions \u201c may be dispensed with,\u201d but on other days they must be held as the statute prescribes. A liberal .and reasonable construction of this statutory direction would seem to indicate that it was the legislative purpose to confer upon the Magistrate\u2019s Courts of Hew York city the same general jurisdiction for their sittings on Sundays which they concededly have the right to exercise on other days. We think that the distinct provision for the difference in the hours of sitting and the omission of any direction differentiating the jurisdiction on Sundays from that of other days, fairly supports the inference that the jurisdiction was to be the same on all days.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">There is even broader ground, however, upon which the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>cisi\u00f3n herein can he supported. We think the provision in section 5 of the Judiciary Law, which limits the Sunday jurisdiction of magistrates \u201cin a criminal case\u201d to the arrest, committal or discharge \u201c of a person charged with an offense \u201d has no application to such a case as this. There are many minor offenses, colloquially classified as crimes, which are merely violations of police regulations. Vagrancy, public drunkenness, various kinds of disorderly conduct, and other minor offenses fall within this category and have from time immemorial been the subject of summary disposition in magistrates\u2019 tribunals. The difference between such offenses and crimes was very clearly stated by our present Chief Justice Cullen, when he was a member of the Appellate Division in the Second Department, in the case of Steinart v. Sobey (14 App. Div. 505, 507). That was an action for false imprisonment. The plaintiff had been charged with disturbing a religious meeting and the question was whether the defendant, a justice of the peace, had jurisdiction to convict and punish. In discussing this question of jurisdiction Mr. Justice Cullen said: \u201c It is undoubtedly true that the term \u2018 crime \u2019 is, within many definitions to be found in dictionaries and text writers, broad enough to include the offense with which the plaintiff was charged. Mr. Bishop, in his work on Statutory Crimes, devotes many sections to the discussion of the violation of the ordinances and by-laws of municipal corporations, treating such violations as crimes. But whatever be the correct and accurate definition of the word <em>\u2018 </em>crime,\u2019 I think that it is not used in the Code of Criminal Procedure in a sense broad enough to include petty offenses subject to summary conviction by a magistrate. In the Code crimes are divided into felonies and misdemeanors, and no provision is found for the trial of either before a magistrate, as such. Yet the Code at length prescribes the forms and methods of procedure in cases of bastardy, in proceedings under the Poor Law, and proceedings against vagrants and disorderly persons. These are termed in the Code, not prosecutions for crime, but \u2018 special proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>ings of a criminal nature.\u2019 Proceedings in cases of bastardy and in cases under the Poor Law may be considered as not penal, but only as means to enforce the discharge of legal obligations. But proceedings against vagrants, and in certain cases against disorderly persons 'are as essentially punitive as any sentence imposed for crime. It is, therefore, apparent that too broad a significance must not be given to the term \u2018 crime \u2019 as used in the Code. This distinction in nomenclature existed prior to the Code. The title of part four of the Revised Statutes is: \u2018An act concerning crimes and punishments; proceedings in criminal cases; and prison discipline.\u2019 Yet in this part of the Revised Statutes the proceedings against vagrants, disorderly persons, Sabbath breakers or disturbers of religious meetings are not to be found. These all occur in chapter 20 of part 1, entitled \u2018 of the internal police of the State.\u2019 It thus appears that, however inaccurate or illogical the distinction may be, summary proceedings for petty offenses leading to disorder have been considered, not as prosecutions for crimes, but for offenses against police regulations.\u201d This quotation very aptly expresses our views in the present case. We think the offense charged against the relator was not a crime in the strict sense of that term, but, an offense against a police regulation which the Magistrates\u201d Court had the power to dispose of summarily on Sunday as on. other days of the week. We regard the limitation in section 5-of the Judiciary Act, restricting the Sunday jurisdiction of magistrates to the arrest, committal or discharge of a person charged with an offense \u201c in \u00a1a criminal case,\u201d as not applicable, because this is not a \u201c criminal case \u201d within the purview of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The orders of the Appellate Division and the Special Term should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Cullen, Oh.

Two reasons for this are given in Sir Henry Spelman\u2019s Original of the Terms, one being that the Christians laid aside all observance of days in opposition to the heathens who were superstitious about the observance of days and times; and the other being that by keeping their courts always open, they would prevent Christian suitors from resorting to the heathen courts. But in 5IT a canon was passed exempting Sunday from the judicial days, which, with other canons passed later, was received and adopted by the Saxon kings and embodied in the Constitution of Edward the Confessor. These canons and constitutions were all confirmed by William the Conqueror and Henry tbe Second, and so became part of the common law of England. Swann v. Broome, 3 Burr. 1595, 97 Eng.
