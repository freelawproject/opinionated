Section 1897 of the Penal Law if construed literally would seem to make the mere possession of a slungshot or a billy, no matter \u00a1how innocent, a felony punishable \u201c by imprisonment for not more than seven years or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or both.\u201d Such a literal interpretation would render such statute unconstitutional and void as being in violation of the Federal and State -Constitutions (U. S. Const. 8th and 14th amendments; N. Y. State Const. art. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 5, and 6.) (Fisher Co. v. Woods, 187 N. Y. 90; People v. Baum, 133 App. Div. 481; People v. Rosenberg, 138 N.

Minnesota, 218 U. S. 57; Comm. v. Murphy, 165 Mass. 66.). The statute in the case at bar makes the carrying or possession of a slungshot a felony irrespective of any \u201c specific intent.\u201d (State v. Dixon, 114 N. C. 850; Ridenour v.

Defendant when arrested denied knowledge of its possession. At the time in question section 1897 of the Penal Law provided: \u201c A person who attempts to use against another, or who carries, or possesses any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a slung-shot, billy, sand club or metal knuckles, or who with intent to use the same against another, carries or possesses a dagger, dirk or dangerous knife is guilty of a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The trial judge charged: \u201c\u2018A person who carries or possesses any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a slungshot is guilty of a felony.\u2019 If this defendant at the time and place in question carried or possessed, knowingly possessed of course, any instrument or weapon known as a slung-shot he is guilty of a felony. That is all there is to the case.\u201d And he refused to charge several propositions presented by the appellant which made intent to use the weapon against another an essential element to be found by the jury before they could convict him. The exceptions to these refusals and the suggestion that if such intent is not to be implied the statute is unconstitutional present the only questions requiring consideraion.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The court correctly refused to hold, as requested, that proof was necessary of intent to use the slungshot. The argument that it was so necessary is predicated on a section of the Penal Law immediately following the one which has been quoted and which reads as follows: \u201cThe possession, by any person other than a public officer, of any of the weapons specified in the last section, concealed or furtively carried on the person, is presumptive evidence of carrying, or concealing, or possessing, with intent to use the same in violation of that section.\u201d The appellant argues that because by this last section a certain possession \u201c of any of the weapons specified \u201d in the preceding one is made presumptive evidence of carrying or possessing with intent to use the same in violation of that section, an in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>tent to thus use must be found in the case of each weapon before a violation is made out. This is an erroneous view. The section relied on must be regarded as making possession evidence of an intent to use only in those cases where such intent is a necessary element of the crime as provided by the first section. It is not to be construed as requiring evidence of an intent to use where the crime as defined by the preceding section is made out without proof of any such intent as in the case of a slungshot. The ambiguity in the last section, if there is any, is due to an amendment of the first section. Prior to 1905 that section (then section 410, Penal Code) reads A person who attempts to use against another, or who, with! intent so to use, carries, conceals, or possesses any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as the slungshot, billy, sandclub or metal knuckles, or a dagger, dirk or dangerousi knife, is guilty of- a felony.\u201d While the section thus read, the succeeding one, for section 1898 of the Penal Law relied onl was then section 411 of the Penal Code, was perfectly appropriate and unambiguous. In 1905 section 410 was so changed as to make the <em>\u201c </em>possession of any instrument or weapon of the kind commonly known as a slungshot,\u201d etc., of itself a crime without evidence of intent to use, and the element of intent to\u00a1 use was thus eliminated in the case of those weapons: When this change was made section 411 was not correspondingly amended as would have been quite appropriate, although in! our judgment not essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">The legislature has the undoubted power to declare that various acts, not theretofore so, shall be criminal without proof of other intent as a necessary ingredient of the offense than the intent to commit the prohibited act. (People v. Abeel, 182 N. Y. 415; People ex rel. Hegeman v. Corrigan, 195 N. Y. 1; People v. Werner, 174 N. Y. 132.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">If we give to the statute under consideration a rational interpretation it becomes clear that the carrying or possessing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>a slungshot even without proof of specific ulterior, criminal intent are within the character of acts which the legislature may thus condemn. Of course, the possession which is meant is a knowing and voluntary one, as the trial judge explicitly charged. Further, the word \u201cpossesses \u201d is to he interpreted somewhat in the light of its association with the other word of the statute, \u201c carries.\u201d As such it must mean a possession which places the weapon within the immediate control and reach of the accused and where it is available for unlawful use. if he so desires. And on the contrary, it clearly should not be construed to mean a possession for instance such as would theoretically and technically follow from the legal ownership of a weapon in a collection of curious and interesting objects or which might result temporarily and incidentally from the performance of some lawful act, as disarming a wrongful possessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\">Given to the statute thus a reasonable interpretation, and its enactment readily and clearly comes within the police power. The evidence and the well-understood character of slungshots, billies, sandbags and brass knuckles make it evident that the legislature were entirely justified in regarding them as dangerous and foul weapons seldom used for justifiable purposes but ordinarily the effective and illegitimate implements of thugs and brutes in carrying out their unlawful purposes. For instance a standard dictionary defines a slungshot as \u201c a metal ball of small size with a string attached used by ruffians for striking.\u201d Influenced as we may assume the legislature was by some such view as this it is obvious that one of the proper and efficient methods by which to prevent the commission of crime to be apprehended through the instrumentality of these weapons was to make their possession of itself criminal without delaying until opportunity had bred and perhaps permitted the accomplishment of some particular evil design. This is what has been done and there is no infringement of the 'Constitution in this aspect of the legislation. (Lawton v. Steele, 152 U. S. 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u00a1Neither is there any constitutional provision securing the right to hear arms which prohibits legislation with, reference to such weapons as are specifically before us for consideration. The provision in the Constitution of the United States that \u201c the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed \u201d is not designated to control legislation by the State. (Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252.) There is no provision in the State Constitution at least directly bearing on this subject, but only in the statutory Bill of \u00a1Rights. But beyond this, as has already been suggested, the act in question relates to instruments which are ordinarily used for criminal and improper purposes and which are not amongst those ordinary legitimate weapons of defense and protection which are contemplated by the Constitution and the Bill of \u00a1Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Cullen, Ch. J., Haight, Vann, Willard Bartlett and Chase, JJ., concur; Gray, J., absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Judgment of conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
