Case No. 51,660 was filed in Douglas County District Court, and No. 52,320 was filed in Shawnee County District Court. In each case plaintiff Ed Marling Stores, Inc., recovered the balances due on the conditional sales contracts. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>final decisions on the defendants\u2019 counterclaims for costs and attorney fees, based upon the allegations of plaintiff\u2019s violation of the disclosure provisions of the Federal Truth in Lending Act and the Kansas Uniform Consumer Credit Code, resulted in a judgment in favor of plaintiff Ed Marling Stores, Inc., in case No. 51,660, and in favor of defendant Richardson, in case No. 52,320.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The ultimate question to be decided on this consolidated appeal is whether the plaintiff violated K.S.A. 16a-3-206, which incorporates the Federal Truth in Lending Act, and if so, whether it nevertheless is excused from liability under K.S.A. 16a-5-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In case No. 51,660, defendant Cheryl Miracle signed the name of her husband to a conditional sales contract and security agreement for the purchase of a Sony AM-FM cassette stereo from plaintiff Ed Marling Stores, Inc. She defaulted on the payments and plaintiff filed suit in Douglas County either for repossession of the merchandise, or if repossession could not be effectuated, for the balance due under the contract. Defendants counterclaimed, alleging that the conditional sales contract violated certain disclosure requirements of the Federal Truth in Lending Act and the Kansas Uniform Consumer Credit Code because it failed to disclose the amount of the \u201cunpaid balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on its petition and on the defendants\u2019 counterclaim. Specifically, the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">\u201cFrom the evidence submitted at trial and the briefs filed in this case . . . the plaintiff substantially complied with all applicable requirements and the contract when read as a whole is clear and unambiguous and does not require the repeat use of the term \u2018Unpaid Balance.\u201d\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">In case No. 52,320 plaintiff brought suit against the defendant Kathryn Richardson for a transaction similar to the one described in No. 51,660. The same type of counterclaim was filed by the defendant. The Shawnee County District Court entered judgment in favor of defendant upon the defendant\u2019s counterclaim and awarded defendant twice the finance charge of the transaction in question, and costs, including attorney fees pursuant to 15 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1640(a) (Supp. 1980) and K.S.A. 16a-5-203. Judgment was rendered in favor of plaintiff for the amount due under the conditional sales contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">These appeals question whether the failure of Ed Marling Stores, Inc., to include the term \u201cunpaid balance\u201d on its condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>tional sales contracts violated the Federal Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601 <em>et seq. </em>(1976), which is incorporated in the Kansas Uniform Consumer Credit Act. See K.S.A. 16a-1-302 and 16a-3-206. There is no Kansas case law on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The purpose of the Federal Truth in Lending Act is set forth in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a) (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">\u201cThe Congress finds that economic stabilization would be enhanced and the competition among the various financial institutions and other firms engaged in the extension of consumer credit would be strengthened by the informed use of credit. The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the cost thereof by consumers. It is the purpose of this title [15 USC \u00a7\u00a7 1601 <em>et seq.] </em>to assure a meaningful disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to compare more readily the various credit terms available to him and avoid the uninformed use of credit, and to protect the consumer against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (1976) sets forth the general disclosure requirements in transactions governed by the Federal Truth in Lending Act. As all parties concede that the contracts are for consumer credit sales, not under an open-end credit plan, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638 (1976) prescribes the applicable items which must be disclosed by a creditor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">\u201c(1) The cash price of the property or service purchased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">\u201c(2) The sum of any amounts credited as downpayment (including any trade-in).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-10\">\u201c(3) The difference between the amount referred to in paragraph (1) and the amount referred to in paragraph (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">\u201c(4) All other charges, individually itemized, which are included in the amount of the credit extended but which are not part of the finance charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">\u201c(5) The total amount to be financed (the sum of the amount described in paragraph (3) plus the amount described in paragraph (4)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">\u201c(6) Except in the case of a sale of a dwelling, the amount of the finance charge, which may in whole or in part be designated as a time-price differential or any similar term to the extent applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-14\">Disclosures (7) through (10) are irrelevant to these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-15\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (1976) authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to implement the disclosure requirements and the Board so responded with \u201cRegulation Z.\u201d See 12 C.F.R. Part 226 (1980). (See also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604 and \u00a7 1632 [1976]).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-16\">Implicated in this action are the disclosure requirements promulgated by the Board and contained in 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>(1980). The following information must be, disclosed by the creditors in the consumer credit sales:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u201c(1) The cash price of the property or service purchased, using the term \u2018cash price.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201c(2) The amount of the downpayment itemized, as applicable, as downpayment in money, using the term \u2018cash downpayment,\u2019 downpayment in property, using the term \u2018trade-in\u2019 and the sum, using the term \u2018total downpayment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201c(3) The difference between the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, using the term \u2018unpaid balance of cash price.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">\u201c(4) All other charges, individually itemized, which are included in the amount financed but which are not part of the finance charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\u201c(5) The sum of the amounts determined under paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section, using the term \u2018unpaid balance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-10\">\u201c(6) Any amounts required to be deducted under paragraph (e) of this section using, as applicable, the terms \u2018prepaid finance charge\u2019 and \u2018required deposit balance,\u2019 and, if both are applicable, the total of such items using the term \u2018total prepaid finance charge and required deposit balance.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-11\">\u201c(7) The difference between the amounts determined under paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section, using the term \u2018amount financed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-12\">\u201c(8) Except in the case of a sale of a dwelling:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-13\">\u201c(i) The total amount of the finance charge, using the term \u2018finance charge,\u2019 and where the total charge consists of two or more types of charges, a description of the amount of each type, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-14\">\u201c(ii) The sum of the amounts determined under paragraphs (c)(1), (4), and (8)(i) of this section, using the term \u2018deferred payment price.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">The form conditional sales contract before this court contains the \u201ccash price\u201d (\u00a7 226.8[c][1]); the total amount of downpayment itemized, as applicable, and \u201ctotal downpayment,\u201d (\u00a7 226.8[c][2]); the difference between the two amounts just referred to identified as \u201cunpaid balance of cash price,\u201d (\u00a7 226.8[c][3]); all other charges itemized, in this particular action consisting of a net balance due under a prior agreement and official fees (\u00a7 226.8[c][4]); and the amount financed (\u00a7 226.8[c][7]). The contract omits the sum of the amounts of the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d and \u201call other charges\u201d not included as part of the finance charge designated as \u201cunpaid balance\u201d as set forth in \u00a7 226.8(c)(4)(5). In both of these transactions, the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d is identical to the \u201camount financed.\u201d The amounts discussed in \u00a7 226.8(c)(6), <em>i.e., </em>\u201cprepaid finance charge\u201d and \u201crequired deposit balance,\u201d or the total of such items designated as \u201ctotal prepaid finance charge and required deposit balance\u201d are also omitted because there were none. The contract contains the requirements of \u00a7 226.8(c)(8)(i) and (ii), regarding \u201cfinance charges\u201d and \u201cdeferred payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>price.\u201d The only basis for complaint in both cases is the omission of the words \u201cunpaid balance\u201d as required by \u00a7 226.8(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Plaintiff argues that the omission of \u201cunpaid balance\u201d does not constitute a violation of Regulation Z because (1) the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d and the \u201camount financed\u201d were the same; (2) the disclosures provided were sufficient to apprise the consumers of the various charges involved in the transaction; and (3) plaintiff substantially complied with all the requirements. The consumers urge a more strict interpretation of Regulation Z and claim that the failure to include the term \u201cunpaid balance\u201d and the amount thereof violates the act, despite the fact that the amount of the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d was the same as the \u201camount financed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Regulation Z fills gaps in the disclosure requirements of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1638 (1976) with precise terms. By its own language the regulation states that the specified terms must be disclosed \u201cas applicable.\u201d Plaintiff suggests that the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d is inapplicable to this transaction because it is the same amount as the \u201camount financed\u201d which was clearly stated on the sales contract. The consumers assume a different, yet plausible, view. They stress that the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d is a sum of the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d and \u201call other charges\u201d not included in the finance charge. Since there were \u201cother charges\u201d in this transaction, the only way to make the computations required by \u00a7 226.8(c)(5), <em>i.e., </em>the sum of the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d and the \u201cother charges\u201d not included as the finance charge, as well as the calculations required in \u00a7 226.8(c)(7) would be to conspicuously state the \u201cunpaid balance.\u201d This argument depends upon finding a necessity to spell out the mathematical progression of charges contemplated by the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Additional sources must be consulted for assistance in determining the validity of the parties\u2019 respective claims. Other courts have given considerable deference to the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s (FRB) interpretation of the federal statute for which it has responsibility for issuing regulations. <em>Ives v. W. T. Grant Company, </em>522 F.2d 749, 755 (2d Cir. 1975). See also <em>Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 365-66, 36 L.Ed.2d 318, 93 S.Ct. 1652 (1973); <em>Johnson v. McCrackin-Sturman Ford, Inc., </em>527 F.2d 257 (3d Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Over the years several agency interpretations have been given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>involving the question before the court. An F.T.C. Informal Staff Opinion dated July 21, 1971, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-4\">\u201cFailure to employ the term \u2018unpaid balance\u2019 on the model form . . . \u2018What You Ought to Know About Regulation Z\u2019 [CCH CONSUMER CREDIT GUIDE \u00b6 3853] is an error of omission. The forms contained in the Initial Decision of the Hearing Examiner in <em>Matter of Zale Corporation, </em>Docket 8810 [CCH CONSUMER CREDIT GUIDE \u00b6 99,688], are merely evidentiary and were not introduced or relied upon for the proposition that \u2018unpaid balance\u2019 is not a required disclosure where appropriate under the Regulation. The enforcement position of this Division has been that a required term must also be used to describe' the same amount, whenever: (a) that required term is prescribed by the Regulation as descriptive of an amount which is the sum, product, or difference of two or more amounts, if the sum, product, or difference is itself required to be disclosed in that transaction; or (b) the required term is prescribed by the Regulation as descriptive of an amount required by the Regulation to be used in computing another amount itself required to be disclosed in that transaction.\u201d CCH Consumer Credit Guide \u00b6 30,705.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">As explained above, the \u201cunpaid balances\u201d in these instances are, in fact, the sum of two or more amounts and the sum is required to be disclosed in the transaction. The \u201cunpaid balance\u201d represents the sum of the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d and all \u201cother charges,\u201d not included in the finance charge and the Regulation requires disclosure of the \u201cunpaid balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In FRB Letter No. 536 dated September 23, 1971, the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d was deemed appropriately omitted whenever there were no \u201cother charges\u201d to be disclosed pursuant to 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226.8(c)(4) (1980) and no \u201cprepaid finance charges\u201d or \u201crequired deposit balances\u201d under \u00a7 226.8(c)(6). CCH Consumer Credit Guide \u00b6 30,748. Under those circumstances the \u201camount financed,\u201d the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d and the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d would be the same figure. However, in the plaintiff\u2019s contract there were \u201cother charges\u201d to be disclosed pursuant to \u00a7 226.8(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">FRB Letter No. 740 dated December 28, 1973, CCH Consumer Credit Guide \u00b6 31,059, approves the elimination of certain prescribed terms for disclosure which are not applicable to a given transaction. However, that letter addressed a transaction on which there were no \u201cfinance charges\u201d or \u201cother charges\u201d and it, too, is distinguishable from these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">Whether \u201cunpaid balance\u201d is a required disclosure where there are \u201cother charges\u201d but no \u201cprepaid finance charge\u201d or \u201crequired deposit balance\u201d in the credit transaction as in this contract was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the subject of FRB Letter No. 842, September 19, 1974. The Board replied to a request:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">\u201cWe appreciate your view that the definition of the term <em>amount financed </em>leaves little doubt as to what it includes on a disclosure statement. However, use of the term <em>unpaid balance </em>does offer some assistance to the consumer in understanding a mathematical progression on the Truth in Lending disclosure statement. Therefore, in view of the recent court decisions and other Federal agency opinions, we would advise creditors to incorporate the term into disclosure statements, even though the disclosure statement illustrated on page 22 of the pamphlet, <em>What You Ought to Know About Truth in Lending, </em>may indicate that such a disclosure may not be required in such circumstances.\u201d CCH Consumer Credit Guide \u00b6 31,164.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The letter declined a recommendation that the Board amend \u00a7 226.8(c) to make the use of the term \u201cunpaid balance\u201d optional where there are no \u201cprepaid finance charges\u201d and \u201crequired deposit balances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">Since the transactions in question, the FRB issued an Official Staff Interpretation, No. FC-0155, which became effective on March 14, 1979 (44 Fed. Reg. 15,474, CCH Consumer Credit Guide \u00b6 31,802), in response to a letter requesting an official staff interpretation of \u00a7 226.8(c) of Regulation Z. The creditor who was the subject of that letter omitted disclosure of \u201cunpaid balance\u201d required by \u00a7 226.8(c)(5) because no \u201cother charges\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 226.8(c)(4) were added to the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price.\u201d Thus, the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d was identical to the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price.\u201d The opinion referred to Public Information Letters 213, 536 and 740 in support of the creditor\u2019s position that only applicable items need be disclosed. The staff adhered to the positions taken in the letters previously cited and authorized certain combinations of disclosures suggested by the creditor under the stated facts. The staff, however, admitted possible limitations on the letter by acknowledging that several federal district courts had reached decisions contrary to its interpretation and cautioned the creditor upon reliance upon the letter in jurisdictions where the district court decisions have been rendered. As discussed above, the letters referred to in the official staff interpretation do not aid the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">In summary, the above interpretations clearly provide support for the position advanced by the consumers on these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">The Truth in Lending Act is remedial in nature and, as a consequence, is to be liberally construed in favor of the consumer in-order to effectuate the underlying congressional purpose. <em>N.C. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number><em>Freed Co., Inc. v. Board of Governors of Fed. Res. Sys., </em>473 F.2d 1210 (2nd Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>414 U.S. 827 (1973). In this case the conflict is poised between strict enforcement of the technical requirements of the act sought by the consumers (see <em>Grant v. Imperial Motors, </em>539 F.2d 506 [5th Cir. 1976] [failure to itemize official fees]; <em>Pennino v. Morris Kirschman &amp; Co., Inc., </em>526 F.2d 367 [5th Cir. 1976] [failure to use the term \u201cnew balance\u201d in an open revolving charge plan]), and substantial compliance promoted by plaintiff (see <em>Dixon v. D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd., </em>566 F.2d 571 [5th Cir. 1978]).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Several cases have dealt with the precise issue before this court or a closely analogous one. Perhaps the leading case finding a violation for failure to use the term \u201cunpaid balance\u201d when there were \u201cother charges\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 226.8(c)(4) is <em>Ives v. W. T. Grant Company, </em>522 F.2d 749. In that action the contracts in question used the term \u201camount financed,\u201d but not \u201cunpaid balance.\u201d The court rejected all of the defenses raised by the creditor in an attempt to escape the penalties for violating the act. Not much analysis is provided for finding the disclosure violation, however. <em>Lewis v. Walker-Thomas Furniture Co., Inc., </em>416 F. Supp. 514 (D.D.C. 1976), provides more insight into the question. The retail installment contracts in <em>Lewis </em>failed to disclose the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d and instead employed the term \u201ctotal amount financed.\u201d The creditor argued that the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d constituted the \u201camount financed\u201d minus the sum of the total \u201cprepaid finance charges\u201d and \u201crequired deposit balances\u201d according to Regulation Z. As there were no \u201cprepaid finance charges\u201d or \u201crequired deposit balances\u201d in the contracts, then the dollar figure for the \u201camount financed\u201d was the same as that for the \u201cunpaid balance.\u201d Accordingly, the creditor contended it was under no duty to reveal the same number twice, under different labels, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cunpaid balance\u201d and the \u201camount financed.\u201d The district court cited <em>Ives </em>and continued its explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cThe very complexity of the statement of defendant\u2019s position indicates that it has no place in this area of the law, for it presumes an unrealistic sophistication and knowledge on the part of consumers. Scrupulous adherence to the requirements of the law is necessary to protect the public and to ensure the application of consistent and uniform terminology that is prerequisite to the informed use of credit. And contrary to [the creditor\u2019s] assertion, it is simply immaterial whether plaintiff in fact was or was not misled, deceived or confused.\u201d 416 F. Supp. at 517.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>In <em>Grey v. European Health Spas, Inc., </em>428 F. Supp. 841 (D. Conn. 1977), a violation was found to exist even when there were no \u201cother charges\u201d and \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d and \u201cunpaid balance\u201d were identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The consumers admit that several cases have involved transactions where there were no \u201cother charges\u201d as described in \u00a7 226.8(c)(4) and under those circumstances disclosure of the term \u201cunpaid balance\u201d was deemed unnecessary. <em>Brown v. Providence Gas Co., </em>445 F. Supp. 459 (D. R.I. 1976); <em>St. Germain v. Bank of Hawaii, </em>413 F. Supp. 587 (D. Hawaii 1976). However, the consumers distinguish these cases on the basis that the sum computation defined in \u00a7 226.8(c)(5) is eliminated when no \u201cother charges\u201d exist and the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d and the \u201cunpaid balance\u201d are identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Plaintiff attempts to emasculate the persuasive authority of the cases the consumers cite to support their position largely on the grounds that flexibility is to be afforded to the creditor in credit sale transactions and that only substantial compliance with Regulation Z is required. Its main argument is premised on the case of <em>Dixon v. D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd., </em>566 F.2d 571. The issue in <em>Dixon </em>concerned whether the omission of the precise term \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 225.8(c)(3) constituted a Truth in Lending violation since the contract set out the cash price, the cash down payment and the unpaid balance\u2014amount financed. The Fifth Circuit adopted the decision of the district court as its own. The district court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201cIt seems to be that the disclosure statement in this case, while, obviously, one could flyspeck it and improve on it from a technical standpoint does what the Truth in Lending Act contemplates, which is make clear to the borrower, in this case the buyer on an installment contract, the cost of his credit, the terms of his credit, and what happens should be fulfill his contract in a way other than by the number of installments called for.\u201d 566 F.2d at 571.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In deciding that the omission of the term \u201cunpaid balance of cash price\u201d was not a violation, the court reasoned that from the context of the contract, it was evident that the term \u201cunpaid balance\u201d which was listed referred to the \u201cunpaid balance of cash price.\u201d The court found \u201cthat substantial and not sacramental compliance is what is necessary.\u201d 566 F.2d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">Plaintiff suggests that the <em>Dixon </em>case undermines those opinions cited by the consumers requiring disclosure of unpaid balance. However, the Fifth Circuit commented upon <em>Dixon </em>in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>later case involving a retail installment sales contract for the purchase of an automobile. In <em>Smith v. Chapman, </em>614 F.2d 968 (5th Cir. 1980), the creditor defended on the ground he had substantially complied with the terms of the Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z. The Fifth Circuit specifically noted: \u201cThe Appellant [creditor] misconceives both the applicable standard for compliance with TILA, as well as the purpose of the Act.\u201d 614 F.2d at 971. The court then reiterated the standards which have evolved to govern alleged TILA violations. It noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201cIt is now well-settled that an objective standard is used in determining violations of TILA. It is not necessary that the plaintiff-consumer actually have been deceived in order for there to be a violation. <em>McGowan v. King, Inc., </em>569 F.2d 845, 849 (5th Cir. 1978). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201cSecond, the applicable standard is strict compliance with the technical requirements of the Act. Only adherence to a strict compliance standard will promote the standardization of terms which will permit consumers readily to make meaningful comparisons of available credit alternatives. 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1601; <em>Pennino v. Morris Kirschman and Co., Inc., </em>526 F.2d 367, 370 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>Houston v. Atlanta Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, </em>414 F. Supp. 851, 855 (N.D. Ga. 1976); <em>Powers v. Sims &amp; Levin Realtors, </em>396 F. Supp. 12, 20 (E.D. Va. 1975).\u201d 614 F.2d at 971.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The court directly confronted the argument made by plaintiff concerning <em>Dixon v. D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\u201cStrict compliance does not necessarily mean punctilious compliance if, with minor deviations from the language described in the Act, there is still a substantial, clear disclosure of the fact or information demanded by the applicable statute or regulation. This is what this Court meant in <em>Dixon </em>v. <em>D. H. Holmes Company, Ltd., </em>566 F.2d 571 (5th Cir. 1978).\u201d 614 F.2d at 972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The creditor in <em>Smith </em>argued that <em>Dixon </em>created a substantial compliance standard but the Fifth Circuit dispelled that notion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">\u201cThe District Court Judge in <em>Dixon </em>was merely saying that it is not necessary to \u2018flyspeck\u2019 the language of credit disclosures. He was not saying it is unnecessary to make the disclosure in the proper technical form and in the proper locations on the contract, as mandated by the requirements of TILA and Regulation Z.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">\u201cMoreover, the <em>Dixon </em>case imposes an objective standard\u2014the District Court Judge looked at the provisions in question objectively and concluded that they were clearly stated. [The creditor] would have us hold, not only that the applicable standard of compliance is less than strict, but also that it is achieved when the debtor in question understood the terms of the contract. We reject [the creditor\u2019s] proposed standard of review. 614 F.2d at 972.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Based upon a review of the Federal Truth in Lending Act itself, the applicable requirements of Regulation Z as well as the staff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>and judicial interpretations, the weight of the authority supports the consumers\u2019 contention that failure to include the term \u201cunpaid balance,\u201d despite the fact that the figure representing the term is identical to the figure of the \u201camount financed\u201d which was disclosed on the contract, constitutes a Truth in Lending violation. A purpose of the Truth in Lending Act was to aid consumers in making informed use of credit. To assure this goal it is necessary to meaningfully disclose credit terms so that consumers can readily compare credit terms available to them from a variety of sources. We find that Kansas should follow the authority as set forth above, and we find that in these two cases the plaintiff failed to comply with K.S.A. 16a-3-201 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Under the provisions of K.S.A. 16a-5-203, any violation of the Federal Truth in Lending disclosure requirements subjects the violator to payment to the consumer the sum of <em>\u201c(a) </em>twice the amount of the finance charge in connection with the transaction, but the liability pursuant to this paragraph shall be not less than one hundred dollars ($100) or more than one thousand dollars ($1,000); and (b) in the case of a successful action to enforce the liability under paragraph <em>(a), </em>the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney\u2019s fees as determined by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">K.S.A. 16a-5-203 and 15 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1640 (Supp. 1980) set up several defenses for the creditor. K.S.A. 16a-5-203(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201cA creditor may not be held liable in any action brought under this section for a violation of the provisions of sections 1 through 131 [16a-1-101 through 16a-9-102] of this act if the creditor shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid the error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">K.S.A. 16a-5-203(7) also provides that liability under the provisions of K.S.A. 16a-5-203 is in lieu of liability under the Federal Truth in Lending Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Plaintiff cites K.S.A. 16a-5-203(3) and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(c) (1976), which is its federal counterpart, to excuse itself from liability even if this court should find the term \u201cunpaid balance\u201d to be required on the ground that the omission was unintentional and resulted from a bona fide error. However, the real thrust of its defense lies under 15 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1640(f) (Supp. 1980), which proscribes imposition of liability for any disclosure violation done or omitted \u201cin good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Board or in conformity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>with any interpretation or approval by an official or employee of the Federal Reserve System duly authorized by the Board to issue such interpretations or approvals under such procedures as the Board may prescribe\u201d even if the rule, regulation, etc., is later amended, rescinded or determined to be invalid for any reason. Plaintiff claims it relied on the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s model for retail installment contracts contained in a Federal Reserve Board pamphlet entitled \u201cWhat You Ought to Know About Regulation Z.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Before evaluating the substance of plaintiff\u2019s argument, we must first address Miracles\u2019 contention that plaintiff may not raise this defense on appeal because it did not raise it in the trial court. A review of the pleadings indicates that while plaintiff pleaded any violation was unintentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding maintenance of procedures reasonably adopted to avoid the error, nevertheless, at the Miracle trial, absolutely no evidence was introduced by plaintiff that it had, in fact, relied upon any of the documents listed in its brief when it prepared the sales contract. The only evidence on the subject was an affidavit by Dale Talmage, plaintiff\u2019s employee, which was submitted with the plaintiff\u2019s trial brief. He explained that in January of 1976, plaintiff updated its installment contracts to comply with the applicable state and federal consumer credit laws. The contract under scrutiny in this action was first used in January, 1976. Nothing in that affidavit states that plaintiff relied upon any of the cited documents in preparing its contract. Thus, plaintiff failed to establish its defense by a preponderance of the evidence as required by the statute. The same failure occurred in the Richardson proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">There should be some flexibility in determining whether a creditor\u2019s defense is legitimate. However, in this particular case, plaintiff simply failed to demonstrate that it had truly relied upon the model contract contained in the pamphlet \u201cWhat You Ought to Know About Regulation Z.\u201d Thus, we find that the disclosure omissions constituted a violation of Truth in Lending and that plaintiff was liable for the statutory penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The judgment is affirmed in case No. 52,320. In case No. 51,160, the judgment for plaintiff against defendant on its petition is affirmed. The judgment for plaintiff against defendant on the defendant\u2019s counterclaim is reversed and remanded with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>directions that judgment be entered for defendant in an amount determined by the trial court to be within the limits prescribed in K.S.A. 16a-5-203(1)(a) and <em>(b). </em>Defendants are awarded additional attorney fees against plaintiff in the amount of $600 for this consolidated appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b215-5\">Herd, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"Atf\">I concur with the majority that Ed Marling Stores, Inc. failed to strictly comply with the technical requirement of the Truth in Lending Act but dissent from the awarding of penalties and fees because the borrowers by their own admissions were not misled. The omission of the item \u201cunpaid balance\u201d where \u201camount financed\u201d is provided and is the same figure is not damaging to the borrowers. I would hold that proof of an unintentional act or bona fide error was not necessary to excuse a lender under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
