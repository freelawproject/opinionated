Snider was convicted in a bench trial of operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway while under the influence of alcohol, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266. He contends the trial judge erred by admitting into evidence the blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>alcohol analysis because the procedure for extracting his blood did not substantially comply with statutory requirements. Snider also contends the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the crime. We disagree and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The evidence at trial proved that when State Trooper Olinger arrived to investigate a one-vehicle accident in Amelia County, Snider had walked away. When Snider returned to his vehicle, he told Trooper Olinger that he slid off the road while turning to avoid several deer. Trooper Olinger noticed that Snider\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and glassy and that his body had an odor of alcohol. Although Trooper Olinger noticed that Snider\u2019s speech was slurred, she testified that Snider\u2019s speech could have been affected by an injury to his lip. Trooper Olinger testified that Snider denied consuming any alcohol after the accident and admitted that he consumed four beers before the accident. He said he consumed the last beer one-half hour before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Trooper Olinger arrested Snider and transported him to have a blood test performed. Trooper Olinger was present when a nurse withdrew Snider\u2019s blood for the test. When the Commonwealth offered as evidence the certificate of analysis of Snider\u2019s blood, Snider\u2019s defense counsel objected to its admission because Trooper Olinger did not know whether the nurse cleansed Snider\u2019s arm before extracting blood. The trial judge overruled the objection and admitted the certificate of analysis, which indicated that Snider\u2019s blood had an alcohol content of .10 by weight by volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">In his defense, Snider testified that his car went into a ditch after he swerved to avoid several deer. When no one passed after twenty minutes, he retrieved a pack of six beers from his vehicle and began to walk. During a two-mile walk, he drank four or five beers. When asked if he remembered Trooper Olinger questioning him about drinking after the accident, Snider testified, \u201cshe asked me, but I can\u2019t remember the before or after____ I said that I had been drinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The trial judge convicted Snider of driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>\n<em>Admissibility of Blood Test Results</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">In pertinent part, the implied- consent statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">For purposes of this article, only a physician, registered professional nurse, graduate laboratory technician or a technician or nurse designated by order of a circuit court acting upon the recommendation of a licensed physician, using soap and water, polyvinylpyrrolidone iodine or benzalkonium chloride to cleanse the part of the body from which the blood is taken and using instruments sterilized by the accepted steam sterilizer or some other sterilizer which will not affect the accuracy of the test, or using chemically clean sterile disposable syringes, shall withdraw blood for the purpose of determining its alcohol or drug or both alcohol and drug content.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.5. The legislature has clearly indicated in the following statutory language that strict compliance with some parts of the implied consent law will not be required:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7k\">The <em>steps </em>set forth in [Code] \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-268.2 through 18.2-268.9 <em>relating to taking, </em>handling, identifying, and disposing <em>of blood </em>or breath samples <em>are procedural and not substantive. Substantial compliance shall be sufficient. </em>Failure to comply with any steps or portions thereof, ... shall go to the weight of the evidence and shall be considered with all the evidence in the case; however, the defendant shall have the right to introduce evidence on his own behalf to show noncompliance with the aforesaid procedures or any part thereof, and that as a result his rights were prejudiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFp\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11 (emphasis added). <em>See Artis v. City of Suffolk </em>19 Va.App. 168, 171, 450 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1994) (holding that \u201cwhere there is substantial compliance, any deficiency in the required procedures is a matter of weight and sufficiency of the evidence to be determined by the trier of fact\u201d). The burden is on the Commonwealth to show that it substantially complied with the requirements of the statute. <em>See Kemp v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 360, 365, 429 S.E.2d 875, 878 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Snider argues that the Commonwealth did not meet its burden of proving substantial compliance with Code \u00a7 18.2-268.5 because the evidence did not establish what, if any, solution was used to cleanse Snider\u2019s arm before the blood was withdrawn. Snider relies on <em>Hudson v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 184, 462 S.E.2d 913 (1995), where this Court held that using benadine to cleanse the driver\u2019s arm before a blood test did not constitute substantial compliance with Code \u00a7 18.2-268.5 because no evidence of benadine\u2019s chemical properties was presented at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 462 S.E.2d at 914. Snider argues that the circumstances here are more egregious than in <em>Hudson </em>because either an unknown solution or no solution was used on his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In another context, the Supreme Court of Virginia has ruled that, in determining the question of substantial compliance, \u201ca minor, trivial difference can be tolerated whereas a material difference cannot.\u201d <em>Akers v. James T. Barnes of Washington, D.C., Inc., 227 </em>Va. 367, 370, 315 S.E.2d 199, 201 (1984). \u201cThe principle of substantial compliance, which is predicated upon a failure of strict compliance with applicable requirements, operates to replace the protective safeguards of specificity with a less exacting standard of elasticity, in order to achieve a beneficial and pragmatic result.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Pross, </em>219 Va. 143, 158, 246 S.E.2d 613, 622 (1978). We believe these general standards can be applied to the requirement of the implied consent law, where the mischief to be avoided is contamination of the blood that is being extracted for the blood alcohol test. In <em>Hudson, </em>the evidence proved that the area from which the blood sample was extracted was, in fact, contaminated by benadine, a solution whose chemical properties were not proved. The evidence in this record proved that, although Trooper Olinger watched the nurse extract blood from Snider\u2019s arm, Trooper Olinger could not recall whether the nurse used a solution to prepare Snider\u2019s arm. Thus, unlike <em>Hudson, </em>the evidence in this case leaves uncertain whether any solution was used to cleanse Snider\u2019s arm before the blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>The evidence proved that a properly designated nurse took the sample. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.5; <em>Brooks v. City of Newport News, </em>224 Va. 311, 315, 295 S.E.2d 801, 803 (1982) (holding that the qualifications of the person who performs the test \u201cis a matter of substance, not procedure\u201d). Because the evidence did not establish whether a solution was used to prepare Snider\u2019s arm for the blood extraction, we can only speculate that contamination could have occurred. No evidence in the record proved that the nurse\u2019s failure to cleanse Snider\u2019s arm caused a contamination which affected the accuracy of the test. <em>See Shumate v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 877, 881-83, 153 S.E.2d 243, 247 (1967) (holding that substantial compliance existed even where \u201cit was not shown who took the blood [and] whether soap and water were used to cleanse the place at which the blood was taken\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In other circumstances, we have ruled that \u201c[w]here there is mere speculation that contamination ... could have occurred, it is not an abuse of discretion to admit the evidence and let what doubt there may be go to the weight to be given the evidence.\u201d <em>Reedy v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 386, 391, 388 S.E.2d 650, 652 (1990). In view of the statutory mandate that substantial compliance suffices to establish the procedural steps of taking the blood, we conclude that the failure to prove whether a solution was used to prepare a suspect\u2019s arm goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11; <em>Stroupe v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 243, 245, 207 S.E.2d 894, 896 (1974); <em>Artis, </em>19 Va.App. at 171, 450 S.E.2d at 167. Accordingly, we cannot say the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting into evidence the certificate of blood analysis. Furthermore, Snider retained \u201cthe right to introduce evidence on his own behalf to show noncompliance with the aforesaid procedures ... and that as a result his rights were prejudiced.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-268.11. <em>See also Stroupe, </em>215 Va. at 245, 207 S.E.2d at 896 (observing that the statute allows the defendant to prove by the nurse the particulars of extracting his blood).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Snider next argues that even if his blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit to operate a motor vehicle, the Commonwealth failed to prove that he consumed alcohol prior to the accident or that he did not consume alcohol after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). So viewed, the evidence proved that Trooper Olinger noticed that Snider\u2019s speech was slurred, his eyes were bloodshot and glassy, and he had an odor of alcohol about his person. Because of those observations, Trooper Olinger asked Snider if he had consumed alcohol after the accident. Snider told her that he did not have anything to drink after the accident. He told her that he consumed four beers before the accident, the last being about thirty minutes prior to the accident. Snider disputed only in part Trooper Olinger\u2019s testimony concerning his statement. He testified that he did not remember Trooper Olinger asking him whether he drank \u201cbefore or after\u201d the accident; he testified that he told her he had been drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The trial judge accepted Trooper Olinger\u2019s testimony and did not believe Snider\u2019s testimony that he consumed the alcohol after the accident. \u201cThe weight which should be given to evidence and whether the testimony of a witness is credible are questions which the fact finder must decide.\u201d <em>See Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986). Trooper Olinger\u2019s testimony was competent, was not inherently incredible, and, combined with the results of the blood alcohol test, was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Snider was guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
