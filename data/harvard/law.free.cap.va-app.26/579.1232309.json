On appeal, he contends that the trial court erred in making numerous evidentiary rulings and when instructing the jury. For the reasons which follow, we reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The facts related here are limited to those pertinent to the issues raised on appeal and they are set forth in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 603, 605-06, 484 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1997) (citing <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). After the Commonwealth brought child pornography charges against appellant relating to materials transmitted through the Internet and found on a computer in appellant\u2019s home, Jana Starr brought charges against appellant for sexually molesting her several years earlier. The Commonwealth chose not to pursue the pornography charges, but indicted appellant for aggravated sexual battery on a child under thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Starr testified she was eleven years of age when she was sexually molested in 1985 by appellant, the half-brother of one of Starr\u2019s close friends at the time. Appellant was then twenty-four years old. He lived directly across the street from Starr and was described by her as a \u201cbig brother\u201d figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Starr testified that appellant entered her home one evening when she was alone and offered her a backrub. Starr stated that after moving her bra and shirt aside, appellant pushed down her shorts and underpants and began to lick her back and then proceeded to rub her genitals. Penetration occurred when appellant partially inserted one of his fingers into her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>vagina. At the time, Starr never told anyone of the incident because she was embarrassed and because of the close relationship which existed between her and the appellant\u2019s church community. At trial, appellant denied the incident had occurred and presented an alibi defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The jury convicted appellant of the charge of aggravated sexual battery of a child under thirteen years of age. In accordance with the jury recommendation, the court sentenced appellant to eight years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Evidence Regarding Starr\u2019s Reputation for Truth</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Appellant proffered the testimony of Starr\u2019s two former Arlington neighbors who would have testified that Starr\u2019s reputation in Arlington for truthfulness was bad. Starr last lived in Arlington in 1993. The trial court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to the evidence and restricted reputation evidence to the community in which Starr lived at the time of trial. We find the exclusion of the evidence to be reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">In support of the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence, the Commonwealth relies in part on <em>Mohler v. Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 713, 735, 111 S.E. 454, 461 (1922), which states that the \u201cquestion to be investigated is the reputation of the witness for truth and veracity as of the time at which he testifies.\u201d The Commonwealth acknowledges that the fact the witness sought to be impeached no longer resides in a particular community does not <em>per se </em>bar reputation testimony from that community. <em>See Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 787, 790-91, 120 S.E.2d 270, 273 (1961). Nevertheless, relying on <em>Cantrell v. Superior Loan Corp., </em>603 S.W.2d 627, 639 (Mo.Ct. App.1980), and <em>State v. Thomas, </em>8 Wash.2d 573, 113 P.2d 73, 77 (1941), the Commonwealth contends that \u201creputation evidence from a former community is admissible only upon a showing of a present connection with the community.\u201d The Commonwealth argues that, because Starr had no present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>connection with the Arlington community, the evidence was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The question before us was settled in <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 660, 662, 137 S.E. 492, 492 (1927). Citing <em>Wigmore on </em>Evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and reasoning from the premise that \u201ca status once established is generally presumed to continue unchanged until the contrary is shown,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court held that the remoteness of a witness\u2019 knowledge of reputation goes to its weight and not to its admissibility. <em>Id. </em>To be sure, the evidence \u201cmust not be so distant in time as to be void of real probative value in showing present character.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The determination of whether evidence is so remote as to be without probative value rests in the discretion of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 662, 137 S.E. at 493. While some authority in a minority of jurisdictions supports the exclusion of evidence of character established at a time other than the time of trial, <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>notes that the minority position is \u201cwholly incorrect on principle, because it is founded on a fallacious analysis of the problem [and it is further] objectionable in policy, because it excludes a class of evidence often meritorious in itself and sometimes the sole kind that is available.\u201d 2 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 928 (Chadbourne rev. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The trial court\u2019s error in this case is one of law. In excluding the character evidence on the basis that it must concern the place \u201cwhere she lives or where she works,\u201d the trial court applied the wrong standard to the evidence before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Our determination of whether the error is harmless is guided by familiar principles. Non-constitutional error \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>harmless \u2018[w]hen it <em>plainly appears </em>from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678) (emphasis added in Lavinder).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Applying the standard articulated in <em>Lavinder, </em>we cannot say that it plainly appears that appellant received a fair trial and that substantial justice was achieved. First, the Commonwealth\u2019s case rested in large measure on Starr\u2019s credibility. Second, the defense specifically stated in its opening statement that they intended to produce witnesses to establish the victim\u2019s bad reputation for truth and veracity, evidence which they should have been permitted to present. Finally, in her closing argument, the attorney for the Commonwealth stated, over defense objection, that the defense had promised to prove that the victim had a bad reputation for truth and veracity and that the defense had failed to do so. Accordingly, we find the error was not harmless and, on that basis, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised. Although we reverse the conviction on this ground, we address the remaining issues raised on appeal as they may arise upon retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Admissibility of Pornographic Material</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Prior to trial, the trial court ruled admissible several exhibits offered by the Commonwealth: three exhibits were pornographic pictures involving children and two proposed exhibits consisted of stories taken from the defendant\u2019s computer portraying a fictional adult engaging in criminal and perverted sex with a child. The Commonwealth ultimately sought the admission of only one of the stories into evidence. The court reasoned that the exhibits were probative of appellant\u2019s lascivious intent in sexually assaulting Starr.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The Commonwealth also sought to have admitted a videotape taken from appellant\u2019s computer containing twenty-four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>pornographic pictures involving children. Three of the videotape pictures duplicated the three already admitted in Exhibits 3, 4, and 5. The court denied the motion, ruling that the prejudicial effect of presenting the video to the jury in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief outweighed its probative value. However, when appellant denied during cross-examination that he had ever seen the pornographic pictures taken from his computer, the court, on its own motion and reasoning that appellant\u2019s response during cross-examination put his credibility with respect to his knowledge of the pictures in issue, allowed the Commonwealth to play the videotape for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Appellant contends that the pornographic images and the sexually explicit story were improperly admitted. Citing <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 182, 348 S.E.2d 849 (1986), and <em>Bunting v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 309, 157 S.E.2d 204 (1967), appellant argues the pornographic materials were not relevant to the determination of the intent at issue in the charged assault and that they were more prejudicial than probative. He also argues that the videotape, composed of similar material, was improperly used for impeachment purposes. We agree with both contentions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">As a general rule, \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence has no probative value and is inadmissible. <em>See Guill v. Commonwealth, </em>-Va.-,-, 495 S.E.2d 489, 491 (1998) (citing, <em>inter alia, Kirkpatrick v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 269, 272, 176 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1970)); <em>Bottoms v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 378, 383, 470 S.E.2d 153, 156 (1996) (citing <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>211 Va. at 272, 176 S.E.2d at 805). However, \u201cwhere the motive, intent, or knowledge of the accused is at issue, evidence of other offenses is admissible if it shows the conduct or attitude of the accused toward his victim, establishes the relationship between the parties, or negates the possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>accident or mistake.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 72, 76, 278 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1981) (citing, <em>inter alia, Kirkpatrick, </em>211 Va. at 272,176 S.E.2d at 805).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In order to prove the charge of aggravated sexual battery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.3, the Commonwealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had \u201csexually abuse[d] the complaining witness\u201d and that \u201c[t]he complaining witness is less than thirteen years of age.\u201d \u201cSexual abuse\u201d is \u201can act committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person, where ... [t]he accused intentionally touches the complaining witness\u2019 intimate parts.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(6). \u201cIntent is the purpose formed in a person\u2019s mind that may, and often must, be inferred from the facts and circumstances in a particular case.\u201d <em>Ridley v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 834, 836, 252 S.E.2d 313, 314 (1979); <em>Jennings v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 9, 17, 454 S.E.2d 752, 755 (citing <em>Ridley, </em>219 Va. at 836, 252 S.E.2d at 314), <em>aff'd, </em>21 Va.App. 328, 464 S.E.2d 179 (1995) <em>(en </em>banc) (mem.).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Commonwealth must prove each element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315-16, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2786-88, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Satterfield v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 630, 636, 420 S.E.2d 228, 232 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc). That principle of law, however, does not mean that the Commonwealth may always offer other bad acts to prove the intent of defendants accused of specific intent crimes. If the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove intent were dispositive, \u201cthe general rule prohibiting introduction of prior bad acts to show character would never apply to specific intent crimes because intent would always be at issue.\u201d <em>State v. Ives, </em>187 Ariz. 102, 927 P.2d 762, 770 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Appellant maintained at trial that the incident reported by Starr never occurred. He introduced no evidence suggesting that the alleged sexual abuse took place without the requisite intent, or that the touching was the result of mistake or accident; instead, he denied the incident altogether and presented an alibi defense. The defense theory of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>case did not relieve the Commonwealth of its burden to prove the element of intent. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 69,112 S.Ct. 475, 480-81, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991); <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 168, 172, 442 S.E.2d 707, 710 (1994) (citing <em>Pittman v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 33, 35, 434 S.E.2d 694, 696 (1993)). However, the question before us is whether \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is admissible on the issue of intent when intent is not genuinely in dispute. We hold that it is not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 480, 486, 438 S.E.2d 296, 300 (1993), this Court set forth the principle which underlies our decision here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">The Commonwealth ... argu[es] that when intent is an element of the offense, prior offenses should be admissible. Intent was at issue here, as it is in most crimes. <em>Kirkpatrick, Boyd [v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 52, 189 S.E.2d 359 (1972)1 <em>Eceles [v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 20, 197 S.E.2d 332 (1973)1 and <em>Donahue [v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 145, 300 S.E.2d 768 (1983)1 all clearly indicate, however, that a significant nexus must exist between intent and the charge at hand. That nexus must be greater than a basic recitation of the fact that intent is an element of the crime. To conclude otherwise is to allow the exception in <em>Kirkpatrick </em>to swallow the general rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">In <em>Hill, </em>we held that admission of prior bad acts evidence was reversible error because neither the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence nor the evidence presented by the defense put the matter of intent in controversy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 487, 438 S.E.2d at 300; <em>see also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 220, 225, 481 S.E.2d 479, 482 (1997) (citing <em>Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 316, 323, 362 S.E.2d 745, 749 (1987)); <em>Tucker v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 520, 523-24, 438 S.E.2d 492, 494 (1993); <em>Foster, </em>5 Va.App. at 323, 362 S.E.2d at 749 (citing <em>Henderson v.

For example, if the prosecution maintains that the other crime reveals defendant\u2019s guilty state of mind, then his intent must be disputed.\u201d). <em>But see United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number><em>Mazzanti, </em>888 F.2d 1165, 1171 (7th Cir.1989); <em>State v. White, </em>538 N.W.2d 237,244 (S.D.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">In appellant\u2019s trial, the \u201cactual issue\u201d was \u201c \u2018commission of the act itself,\u2019 \u201d rather than appellant\u2019s intent in committing the act. <em>Reynolds, </em>24 Va.App. at 225, 481 S.E.2d at 482 (quoting <em>Foster, </em>5 Va.App. at 323, 362 S.E.2d at 749). Neither the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence nor that developed by the appellant puts the issue of intent in genuine dispute. <em>Cf. Jennings, </em>20 Va.App. at 17-18, 454 S.E.2d at 756. The child pornography and sexually explicit story were, on this ground, inadmissible to prove appellant\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Furthermore, where a defendant\u2019s intent is genuinely uncontested, any nominal probative value will be easily outweighed by the danger of prejudice. <em>See Reynolds, </em>24 Va. App. at 225, 481 S.E.2d at 481-82 (citing <em>Foster, </em>5 Va.App. at 323-24, 362 S.E.2d at 748-49); <em>Tucker, </em>17 Va.App. at 523-24, 438 S.E.2d at 494; <em>see also United States v. Beechum, </em>582 F.2d 898, 914 (5th Cir.1978) <em>(en </em>banc) (\u201cIf the defendant\u2019s intent is not contested, then the incremental probative value of the extrinsic offense is inconsequential when compared to its prejudice; therefore, in this circumstance the evidence is uniformly excluded.\u201d); <em>State v. McGlew, </em>139 N.H. 505, 658 A.2d 1191, 1196 (1995). Since the issue of intent was not genuinely in dispute in this case, the probative value of the child pornography evidence was clearly outweighed by its prejudicial effect; the tendency of the child pornography and sexually explicit story to divert the jury and inject extraneous considerations into the fact-finding process, as well as the inherently inflammatory character of the evidence, was clear. Given the nature of the sexually explicit materials, the risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>was great that the jury might consider the unpunished possession of the materials in arriving at their verdict. <em>See Tucker, </em>17 Va.App. at 524, 438 S.E.2d at 494. Indeed, as the trial court noted in its initial ruling excluding the videotape evidence, admission of the sexually explicit materials \u201cruns the risk of turning an aggravated sexual battery trial into a child pornography trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">\u201c \u2018The admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bottoms, </em>22 Va.App. at 384, 470 S.E.2d at 156 (quoting <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)). Because the issue of intent was not genuinely in dispute, we find the admission of the child pornography and story on the issue of appellant\u2019s intent to be an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">We also agree with appellant that the videotape was improperly shown to the jury. The trial court, reversing its earlier ruling excluding the videotape on the ground its prejudicial effect outweighed any probative value it might have, allowed the prosecution to play the videotape to the jury to impeach appellant\u2019s denial of any knowledge of the pictures comprising the Commonwealth\u2019s child pornography exhibits and their presence on his computer. The Commonwealth\u2019s child pornography exhibits were part of the videotape compilation of pictures. The court reasoned that the jury should properly evaluate appellant\u2019s denial in light of the number of pictures found on appellant\u2019s computer, twenty-four of which were included in the videotape exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">We find the admission of the videotape to be erroneous on the ground that a witness may not be cross-examined on a collateral subject.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the witness answers a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>question on a collateral issue, the answer is conclusive and may not be contradicted with further evidence. <em>Simpson v.

Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 928, 935, 434 S.E.2d 343, 347 (1993) (quoting <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>122 Va. 834, 842, 94 S.E. 783, 786 (1918)). Because we hold that the Commonwealth could not introduce the child pornography evidence in its case-in-chief, the videotape is impeachment evidence on a collateral matter and should not have been shown to the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Admissibility of Hearsay Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">On direct examination, Starr testified that, in 1992, she told her husband she had been \u201csexually abused\u201d. Starr also testified that, in a subsequent conversation the same year, she told her husband that appellant \u201cwas the individual whom I had things to work out with.\u201d As appellant contends, Starr\u2019s statements given during her direct examination constituted hearsay and were erroneously admitted. <em>See Haycox v. Dunn, </em>200 Va. 212, 227, 104 S.E.2d 800, 809-10 (1958); 2 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-4 (4th ed.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">However, we reject appellant\u2019s contention that the testimony of Starr\u2019s husband regarding Starr\u2019s report to him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>about the assault and the identity of the perpetrator was erroneously admitted hearsay. Lance Curtis Starr, Starr\u2019s husband, testified over appellant\u2019s objection that, on one occasion in 1992, Starr told him she had been molested. He also testified that his wife, on a separate occasion, identified appellant as the person who had assaulted her. The testimony of Starr\u2019s husband was properly admitted. His testimony was elicited after appellant cross-examined Starr and attacked her testimony as a story of recent fabrication, impelled by her desire to become involved in the appellant\u2019s Internet pornography case.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In <em>Faison v. Hudson, </em>243 Va. 397, 404-05, 417 S.E.2d 305, 309 (1992) (quoting <em>Honaker Lumber Co. v. Kiser, </em>134 Va. 50, 60, 113 S.E. 718, 721 (1922)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">\u201cWhere a witness has been assailed on the ground that [her] story is a recent fabrication, or that [she] has some motive to testifying falsely, proof that [she] gave a similar account of the transaction when the motive did not exist, before the effect of such an account could be foreseen or motives of interest would have induced a different statement, is admissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Appellant first suggested in his opening statement that Starr had fabricated the charge \u201cin order to get involved in [the publicity of the Internet] case\u201d and because she was \u201cinfatuated\u201d with appellant. Subsequently, during cross-examination, Starr was questioned about her motives to fabricate the charge. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statements made by Starr\u2019s husband.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Admissibility of Statements Obtained in Violation of <em>Miranda</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to cross-examine him with respect to certain statements he made before being informed of his rights as required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Appellant made a statement when he was taken before the magistrate after his arrest on the pornography charges. According to an officer present at the time, in response to the magistrate\u2019s question, \u201cwhat [is] this ... all about?\u201d, appellant answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">he liked young-looking girls and he liked pictures of them and he also said that he gets pictures of young-looking girls over his computer and he looks at some of them and he reroutes others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">This statement was suppressed prior to trial. However, the court limited the ruling to the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, stating, \u201cI might consider it different as a cross-examination or impeachment issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The Commonwealth contends the substance of the statement was never made the subject of the cross-examination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Assuming without deciding the statement\u2019s substance is implicated by the question posed, we find appellant\u2019s argument is lacking merit. <em>See Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 226, 91 S.Ct. 643, 646, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971) (holding that a statement obtained from a defendant in violation of <em>Miranda </em>can be used by the government in cross-examination or rebut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>tal to impeach the defendant\u2019s credibility if he or she chooses to testify). Appellant\u2019s further contention that such statements are permitted during cross-examination only when a defendant has made \u201csweeping denials of the matter contained in the suppressed statements on direct examination\u201d is likewise without merit. <em>See Harris, </em>401 U.S. at 223, 91 S.Ct. at 644-45 (allowing use of suppressed statements to impeach a defendant whose trial testimony \u201cpartially contradicted\u201d his prior statements); <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 427, 441, 323 S.E.2d 554, 561 (1984) (explaining that the Commonwealth may impeach a defendant\u2019s inconsistent testimony with suppressed statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Appellant\u2019s challenge to a statement he made to Detective Smith,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> made before <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given, is likewise without merit as it was also properly the subject of cross-examination.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Appellant cites as error the court\u2019s refusal to give five of his instructions and the court\u2019s acceptance of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Defense instructions L, M, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>and E would have advised the jury that to convict the appellant on the charge, the Commonwealth had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the victim was under the age of thirteen when assaulted. The jury was, in fact, duly instructed as to the age requirement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not err in refusing the proffered defense instructions. <em>See Cardwell v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 501, 514, 450 S.E.2d 146,154 (1994) (explaining that a court is not obligated to grant duplicative instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Defense instruction D sought to define reasonable doubt to the jury. Appellant concedes, however, that this Court, as well as the Supreme Court of Virginia, has consistently \u201cdiscouraged trial courts from attempting to define reasonable doubt to the jury.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Strawderman v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 855, 858, 108 S.E.2d 376, 379 (1959); <em>Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 497, 500, 345 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1986) (quoting <em>Strawderman, </em>200 Va. at 858, 108 S.E.2d at 379). The trial court did not err in rejecting the proffered instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Appellant tendered three instructions addressing the alibi defense. The court granted one of the three proffered instructions.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On appeal, appellant contends the court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>in failing to instruct the jury that he did not bear the burden to prove his alibi.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the court fully instructed the jury on the defense of alibi, and informed the jury that the Commonwealth bore the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the court specifically instructed the jury that appellant bore no burden to produce any evidence. Read as a whole, the instructions clearly conveyed to the jury each principle of law offered by appellant. <em>See Rollston v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 585, 541, 399 S.E.2d 823, 826 (1991) (explaining that jury instructions must be read as a whole). Because the defense instruction was cumulative, it was neither necessary nor required. <em>Cardwell, </em>248 Va. at 514, 450 S.E.2d at 154; <em>see also Crabbe v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 419, 421, 270 S.E.2d 727, 728 (1980) <em>(per </em>curiam) (holding that an alibi instruction is unnecessary where the court instructs the jury on the elements of a crime and the burden of proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The appellant\u2019s conviction is reversed and remanded for a new trial, if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\">. \" 'On principle, the correct solution seems to be that prior <em>character at any time may be admitted, </em>as being relevant to show present character, ...

Appellant also contends that the acquisition of the pornographic materials in question was too remote from the alleged offense to be probative of the issue of intent.

In <em>Jennings, </em>20 Va.App. at 12, 454 S.E.2d at 753, the defendant was accused of abduction with the intent to defile. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence showed that the defendant had tied a child to a bed with the intent to anally rape him. It also showed, through the testimony of the child who had been victimized, that the defendant explained that his purpose in tying the child to the bed was to punish him. <em>Id. </em>at 17, 454 S.E.2d at 756. Thus, the issue of intent was in genuine controversy, and this Court found admissible the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior acts of sodomy. Consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>rule explained in <em>Hill, </em>17 Va.App. at 487, 438 S.E.2d at 300, the evidence of \"the prior offense was ... necessary to show intent in the context of the Commonwealth's other evidence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\">.

As the Commonwealth notes, appellant failed to object to the Commonwealth\u2019s question which became the predicate for the court's ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>on the admissibility of the videotape for impeachment purposes. This failure to object, however, does not bar appellant from appealing the introduction of the material used to impeach him on the collateral matter. <em>Simpson v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 604, 607-08, 414 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b640-12\">. In light of our reversal and remand of this case on the issue of reputation evidence, we will not undertake harmless error analysis of other errors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\">. Appellant contended both at trial and on appeal that Starr\u2019s statements and those of her husband were not \"recent\u201d and were therefore erroneously admitted in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2. Code \u00a7 19.2-268.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any prosecution for criminal sexual assault under Article 7 (\u00a7 18.2-61 et seq.) of Chapter 4 of Title 18.2, a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-361, 18.2-366, 18.2-370, or 18.2-370.1, the fact that the person injured made complaint of the offense recently after commission of the offense is admissible, not as</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>independent evidence of the offense, but for the purpose of corroborating the testimony of the complaining witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">Because we resolve the evidentiary question on other grounds, we do not reach the contention that admitting the statements violated the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b642-12\">. When appellant denied any knowledge of the pornographic materials on his computer, the Commonwealth's attorney asked, \"Well, you have admitted that you like to look at pictures of young girls, isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d Appellant answered, \"No, sir.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">. During her cross-examination of the appellant, the prosecutor asked him if he recalled \"a detective who said to you that he was looking for child pornography.\u201d The appellant answered, \"No, ma\u2019am.\u201d She then impeached appellant with the answer appellant gave to Detective Smith, to the effect that he would \"find things on the computer, but they are just fantasy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b643-10\">. Appellant also contends he was wrongfully denied a hearing on whether the statement to Detective Smith should be suppressed on the ground it was made before he received <em>Miranda </em>warnings, citing <em>Stockton v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 124, 314 S.E.2d 371 (1984), <em>habeas corpus granted, </em>852 F.2d 740 (4th Cir.1988).

Appellant contends the trial judge erred in granting one of the Commonwealth\u2019s instructions on the ground it \"singled out for special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>emphasis a part of the evidence tending to establish a particular fact.\u201d This instruction addressed the child pornography evidence.
