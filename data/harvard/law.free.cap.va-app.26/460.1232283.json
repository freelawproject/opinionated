Webb (\u201cclaimant\u201d). Appellant contends the commission erred when it concluded that the allergic contact dermatitis afflicting claimant was a compensable \u201cdisease\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">Claimant has been employed by appellant as a floral designer since October, 1993. Her duties include designing and constructing floral arrangements and \u201cprocessing\u201d flowers that are delivered to appellant\u2019s store. Processing flowers entails removing excess foliage from the flowers, cutting their stems, and placing them in water. Two of the flowers with which claimant works are alstroemeria and tulips. In March, 1995, claimant noticed blisters and a \u201csplotchy area\u201d on her right index finger and palm. Claimant unsuccessfully attempted to treat this condition herself, and the irritation spread up her arms to her elbows.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">On August 30, 1995, Dr. John Carpenter, claimant\u2019s family physician, examined claimant and concluded that she suffered from \u201cdermatitis.\u201d However, Dr. Carpenter was uncertain whether claimant\u2019s dermatitis was \u201cfungal or a contact type ... or a combination.\u201d Beginning in November, 1995, claimant was treated by Dr. Anna Magee, a dermatologist. Claimant underwent \u201cpatch tests\u201d that revealed she was allergic to both alstroemeria and tulips. Dr. Magee diagnosed claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>with \u201callergic contact dermatitis to tulips and alstro[e]meria.\u201d Dr. Magee later opined that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was caused by her exposure to alstroemeria and tulips at work. She stated that allergic contact dermatitis is \u201ca very common problem with florists.\u201d She opined that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis \u201cwas most likely caused by at least two and probably more physical contacts with the chemicals contained in alstro[e]meria and tulips during her employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The record contains three articles describing the incidence, causation, and course of allergic contact dermatitis in florists. <em>See </em>Cindy Hoogasian, <em>Dermatitis Concerns Spark Industry Study, </em>Florist, Jan. 1988, at 95 (\u201cHoogasian I\u201d); Cindy Hoogasian, <em>Dermatitis Concerns Continue, </em>Florist, March 1990, at 75 (\u201cHoogasian II\u201d); Robert M. Adams, M.D. et al., <em>Alstroemeria: The Cause of a New and Potent Allergen for Florists </em>(manuscript of article eventually published in Dermatology Clinics, Jan. 1990). These articles state that allergens contained in plants have long been recognized as a source of dermatitis and that the condition became particularly prevalent among florists in the 1980s. <em>See </em>Adams, <em>supra, </em>at 1; Hoogasian I, <em>supra, </em>at 95-96, Hoogasian II, <em>supra, </em>at 75. Allergic contact dermatitis \u201cis a skin irritation caused by contact with an allergen.\u201d Hoogasian I, <em>supra, </em>at 96. The condition \u201cinvolves a reaction of the body\u2019s immune system to the substance to which that person is sensitive____\u201d Hoogasian II, <em>supra, </em>at 77. Alstroemeria, tulips and other flowers contain chemicals that \u201ccause allergic skin reactions in some people with skin sensitivities.\u201d Hoogasian I, <em>supra, </em>at 96, 99; <em>see also </em>Hoogasian II, <em>supra, </em>at 76, 77, Adams, <em>supra, </em>at 1, 4. Increased exposure to these allergens \u201csensitize[s] some people to the extent that an allergic reaction takes place upon contact with the chemical.\u201d Hoogasian I, <em>supra, </em>at 96. However, one article states that \u201c[t]here is little or no fear\u201d the public will develop allergic sensitivity to the allergen in alstroemeria because \u201ctheir actual involvement with the flower is limited.\u201d Hoogasian I, <em>supra, </em>at 98. According to Dr. Alan Moshell, an occupational dermatologist in Washington, D.C., the general public has little chance of becoming sensitized to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>floral allergens and that \u201c[ojnly in cases where there is constant contact with the juice of the alstroemeria, such as a designer or a sales employee would have, is there cause for concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 96, 98. Once an individual develops an allergy to the chemicals in a particular flower, it is generally \u201ca lifelong sensitivity.\u201d Hoogasian II, <em>supra, </em>at 76, 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Claimant filed a claim for benefits contending that her allergic contact dermatitis was a compensable occupational disease. Appellant defended against the claim on the sole ground that allergic contact dermatitis is not a compensable disease under the Act. Following a hearing, a deputy commissioner concluded that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was a compensable occupational disease under Code \u00a7 65.2-400 and awarded benefits to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Appellant appealed, and the commission affirmed. Quoting <em>The Stenrich Group v. Jemmott, </em>251 Va. 186, 199, 467 S.E.2d 795, 802 (1996), the commission stated that \u201cjob-related impairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion, however labeled or however defined, are, as a matter of law, not compensable under the present provisions of the Act.\u201d The commission then found that \u201c[t]he evidence does not establish that cumulative traumatic insults resulting from repetitive motion caused the claimant\u2019s condition.\u201d The commission also found that allergic contact dermatitis is caused by \u201cexposure over time to a particular causative agent resulting in an adverse reaction in the form of contact dermatitis.\u201d The commission reasoned that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was not barred from compensation under <em>Jemmott </em>because it did not result from a cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion. The commission concluded that allergic contact dermatitis was a compensable occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">\u201cFLORIST\u2019S ALLERGIC CONTACT DERMATITIS\u201d AS A COMPENSABLE DISEASE UNDER THE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Appellant contends the commission erred as a matter of law when it concluded that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>was a compensable disease. It argues that allergic contact dermatitis is a \u201ccumulative trauma\u201d condition and cannot be compensated under the Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Although a condition caused by \u201ccumulative trauma\u201d cannot be a \u201cdisease\u201d under the Act as that term has been construed by our Supreme Court, <em>see Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 199, 467 S.E.2d at 802; <em>Merillat Indus., Inc. v. Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 438, 436 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1993) (citing <em>Morris v. Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 586, 385 S.E.2d 858, 863 (1989)); <em>see also Allied Fibers v. Rhodes, </em>23 Va.App. 101, 104, 474 S.E.2d 829, 830 (1996), the record in this case established that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis, although incurred over time, was <em>not </em>caused by the process of \u201ctrauma.\u201d Thus, we first hold that allergic contact dermatitis is not excluded <em>per se </em>from coverage as a disease under the Act. Turning to the legal aspect of the mixed question presented by this case, we hold as a matter of law that \u201cflorist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis\u201d qualifies as a disease under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">This case compels us to revisit an issue of some uncertainty in Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation jurisprudence: the General Assembly\u2019s intended meaning of the word \u201cdisease\u201d in the Act. As has often been stated, the Act currently provides coverage for impairments arising out of and in the course of employment that fall into one of two categories: (1) \u201cinjury by accident\u201d or (2) \u201coccupational disease.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101; <em>see Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 192-93, 467 S.E.2d at 798-99; <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 431, 436 S.E.2d at 600-01; <em>Holly Farms/Federal Co. v. Yancey, </em>228 Va. 337, 340, 321 S.E.2d 298, 299 (1984). Although used repeatedly in the text of the Act, the word \u201cdisease\u201d was not defined by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The Supreme Court has set forth some basic parameters for determining whether a particular impairment or condition was intended by the General Assembly to be compensated as a \u201cdisease\u201d under the Act. First, the Court has stated that when the General Assembly added \u201coccupational diseases\u201d to those impairments covered by the Act in 1944, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>intended this coverage to be \u201ccarefully limited.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 584, 385 S.E.2d at 862. In addition, in order for a condition to be compensable as an occupational disease, it \u201cmust first qualify as a disease.\u201d <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 432, 436 S.E.2d at 601. As such, whether an impairment or condition is a compensable \u201cdisease\u201d is a mixed question of law and fact that is reviewable on appeal. <em>See Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 192, 467 S.E.2d at 798. The \u201cfactual part\u201d of the mixed question includes both the nature and causation of a claimant\u2019s ailment. <em>See id. </em>The \u201clegal part\u201d of the mixed question involves deciding \u201cwhether these impairments ... constitute diseases within the contemplation of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(also stating that \u201cthe crucial inquiry is whether the Commission correctly applied the law to the established facts\u201d). Medical evidence that a particular condition is considered a disease, standing alone, is not dispositive of whether the condition is covered under the Act as a disease. <em>See id. </em>at 198, 467 S.E.2d at 801 (stating that \u201cjust because a doctor opines that a particular impairment is a disease does not necessarily make it so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Regarding the substantive meaning of the word \u201cdisease\u201d under the Act, the Supreme Court has eschewed the approach of setting forth a \u201cbright line\u201d definition of disease. Instead, the Supreme Court has only defined disease in the negative, stating what the term \u201cdisease\u201d does <em>not </em>mean. According to the Supreme Court, the General Assembly\u2019s intended meaning of \u201cdisease\u201d is not so broad as to \u201cencompass any bodily ailment of whatever origin,\u201d <em>Yancey, </em>228 Va. at 340, 321 S.E.2d at 300, or to \u201cexpand[ ] the limits of coverage to a point where the Workers\u2019 Compensation scheme would amount to a general plan of health insurance.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 584, 385 S.E.2d at 862. In addition, the meaning of \u201cdisease\u201d under the Act is not the same as the definition of this term that appears in <em>The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary. See Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 197-98, 467 S.E.2d at 801-02.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the Court has held that the \u201cdisease\u201d cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>gory under the Act does not include either \u201cimpairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion\u201d or \u201cgradually incurred traumatic injuries or cumulative trauma conditions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 467 S.E.2d at 802 (citing <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 438, 436 S.E.2d at 601-02, and interpreting its holding in Morris); <em>see also Rhodes, </em>23 Va.App. at 104, 474 S.E.2d at 830 (stating that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court\u2019s holding [in Jemmott] ... leaves no doubt that in Virginia cumulative trauma conditions, regardless of whether they are caused by repetitive motion, are not compensable under the Act\u201d). A corollary of the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of proposed definitions of disease in <em>Yancey </em>and <em>Jemmott </em>is that whether a particular ailment is a \u201cdisease\u201d under the Act is determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Turning to the facts of this case, we disagree with appellant\u2019s contention that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is a \u201ccumulative trauma\u201d condition. The commission\u2019s factual finding that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis did not result from \u201ccumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion\u201d is supported by credible evidence and is binding on appeal. Furthermore, the evidence in the record established that allergic contact dermatitis is not caused by the process of \u201ctrauma.\u201d Therefore, we hold that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is not a \u201ccumulative trauma\u201d condition and is thus not barred <em>per se </em>from qualifying as a compensable disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">If supported by credible evidence in the record, the commission\u2019s factual findings are binding on appeal. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706. Although whether a particular disease qualifies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>for compensation under the Act is a question of law, whether a particular ailment is caused by cumulative trauma or through some other process is a question of fact. <em>Cf. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Musick, </em>7 Va.App. 684, 688, 376 S.E.2d 814, 817 (1989) (stating that \u201cthe actual determination of causation is a factual finding\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s factual finding that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was not caused by \u201ccumulative traumatic insults resulting from repetitive motion.\u201d The record indicates that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was not causally linked to any repetitive motion that she performed at work. Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by the reaction of an individual\u2019s immune system with a substance, such as chemicals contained in certain flowers, to which that individual has developed a hypersensitivity. Hoogasian I, <em>swpra, </em>at 96; Hoogasian II, <em>supra, </em>at 76, 77; Adams, <em>supra </em>at 1, 4. It is not caused by the wear and tear associated with a repetitive motion. Although claimant\u2019s duties included designing and constructing floral arrangements and \u201cprocessing\u201d flowers delivered to appellant\u2019s store, no evidence linked the motions associated with these activities to the outbreak of dermatitis on claimant\u2019s hands and arms. Because credible evidence supports this factual finding, it is binding on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was a \u201ccumulative trauma condition\u201d is flawed and based upon an incomplete reading of the record. Appellant argues that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was caused by \u201ccumulative traumatic exposure to chemicals in alstroemeria and tulips.\u201d This understanding of the causation of claimant\u2019s ailment is irreconcilable with the evidence in the record on this issue. Claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was not caused by the \u201ctraumatic\u201d impact of floral chemicals upon her skin; it was caused by the reaction of antibodies produced by claimant\u2019s immune system with the chemical contained in the flowers that eventually manifested itself in claimant\u2019s contact dermatitis.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>The articles contained in the record state that allergic contact dermatitis results when a person develops an allergic sensitivity to a substance, which in claimant\u2019s case was a chemical contained in alstroemeria and tulips. <em>See </em>Hoogasian I, <em>supra, </em>at 96-97, 99; Hoogasian II, <em>supra, </em>at 76, 77; Adams, <em>supra </em>at 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An allergic reaction is an \u201cimmunological reaction\u201d between an allergen and antibodies produced by an individual\u2019s immune system that causes discomfort to the allergic individual.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 6 <em>Lawyers\u2019 Medical Cyclopedia </em>\u00a7 45A.1 (James G. Zimmerly ed., 3d ed.1991); <em>see </em>6 <em>Ausman &amp; Snyder\u2019s Medical Library (Lawyers Edition) </em>\u00a7 11:1 (1990); Hoogasian II, <em>supra, </em>at 77. The reaction between allergen and antibody releases \u201cpharmacologically active substances [that] cause inflammation and produce symptoms.\u201d 6 <em>Lawyers\u2019 Medical Cyclopedia </em>\u00a7 45A.2. The substance or allergen that causes the allergic reaction \u201cusually does not produce a skin reaction on normal skin on first exposure, but ... may do so on a subsequent exposure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 45A.1; <em>see </em>Hoogasian I, <em>supra, </em>at 96-97; Hoogasian II, <em>supra, </em>at 77. Thus, claimant\u2019s hypersensitivity to the floral chemical developed as antibodies in her immune system began reacting abnormally with the allergen contained in the flowers. This biochemical process through which the sensitivity of claimant\u2019s immune system to floral allergens was gradually heightened is not the result of \u201ctrauma\u201d which is typically associated with <em>physical </em>injury to the body. <em>See The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary </em>745 (1987) (defining \u201ctrauma\u201d as \u201ca wound or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>injury, whether physical or psychic\u201d). Because trauma does not play a part in the development of an allergic sensitivity to a particular allergen, claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis was not a \u201ccumulative trauma\u201d condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The absence of a traumatic process in the development of claimant\u2019s allergic sensitivity to alstroemeria and tulips distinguishes this case from <em>Allied Fibers v. Rhodes, </em>23 Va.App. 101, 474 S.E.2d 829 (1996). In <em>Rhodes, </em>this Court held that bilateral sensorineural hearing loss due to noise exposure did not qualify as a disease because it was a cumulative trauma condition. <em>See Rhodes, </em>23 Va.App. at 105, 474 S.E.2d at 831. The record in <em>Rhodes </em>established that hearing loss due to noise exposure is caused by physical damage to the outer hair cells in the cochlea that results in \u201ctheir [inability to vibrate in response to sound.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104, 474 S.E.2d at 830. The evidence in that case also established that \u201c[njoise damage to sensorineural hearing belongs under the general heading of traumatic injury <em>because it is strictly a physical force.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Unlike the ailment in <em>Rhodes, </em>the hyper-sensitization of claimant\u2019s immune system to the allergens in alstroemeria and tulips was not caused by the type of physical force associated with \u201ctrauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Appellant also contends that this case is controlled by <em>United Airlines, Inc. v. Walter, </em>24 Va.App. 394, 482 S.E.2d 849 (1997). In <em>Walter, </em>this Court held that photosensitivity to fluorescent lighting is an injury rather than a disease. <em>See Walter, </em>24 Va.App. at 396-97, 482 S.E.2d at 850-51. However, the <em>Walter </em>opinion does not contain sufficient facts regarding the causation of photosensitivity to be considered controlling authority. The opinion contains no description of the process through which an individual develops a sensitivity to fluorescent light. The opinion merely states that the claimant was diagnosed with photosensitivity that was \u201cgradually incurred,\u201d and then offers a dictionary definition of the ailment. <em>See id. </em>at 395, 396-97, 482 S.E.2d at 850, 850-51 (stating that <em>The Sloane-Dorland Annotated Medical-Legal Dictionary </em>defines photosensitivity as \u201can \u2018abnormal reactivity of the skin to sunlight\u2019 \u201d). Due to this dearth of information, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ascertain whether photosensitivity is caused by trauma or some other process. Thus, we hold that <em>Walter </em>is unsuitable for comparison to other ailments and that its holding is necessarily limited to its facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Having decided that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is not a \u201ccumulative trauma\u201d condition that is barred <em>per se </em>from compensation under the Act, we next consider whether it is a compensable disease as a matter of law. We hold that, based on the policies underlying the Supreme Court\u2019s prior construction of the term \u201cdisease,\u201d the purpose of the Act, and the nature of claimant\u2019s ailment, the General Assembly intended its \u201ccarefully limited\u201d coverage of occupational diseases to include allergic contact dermatitis caused by exposure to floral allergens in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">A review of the Supreme Court\u2019s three major cases in this area, <em>Yancey, Merillat, </em>and <em>Jemmott, </em>indicates that two primary policy considerations underlie the Court\u2019s construction of the term \u201cdisease.\u201d First, the Supreme Court has rejected \u201cbroad\u201d definitions of disease in order to maintain the coherence of the current \u201cinjury-by-accident/occupational-disease\u201d dichotomy in a manner consistent with the principles of statutory construction. <em>See Monument Associates v. Arlington County Bd, </em>242 Va. 145, 149, 408 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1991) (stating that statutes \u201cshould be interpreted, if possible, in a manner which gives meaning to every word\u201d); <em>see also Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 198, 467 S.E.2d at 801-02 (rejecting the <em>Piedmont </em>definition of \u201cdisease\u201d because \u201cit ... \u2018would make unnecessary and meaningless the two categories specifically set forth in the Act\u2019 \u201d); <em>Merillat, </em>246 Va. at 433, 436 S.E.2d at 601-02 (stating that the Court has rejected previous invitations to broaden the scope of the Act based on its conclusion \u201cthat the categories of compensable injuries created by the legislature \u2014 accidental injury and occupational disease \u2014 are separate, meaningful categories\u201d); <em>Yancey, </em>228 Va. at 340, 321 S.E.2d at 300 (rejecting a broad definition of disease because it would make \u201cunnecessary and meaningless\u201d the \u201cinjury-by-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>accident/occupational-disease\u201d dichotomy). Second, the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions evince its intent to prevent claimants from pretextually using the \u201cdisease\u201d category of impairments as a loophole to obtain benefits for \u201ccumulative trauma\u201d conditions that are otherwise non-compensable as \u201cinjuries by accident.\u201d <em>See Jemmott, </em>251 Va. at 194-97,199, 467 S.E.2d at 799-801, 802 (summarizing prior cases in which claimants have sought to classify gradually-incurred injuries as occupational diseases and stating that impairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion are not compensable under the present provisions of the act \u201chowever labeled or however defined\u201d by claimants).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Neither of these policy concerns is implicated by concluding that florist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is a compensable \u201cdisease\u201d under the Act. First, holding that florist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis qualifies as a disease would not threaten the coherence of the existing distinction between \u201cinjuries by accident\u201d and \u201coccupational diseases.\u201d The development of an allergic sensitivity to floral allergens cannot be confused with an \u201cinjury\u201d because it is not a \u201cmechanical or structural change in the body.\u201d <em>Virginia Elec. and Power Co. v. Cogbill, </em>223 Va. 354, 356, 288 S.E.2d 485, 486 (1982) (stating that an injury is \u201can obvious ... mechanical or structural change in the body\u201d). Claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis occurred as a result of exposure to a chemical contained in two flowers: alstroemeria and tulips. Through a process that involved neither \u201crepetitive motion\u201d nor \u201ccumulative trauma,\u201d the chemical reacted with claimant\u2019s antibodies in a way that caused her immune system to develop a hypersensitivity to the chemical. Although claimant\u2019s allergic sensitivity to the allergen in these flowers had a physical manifestation \u2014 the contact dermatitis on her hands and arms \u2014 her underlying problem cannot be understood as an \u201cinjury.\u201d Unlike prior attempts to set forth all-purpose definitions of disease, narrowly holding that florist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is within the General Assembly\u2019s intended meaning of \u201cdisease\u201d does not render the two categories of ailments \u201cunnecessary and meaningless,\u201d <em>Yancey, </em>228 Va. at 341, 321 S.E.2d at 300, or threaten to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>convert the Act into \u201ca general plan of health insurance.\u201d <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 584, 385 S.E.2d at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Ironically, accepting appellant\u2019s contention that florist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is <em>not </em>a disease would threaten the integrity of the \u201cinjury-by-accident/occupational-disease\u201d distinction. Although the Supreme Court has repeatedly warned of the dangers of a definition of disease that is too broad, the hazards of a concept of disease that is <em>too narrow </em>are equally apparent. As previously discussed, the record in this case established that allergic contact dermatitis was not caused by a process of \u201ccumulative trauma\u201d to claimant. Many ailments that have been traditionally considered to be occupational diseases manifest themselves over time. Unlike the coverage of injuries under the Act, the General Assembly\u2019s \u201ccarefully limited\u201d coverage of diseases is not confined to \u201cdiseases by accident\u201d as currently written. Were we to hold that a non-trauma-related condition such as allergic contact dermatitis does not qualify as a disease under the Act, we would move one step closer to creating an incomprehensible \u201cslippery slope\u201d under which <em>all </em>gradually incurred ailments, regardless of whether they are caused by trauma, fail to qualify as \u201cdiseases\u201d under the Act. Such an interpretation of \u201cdisease\u201d finds no support in <em>Yancey, Merillat, </em>or <em>Jemmott </em>and would render the \u201cdisease\u201d category of ailments a nullity.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">A [concept] of either \u201cinjury\u201d or \u201cdisease\u201d that is so [narrow] as to encompass [no] bodily ailment of whatever origin is too [narrow] because it would make unnecessary and meaningless the two categories specifically set forth in the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\"><em>Yancey, </em>228 Va. at 340, 321 S.E.2d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Likewise, narrowly holding that florist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is a compensable disease does not open the floodgates of compensation to claimants who might use sophistic arguments to categorize conditions truly caused by cumulative trauma as \u201cdiseases.\u201d Florist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is a well-defined ailment that is caused by a distinctive, non-traumatic process. It is thus distinguishable from \u201ccumulative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>trauma\u201d conditions and, therefore, cannot be used to expand the disease category to permit coverage for trauma-related injuries that are excluded from compensation under the \u201cinjury-by-aecident\u201d category.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Finally, we conclude that the General Assembly intended its \u201ccarefully limited\u201d coverage of occupational diseases to include florist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis. The General Assembly enacted the Act for the purpose of compensating employees for accidental injuries and certain diseases \u201cwithin the hazards of the employment.\u201d <em>See Morris, </em>238 Va. at 584, 385 S.E.2d at 861-62. The General Assembly has defined the phrase \u201coccupational disease\u201d to mean \u201ca disease arising out of and in the course of employment, but not an ordinary disease of life to which the general public is exposed outside of the employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-400(A). Appellant does not contest and the record conclusively proves that claimant\u2019s allergy to alstroemeria and tulips arose out of and in the course of her employment. The record also established that the development of an allergic sensitivity to floral allergens is a hazard peculiar to employment in the floral industry. Dr. Magee stated that allergic contact dermatitis is \u201ca very common problem with florists.\u201d One article stated that \u201c[tjhere is little or no fear\u201d that the public will develop allergic sensitivity to the allergen in alstroemeria because \u201ctheir actual involvement with the flower is limited.\u201d Hoogasian I, <em>supra, </em>at 98. According to Dr. Moshell, an allergic sensitivity to alstroemeria is likely to develop \u201c[o]nly in cases where there is constant contact with the juice of the alstroemeria, such as a designer or a sales employee would have----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Because covering florist\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis as a disease under the Act is consistent with the General Assembly\u2019s purpose and does not threaten to erode the \u201cinjury-by-accident/occupational-disease\u201d dichotomy or to create a loophole that enables compensation of gradually-incurred traumatic injuries, it is a compensable \u201cdisease\u201d as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-6\">.

Claimant began working as a florist for New Leaf, Inc. in October, 1993. Her daily duties included handling flowers, floral design and providing floral arrangements for weddings. At least once a week, she processed flowers, which included removing the flowers\u2019 foliage, cutting the flowers\u2019 stems and placing them in water.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">In March, 1995, claimant first noticed \u201cblisters\u201d and \u201ca splotchy area\u201d on her right index finger and palm. On August 30, 1995, Dr. John Carpenter, claimant\u2019s family doctor, diagnosed claimant\u2019s condition as dermatitis of unclear etiology. In November, 1995, Dr. Anna Magee, a dermatologist, diagnosed the condition as allergic contact dermatitis. Dr. Magee conducted a \u201cpatch test,\u201d which demonstrated that claimant exhibited an allergic reaction to alstroemeria and tulips. Dr. Magee concluded that this was an occupational disease caused by claimant\u2019s exposure on at \u201cleast two and probably more physical contacts with the chemicals contained in aistro[e]meria and tulips during her employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">At a hearing before the deputy commissioner, claimant testified that she was exposed to two types of flowers, alstroemeria and tulips, that caused her condition. Additionally, claimant testified that \u201c[a] lot of times what has happened to my hand doesn\u2019t happen on the first day or two. It\u2019s after you have worked with it time after time.\u201d Employer did not dispute claimant\u2019s exposure to these flowers or that claimant contracted this condition from her employment. The deputy commissioner entered an award in claimant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">The full commission affirmed the award of medical benefits and found claimant\u2019s contact dermatitis to be a compensable occupational disease. The commission found that claimant had a disease which was distinguishable from the impairments at issue in the repetitive motion line of cases. <em>See The Stenrich Group v.

The commission found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-5\">In the case at bar, there is no evidence that the claimant\u2019s condition resulted from \u201ccumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion,\u201d rather, the evidence reveals exposure over time to a particular causative agent resulting in an adverse reaction in the form of contact dermatitis. The evidence demonstrates that it is the irritant contained in the alstroemeria and the tulips that effects the skin changes which manifest as contact dermatitis. The evidence does not establish that cumulative traumatic insults resulting from repetitive motion have caused the claimant\u2019s condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Employer argues that claimant\u2019s allergic contact dermatitis is not compensable under Code \u00a7 65.2-400, because it was caused by cumulative exposure over an extended time to certain fresh flowers at her employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">A claimant seeking benefits under the Act must prove either \u201can injury by accident or an occupational disease \u2018arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holly Farms Foods, Inc. v.

Noting that the definition of a compensable \u201cinjury\u201d or \u201cdisease\u201d had created difficulties in previous cases, the Virginia Supreme Court in <em>The Stenrieh Group v. Jemmott, </em>251 Va. 186, 199, 467 S.E.2d 795, 802 (1996), spoke clearly in enunciating the rule regarding gradually incurred impairments. The Court unequivocally stated that \u201cjob-related impairments resulting from cumulative trauma caused by repetitive motion, however labeled or however defined, are, as a matter of law, not compensable under the present provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe are bound by decisions of the Supreme Court of Virginia and are without authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>overrule them.\u201d <em>Roane v.

Rhodes, </em>23 Va.App. 101, 474 S.E.2d 829 (1996), we held that a gradually incurred hearing loss was not compensable as an occupational disease.

We found the holding in <em>Jemmott </em>\u201cclear and unequivocal, [leaving] no doubt that in Virginia cumulative trauma conditions, regardless of whether they are caused by repetitive motion, are not compensable under the Act.\u201d <em>Rhodes, </em>23 Va.App. at 104, 474 S.E.2d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Similarly, in <em>United Airlines v.
