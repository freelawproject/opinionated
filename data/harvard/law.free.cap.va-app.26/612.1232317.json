Defendant complains on appeal that the trial court erroneously declined to suppress evidence seized during the execution of a search warrant at his residence. Defendant argues that the affidavit given in support of the warrant was tainted both by a material omission and with information obtained unconstitutionally by the affiant, requiring suppression of all evidence seized during the attendant search. Finding no error, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a suppression motion, we consider the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable to ... the prevailing party below,\u201d the Commonwealth in this instance, and the factual findings of the trial judge will be disturbed only if plainly wrong. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). Our consideration of the record includes evidence adduced at both the trial and the suppression hearing, if any. <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 577, 583, 359 S.E.2d 540, 542-43 (1987). However, \u201cas a general matter, determinations of ... probable cause should be reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal,\u201d with deference to a trial court\u2019s finding of \u201chistorical fact.\u201d <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). To prevail on appeal, the defendant must \u201cshow ... that the denial of [his] motion ... constitute[d] reversible error.\u201d <em>Motley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 439, 440-41, 437 S.E.2d 232, 233 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">On July 1, 1994, Norfolk Humane Officers Jody Shoulders and Mark Kumpf visited defendant\u2019s residence to investigate an \u201c[animal] cruelty complaint.\u201d In defendant\u2019s absence, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>wife admitted the officers to the home and adjoining, fenced rear yard, where they observed four adult pit bull dogs \u201c[o]n very, very heavy chains,\u201d a pit bull puppy confined in a \u201ckennel carrier,\u201d \u201cquite a bit ... of feces,\u201d and \u201cno water.\u201d Inside the residence, Shoulders noticed items \u201cconsistent with individuals engaged in breeding and fighting pit bull dogs for sport,\u201d including \u201cinjectable materials,\u201d a periodical entitled \u201cGame Dog Times,\u201d and canine pedigree documents. Because defendant\u2019s wife was unable to locate vaccination certificates or city licenses for the dogs, and none were found among city records, Shoulders left a notice with defendant\u2019s wife, directing that he contact Shoulders concerning licensure and care of the animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">When defendant failed to respond to the notice, Shoulders resumed her investigation in January, 1995, learned that no dogs had been licensed to defendant\u2019s residence following the July, 1994 visit, and returned to defendant\u2019s home on the morning of January 31, 1995. On arrival, Shoulders noticed a car in the driveway, and, while standing on the public sidewalk, saw \u201cthings moving through the slats of the [back yard] fence.\u201d The odor of animal waste and a cacophony of \u201cmultiple dogs barking\u201d emanating from the rear of the house were also detectable from the sidewalk. Receiving no answer to her knock at defendant\u2019s front door, Shoulders \u201cstepped off the front porch ... [and] went down a very short driveway to the fence to see what the animals were barking about, if they were okay and [if] someone was possibly in the back yard.\u201d The \u201cdriveway area\u201d was an \u201copen space,\u201d with no signs warning away trespassers, which afforded an unobstructed view from the sidewalk to the fence. Shoulders called, \u201chello, hello,\u201d but heard no response above the din of \u201csix Pit Bulls barking all at once.\u201d The rear yard was visible to Shoulders through \u201clarge spaces between the [fence] slats,\u201d and she saw \u201csix dogs ... chained to different structures^] ... no water ... [,] and quite a bit of fecal matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Based upon her observations, Shoulders immediately obtained a warrant to search defendant\u2019s \u201cresidential dwelling, its curtilage and its environs\u201d for evidence of violations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>several city ordinances. The following \u201cmaterial facts constituting probable cause\u201d were set forth in the attendant affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">On January 31, 1995, your affiant went to 2136 Ballentine Boulevard, Norfolk, VA 23509, at approximately 11:15 a.m. I observed six (6) adult dogs in the back yard on heavy chains. No food or water was visible for the animals. A check of 1994 and 1995 city licenses showed no licenses on file for thqat [sic] address. On July 1, 1994, your affiant investigated a cruelty complaint at 2136 Ballentine Boulevard, Norfolk, VA 23509. Your affiant was given consent to examine the four (4) pitbulls and one (1) pitbull puppy on the property. While on the property, your affiant observed a bottle labeled injectable Vitamin E and other unlabeled bottled injectable substances.... Your affiant also observed several periodicals including \u201cGame Dog Times.\u201d In theis [sic] officer\u2019s experience, such documents and medications are consistent with individuals engaged in breeding and fighting pitbull dogs for sport.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">A check of DMV files for Virginia ICE MANI, showed vehicle registration to David D. Williams at 2316 Ballentine Blvd., Norfolk, VA 23509. A check of Norfolk tracer indicated previous arrests for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, carrying concealed weapons, etc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtE\">Shoulders, accompanied by several officers, executed the search warrant on the afternoon of January 31, 1995, and discovered the offending firearm, together with evidence of numerous other crimes not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Defendant first argues that the \u201cprimary basis in the affidavit sworn to by Officer Shoulders\u201d in support of probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>cause for the search warrant \u201cwas information she observed on January 31, 1995 while trespassing onto\u201d defendant\u2019s property. He maintains that Shoulders\u2019 failure to advise the magistrate that she saw the \u201csix pit bulls\u201d while unconstitutionally invading the curtilage of his residence and gazing through his \u201cprivacy fence\u201d constituted a \u201cmaterial omission ... made in reckless disregard for the truth----\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relying upon <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), defendant reasons that such \u201ctainted information in the affidavit\u201d must be \u201cset aside,\u201d leaving the warrant without the requisite probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In <em>Franks, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request. In the event that at that hearing the allegation of perjury or reckless disregard is established by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence, and, with the affidavit\u2019s false material set to one side, the affidavit\u2019s remaining content is insufficient to establish probable cause, the search warrant must be voided and the fruits of the search excluded to the same extent as if probable cause was lacking on the face of the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. at 2676-77, <em>see also West v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 679, 689, 432 S.E.2d 730, 736-37 (1993). For purposes of this appeal, we treat the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress as a <em>Franks </em>hearing, despite the absence of \u201cany <em>preliminary </em>showing\u201d by defendant of police misconduct. <em>West, </em>16 Va.App. at 689, 432 S.E.2d at 737 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Defendant correctly asserts .that <em>\u201cFranks </em>protects against omissions that are <em>designed to mislead, </em>or that are made in <em>reckless disregard of whether they would mislead, </em>the magistrate ... [;] [however,] \u2018mere negligen[ce] in ... recording the facts relevant to a probable-cause determination\u2019 is not enough.\u201d <em>United States v. Colkley, </em>899 F.2d 297, 300 (4th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 170, 98 S.Ct. at 2683); <em>see West, </em>16 Va.App. at 689-90, 432 S.E.2d at 736-37. Thus, to prevail in a <em>Franks </em>challenge, an accused must allege and prove \u201cmore than [an] \u2018intentional\u2019 omission.\u201d <em>Colkley, </em>899 F.2d at 301. This principle is consistent with the remedial purpose of the exclusionary rule, \u201cto deter police <em>misconduct </em>by denying illegally obtained evidence from being admitted in [a] defendant\u2019s criminal trial.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 172, 175, 462 S.E.2d 907, 909 (1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Here, defendant offered no evidence that established either a design to deceive the magistrate or recklessness in Shoulders\u2019 omission of \u201cmaterial\u201d information from the affidavit, and nothing in the record suggests such misconduct. Accordingly, in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial court concluded that \u201cthe officer neither intentionally nor recklessly misled the magistrate,\u201d a factual finding supported by the record and which renders defendant\u2019s <em>Franks </em>claim meritless. <em>See West, </em>16 Va.App. at 689, 432 S.E.2d at 737; <em>Moats v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 349, 355, 404 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Defendant next urges that, irrespective of <em>Franks, </em>the disputed search was dependent upon the authority of a warrant supported by an affidavit \u201ctainted by the prior illegal entry onto defendant\u2019s property,\u201d a circumstance requiring suppression of the resulting evidence as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>See Commonwealth v. Ealy, </em>12 Va.App. 744, 754-55, 407 S.E.2d 681, 688 (1991). Defendant acknowledges on brief that Shoulders \u201clawfully obtained\u201d information that dogs were present at the residence \u201cfrom their barking and ... odor,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>conditions \u201cobservable\u201d from the public sidewalk, without invading the curtilage. Hence, his challenge embraces only that information gathered from Shoulders\u2019 view of the dogs through the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">It is well established that \u201c[t]he inclusion of tainted evidence does not invalidate a search warrant,\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>991 F.2d 1182, 1186 (4th Cir.1993) (citing <em>United States v. Whitehom, </em>813 F.2d 646, 649 (4th Cir.1987)), and suppression is not required \u201cif, excluding the illegally obtained information, probable cause for the issuance of the warrant could still be found.\u201d <em>United States v. Apple, </em>915 F.2d 899, 910 (4th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Gillenwaters, </em>890 F.2d 679, 681 (4th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Hawkins, </em>788 F.2d 200, 203-04 (4th Cir.1986) (court properly deleted challenged wiretap information from the affidavit before making a probable cause determination); <em>cf. Derr v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 215, 221-22, 368 S.E.2d 916, 919 (1988) (in assessing probable cause to conduct a warrantless search under the \u201cautomobile exception,\u201d evidence properly obtained is admitted, while evidence resulting from an unconstitutional search is suppressed).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Thus, if we adopt defendant\u2019s argument, any taint in Shoulders\u2019 affidavit is cured by the following redactions: \u201cI observed six-(6)-adalt dogs in the back yard on heavy-chains. No-feod-er water was visible for the animals.\u201d The remainder of the affidavit then recites that Shoulders visited defendant\u2019s home on the morning of January 31, 1995, and \u201cobserved ... dogs in the back yard\u201d of a residence to which no dog licenses were of record with the city. Such circumstances, together with the information gathered on July 1,1994, also set forth in the affidavit, clearly provided probable cause to believe that dogs were present on the premises in violation of City Code \u00a7\u00a7 6-11 and 6-79. <em>See Gwinn v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 972, 975-76, 434 S.E.2d 901, 904 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>no error in admitting the disputed evidence and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b662-9\">. The affidavit referenced the following violations of the Norfolk City Code: \u201d[m]aintaimng more than four dogs\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 6-5(d); \"[fjailure to vaccinate for rabies\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 6-102; \"[failure to pay city dog license tax,\" in violation of Code \u00a7 6-79; and \"[Qailure to provide the duties of ownership\u201d in violation of Code \u00a7 6-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\">. The trial judge concluded that the \"enclosed back yard and side yard were within the curtilage.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">. \"In dealing with probable cause ... as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities.
