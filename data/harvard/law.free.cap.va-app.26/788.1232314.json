On appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>defendant complains (1) he was denied the right of speedy trial guaranteed by Code \u00a7 19.2-243, and (2) the trial court erroneously refused to permit his counsel to withdraw and testify to impeach a Commonwealth witness. Finding no error, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">In accordance with well established principles, we review the evidence in \u201cthe light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\u201d granting to it \u201call reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The victim, Tony Woods, was awakened at approximately 3:00 a.m. by a knock at the door of a female friend\u2019s home located in the City of Portsmouth. Opening the door, Woods was met by Anthony Smith, a longtime acquaintance, asking to borrow money. Woods declined and ordered Smith to leave. Within minutes, however, Smith returned and Woods again directed him off the property. When Woods responded to a third knock at the door, Smith was accompanied by defendant, who shot Woods several times from a distance of \u201cabout five feet.\u201d Defendant then attempted to enter the house, but Woods closed the door and \u201claid down on the floor.\u201d Woods had known defendant for several years, and defendant had threatened to \u201cshoot him right now\u201d just two days before the instant offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Portsmouth Police Officer Charles Sotomayor was dispatched to the residence, spoke to Woods for approximately \u201ctwo ... to five minutes\u201d and prepared an \u201cinitial offense report\u201d \u201csummar[Mng] ... what was related to [him]\u201d by Woods. The report described a single \u201csuspect,\u201d Anthony Smith, and was submitted by Sotomayor to his supervisor on the morning of the shooting. Woods, however, insisted at trial that he also named \u201cGreg,\u201d defendant, to police at the crime scene. Sotomayor testified that Woods first mentioned defendant the following evening and that Sotomayor related this additional information directly to the investigating detective rather than prepare a supplemental report.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The relevant procedural history is uncontroverted. On January 9, 1996, the district court found probable cause at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>preliminary hearing on the offenses and certified the charges to the trial court. A grand jury indicted defendant on February 1, 1996. Trial commenced on April 23, 1996, ending in a mistrial on defendant\u2019s motion as a result of deficiencies in the Commonwealth\u2019s response to previously ordered discovery. In granting defendant\u2019s motion, however, the trial court specifically found \u201cno intentional failure\u201d by the Commonwealth to comply with the order. A second trial began on August 15, 1996, but also ended in a mistrial, granted on motion of defendant after Woods testified that defendant \u201cused to sell drugs to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The instant trial commenced on September 30,1996. At the inception of the proceedings, defendant moved the court to dismiss the indictments because the trial had not commenced within the five-month period prescribed by Code \u00a7 19.2-243.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied defendant\u2019s motion, a ruling defendant challenges on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">During trial and after the Commonwealth had rested its case, defense counsel advised the court that he and Officer Sotomayor had previously discussed inconsistencies between information attributed to Woods on Sotomayor\u2019s offense report and Woods\u2019 recollection of events at trial. Counsel proffered Sotomayor\u2019s explanation to him, which differed from his testimony at trial, and sought leave to withdraw and offer himself as a defense witness to impeach Sotomayor. After entertaining argument, the court denied counsel\u2019s motion and continued with trial, which concluded in convictions of defendant on both indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">\n<em>Speedy Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-243 provides, in pertinent part, that an accused \u201cshall be forever discharged from prosecution ... if no trial is commenced ... within five months from the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>... probable cause was found by the district court.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-243. The statute specifically excludes \u201csuch period of time as the failure to try the accused was caused\u201d by several enumerated circumstances. However, \u201c[t]he specified reasons for excusable delay listed in the statute are not exclusive; other similar circumstances may excuse delay in trying the accused within the designated time.\u201d <em>Adkins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 519, 521, 414 S.E.2d 188, 189 (1992) (citing <em>Stephens v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 224, 230, 301 S.E.2d 22, 25 (1983)). \u201c[S]ome delay is unavoidable and some is essential to due process.\u201d <em>Stephens, </em>225 Va. at 231, 301 S.E.2d at 26. Thus, \u201c[i]f the record shows that the delay was due to one of the justifiable reasons specified in the Code, or a reason of a similar nature, that delay will not bar a later trial.\u201d <em>Bunton v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 557, 559, 370 S.E.2d 470, 471 (1988) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Defendant contends that the April, 1996 mistrial was necessitated by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to comply with the prior discovery order. He, therefore, reasons that the Commonwealth was not exempted from the time constraints of Code \u00a7 19.2-243, which required trial to commence within five months of the preliminary hearing date, January 9, 1996, a limitation that barred the instant prosecution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">\u201cCode \u00a7 19.2-243 uses the word \u2018commenced\u2019 repeatedly and purposefully to define compliance with the time periods prescribed as the statutory measure of ... a speedy trial.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 425, 428, 478 S.E.2d 539, 540 (1996). Thus, it clearly \u201caddresses the commencement of trial, not the conclusion of proceedings.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 637, 640, 453 S.E.2d 914, 915 (1995); <em>see Riddick v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 136, 138, 468.S.E.2d 135, 138 (1996). This well established principle is consonant with the \u201c \u2018object of the statute ... to secure a \u201cspeedy trial\u201d \u2019 \u201d for the accused, while recognizing that \u2018\u201cwhere the accused is actually brought to trial within the time required by statute, but from some adventitious cause, without fault on the part of the Commonwealth, ... final judgment cannot be entered during such [time], the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>has been sufficiently complied with.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>252 Va. at 428, 478 S.E.2d at 540-41 (quoting <em>Butts v. Commonwealth, </em>145 Va. 800, 808, 133 S.E. 764, 766 (1926)).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">A mistrial generally results from \u201csome adventitious cause\u201d that impairs due process or otherwise thwarts the proper administration of justice. Therefore, when a prosecution is disrupted by mistrial, the commencement of such trial, if timely, satisfies the statutory mandate and excludes subsequent retrials from the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-243. This result is especially appropriate where, as here, the remedy of mistrial was granted upon motion of the accused, without evidence of machinations by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Brandon v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 82, 89, 467 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1996). Defendant\u2019s April trial was commenced timely, and the subject trial \u201cwas but an extension of that same proceeding, based upon the same indictment and process and following a regular, continuous order\u201d and without \u201cimplicating a new speedy trial time frame.\u201d <em>Morgan, </em>19 Va.App. at 639, 453 S.E.2d at 915.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">\n<em>Withdrawal of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The defendant next asserts the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow defense counsel to withdraw and testify, thereby denying defendant the right to impeach Sotomayor through proof of inconsistencies between his trial testimony and prior statements allegedly made in conversation with counsel. In support of his argument, defendant relies upon Rule 5-102(A) of the Disciplinary Rules of the Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>Code of Professional Responsibility which provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201c[i]f, after undertaking employment in contemplated or pending litigation, a lawyer learns or it is obvious that he ... ought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client, he shall withdraw from the conduct of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Initially, \u201c[w]e question the propriety of equating the force of a disciplinary rule with that of decisional or statutory law.\u201d <em>See Shuttleworth, Ruloff, and Giordano, P.C. v. Nutter, </em>254 Va. 494, 498, 493 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1997). Notwithstanding this concern, however, a decision to permit counsel to withdraw mid-trial rests with the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 587, 592-93, 466 S.E.2d 741, 743-44 (1996); <em>Terrell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 285, 293, 403 S.E.2d 387, 391 (1991). When defendant\u2019s counsel failed to cross-examine Officer Sotomayor relative to the alleged inconsistent statements to counsel, he failed to lay a proper foundation necessary to impeach Sotomayor through testimony regarding such statements. <em>See </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 4-3(c) (4th ed.1993). Thus, impeachment of Sotomayor by counsel\u2019s testimony would have been impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\">. It is not disputed that defendant was \u201cheld continuously in custody ... from the date ... probable cause was found by the district court.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-243.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">. In the event bad faith or other prosecutional misconduct precipitates a mistrial, an accused is insulated from further prosecution by the double jeopardy safeguards of the United States Constitution, <em>see Brandon v. Commonwealth, 22 </em>Va.App. 82, 91, 467 S.E.2d 859, 863 (1996); <em>Kemph v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 335, 341, 437 S.E.2d 210, 213 (1993) (citing <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 676, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 2089-90, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982); <em>MacKenzie v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 236, 240, 380 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1989)), as well as the reasonableness and fairness protections of the constitutional speedy trial standard. <em>See Shavin v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 256, 267, 437 S.E.2d 411, 418 (1993) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
