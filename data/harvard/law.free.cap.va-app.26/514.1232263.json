On appeal, Maxey contends the trial court erred by allowing the Commonwealth to impeach his mother, called as a Commonwealth witness, with inconsistent statements she previously had given to a police investigator. Maxey argues the Commonwealth could not impeach his mother because she was not an adverse witness, and the Commonwealth knew prior to her testimony that she would testify unfavorably. We hold that appellant\u2019s mother was an adverse witness and, therefore, the Commonwealth could impeach her with her prior inconsistent statements. Accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Appellant was tried before a jury for the rape and abduction of his former wife, Christina Poore. Poore testified that on the day of the rape, she and three of her children went to the appellant\u2019s trailer to visit two of her other children who were in Maxey\u2019s custody. The trailer was located adjacent to the property of Rebecca Maxey (Mrs. Maxey), the appellant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">When Poore arrived, appellant invited her inside his trailer while the children were at his mother\u2019s home. According to Poore, once she was inside, appellant locked the door, physically forced her onto his bed, began taking her clothes off, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>told her he was going to have sexual intercourse with her. Poore resisted and began to scream. Poore testified that shortly thereafter, Mrs. Maxey entered the trailer with all five of Poore\u2019s children. She stated that Mrs. Maxey began to hit appellant and told him to get off Poore. When appellant reached for a file cabinet where he kept a gun, Mrs. Maxey and Poore struggled to restrain him. Appellant pushed his mother away and punched Poore in the left eye. Eventually, according to Poore, he grabbed the gun and demanded that Mrs. Maxey and the children leave the trailer. Poore also testified that the appellant warned Mrs. Maxey not to call anyone or he would \u201cblow [Poore\u2019s] head off.\u201d Poore claimed that after Mrs. Maxey and the children left the trailer, the appellant forcibly raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">After Poore testified, the Commonwealth called Mrs. Maxey as a witness. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney requested that Mrs. Maxey be declared an adverse witness because of her relationship to the appellant and that he be permitted to cross-examine her. Appellant asserted that his mother could not be declared an adverse witness based solely on her relationship to him. Appellant further informed the court and the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney that his mother\u2019s anticipated testimony would not substantiate Poore\u2019s account of the incident, as the Commonwealth may have anticipated. Thus, appellant argued, the Commonwealth could not claim surprise when Mrs. Maxey testified or claim that she was an adverse witness; therefore, it could not cross-examine her or impeach her with conflicting statements she may have previously made to the police investigator.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Out of the jury\u2019s presence, the judge conducted <em>voir dire </em>of Mrs. Maxey to preview her testimony. Mrs. Maxey stated that when she entered the appellant\u2019s trailer the door was not locked. She stated that appellant and Poore were merely arguing and watching television. She denied that she tried to keep appellant away from his gun, that she saw appellant strike Poore in the face, or that appellant threatened her. Mrs. Maxey did testify that Poore had a \u201cmark\u201d under her left <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>eye and that Poore told appellant that she wanted to leave the trailer and go home.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">After previewing Mrs. Maxey\u2019s proffered testimony, the court declared that she was an adverse witness because of her relationship to the appellant and because the Commonwealth was surprised by her unfavorable testimony. As a result, the court ruled that the Commonwealth could cross-examine her and could impeach her with any prior inconsistent statements she may have made to the investigator. The Commonwealth called Mrs. Maxey as an adverse witness, and she testified substantially as she did in <em>voir dire. </em>When confronted with and asked about the contradictory statements she allegedly had made to the investigator, she denied having made them. The Commonwealth was allowed to impeach Mrs. Maxey by calling the investigator, who testified that Mrs. M\u00e1xey had made a number of statements to him that were inconsistent with her testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The jury convicted Maxey for rape and abduction and recommended that he be sentenced to eighteen years in the penitentiary for rape and one year for abduction, which the trial judge imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">As a general rule at common law, a party was not allowed to impeach its own witness. <em>See Washington &amp; O.D. Ry. v. Jackson\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>117 Va. 636, 85 S.E. 496 (1915). A party calling a witness was considered to have vouched for the witness\u2019 credibility and was not allowed to prove that the witness was unworthy of belief, even if the witness spoke against the party in some respects. Spencer A. Gavel, <em>Jones on Evidence </em>\u00a7 26:10, at 194 (6th ed. 1972). By statute, the English Parliament long ago modified the common law rule to allow a party to impeach its own witness with prior inconsistent statements, provided the witness proved adverse. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, Virginia has enacted two statutes that impact the common law rule. Code \u00a7 8.01-403 allows a party producing a witness to \u201cprove that he has [previously] made a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>inconsistent with his present testimony,\u201d provided that witness \u201cproves adverse.\u201d Under Code \u00a7 8.01-401, a party may call a witness \u201chaving an adverse interest\u201d and \u201cmay examine such person according to the rules applicable to cross-examination.\u201d <em>See also Mast\u00edn v. Theirjung, </em>238 Va. 434, 439-40, 384 S.E.2d 86, 89 (1989). Although one commentator takes the view that the cases applying these two statutes do not clearly define the scope and circumstances when each statute will apply, <em>see </em>Charles E. Friend, <em>Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 4-9, at 147 (4th ed. 1993) (\u201cMuch confusion has resulted from the failure to distinguish between the witness who \u2018proves adverse\u2019 and the \u2018adverse witness.\u2019 \u201d), our common law clearly holds, albeit with little discussion, that a party may impeach a witness having an adverse interest with the witness\u2019 prior inconsistent statements. <em>See Stoots v. Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 857, 866, 66 S.E.2d 866, 871 (1951) (upholding trial court\u2019s decision to allow Commonwealth to call defendant\u2019s sister as adverse witness and contradict her testimony with her prior inconsistent statements). Thus, we consider whether either of the two statutes, in addition to the <em>Stoots </em>decision, authorized the trial court to allow the Commonwealth to impeach Mrs. Maxe/s testimony with her prior inconsistent statements.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Code \u00a7 8.01-403 permits the impeachment of a witness who \u201cproves adverse.\u201d The term \u201cadverse,\u201d under this section, refers to a witness whose testimony is \u201cinjurious or damaging to the case of the party who called the witness.\u201d <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 920, 434 S.E.2d 675, 680 (1993). A party\u2019s own witness <em>\u201cprove[s] </em>adverse\u201d if the witness \u201csurprise^] the party by changing stories or becoming hostile <em>on the stand.\u201d </em>Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4-9, at 147 (emphasis added); <em>see Roberts v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 264, 269-70, 337 S.E.2d 255, 259 (1985) (holding that witness proved adverse where prosecutor was \u201csurprised by what [his own witness] said when he began testifying\u201d). Thus, Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>\u00a7 8.01-403 allows a party to impeach his or her own witness by prior inconsistent statements only when the witness whom the party expected to testify favorably has suddenly given unexpected, adverse testimony on the stand. <em>See </em>Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4-9, at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In this case, the Commonwealth was not surprised when Mrs. Maxey testified unfavorably on the stand about some aspects of what she had seen. The Commonwealth was aware before Mrs. Maxey took the stand that parts of her testimony would conflict with parts of her earlier statements to the investigator and in some respects was injurious to its case. Accordingly, Mrs. Maxey did not \u201cprove adverse\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-403 and the Commonwealth could not impeach her testimony pursuant to that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-401(A), on the other hand, refers to calling a witness \u201chaving an adverse interest,\u201d or commonly referred to as an \u201cadverse witness.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Friend, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4-9, at 149-50. A witness does not have an \u201cadverse interest\u201d simply because his or her testimony is adverse or injurious to the calling party\u2019s case. <em>See Butler v. Parrocha, </em>186 Va. 426, 433, 43 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1947) (distinguishing witness \u201chaving an adverse interest\u201d from \u201cadverse testimony\u201d provided by witness who \u201cproves adverse\u201d within the meaning of statutory predecessor to Code \u00a7 8.01-403). Rather, an \u201cadverse witness\u201d is an opposing party or a nonparty witness who has a financial or <em>other personal interest </em>in the outcome of the case. <em>See Daniels v. Morris, </em>199 Va. 205, 211, 98 S.E.2d 694, 698 (1957); <em>Butler, </em>186 Va. at 431, 43 S.E.2d at 4. A witness who has a personal interest in the outcome of the case includes persons who are \u201cclosely connected by blood or otherwise to at least one party\u201d; thus, close relatives of a party are witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>who have an \u201cadverse interest\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 8.01-401(A). <em>Butler, </em>186 Va. at 434, 43 S.E.2d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Mrs. Maxey is appellant\u2019s mother. Although parts of her testimony were relevant and provided details of the facts surrounding the incident that led to the charges, some aspects of her testimony were not supportive of the Commonwealth\u2019s charges. Because of her close blood relationship to the appellant, Mrs. Maxey was an adverse witness. Although the Commonwealth could not have called Mrs. Maxey <em>solely </em>for the purpose of impeaching her with her prior statements, the Commonwealth was entitled to prove the relevant facts about which she testified. Because she was adverse to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth could impeach her with her contradictory statements. In <em>Stoots, </em>the Supreme Court upheld the trial court\u2019s ruling that allowed the Commonwealth to call the defendant\u2019s sister as an adverse witness and impeach her with her prior inconsistent statements. 192 Va. at 866, 66 S.E.2d at 871. Likewise, in this case, the Commonwealth was permitted to impeach Mrs. Maxey with her prior statements to the police investigator where her testimony was adverse to the Commonwealth\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 764, 71 S.E.2d 73 (1952), is misplaced. <em>Williams </em>held that a party may not call an adverse witness for the sole purpose of impeaching his or her testimony. 193 Va. at 769, 71 S.E.2d at 76. Irrespective of whether the trial court gives the jury a limiting instruction, such a practice is highly prejudicial to the other party, allowing the calling party to use statements \u201cdirectly ... which could not be [used] indirectly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, Mrs. Maxey testified that Poore was crying and wanted to leave the trailer and that she left the trailer with a bruise on her left eye which she did not have when she first arrived on the property. Thus, some aspects of Mrs. Maxey\u2019s testimony substantiated Poore\u2019s account of the incident and, therefore, were favorable to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Accordingly, the Commonwealth did not call Mrs. Maxey for the sole purpose of impeaching her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>For these reasons, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declared Mrs. Maxey to be an adverse witness and allowed the Commonwealth to impeach her with her prior inconsistent statements; accordingly, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-6\">. Both statutes apply in criminal as well as civil proceedings. <em>See Trout v. Commonwealth, </em>167 Va. 511, 516, 188 S.E. 219, 221 (1936); <em>Tate v.
