Winston (\u201cappellant\u201d) appeals Ms convictions of possession of cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-250, possession of a firearm wMle simultaneously possessing cocaine in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4, carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308, and grand larceny. He contends the trial court erred when it deMed Ms motion to set aside Ms convictions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. He also contends the evidence was insufficient to support Ms convictions of carrying a concealed weapon and of grand larceny. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Appellant was charged with committing five crimes: grand larceny of an automobile, possession of cocaine, possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of tools with intent to commit larceny. All of these crimes were allegedly committed on January 31, 1996. The proceedings against appellant were not imtiated in a juvenile and domestic relations district court. Appellant was tried by the circuit court (\u201ctrial court\u201d) on April 24, 1996. During appellant\u2019s arraignment, the trial court asked appellant to state his name, age, and his date of birth. Appellant replied that his name was \u201cJamal Shagun Winston,\u201d that he was nineteen years old, and that he was born on August 6, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case and again after resting without presenting evidence, appellant moved to strike three of the charges against him: grand larceny, carrying a concealed weapon, and possession of tools with the intent to commit larceny. The trial court demed appellant\u2019s motions with respect to the charges of grand larceny and carrying a concealed weapon, but granted appellant\u2019s motion to strike regarding the charge of possession of tools with intent to commit larceny. Following appellant\u2019s motions to strike, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>trial court convicted appellant of the remaining four charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Appellant subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal and a timely petition for appeal. On November 5, 1996, appellant filed a motion <em>in this Court </em>to set aside his convictions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On November 20, 1996, this Court remanded appellant\u2019s convictions to the trial court \u201cfor factual findings regarding appellant\u2019s age at the time of the alleged offense and disposition as appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">On December 16, 1996 and January 17, 1997, the trial court held hearings to receive evidence regarding appellant\u2019s age. Following the hearings, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdicts for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court made two findings. The trial court first found that appellant\u2019s age \u201ccannot be determined by the exhibits introduced by [appellant].\u201d Then, relying on the evidence presented by the Commonwealth, it found that both appellant and his mother \u201cheld [appellant] out to be an adult [on January 31, 1996] and have produced no evidence to convince this Court otherwise.\u201d The trial court also stated that appellant was not \u201cpermitted to come before the court and claim a juvenile status so as to benefit from his perjury and his alleged willful misrepresentations as to his age before the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Appellant contends the trial court erred when it denied his motion to set aside the convictions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. He argues the trial court erred when it found that he failed to prove he was a juvenile on the date the offenses were committed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">A criminal conviction is void <em>ab initio </em>if it has been entered by a court that did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the charge against the defendant. <em>See Humphreys v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 765, 772, 43 S.E.2d 890, 893-94 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>(1947) (stating that, if a trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a criminal charge, \u201cits trial of the charge was a vain thing and the judgment pronounced was a nullity\u201d); <em>see also Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 143, 145, 207 S.E.2d 833, 835-36 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Under Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A), the juvenile and domestic relations district courts (\u201cJ <em>&amp; </em>DR courts\u201d) have \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d over \u201call cases, matters and proceedings\u201d involving a juvenile who is alleged to be delinquent. <em>See Burfoot v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 38, 45, 473 S.E.2d 724, 728 (1996). A juvenile is defined by Code \u00a7 16.1-228 to be \u201ca person less than eighteen years of age.\u201d \u201cDelinquent acts\u201d include \u201can act designated a crime under the law of this Commonwealth .... \u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-228 (defining \u201cdelinquent act\u201d). The ages specified in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court Law \u201crefer to the age of the child at the time of the acts complained of .... \u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-241.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1, a circuit court may obtain jurisdiction to try a juvenile charged with certain criminal offenses <em>after </em>a transfer hearing is held by a J &amp; DR court. The holding of a transfer hearing and the making of the findings required by Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1 <em>by a J &amp; DR court </em>are essential prerequisites of the- circuit court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction in such cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-8\">[I]f the [J &amp; DR court] fails to hold a transfer hearing or to make the required findings, then the circuit court proceedings against a juvenile are void for lack of jurisdiction to try him or her as an adult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-9\"><em>Burfoot, </em>23 Va.App. at 49, 473 S.E.2d at 730 (citing <em>Matthews v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 358, 359, 218 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1975); <em>Peyton v. French, </em>207 Va. 73, 80, 147 S.E.2d 739, 743 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">As with all void judgments, a void criminal conviction may be attacked collaterally or directly in any court at any time. <em>See Humphreys, </em>186 Va. at 772, 43 S.E.2d at 893; <em>see also Slaughter v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 787, 793, 284 S.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>824, 827 (1981); <em>Broyhill v. Dawson, </em>168 Va. 321, 326,191 S.E. 779, 781 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Jurisdiction of the subject matter can only be acquired by virtue of the Constitution or of some statute. Neither the consent of the parties, nor waiver, nor acquiescence can confer it. Nor can the right to object for want of it be lost by acquiescence, neglect, estoppel or in any other manner.</p>\n<p id=\"AdQp\"><em>Humphreys, </em>186 Va. at 772-73, 43 S.E.2d at 894.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Generally, the party asserting that a judgment is void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction has the burden of proving that fact. <em>Cf. Shelton v. Sydnor, </em>126 Va. 625, 633-34, 102 S.E. 83, 86-87 (1920); <em>Carter\u2019s Adm\u2019r v. Skillman, </em>108 Va. 204, 215-16, 60 S.E. 775, 779-80 (1908). In a proceeding to attack a judgment for lack of jurisdiction, \u201c \u2018the record is never conclusive as to the recital of a jurisdictional fact, and the defendant is always at liberty to show a want of jurisdiction, although the record avers the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slaughter, </em>222 Va. at 793, 284 S.E.2d at 827-28 (quoting <em>Broyhill, </em>168 Va. at 327, 191 S.E. at 782). \u201c[T]he jurisdiction of a court, whether general or of limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>jurisdiction, may be inquired into, although the record of judgment states facts giving it jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Broyhill, </em>168 Va. at 326-27, 191 S.E. at 782 (citations omitted). The party attacking the judgment is not estopped by the contents of the record \u201cfrom showing[ ] by affirmative proof\u2019 that the court that entered the judgment erred when it concluded that jurisdiction was proper. <em>Id. </em>at 327, 191 S.E. at 782 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, if, at the hearing on his motion to set aside the verdicts, appellant met his burden of proving that he was under the age of eighteen on the date the offenses were committed, his convictions are void because the record established that the charges against appellant were not transferred from a J &amp; DR court prior to his trial in circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We hold that the trial court did not err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the verdicts for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court\u2019s finding that appellant failed to meet his burden of proving he was a juvenile on January 31, 1996, the date the offenses were committed, is supported by credible evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">At the hearing to determine appellant\u2019s age on the date the offenses were committed, conflicting evidence was presented. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Appellant offered two birth certificates issued by the City of Newark, New Jersey. One certificate stated that \u201cJaream Tyrell Winston\u201d was born on August 17, 1976; the other certificate stated that <em>\u201cJameel </em>Shaquan Winston\u201d was born on August 6, 1978. (Emphasis added). Appellant also offered four juvenile petitions and a social history report, all referring to <em>\u201cJameel </em>Shaquan Winston,\u201d which stated that \u201cJameel\u2019s\u201d birthday was August 6, 1978. (Emphasis added). Furthermore, the trial court had the following exchange with appellant at the hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-5\">TRIAL COURT: Stand please, sir. What is your name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\">APPELLANT: Jamel Shaquan Winston</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">TRIAL COURT: Spell your first name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">APPELLANT: J-A-M-E-L</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-9\">TRIAL COURT: What happened to Jamal, J-A-M-A-L?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-10\">APPELLANT: That\u2019s what they got down. That\u2019s what</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-11\">they\u2019ve been calling me the whole time I\u2019ve been locked up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-12\">TRIAL COURT: Tell me what name[s] are on these many</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-13\">birth certificates ... that are coming in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-14\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: J-A-R-E-A-M and J-A-M-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-15\">E-E-L, Jameel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-16\">TRIAL COURT: Jaream is your brother; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-17\">APPELLANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-18\">TRIAL COURT: And you are \u2014 spell your name again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-19\">APPELLANT: J-A-M-E-L.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-20\">The Commonwealth introduced the testimony of Officers James F. Hannah and Mark Wooten, which established that appellant told them following his arrest on January 31, 1996, that he was born on August 6, 1976 and that he was nineteen years old. In addition, the trial court read into the record a portion of the transcript from appellant\u2019s trial in which he told the trial court that he was nineteen and that his date of birth was August 6,1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-21\">As the trier of fact, the trial court was entitled to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Cf. Witt v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 670, 674-75, 212 S.E.2d 293, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>297 (1975). When appellant\u2019s spelling of his first name failed to match the spelling of the person\u2019s name who had the birthdate of \u201cAugust 6,1978\u201d on all of appellant\u2019s exhibits, the trial court was within its discretion to discount this evidence and credit appellant\u2019s previous statements that he was born on August 6, 1976. Because credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant failed to prove he was less than eighteen years of age on the date the offenses were committed, we cannot say the trial court erred when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to set aside his convictions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Appellant next contends the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions of carrying a concealed weapon and grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). This Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact. <em>See Cable v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 236, 239, 415 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1992). Instead, the trial court\u2019s judgment will not be set aside unless it appears that it is plainly wrong or without supporting evidence. <em>Josephs v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va,App. 87, 99, 390 S.E.2d 491, 497 (1990) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Appellant argues the Commonwealth failed to prove that the handgun he was carrying was, in fact, \u201cconcealed.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to prove the handgun carried by appellant was concealed. Under Code \u00a7 18.2-808(A), it is unlawful for a person to carry a \u201cweapon designed or intended to propel a missile of any kind\u201d <em>\u201cabout his person, hidden from common view.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). We have previously stated that a weapon is hidden from common view under Code \u00a7 18.2-308(A) when it is \u201chidden from all except those with an unusual or exceptional opportunity to view it.\u201d <em>Main v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 370, 372-73, 457 S.E.2d 400, 402 (1995) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">In this case, the Commonwealth proved with direct evidence that the handgun carried by appellant was hidden from common view. Officer Hannah testified that, while he was pursuing appellant on foot, he had an opportunity to view appellant from the back and front. He testified that he observed no visible sign that appellant was carrying a weapon. After the two scaled a large fence, Officer Hannah saw appellant retrieve a handgun from his right coat pocket and drop it on the ground. Even though Officer Hannah\u2019s pursuit of appellant occurred in darkness, his direct observation of appellant before he retrieved the gun from his coat pocket was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that this gun was \u201chidden from common view.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">GRAND LARCENY</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Appellant also contends the evidence failed to prove that <em>he </em>was the person who took the victim\u2019s blue Pontiac. Specifically, he argues that the \u201clarceny inference\u201d cannot apply to him because the Commonwealth failed to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>the victim\u2019s automobile was \u201crecently\u201d stolen when he was caught driving it. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">\u201c[L]arceny is the taking and carrying away of the goods and chattels of another with intent to deprive the owner of the possession thereof permanently.\u201d <em>Lund v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 688, 691, 232 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1977). Under Code \u00a7 18.2-95, grand larceny includes \u201clarceny not from the person of another of goods and chattels of the value of $200 or more.\u201d It is well established that \u201c[o]nce the [larceny] is established, the unexplained possession of recently stolen goods permits an inference of larceny by the possessor.\u201d <em>Bright v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 248, 251, 356 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1987); <em>see also Castle v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 222, 226-27, 83 S.E.2d 360, 363 (1954). For the \u201clarceny inference\u201d to arise, the Commonwealth must establish that the accused was in exclusive possession of <em>recently </em>stolen property. <em>See Best v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 387, 389, 282 S.E.2d 16, 17 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient to prove that appellant was the person who stole the blue Pontiac from Ms. Yeoman. Although no evidence directly proved that appellant stole the automobile, the evidence proved that appellant was in exclusive possession of the automobile shortly after it was stolen. Sally Rebecca Yeoman, the owner of the automobile, testified that she parked it near her home between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m on January 31,1996, and discovered shortly after 8:00 p.m. that evening that the car had been stolen. Officer Hannah testified that he spotted appellant driving the automobile \u201caround 9:30\u201d p.m. on January 31 and that appellant was the only occupant of the car. Appellant\u2019s exclusive possession of the stolen automobile was sufficiently \u201crecent\u201d to justify the inference that he was the thief. <em>See Montgomery v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 188, 190, 269 S.E.2d 352, 353 (1980) (holding that \u201c[f]our weeks is not, as a matter of law, so long a time that goods may not be considered recently stolen\u201d); <em>Wright v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 743, 748, 348 S.E.2d 9, 13 (1986) (holding that \u201cthe one month time lapse between when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>items were discovered missing and when they were found in [the defendant\u2019s possession] is sufficiently brief to be construed as recent possession\u201d). Because credible evidence supports the reasonable inference that appellant stole the blue Pontiac and no reasonable hypothesis of innocence flows from the evidence, we cannot say the trial court erred when it convicted appellant of grand larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-5\">. In the juvenile context, there are statutory exceptions to the general rule regarding the non-waivability of objections to a circuit court\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction. For example, a juvenile charged with an offense \"which if committed by an adult could be punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility\u201d may waive the jurisdiction of the J &amp; DR court prior to the commencement of a transfer hearing. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-270. Such waivers must be both in writing and accompanied by the written consent of the juvenile\u2019s counsel. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-270. In addition, in 1994, the General Assembly amended Article 7 of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court Law (Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1 et seq.) so that \"[a]ny objection to the jurisdiction of the circuit court pursuant to [that] article shall be waived if not made before arraignment.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">It is clear that the waiver provision of Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E), as currently written, does not apply to this case. Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) only applies to proceedings that were both (1) initiated by the filing of a petition in a J &amp; DR court <em>and </em>(2) transferred to the circuit court following a valid transfer hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1. <em>See Burfoot, </em>23 Va.App. at 51, 473 S.E.2d at 731. \"The 'objections\u2019 contemplated by Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) are arguments concerning deficiencies in the transfer process involving a particular juvenile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The waiver provision of Code \u00a7 16.1-269.6(E) does not apply to cases, such as this one, in which \"no petition was filed or transfer hearing was held.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\">. The Virginia Supreme Court has stated that, when a judgment is collaterally attacked, the attacking party is precluded from admitting any new or parol evidence. <em>Farant Inv. Corp. v. Francis, </em>138 Va. 417, 429-30, 122 S.E. 141, 143 (1924) (stating that \"the record is presumed to speak the truth and can be tried by inspection only; extrinsic evidence not being allowed to impeach the verity of the record\u201d). Although this evidentiary prohibition may apply when prior convictions are collaterally attacked on non-jurisdictional grounds, the Virginia Supreme Court has expressly ratified the procedure of hearing evidence <em>in addition to </em>the record when a judgment is attacked for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Slaughter, </em>222 Va. at 793-94, 284 S.E.2d at 827-28; <em>Broyhill, </em>168 Va. at 326-28, 191 S.E. at 782. To the extent that <em>Farant Inv. Corp. </em>stands for a contrary proposition, it appears to have been implicitly overruled on this point by <em>Broyhill </em>and <em>Slaughter. </em>As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-8\">Notwithstanding the rule that a recitation in a court\u2019s order is a verity, a recitation of jurisdiction is subject to collateral attack.... \"If the court had no jurisdiction, it had no power to make a record, and the supposed record is not in truth a record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-9\"><em>Slaughter, </em>222 Va. at 793, 284 S.E.2d at 827-28 (quoting <em>Broyhill, </em>168 Va. at 327, 191 S.E. at 782).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b801-9\">. Appellant also argues that the trial court erred when it concluded that he was estopped by his and his mother's representations to authorities that he was an adult on the date the offenses were committed from collaterally challenging the circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction over the charges against him. See <em>Humphreys, </em>186 Va. at 772-73, 43 S.E.2d at 894; <em>but see Penn v. Peyton, </em>270 F.Supp. 981, 984-85 (W.D.Va.1967). However, we need not address this argument because, even assuming the tried court\u2019s analysis on this point was erroneous and that appellant was entitled to challenge the validity of his conviction on jurisdictional grounds, appellant failed to meet his burden of proof at the hearing on his motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
