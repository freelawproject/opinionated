Christensen (husband) appeals the decision of the Gloucester County Circuit Court awarding Janalee M. Christensen (wife) a divorce. Husband contends that the trial court erroneously entered the divorce decree without complying \u2022with the provisions of Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A). He asserts there was \u201cno evidence that it was clearly necessary to retain jurisdiction with regard to equitable distribution.\u201d Accordingly, husband argues, we should set aside the decree of divorce and remand this cause to the trial court for further proceedings. We disagree and deny the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">The facts are not in dispute. Husband and wife were married in 1980 in Florida. Two children were born of the marriage, both of whom remain minors. On February 22, 1996, husband filed a bill of complaint for divorce charging desertion and adultery and requested all such relief as provided for by Code \u00a7 20-107.3. Wife filed an answer and cross-bill requesting a divorce on grounds of cruelty and seeking equitable distribution. On May 9,1997, the trial court indicated its intent to enter a decree of divorce based on a one-year separation, reserving to the parties their right to equitable distribution. Husband objected to entry of the divorce decree prior to resolution of the equitable distribution because the bifurcation was not \u201cclearly necessary.\u201d The parties had \u201cvery little [marital property] to speak of,\u201d a trailer and \u201ca little bit of real estate, maybe worth $20,000.\u201d The record contains no other evidence regarding the necessity for bifurcation.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Confronted with husband\u2019s objection that the divorce should not be granted in the absence of a record showing a clear necessity to reserve matters of equitable distribution, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>court responded: \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s necessary. I think [wife] wants a divorce, and that might accelerate yours.\u201d The trial court then entered the decree of divorce, which included a provision that \u201cthe parties reserve their right to an equitable distribution of the marital property of the parties pursuant to \u00a7 20-107.3 of the Code of Virginia, 1950, as amended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.3, as originally written, did not address whether a trial court could dissolve the bond of matrimony between the parties and retain jurisdiction to decide marital property matters at a later time. <em>See Parra v. Parra, </em>1 Va.App. 118, 336 S.E.2d 157 (1985). Subsequent to <em>Parra, </em>in 1986, Code \u00a7 20-107.3 was amended. <em>See </em>1986 Va.Acts. ch. 537. In relevant part, it then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-6\">Upon decreeing the dissolution of a marriage, and also upon decreeing a divorce from the bond of matrimony, ... [t]he court, <em>on the motion of both parties, </em>may retain jurisdiction in the final decree of divorce to adjudicate the remedy provided by this section when the court determines that such action <em>is dearly necessary because of the complexities of the parties\u2019 property interests, </em>and all decrees heretofore entered retaining such jurisdiction are validated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-7\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">The 1986 amendment clearly authorized bifurcation of the divorce issue and equitable distribution of marital property \u201conly where the parties jointly [made] a motion to do so <em>and </em>then only when the court determine[d] that such action [was] clearly necessary because of the complexities of the parties\u2019 property interests.\u201d <em>Erickson-Dickson v. Erickson-Dickson, </em>12 Va.App. 381, 385-86, 404 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1991). Otherwise, the divorce issues and equitable distribution determinations were to be adjudicated contemporaneously. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">In both 1991 and 1992, the legislature again amended Code \u00a7 20-107.3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but continued limitations on the trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>authority to retain equitable distribution jurisdiction upon granting a final divorce. <em>See </em>1991 Va.Acts ch. 640; 1992 Va.Acts ch. 88. The 1991 and 1992 amendments were effective at the time the trial court entered the decree from which this appeal emanates. As a result of these amendments, the applicable portion of Code \u00a7 20-107.3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\">Upon decreeing the dissolution of a marriage, and also upon decreeing a divorce from the bond of matrimony, ... [t]he court, <em>on the motion of either party, </em>may retain jurisdiction in the final decree of divorce to adjudicate the remedy provided by this section when the court determines that such action <em>is clearly necessary, </em>and all decrees heretofore entered retaining such jurisdiction are validated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The 1991 and 1992 amendments eliminated the requirement that both parties join the retention motion and the requirement that the equitable distribution matter be complex. However, the statute retained the requirement that the trial court must make a specific finding of clear necessity for granting the divorce while retaining jurisdiction to decide equitable distribution issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Under the facts of this case, we hold that the trial court erred in bifurcating the equitable distribution and divorce proceedings. The trial court made no express finding that bifurcation of the proceedings was <em>\u201cclearly </em>necessary,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) (emphasis added), and the record does not support such a finding. We therefore must determine whether, as a consequence, the decree entered by the trial court dissolving the marriage must be set aside and the matter remanded. Here, we are confronted with an issue similar, but not identical, to the issue addressed by this Court in <em>Ericksonr-Dickson. </em>There, the Court noted that the 1986 amendment continued to be \u201csilent as to whether the divorce is void or voidable because complete relief was not granted, or whether, how, or to what extent the parties may proceed with equitable distribution.\u201d 12 Va.App. at 386, 404 S.E.2d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>Because subsequent amendments have done nothing to clarify that dilemma, we hold that this Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Ericksonr-Dickson </em>is equally applicable to the facts of this case. Circuit courts in this Commonwealth are authorized to enter decrees of divorce that dissolve the bond of matrimony between the parties, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-96, and to \u201cequitably distributee] the marital wealth.\u201d <em>Erickson-Dickson, </em>12 Va. App. at 387, 404 S.E.2d at 392; <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.3. Where a court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the controversy, and the parties before it, its mistaken exercise of that jurisdiction does not render its judgment void. <em>See County Sch. Bd. v. Snead, </em>198 Va. 100, 107, 92 S.E.2d 497, 503 (1956). An act of the legislature, not the courts, is required to deprive circuit courts of authority to enter decrees of divorce. <em>Cf. Parra, </em>1 Va.App. at 123, 336 S.E.2d at 159 (noting that jurisdiction in divorce suits \u201cis purely statutory and cannot be acquired inferentially or through indirection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Following the <em>Ericksonr-Dickson </em>opinion and before the proceedings in the instant case, the legislature met on several occasions, amending Code \u00a7 20-107.3 two additional times, and yet it has given no indication of a desire to deprive the circuit court of the authority to dissolve the bond of matrimony even if the attempt to retain jurisdiction over equitable distribution was made contrary to the Code provisions. <em>See </em>1992 Acts ch. 88; 1993 Acts ch. 79. \u201c[W]here the General Assembly acts in an area in which this Court has already spoken, it is presumed to know the law as the Court has stated it and to acquiesce therein.\u201d <em>McFadden v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 226, 230, 348 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1986) (quoting <em>Burns v. Board of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 354, 360, 315 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In summary, Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) forbids the court from retaining jurisdiction to make an equitable distribution award after the divorce has been granted without first finding a clear necessity therefor. However, the statute does not prohibit the court from granting the divorce. Therefore, we hold that the language in the decree that \u201cthe parties reserve their right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>an equitable distribution of the marital property of the parties pursuant to \u00a7 20-107.3\u201d was an erroneous attempt to retain jurisdiction of the matter without complying with the clear necessity provision of that Code section; however, the decree dissolving the bond of matrimony between the parties is not void or voidable as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Accordingly, we will not set aside the decree of divorce, and the relief prayed for is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">\n<em>Denied.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b700-10\">. The legislature previously had enacted other amendments, not directly relevant to the portion of the statute under discussion, in 1988, 1989 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>and 1990. See 1988 Va.Acts chs. 745, 746, 747, 825, 880; 1989 Va.Acts ch. 70; 1990 Va.Acts chs. 636, 764.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
