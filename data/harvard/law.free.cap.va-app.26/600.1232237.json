His widow, Janine Carlson, appeals from a Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission decision denying an award of death benefits and funeral expenses. The commission ruled that Carlson\u2019s death did not arise out of, or in the course of, his employment because Carlson\u2019s death occurred while he was going to work and did not fall within any of the well recognized exceptions to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule. We affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">On the weekend of December 4 and 5, 1993, Carlson was on \u201cinactive duty training\u201d with the Virginia National Guard at Fort A.P. Hill in Bowling Green, Virginia. Carlson\u2019s widow testified that Carlson reported for duty on Saturday morning, December 4, and that she met him later that afternoon at Fort A.P. Hill to attend a Christmas dinner sponsored by the National Guard. When the dinner ended at 8:00 p.m., the Carlsons left together and returned to their home in Fredericksburg.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Carlson left home to return to Fort A.P. Hill at 7:00 a.m. Sunday morning with Randall Lincoln, who was also a member of the National Guard. Lincoln was driving southbound on Route 2 in Caroline County and was traveling at a high rate of speed in rainy weather when he lost control of the car and collided with another vehicle. Carlson died in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Allen testified that \u201caccording to the training schedule, ... [Carlson] was to report at 7:30 in the morning on Saturday, be dismissed later that afternoon at approximately 4:30, and to return home, and he was to come back on Sunday at 7:30 in the morning, and be released at about 4:30 in the afternoon on Sunday.\u201d Allen also testified that the weekend drill was made up of four four-hour blocks of time called unit training activity periods. Carlson completed two unit training activity periods on Saturday. According to a Statement of Medical Examination and Duty Status, which was stipulated as evidence, Carlson\u2019s inactive duty training began at 8:00 a.m. on Saturday, December 4 and was to end at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, December 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Allen further testified that the National Guard neither reimbursed Carlson for mileage between his home and Fort A.P. Hill, nor provided Carlson with transportation between his home and Fort A.P. Hill. Allen testified that Carlson was not tasked with any work assignment when he was traveling between his home and Fort A.P. Hill and that Carlson \u201cwas simply coming to work\u201d on Sunday when the accident oc-</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>curred. Allen also testified that members of the National Guard generally would not spend the night at Fort A.P. Hill. They would be released by the commanding officer to return home and would report for duty the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Denying an award, the commission ruled that <em>Globe Indemnity Co. v. Forrest, </em>165 Va. 267, 182 S.E. 215 (1935), did not control this fact situation and made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abp\">[Carlson] was attending a weekend drill which consisted of four, four-hour training periods. He was free to leave the post after the completion of the second four-hour training period on Saturday, December 4, 1993, as noted above. It was not necessary that [Carlson] obtain a pass to leave the post, as was the case with [the guardsman in <em>Forrest </em>]. While his employment status as a guardsman may have been of a continuing nature, as would have been the situation with normal civilian work, his dependents must still show that he was charged with some duty of his employment at the time of his injury, or that this case falls within one of the exceptions to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, as noted by the Deputy Commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Carlson\u2019s widow argues that <em>Forrest </em>supports her entitlement to an award. Although the Department of Military Affairs concedes that Carlson was an employee of the National Guard at the time of his death, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101, it argues that Carlson\u2019s widow did not meet her burden of proving that Carlson\u2019s death arose out of and in the course of his employment with the National Guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">A claimant for death benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-512 must prove that the employee\u2019s death arose out of and in the course of the employment. <em>See Baggett Transportation Co. v. Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 636-37, 248 S.E.2d 819, 821 (1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">The expressions \u201carising out of\u2019 and \u201cin the course of\u2019 are used conjunctively and are not synonymous. Both conditions must be present before compensation can be awarded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The words \u201carising out of\u2019 have been construed ... to refer to the origin or cause of the injury, and the words \u201cin the course of\u2019 refer to the time, place and circumstances under which the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">[A]n accident occurs in the \u201ccourse of employment\u201d when it takes place within the period of employment, at a place where the employee may be reasonably expected to be, and while he is reasonably fulfilling the duties of his employment or is doing something which is reasonably incidental thereto. ... [A]n injury \u201carises \u2018out of the employment, when there is apparent to the rational mind upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury. Under this test, if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment, then it arises \u2018out of the employment. But it excludes an injury which cannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have b\u00e9en equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood. It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant. It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Thus it clearly appears that in order for an injury to be compensable on the ground that it arose out of and in the course of employment it is not enough to show merely that the accident occurred during the period of the employment and while the employee was about his master\u2019s business. It must also be shown that the accident occurred at a place where, from the nature of the work, the employee was reasonably expected to be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number><em>Conner v. Bragg, </em>203 Va. 204, 208-09, 123 S.E.2d 393, 396-97 (1962). \u201cWhether an accident arose out of and in the course of employment is a mixed question of law and fact and is properly reviewable on appeal.\u201d <em>Kendrick v. Nationwide Homes, Inc., </em>4 Va.App. 189, 190, 355 S.E.2d 347, 347 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">As a general rule, an injury or death is not compensable if it occurs while an employee is traveling to or from work. <em>See Harbin v. Jamestown Village Joint Venture, </em>16 Va.App. 190, 193, 428 S.E.2d 754, 756 (1993); <em>Sentara Leigh Hosp. v. Nichols, </em>13 Va.App. 630, 636, 414 S.E.2d 426, 429 (1992). This rule is premised upon the principle that an employee traveling to or from his workplace \u201cis not engaged in performing any service growing out of and incidental to his employment.\u201d <em>Kendrick, </em>4 Va.App. at 190, 355 S.E.2d at 347. However, several exceptions exist to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule. <em>Id. </em>The following three exceptions are generally recognized: \u201c(1) where the means of transportation used to go to and from work is provided by the employer or the employee\u2019s travel time is paid for or included in wages; (2) where the way used is the sole means of ingress and egress or is constructed by the employer; and (3) where the employee is charged with some duty or task connected to his employment while on his way to or from work.\u201d <em>Sentara, </em>13 Va.App. at 636, 414 S.E.2d at 429. The burden of proof is upon the dependents of the deceased employee to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that one of these exceptions applies. <em>See id. </em>at 636, 414 S.E.2d at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The evidence proved that Carlson was traveling from his home to his duty station at Fort A.P. Hill when he was killed. The evidence in this case readily eliminates the first and second exceptions to the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule. First, the uncontradicted evidence proved that Carlson was not reimbursed by the Department for travel en route to training. Allen testified that Carlson was not reimbursed by the Department for mileage and that transportation was not provided by the National Guard. Second, Lincoln and Carlson were traveling on Route 2 in Caroline County at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>accident. That route is a public highway, was not constructed by the Department, and was not the sole means of ingress and egress to Fort A.P. Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">As to the third exception, the record contains testimony of Lieutenant Colonel Allen that Carlson was not engaged in any duty or task connected with his employment while en route to Fort A.P. Hill. After Carlson completed his two unit training activity periods on Saturday, he was released to go home and was at liberty to do as he pleased until he reported to base on Sunday morning. Carlson\u2019s only responsibility was to return to Fort A.P. Hill on Sunday at 7:30 a.m. His obligation to report to his duty station does not equate to having a responsibility to the National Guard while he was en route to Fort A.P. Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Nonetheless, Carlson\u2019s widow argues that this case is governed by <em>Forrest </em>and that Carlson\u2019s duty status is the dispositive factor. We disagree. The commission correctly ruled that the holding in <em>Forrest </em>is not dispositive of the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Forrest was an enlisted member of the Virginia National Guard attending an annual two week encampment at Virginia Beach in August 1933. 165 Va. at 268, 182 S.E. at 215. Forrest left the military camp at 7:30 p.m. on a pass and visited places of amusement in the town of Virginia Beach. At 10:00 p.m., a lieutenant in the military police ordered Forrest to take two intoxicated National Guard soldiers back to the military camp. While Forrest was returning to the military camp with the intoxicated National Guard soldiers, Forrest and one of the soldiers sat on a railroad track. When a train approached, Forrest attempted to move the intoxicated soldier from the tracks and was injured by the train. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 182 S.E. at 216. The commission awarded Forrest benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and the employer and its insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">The Supreme Court stated the issue in <em>Forrest </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">The contention of the appellant, who is the insurance carrier is that the accident did not arise out of and in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>[Forrest\u2019s] employment, but that it was the result of misconduct on the part of [Forrest] which bars him from the allowance of compensation....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\">As to the first contention, <em>the carrier urges that, when [Forrest] was given a pass </em>to leave the military reservation for Virginia Beach and proceeded to avail himself of its privileges, <em>there was a cessation of the relation of master and servant between himself and the State of Virginia, his employer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">165 Va. at 270,182 S.E. at 216 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">We believe the Supreme Court\u2019s description of the issue and argument of the insurance carrier manifestly established that the <em>Forrest </em>decision primarily decided whether Forrest was an employee of the National Guard when he was injured. Even though in 1935, when <em>Forrest </em>was decided, the Act stated that \u201cthe term \u2018employee\u2019 shall include the officers and members of the national guard,\u201d Code \u00a7 1887(2)(a) (1930), that provision of the Act merely brought the National Guard within the purview of the Act and did. not further delimit when the period of employment began and ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">The <em>Forrest </em>decision clearly held that although Forrest was on a pass for recreational leave, the employment relationship still existed because Forrest was on active duty. 165 Va. at 270, 182 S.E. at 216. The Court rejected the argument that Forrest\u2019s release on a pass \u201cconstituted a severance of the relation of master and servant\u201d between the National Guard and Forrest. <em>Id. </em>The Court emphasized the continuing nature of Forrest\u2019s employment and held that \u201c \u2018the relationship of master and servant was continuous from the moment when Forrest reported ... in compliance with the orders from his employer, the State of Virginia, until he was released from active employment by the termination of said orders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 182 S.E. at 216 (citation omitted). This and other pertinent discussions in <em>Forrest </em>are germane solely to the insurer\u2019s argument concerning Forrest\u2019s employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">We concede, as we must, that one reading of <em>Forrest </em>suggests that because the Court affirmed the award of bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>fits, the Court also necessarily decided that the event that injured Forrest also arose out of Forrest\u2019s employment. Although the <em>Forrest </em>opinion notes that \u201cit is unnecessary to discuss the effect of the [lieutenant\u2019s] order\u201d that Forrest was implementing when Forrest was injured, the opinion points out \u201cForrest\u2019s immediate obedience to the command of his superior officer but emphasizes the continuity of the relationship of master and servant.\u201d 165 Va. at 273, 182 S.E. at 217. Indeed, in a later decision, <em>see Norfolk &amp; Washington Steamboat Co. v. Holladay, </em>174 Va. 152, 5 S.E.2d 486 (1939), the Supreme Court observed \u201cthat <em>[Forrest </em>] turned upon whether there had been a temporary cessation of the relationship of master and servant.\u201d <em>Holladay, </em>174 Va. at 161, 5 S.E.2d at 490. Significantly, however, the Court in <em>Holladay </em>reiterated the evidence that the <em>Forrest </em>opinion declared unnecessary, <em>viz. </em>that Forrest \u201chad been instructed by his superior officer to assist in returning to camp\u201d the intoxicated soldier. <em>Holladay, </em>174 Va. at 161, 5 S.E.2d at 490. We conclude, therefore, that the Supreme Court tacitly recognized in <em>Holladay </em>that the evidence in <em>Forrest </em>proved that Forrest was acting under orders and, thus, was engaged in an activity that arose out of his employment. In any event, we do not read <em>Forrest </em>to hold that every injurious event suffered by a member of the National Guard arises out of and in the course of employment whenever the member is \u201con duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">Credible evidence in the record supports the commission\u2019s finding that Carlson was not engaged in an activity that arose out of his employment. First, the evidence proved that Carlson was on \u201cinactive\u201d, duty training and not on \u201cactive\u201d duty training. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 44-41, 44-83. Lieutenant Colonel Allen testified that \u201caccording to the training schedule ... [Carlson] was to report at 7:30 in the morning on Saturday, be dismissed ... at approximately 4:30, and to return home, and ... come back on Sunday at approximately 7:30 in the morning, and be released at about 4:30 in the afternoon on Sunday.\u201d He also testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Q. [B]ut the records reveal that he was activated for duty that weekend \u2014 I mean, this was a weekend drill that required his presence at A.P. Hill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-4\">A. That\u2019s correct. And ... a weekend drill typically is made up of what we call four, four hour blocks of time which we refer to as unit training activity periods, or U.T.A.\u2019s. So there would have been two U.T.A.\u2019s on Saturday performed, or four \u2014 two four hour blocks of, of training,____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Thus, Carlson was not in uninterrupted, continuous service for the two-day period of \u201cinactive\u201d duty training.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Second, Allen testified that Carlson was not reimbursed for mileage to and from his home and Fort A.P. Hill, that the National Guard did not provide for Carlson\u2019s transportation between his home and Fort A.P. Hill, and that Carlson was not tasked with any National Guard duty while going from his home to Fort A.P. Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Carlson\u2019s duty orders clearly establish that he was an employee of the National Guard, a prerequisite for coverage under the Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-101; <em>Forrest, </em>165 Va. at 271, 182 S.E. at 216; <em>Cotman v. Green, 4 </em>Va.App. 256, 258, 356 S.E.2d 447, 448 (1987). However, the evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that Carlson was not performing any task of his employment when he was travelling from his home to Fort A.P. Hill. Accordingly, we hold that Carlson\u2019s widow has not carried her burden of proving that her husband\u2019s death arose out of and in the course of his employment with the National Guard. For the reasons stated, the decision of the commission denying benefits is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
