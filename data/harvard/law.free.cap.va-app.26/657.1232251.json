Washington was convicted of possession of heroin and possession of cocaine. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-250. Contending that he was illegally seized and that the police unlawfully entered his home, Washington argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress. We agree and reverse his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">The evidence proved that on August 30, 1995, a bondsman telephoned Officer Michael Moore and asked Officer Moore to meet him at the 2000 block of Mecklenburg Street. Officer Moore testified that the bondsman received a tip from an informant that Reginald Ford, for whom a capias had been issued, could be found at 2347 Bethel Street. Officer Moore testified that he verified that a capias was outstanding, that he did not obtain a copy of the capias, and that he believed Ford \u201chad either jumped or was about ready to jump [bail].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Officer Moore also testified that he had not checked to determine Ford\u2019s address and did not have a physical description of Ford. Only the bondsman could recognize Ford.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">At 10:30 a.m., Officer Samuels and Sergeant Kemp met Officer Moore and the bondsman at 2347 Bethel Street, Washington\u2019s residence. Officer Samuels testified that he was told that Ford \u201cwas supposed\u201d to be in the residence. He knew only Ford\u2019s name. He did not have a physical description of Ford, and he had no information concerning the capias. He had not been told that Ford was dangerous, but he testified that he \u201ctake[s] everybody to be dangerous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Officers Samuels and Kemp went to the back door of Washington\u2019s residence. Officer Moore and the bondsman went to the front door. Officer Moore knocked on the front door for a \u201c[c]ouple of minutes.\u201d Moore did not see anybody look out of a window.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">Officer Samuels testified that he heard Officer Moore knocking on the front door. Three to four seconds after the knocks began, Washington opened the back door and stepped out. Officer Samuels testified that Washington opened the door \u201crather fast.\u201d Samuels placed his hands on Washington and said, \u201cMr. Ford.\u201d Washington replied, \u201c[N]o. I\u2019m Welford Washington.\u201d Officer Samuels then frisked Washington and asked Washington for identification. Washington said his driver\u2019s license was inside the residence and turned to go inside. Officer Samuels went into the house in front of Washington. Officer Kemp followed. When Officer Samuels entered the kitchen, he saw \u201csyringes with cocaine and heroin\u201d residue and baggies of white powder and he arrested Washington. Ford was not in the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">Washington contended the officers unlawfully entered his residence without a search warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The trial judge denied the motion to suppress the seized evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">To justify a <em>Terry </em>stop, a \u201cpolice officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). When a stop is based on an informant\u2019s tip, the \u201cinformant must provide some basis for his knowledge [of the facts he reported] before the police officer relies upon it as being reliable enough to support an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Beckner v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 533, 537, 425 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1993). In addition, \u201c[significant aspects of the informer\u2019s information must be independently corroborated ... to give \u2018some degree of reliability to the ... allegation\u2019 of the informant.\u201d <em>Bulatko v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 135, 137, 428 S.E.2d 306, 307 (1993) (quoting <em>Alabama v. White, </em>496 U.S. 325, 332, 110 S.Ct. 2412, 2417, 110 L.Ed.2d 301 (1990)). On appeal, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial judge\u2019s determination that reasonable suspicion existed to stop Washington. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">We hold that the police officers lacked a reasonable suspicion that Ford was at 2347 Bethel Street, that Washington was Ford, or that Washington was engaging in criminal activity. The evidence proved that Washington resided at 2347 Bethel Street. The police learned from the bondsman that an unidentified informant said Ford could be found at that address. No evidence established the basis of the unknown informant\u2019s asserted knowledge that Ford could be found at Washington\u2019s residence. Moreover, no evidence established that either the informant or the bondsman was a reliable informant. Indeed, none of the officers attempted to corroborate the tip by determining Ford\u2019s address or by determining who resided at 2347 Bethel Street. Because neither the informant\u2019s reliability nor the basis for the informant\u2019s knowledge was established, the officers lacked a reasonable suspicion to believe that Ford was in the residence at 2347 Bethel Street. <em>See McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 203, 487 S.E.2d 259, 264 (1997) <em>(en banc). See also State v. Rubert, </em>46 Or.App. 843, 612 P.2d 771 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Officer Samuels lacked a reasonable suspicion to believe that Washington was Ford. The uncontroverted testimony of Officer Samuels and the other officers established that none of the officers had a physical description of Ford. Officer Samuels simply speculated that Washington might be Ford. The uncorroborated, unsubstantiated informant\u2019s tip was not enough, alone, to provide Officer Samuels with reasonable suspicion to believe that any man who was in the residence was Ford. Furthermore, Washington promptly identified himself to Officer Samuels by stating that his name was Welford Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Finally, the fact that Washington opened the rear door of the residence after Officer Moore knocked on the front door is insufficient to justify a stop of Washington. No evidence proved that the officers announced their presence or that Washington knew the police were at the door. Washington testified that he opened the rear door because he believed the knock was at that door. Even if Officer Samuels suspected that Washington intended to flee, \u201cflight alone may not supply sufficient reason to suspect a person of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Buck v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 298, 303, 456 S.E.2d 534, 536 (1995). Washington\u2019s appearance at the rear door could give rise \u201cto no more than an \u2018inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u201chunch\u201d \u2019 \u201d about his intention. <em>Deer v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 730, 736, 441 S.E.2d 33, 37 (1994) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883). In the absence of any particular information, Officer Samuels lacked a reasonable articulable suspicion that Washington, when he opened the door, was involved in a criminal offense or that he was armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u201cTh[e] demand for specificity in the information upon which police action is predicated is the central teaching of [the United States Supreme] Court\u2019s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 21 n. 18, 88 S.Ct. at 1880 n. 18. Based upon the scant information provided by the informant, we hold that Officer Samuels lacked a reasonable suspicion to believe that Ford could be found at 2347 Bethel Street, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Washington was Ford, or that Washington was involved in a criminal offense. Accordingly, the stop and frisk of Washington was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Citing <em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 130, 360 S.E.2d 196 (1987), the Commonwealth further argues that the officers had a \u201climited authority to enter [Washington\u2019s residence] pursuant to the capias.\u201d We disagree. Even if the police had been armed with an arrest warrant for Ford and had a reasonable basis to believe he was in the residence, they still would have needed a search warrant to lawfully enter Washington\u2019s residence to arrest Ford. \u201c[T]he entry into a home [of a person not named in an arrest warrant] to ... make an arrest is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment unless done pursuant to a [search] warrant.\u201d <em>Steagald v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 204, 211, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 1647, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">The Fourth Amendment protects the individual\u2019s privacy in a variety of settings. In none is the zone of privacy more clearly defined than when bounded by the unambiguous physical dimensions of an individual\u2019s home \u2014 a zone that finds its roots in clear and specific constitutional terms: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their ... houses ... shall not be violated.\u201d That language unequivocally establishes the proposition that \u201c[a]t the very core [of the Fourth Amendment] stands the right of a [person] to retreat into his [or her] own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\u201d In terms that apply equally to seizures of property and to seizures of persons, the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-8\"><em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 589-90, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1381-82, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980) (citation omitted). Thus, \u201cto the extent that [an arrest warrant] is invoked as authority to enter the homes of third parties,\u201d that entry is violative of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Fourth Amendment rights of those third parties. <em>Steagald, </em>451 U.S. at 220,101 S.Ct. at 1652.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The Commonwealth further argues that Officer Samuels\u2019 entry into the residence was justified because of \u201cthe potential for danger.\u201d No evidence supports that argument. We reiterate that the officers had no information that Washington\u2019s home was Ford\u2019s residence. Officer Samuels justified his entry on the grounds that he \u201cneeded to know who [Washington] was\u201d and that he considers \u201ceverybody to be dangerous.\u201d However, Washington identified himself to Officer Samuels. Even if Officer Samuels had a legitimate need to verify Washington\u2019s assertion that he was not Ford, a less intrusive means was available. The bondsman, who could identify Ford, was on the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In addition, Officer Samuels lacked a reasonable basis to conclude that Washington was dangerous. Nothing about Washington indicated that he posed a danger to the officers. Officer Samuels\u2019 generalized belief that everyone is dangerous did not allow him to enter Washington\u2019s residence at his whim. Furthermore, it is clear that \u201cany exigency arising from [Washington\u2019s] retreat was created solely by the police action in knocking on [Washington\u2019s] door.\u201d <em>State v. Morse, </em>125 N.H. 403, 480 A.2d 183, 186 (1984). \u2018Where agents create the exigency themselves, warrantless activity is per se unreasonable and we require suppression of any evidence obtained thereby.\u201d <em>United States v. Webster, </em>750 F.2d 307, 328 (5th Cir.1984). <em>See also United States v. Rossetti, </em>506 F.2d 627 (7th Cir.1974) (agents knocking at apartment door and identifying themselves as police officers unnecessarily created emergency situation).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">Because Officer Samuels was not justified in stopping Washington in the first instance, his entry into Washington\u2019s house and search of the kitchen cannot be justified by an apprehension of fear that arose during the stop. <em>Cf. Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 519, 371 S.E.2d 156, 162 (1988) (\u201cOnce an officer has <em>lawfully </em>stopped a suspect, he is \u2018authorized to take such steps as [are] reasonably necessary to protect [his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>and others\u2019] personal safety____\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 235, 105 S.Ct. 675, 683-84, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985) (emphasis added)). Thus, the entry and search of Washington\u2019s house was a product of the illegal detention and the fruits should have been suppressed. <em>See Walls v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 639, 651, 347 S.E.2d 175, 182 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">For these reasons, we reverse the trial judge\u2019s refusal to suppress the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b711-8\">COLE, Judge, dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">I respectfully dissent. The trial judge based his decision upon the presence of exigent circumstances sufficient to permit the police officers to enter Washington\u2019s home 'without a search warrant. I would affirm the trial court because of the presence of exigent circumstances. I also disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that the police officers could not stop Washington to determine his identity as he fled from the police through the rear door of his home to avoid the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">On August 30, 1995, Officer Michael Moore was operating a patrol car. At 10:15 a.m., he received a call directing him to meet a bondsman from Henderson Bonding in the 2000 block of Mecklenburg Street concerning a possible location of a wanted party named Reginald Ford. Moore met with the bondsman, Mr. Henderson, who advised Moore that he had received a tip from a reliable informant as to Ford\u2019s location. He stated that Ford was at 2347 Bethel Street. Officer Moore verified through the warrant section of the police department that a capias was outstanding for Reginald Ford. At trial, Moore testified that Ford \u201chad either jumped or was about ready to jump bond.\u201d Henderson was the bondsman \u201cwho had bonded out\u201d Ford. Henderson asked the help of the police to take Ford into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">In addition to the authority of the capias, the police officers and Henderson had extensive powers over Ford conferred upon them by Code \u00a7 19.2-149, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>A surety on a bond in a recognizance may at any time arrest his principal and surrender him to the court before which the recognizance was taken or before which such principal\u2019s appearance is required, or to the sheriff, sergeant or jailer of the county or city wherein the court before which such principal\u2019s appearance is required is located; in addition to the above authority, upon the application of the surety, the court, or the clerk thereof, before which the recognizance was taken, or before which such principal\u2019s appearance is required, shall issue a capias for the arrest of such principal, and such capias may be executed by such surety, or his authorized agent, or by any sheriff, sergeant or police officer, and the person executing such capias shall deliver such principal and such capias to the sheriff or jailer of the county or the sheriff, sergeant or jailer of the city in which the appearance of such principal is required....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">It is undisputed that a capias was outstanding for Reginald Ford on the ground that he had jumped or was about to jump bond. A capias is a court order that requires the officer to whom it is addressed to take a named defendant into custody. <em>See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>208 (6th ed. 1990). Officer Samuels testified at trial that at the time of this incident, he was not aware whether the capias was based upon a felony or a misdemeanor, but he later determined it was upon a felony. Any person charged with a felony who willfully fails to appear before any court as required is guilty of a Class 6 felony, and any person charged with a misdemeanor who willfully fails to appear as required is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-128(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">\u201cA valid arrest warrant carries with it the implicit but limited authority to enter the residence of the person named in the warrant in order to execute the warrant, where there is \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that the suspect is within.\u201d <em>United States v. Route, </em>104 F.3d 59, 62 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 117 S.Ct. 2491, 138 L.Ed.2d 998 (1997); <em>see also Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 603, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1388, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980); <em>United States v. Woods, </em>560 F.2d 660, 665 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Cir.1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 906, 98 S.Ct. 1452, 55 L.Ed.2d 497 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">In <em>Wallace v. King, </em>626 F.2d 1157 (4th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>451 U.S. 969, 101 S.Ct. 2045, 68 L.Ed.2d 348 (1981), the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that, in order for a search to be \u201cconstitutionally valid, not only must the officers have probable cause to believe the person named in the arrest warrant is on the premises of the third person, but there must also exist an appropriate exception to the warrant requirement, e.g., ... exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>Id., </em>626 F.2d at 1161. The Court identified a nonexclusive list of circumstances justifying such an entry without a search warrant, noting, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[ejxigent circumstances may properly include hot pursuit or justifiable fear of injury to persons or property if the arrest is delayed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Under the facts of this case, the officers had a \u201creason to believe\u201d that Ford was present at 2347 Bethel Street. Officer Moore met Mr. Henderson, a professional bondsman with Henderson Bonding Company, who advised Moore that he had received a tip from a reliable informant that Ford could be found at 2347 Bethel Street. Because Ford had jumped or was about to jump bail, it was essential that the officers react immediately to the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Based upon the authority of the capias, the authority of Code \u00a7 19.2-149, and the fact that they had reason to believe Ford was located in the house, Moore and the bondsman went to 2347 Bethel Street intending to execute the capias and take Ford into custody! There they were met by Officer Samuels and Sergeant Kemp to aid in the arrest. The time of arrival was 10:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Officer Moore and the bondsman went to the front door, and Samuels and Kemp went to the rear door. Moore knocked on the door several minutes. Samuels, at the rear door, heard the knocking on the front door. Within three to four seconds after the knocking commenced, the back door opened and Washington stepped out. Samuels testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">Q. Describe the manner in which he came out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>A. He didn\u2019t know we were there. He was opening the door rather fast. I placed my hands on him. I said, Mr. Ford, and he said, no, I\u2019m Welford Washington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">I patted him down and asked him if he had any identification on him, and he said no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">Q. What, if anything, did he do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">A. He said that his driver\u2019s license was on the kitchen table. He turned to go into the house, and I went in in front of him, for safety\u2019s sake, and his driver\u2019s license was on the kitchen table, along with the drug paraphernalia that we recovered. All of it was in plain view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">Q. What were your safety concerns in stepping into the house first?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">A. I didn\u2019t know whether or not he was Reginald Ford or Welford Washington. I didn\u2019t know if Reginald Ford was in the house. I didn\u2019t know if there was a gun laying on this kitchen table, or if he was going to open the door, and go in, and slam the door, and then we have got a barricaded suspect to confront.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">Q. Why didn\u2019t you let him walk in first and you behind him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">A. He would have been able to access a gun on the kitchen table or anywhere else in the house. He could have first took off running through the whole house. It\u2019s too dangerous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b714-12\">Assuming, but not deciding, that stopping Washington in this manner to seek his identification constituted a seizure, as the majority holds, Officer Samuels had specific and articulable facts sufficient to justify the seizure. The majority appears to proceed upon the theory that the seizure was based upon the informant\u2019s tip. In this case, the officers were executing a capias to take Ford into custody. The bondsman was present and had statutory authority to arrest Ford. The officers had reason to believe that Ford was located at 2347 Bethel Street. This information was obtained from a rehable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>informant. This informant did not give any information about whether Ford had, or was about to engage in any criminal activity. He provided the address where Ford could be found. The bondsman and Officer Moore, who verified the validity of the capias, had full knowledge about Ford\u2019s identification, description and criminal activity. The majority states that \u201c[e]ven if the police had been armed with an arrest warrant for Ford and had a reasonable basis to believe he was in the residence, they still would have needed a search warrant to lawfully enter Washington\u2019s residence to arrest Ford.\u201d I disagree. To support this statement, the majority quotes from <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 590, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 1382, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980), in which the United States Supreme Court held: \u201cAbsent exigent circumstances that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\u201d The clear implication to be drawn from this statement is that with exigent circumstances, the threshold may reasonably be crossed without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">When Washington exited the rear door, he gave Officer Samuels reasonable suspicion to believe he was Ford and was exiting the premises to evade the police. Samuels heard Moore knocking on the front door, and Washington testified that he also heard the knocking at the front door. Washington did not answer the knock at the front door, but rapidly exited through the rear door three to four seconds after the knocking began.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The officers reasonably could infer from the evidence that, because no one knocked on the rear door, Washington was fleeing the premises. Officer Samuels testified that, from the manner Washington exited, it appeared he did not know the officers were present. Washington rapidly exited the door and \u201cstepped out\u201d of the house. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the trial judge could infer that Washington heard the knocking at the front door and fled through the rear door to evade the police because of the presence of drugs and drug paraphernalia on the kitchen table.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Under the circumstances, Samuels reasonably believed that Washington was Ford and that he was fleeing the premises to avoid being taken into custody under the capias or being arrested by the bondsman at the front door. Under these circumstances, Samuels was able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warranted stopping Washington to conduct a further investigation. <em>See Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1879-80, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Therefore, if stopping Washington to determine his identification under these circumstances was a Fourth Amendment seizure, then Samuels had sufficient specific and articulable facts to justify the stop, contrary to the conclusion reached by the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In the trial court, Washington argued that no exigent circumstances existed to permit the police to cross the threshold of the home. This is the issue upon which the trial judge decided the case. The majority has avoided this issue. Exigent circumstances exist where \u201cthere is a likelihood that the occupants will attempt to escape, resist, or destroy evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>585 F.2d 653, 662 (4th Cir.1978). In this case, a capias had been issued by a judicial officer to take Ford into custody because he had jumped bond or was about to jump bond, thus avoiding his trial. Officers must instantly determine whether exigent circumstances exist, and they are forced to act on incomplete clues as to what will unfold when they seek to effectuate an arrest. <em>See Bonner v. Anderson, </em>81 F.3d 472, 476-77 (4th Cir.1996) (Wilkinson, C.J., dissenting). When an arrest arises while the police are in the field investigating the conduct which is the basis for the arrest, there should be a far greater reluctance to fault the police for not having a search warrant. <em>See 2 </em>Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure </em>\u00a7 6.1(f) (3d ed. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has adopted the following principle regarding exigent circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">Exigent circumstances ... may justify as reasonable a warrantless entry into a dwelling, a search of the interior, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>seizure of contraband, and an arrest of those found in possession of it. Such warrantless entries into dwellings, followed by searches, seizures, and arrests therein, however, are presumed to be unreasonable, in Fourth Amendment terms, casting upon the police a heavy burden of proving justification by exigent circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><em>Verez v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 405, 410, 337 S.E.2d 749, 752-53 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In <em>Verez, </em>the Court put forth the following noncomprehensive list of factors and situations that may justify a warrant-less entry based upon exigent circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">(1) the degree of urgency involved and the time required to get a warrant; (2) the officers\u2019 reasonable belief that contraband is about to be removed or destroyed; (3) the possibility of danger to others, including police officers left to guard the site; (4) information that the possessors of the contraband are aware that the police may be on their trail; (5) whether the offense is serious, or involves violence; (6) whether officers reasonably believe the suspects are armed; (7) whether there is, at the time of entry, a clear showing of probable cause; (8) whether the officers have strong reason to believe the suspects are actually present in the premises; (9) the likelihood of escape if the suspects are not swiftly apprehended; and (10) the suspects recent entry into the premises after hot pursuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 410-11, 337 S.E.2d at 753. In determining whether exigent circumstances sufficiently \u201covercome the presumption of unreasonableness and justify a warrantless entry, the Court must examine the circumstances as they reasonably appeared to the law enforcement officers on the scene. \u2018The officers are not required to possess either the gift of prophecy or the infallible wisdom that comes only with hindsight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 337 S.E.2d at 753 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">In this case, Officer Samuels explained why he crossed the threshold of the residence, namely, he had reason to believe that Ford was present in the home. Ford had a reason to escape from the police. He had shown that he did not want to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>submit to the law, and, as a result, a capias had been issued for his arrest. Within seconds of Officer Moore\u2019s knock on the front door, a person rapidly exited through the rear door. Samuels inquired if he was Ford, and the person responded that he was Welford Washington. However, he possessed no identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">At this point, Samuels did not know whether he was talking to Ford or Washington. Having reason to believe that appellant might be Ford, who was escaping from the lawful authorization of the capias and attempting to avoid arrest, and who, in the act of fleeing, might be armed and dangerous, Samuels patted down Washington and asked him for some identification. I believe Samuels\u2019 actions were reasonable. At trial, Samuels explained that he did not know whether he was facing Ford or Washington; he did not know if a gun was in the kitchen, or whether appellant was going to slam the door and barricade himself in the house. Under these circumstances, when Washington turned and started back into the house without explaining what he was doing, Samuels was justified in entering the house because of the exigent circumstances. Almost all of the exigencies enumerated in <em>Verez </em>were present. Samuels acted reasonably when he stepped in front of Washington and went into the kitchen, where he saw the identification, as well as the illegal contraband on the kitchen table in plain view. Under the circumstances that reasonably appeared to Samuels, he acted reasonably and was justified in entering the house under these exigent circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The trial judge commented upon the evidence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">At that point, Mr. Washington makes known to Officer Samuels his identification as being Welford Washington, rather than Reginald Ford. He indicates, in effect, that he has no identification on his person, and that his identification is on the kitchen table, and bearing in mind that he just came out of the rear door of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">At that point, there is no precise testimony that Mr. Washington said I will go in and get it. But there was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>comment from Officer Samuels that Mr. Washington started back into the house, presumably to get the identification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">Under those circumstances, ... the options of the police officer may have been to detain Mr. Washington while the police officers went down and requested a warrant from the magistrate to enter the premises for the purpose of locating Mr. Reginald Ford, order permitting Mr. Washington to go into the house to obtain the identification, which he indicated was in the kitchen, to satisfy Officer Samuels that Mr. Washington, indeed, was not Mr. Reginald Ford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">When Mr. Washington elected to go into the house to acquire that, under those exigent circumstances, the Court finds no fault in Officer Samuels accompanying him into the house, and the fact that Officer Samuels went into the house, into the back door, in front of Mr. Washington does not change the Court\u2019s perception that it was a limited intrusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In the trial court, Washington argued that no exigent circumstances existed to permit the police to cross the threshold of the home. This is the issue upon which the trial court decided the case. The majority has avoided this issue by saying that the exigency was created by the police when they knocked on the front door. This argument lacks merit. We must look at the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the prevailing party. The exigency was created when Washington fled from the premises through the rear door when the police knocked on the front door. Had he answered at the front door and identified himself as Washington, this case may never have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">I find that, upon the circumstances of this case, that exigent circumstances justified Samuels\u2019 action when he stepped into the rear door in front of Washington in order to secure Washington\u2019s identification. Therefore, I would affirm the trial court\u2019s finding of exigent circumstances and affirm its denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
