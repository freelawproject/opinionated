We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. The judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-12\"><em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">On July 6, 1996, City of Richmond Police Officer Shepard was working off-duty as a security guard at the Richmond Medical Center (Center). Shepard testified that, on several occasions between 8:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., he saw Juares standing in the middle of the driveway that serves as the entrance to the Center. She had \u201cpositioned herself in the center of the entranceway to the [Center],\u201d and attempted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>pass out brochures and to speak to people who were approaching the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Juares stood in \u201cthe break in the sidewalk for the driveway,\u201d which was the only entrance to the Center. The sidewalk crossed over and merged with the driveway, which sloped down to the Center\u2019s parking lot. To enter the parking lot, vehicles were required to cross over the sloped sidewalk area. Because the entrance to the Center was adjacent to the driveway, people walked alongside the driveway to enter the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">On four different occasions, Shepard told Juares that she could not stand in the driveway. He advised her that she could stand on the sidewalk, that she could walk back and forth across the driveway, but that she could not stop and stand in the driveway. Each time, Juares had stood in the driveway for approximately two to three minutes. Shepard testified that \u201c[h]er whole attitude the whole day was arrogant and very hostile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Several people were required to walk onto the grassy area next to the sidewalk to avoid Juares, who was standing in the driveway. Some of the people that she blocked were \u201cjust walking down the sidewalk,\u201d while others were going into the Center. Shepard estimated that twenty people entered and left the driveway that day. He was unsure how many vehicles entered. Once or twice, Shepard saw Juares go up to a car entering the Center\u2019s parking lot, \u201cand actually put her hand on the car to hand the brochure or whatever it [was] that she was handing out to people coming into the [Center].\u201d Shepard testified that had a car driven away with Juares\u2019 hand still on it, \u201c[fit\u2019s a possibility she could have been injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The last time Shepard approached Juares, he told her he was going to issue her a summons. In a bench trial, Juares was convicted of obstructing the free passage of others, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-404 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">Any person or persons who in any public place or on any private property open to the public <em>unreasonably or unnec</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>essarily obstructs </em>the free passage of other persons to and from or within such place or property and who shall fail or refuse to cease such obstruction or move on when requested to do so ... shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYH\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Contending that the evidence fails to support her conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-404, Juares argues first, that her temporary presence in the driveway was necessary to permit her to share her views with the Center\u2019s patrons; and second, that any inconvenience to motorists and pedestrians resulting from her conduct did not \u201cunreasonably\u201d obstruct the free passage of other persons. We find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u201cGenerally, the words and phrases used in a statute should be given their ordinary and usually accepted meaning unless a different intention is fairly manifest.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The ordinary and plain meaning of \u201cunreasonable\u201d is \u201cnot governed by or acting according to reason\u201d or \u201cevincing indifference to reality or appropriate conduct.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2507 (1986). <em>See also Sydnor Pump &amp; Well Co. v. Taylor, </em>201 Va. 311, 317-18, 110 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1959) (defining \u201creasonable\u201d as \u201cjust, fair, and suitable under the circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u201cNecessarily\u201d means \u201cin such a way that it cannot be otherwise.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 1510. <em>See also Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Glick, </em>240 Va. 283, 288, 397 S.E.2d 105, 108 (1990). Conversely, \u201cunnecessarily\u201d means \u201cnot by necessity.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 2504.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">The adverbs \u201cunreasonably\u201d and \u201cunnecessarily\u201d modify the verb \u201cobstruct,\u201d and are an element required for conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-404. The accused must be proven to have obstructed the free passage of other persons either unreasonably <em>or </em>unnecessarily. Determining whether an obstruction is unreasonable or unnecessary requires an examination of the facts and circumstances of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Juares positioned herself so that people were required to walk around her, and vehicles were required to stop. She repeatedly refused Shepard\u2019s requests to cease blocking the driveway. She jeopardized her own safety and obstructed the free movement of other persons. As suggested by Shepard, she could just as well have proposed her views and tendered her brochures from the sidewalk without obstructing the driveway and the passage of other persons. She failed and refused to cease such obstruction when requested to do so by Shepard. Thus, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Juares\u2019 actions were unnecessary and unreasonable obstructions. Accordingly, the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt each element of Code \u00a7 18.2-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
