He contends the trial court erred when it (1) admitted as an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d the hearsay statement of the victim\u2019s three-year-old son (\u201cchild\u201d) and (2) ruled that the child\u2019s statement and evidence regarding his condition following the discovery of the victim\u2019s body were relevant. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">In early 1995, Lorann Cox (\u201cvictim\u201d) was working as an undercover drug informant for the Manassas City Police Department. On February 3, 1995, she executed a controlled buy of cocaine from appellant. On June 3, the Manassas police obtained a warrant for appellant\u2019s arrest based upon the information provided by the victim. This warrant was executed on June 7 and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for July 6. A subpoena was issued ordering the victim to appear and testify at the preliminary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">On June 30, appellant was riding in a car near the victim\u2019s home with his second cousin, Yolanda Skinner. Appellant told Skinner \u201cabout some charge that [the victim] had on him\u201d and stated that \u201che would kill [the victim], if he could.\u201d Appellant pointed out the victim\u2019s house to Skinner and said, \u201cthat\u2019s where the bitch lives.\u201d During this conversation, appellant asked Skinner if she knew where he could obtain a gun. Skinner replied that she did not know anybody who had a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">On the evening of July 2, the victim and her three year old visited her parents at their home. The victim\u2019s father noticed that the child\u2019s \u201cnose [was] running\u201d and made arrangements with the victim to care for the child the following day. The victim\u2019s father and the victim, who worked for the same employer but at different times of the day, arranged to meet at the end of the father\u2019s shift so that the father could take the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>child home and care for him while the victim worked. After making these arrangements, the victim left her parents\u2019 house around 10:30 p.m. to return home for the evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The next day, July 3, the victim did not meet her father at the appointed time. The victim\u2019s father attempted to contact her by phone and by pager, but the victim did not respond. The victim\u2019s father then drove to the victim\u2019s house and arrived there at about 2:35 p.m. He tried the front door, discovered that it was unlocked, and walked into the victim\u2019s house. After searching for six or seven minutes, he discovered his daughter\u2019s body lying face down behind a love seat in the living room. He also found the child, who was unharmed, next to the victim\u2019s body. The victim\u2019s father picked up the child and removed him from the scene. Four minutes later, the victim\u2019s father used a phone in a neighboring house to call \u201c911\u201d and then the victim\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Both an ambulance and the police arrived at the scene a short while later. The victim\u2019s house was secured, and investigators collected evidence from the scene. A metal cooking pot with a large dent in it was found a few feet from the victim\u2019s body. A plastic container that dispensed body lotion was found next to the victim\u2019s sink. A bloody fingerprint matching appellant\u2019s right index finger was found on top of the dispenser\u2019s pumping mechanism. A DNA analysis of the blood in which the fingerprint was formed indicated a high probability that it was the victim\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">An autopsy of the victim revealed that she was stabbed nineteen times in the neck with a sharp object. The medical examiner also found \u201ca number of bruises about the [victim\u2019s] body and face\u201d and a swollen area on the back of her head that were consistent with \u201ca blow to the head with a large object such as a pot.\u201d The victim\u2019s death was attributed to the stab wounds to her neck, which caused \u201cprofuse bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Ronald Wortmann, an inmate in the Prince William County Adult Detention Center, informed authorities that appellant confessed to him that he murdered the victim. Wortmann later testified that he asked appellant \u201cwhat he was in here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>for\u201d and appellant told him that he had been charged with the victim\u2019s murder. Appellant then told Wortmann that \u201c[he] did the bitch.\u201d Appellant told Wortmann he had learned that the victim was working undercover for the Manassas City Police Department by following her when she met with officers at the police department. When Wortmann asked him why he had murdered the victim, appellant responded, \u201cshe was going to tell on all of us.\u201d Appellant also told Wortmann that \u201ca baby\u201d was at the scene when he murdered the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Appellant was charged with the capital murder and robbery of the victim. A jury convicted him of first degree murder and petit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The scope of this appeal is limited to the admissibility of an out-of-court statement made by the child after he was discovered at the crime scene and the evidence regarding his condition during this time. The following is a summary of the contested evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">At trial, the victim\u2019s father testified that when he found the child next to the victim\u2019s body, \u201cit looked like [the child] had been sleeping across her body____\u201d After he picked up the child and carried him out of the house, the victim\u2019s father noticed that \u201c[the child] had dried mucous down the front of his nose from the cold\u201d and that he was wearing \u201cthe same diaper that he had on the night before.\u201d He also noticed that the child was wearing a t-shirt that had \u201csome blood on it\u201d and that the child \u201chad kind of a glazed look in his eyes\u201d and \u201cwas in a dazed state.\u201d Appellant objected to all of this evidence on the ground that it was not relevant, and the trial court overruled his objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Later in the trial, the victim\u2019s brother testified that the victim\u2019s father gave the child to him outside the victim\u2019s home. The victim\u2019s brother testified that he spoke with a police officer for about five minutes and then took the child to his home \u201cto get him away from everything.\u201d The victim\u2019s brother noticed that the child \u201cwas not himself\u2019 and that he \u201cwas in shock, kind of dazed.\u201d The victim\u2019s brother also observed blood on the child\u2019s shirt and identified in court the blood<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>stained shirt that the child had been wearing. The victim\u2019s brother testified that his wife washed the shirt before delivering it to the police. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to all of this evidence on the ground that it was irrelevant, and the trial court again overruled his objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">The victim\u2019s sister-in-law testified that, on July 3, the victim\u2019s brother brought the child to their house from the crime scene. She testified that the child \u201cwas quiet [and] subdued\u201d and that \u201cthere was some blood on his shirt.\u201d She testified that she removed the blood-stained shirt from the child and eventually washed it. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to all of this evidence on the ground that it was not relevant. The trial court overruled his objections. The victim\u2019s sister-in-law also testified that the child made statements about the victim \u201cevery ten to fifteen minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">Kathleen Burch testified that she arrived at the residence of the victim\u2019s sister-in-law on July 3 after the child was already there. She testified that the child indicated to her that he wanted to \u201cgo out and play\u201d and that she took him outside. When asked to describe the child\u2019s \u201cdemeanor and appearance,\u201d Burch testified that the child \u201cwas very quiet and just dazed.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The Commonwealth then indicated to the trial court that it intended to offer a statement that the child made to Burch while the two were outside. The trial court heard arguments regarding the admissibility of this statement outside the presence of the jury. The Commonwealth proffered that Burch would testify that \u201cthe child unsolicited told her the man\u2014 hit[ing] his head like this (indicating) \u2014 Mommy on the head.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that the statement was inadmissible on three grounds: (1) it was hearsay not within the excited utterance exception; (2) it was cumulative of other evidence already admitted; and (3) it was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">The trial court ruled that the child\u2019s statement was relevant. It reasoned that the statement was probative of \u201chow that contusion came to be on [the victim\u2019s] head\u201d and of \u201cthe gender of the person who struck her.\u201d The trial court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ruled that the statement, although hearsay, fell within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvZ\">The age of the child, I think, is a substantial factor. And the evidence in this case establishes at least this. That while it\u2019s not clear what period of time elapsed between the time that [the victim] was injured or killed until the time he saw [the victim\u2019s father], the evidence does establish fairly clearly that from the time [the victim\u2019s father] came and picked him up out of there he was passed off in quick succession from [the victim\u2019s father] to [the victim\u2019s brother] ... to [the victim\u2019s sister-in-law] and then to [Burch], and that he was variously described as quiet, dazed, those sorts of things, which is to say ... in my view that [the child was] under the influence of the events still....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Burch then testified that the child told her \u201c[t]hat man (indicating) mommy on the head.\u201d The record established that Burch placed her hand to her head \u201cin a striking manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Later in the trial, Officer S.C. Newsome of the Prince William County Police Department testified that, on March 6, 1996, the victim\u2019s sister-in-law gave him the blood-stained shirt worn by the child on July 3, 1995. He identified the shirt in court, and the Commonwealth offered the shirt into evidence. Appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of the shirt \u201con a relevance basis,\u201d and the trial court overruled his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">EXCITED UTTERANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Appellant contends the trial court erred when it concluded that the child\u2019s hearsay statement to Burch fell within the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">\u201cAs a general rule, hearsay evidence is incompetent and inadmissible,\u201d and \u201c[t]he party seeking to rely upon an exception to the hearsay rule has the burden of establishing admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>sibility.\u201d <em>Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 416, 420-21, 425 S.E.2d 521, 524 (1992).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">A statement comes within the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule and is admissible to prove the truth of the matter stated, when the statement is spontaneous and impulsive, thus guaranteeing its reliability. \u201cThere is no fixed rule by which the question whether the statement is admissible as an excited utterance can be decided. Resolution of the issue depends upon the circumstances of each case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap0\">The statement must be prompted by a startling event and be made at such time and under such circumstances as to preclude the presumption that it was made as the result of deliberation. In addition, the declarant must have firsthand knowledge of the startling event. The decision whether the statement qualifies as an excited utterance lies within the discretion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\"><em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 460, 470 S.E.2d 114, 126, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 117 S.Ct. 222, 136 L.Ed.2d 154 (1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">Whether a hearsay statement is an excited utterance is not determined solely by the lapse of time between the \u201cstartling event\u201d and the declaration. <em>See Doe v. Thomas, </em>227 Va. 466, 471-72, 318 S.E.2d 382, 385 (1984). Instead, the lapse of time is but one circumstance to consider when determining whether the declarant\u2019s statement was \u201c \u2018prompted by a startling event, and not the product of premeditation, reflection, or design.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 441, 358 S.E.2d 415, 417 (1987) (citation omitted). \u201c[I]n the case of statements made by young children, the element of trustworthiness underscoring the spontaneous and excited utterance exception finds its source primarily in the child\u2019s lack of capacity to fabricate such a story rather than the lack of time to fabricate.\u201d <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 768, 773, 454 S.E.2d 737, 740 (1995) (citing <em>Martin, </em>4 Va.App. at 445, 358 S.E.2d at 418).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the child\u2019s out-of-court statement to Burch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. The child\u2019s age, the evidence of his condition from the time he was discovered at the crime scene until he made his statement, and the circumstances of the making of the statement support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the child was speaking spontaneously in response to a startling event of which he had firsthand knowledge. The child was only three years old on the date of the victim\u2019s murder. The evidence indicates that the child observed the attack on his mother and was in her presence as she subsequently bled to death. The child was alone with his mother\u2019s body from the time of the attack until the victim\u2019s father found him around 2:35 p.m. on July 3. The child\u2019s shirt was stained with blood. The child was passed from the victim\u2019s father to the victim\u2019s brother to the victim\u2019s sister-in-law to Burch in relatively quick succession. All of these persons testified that the child appeared \u201cin shock,\u201d \u201cquiet,\u201d and \u201cdazed.\u201d The record indicates that the child made his statement to Burch within an hour of being discovered by the victim\u2019s father and that his statement was unsolicited. Although the record does not establish how much time elapsed between the victim\u2019s murder and the child\u2019s statement to Burch, the child\u2019s limited capacity to fabricate and the evidence that he remained visibly distressed to each person who handled him indicates that his statement was sufficiently reliable to be admitted as an excited utterance.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">RELEVANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred when it concluded that the child\u2019s statement and the evidence regarding his condition after the victim\u2019s body was discovered were relevant. He specifically challenges the admissibility of the child\u2019s statement, the evidence that he was wearing a blood-stained shirt and an unchanged diaper, and the evidence that he had dried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>mucous around his nose and was in a dazed state.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that the prejudicial effect of this evidence outweighed its probative value. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u201cThe admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988). \u201cEvidence is admissible if it is both relevant and material.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 196, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441 (1987). \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993). \u201c \u2018Upon finding that certain evidence is relevant, the trial court is then required to employ a balancing test to determine whether the prejudicial effect of the evidence sought to be admitted is greater than its probative value.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wise v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 178, 188, 367 S.E.2d 197, 203 (1988)). On appeal, a trial judge\u2019s ruling that any relevant evidence outweighs any incidental prejudice will be reversed only on a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ferrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 380, 390, 399 S.E.2d 614, 620 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that .the evidence challenged by appellant was relevant and that the prejudice did not outweigh its probative value. The child\u2019s statement was relevant to the identity of the murderer and the causation of the victim\u2019s injuries. The child\u2019s statement provided the only direct evidence in the record regarding the gender of the victim\u2019s assailant. In addition, the child\u2019s statement that he saw a man strike his mother on the head tended to establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>contusion on the victim\u2019s head was caused by a blow from her assailant rather than from striking the ground when she fell to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The evidence regarding the child\u2019s condition after he was discovered at the crime scene by the victim\u2019s father was relevant to the trustworthiness of his out-of-court statement to Burch. Although the child\u2019s statement passed the threshold test of admissibility as an excited utterance, the ultimate credibility and weight of this statement were questions for the jury. <em>See Litchford v. Hancock, </em>232 Va. 496, 499, 352 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1987). Evidence that tends to establish the credibility of a witness or the reliability of evidence is relevant and admissible. The evidence regarding the mucous on the child\u2019s face and the fact that he was wearing \u201cthe diaper that he had on the night before\u201d tended to prove the length of time between the \u201cstartling event\u201d he observed and his statement. The evidence that he was wearing a blood-stained shirt and that he appeared dazed was relevant to prove that he was still under the influence of witnessing his mother\u2019s murder at the time of his statement. Furthermore, based on our review of the record, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion when it concluded that the incidental prejudicial effect did not outweigh the probative value of the child\u2019s statement and the evidence regarding his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the convictions of first degree murder and petit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\">. Appellant also challenges the admissibility of a portion of Ronald Wortmann's testimony. At trial, Ronald Wortmann testified that appellant stated that he saw the child when he murdered the victim and that he contemplated killing the child. Appellant contends that this testimony was also irrelevant and erroneously admitted into evidence. However, appellant failed to raise this issue in his petition for appeal. Rule 5A: 12(c) bars us from considering the merits of this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
