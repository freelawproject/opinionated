The jury sentenced him to three years imprisonment. Shifflett contends that the trial judge erred in excluding from the jury\u2019s consideration mitigating evidence relevant to sentencing. A panel of this Court, with one judge dissenting, affirmed the trial judge\u2019s decision. <em>See Shifflett v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 538, 484 S.E.2d 134 (1997). For the reasons that follow, upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we reverse and remand for a new sentencing proceeding in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">During the guilt phase of Shifflett\u2019s trial, State Police Trooper Bob Davis testified for the Commonwealth that he passed a service station and saw Shifflett pumping gas into Norma Roach\u2019s truck. Trooper Davis recognized Shifflett as an habitual offender whom he had arrested a year earlier. Trooper Davis waited at a place that he knew Shifflett would have to pass to get home. When Shifflett drove by with Roach in the passenger seat, Trooper Davis signalled for Shifflett to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">In Shifflett\u2019s defense, a friend and co-worker testified that he drove Shifflett to work on the date of the offense and was to drive Shifflett home that evening. However, when the friend learned in the middle of the day that he had to work late, he told Shifflett to find another ride home.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Shifflett testified that he contacted Norma Kim Roach, the woman with whom he lives and who is the mother of his children, and asked her to come for him. However, Roach said that she did not feel well. Shifflett told Roach that if she was not at his place of employment at the end of his work shift he would attempt to find a ride with someone or walk if necessary. He worked in Charlottesville but lived in Earleysville.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">When Shifflett left work, Roach was waiting in her truck and told Shifflett that she still was not feeling well. While driving home, Roach became dizzy and began to lean forward. Shifflett testified that he grabbed the steering wheel and told Roach to stop. After Roach drove into a restaurant\u2019s parking lot, Shifflett obtained food and a drink for her. Shifflett testified that after Roach told him that she still did not feel better, he drove the truck because their children, ages eleven and four, were alone at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Shifflett testified that he stopped on the way home to buy gas for the truck. While Shifflett was pumping the gas, Roach went inside the store to pay for the gas. When Shifflett drove away from the store, the officer signalled for Shifflett to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">After the jury found Shifflett guilty of driving after having been declared an habitual offender, Shifflett\u2019s counsel informed the trial judge that he intended to offer mitigating testimony about Shifflett\u2019s employment, family responsibilities, and his motive for committing the offense. The trial judge ruled that testimony from Roach about Shifflett\u2019s family responsibilities was inadmissible. Over Shifflett\u2019s objection, the trial judge ruled that evidence at the penalty phase would be limited to the \u201crange of punishment established by [the] legislature, injury to the victim, use of [a] weapon, extent of [the] offender\u2019s participation, the offense, [the] offender\u2019s motive in committing the offense, prior record and rehabilitative efforts, drug and alcohol use, age, health and education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">During the penalty phase, Roach was permitted to testify that she was not feeling well when Shifflett called and told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>that he needed a ride home. She went for him because he had no means of getting home, except by walking. She testified that as they were leaving Charlottesville, she became dizzy from vertigo. She further testified that she has had episodes of vertigo for twelve years, that she has had three ear surgeries, and that she continues to receive treatment. When she did not feel better after eating, she asked Shifflett to drive because she was concerned about their children being at home alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Roach\u2019s doctor testified that Roach suffers from vertigo. He testified that her \u201cvertigo ... is a ... dizzy condition ... that\u2019s transient, that comes and goes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">When Shifflett\u2019s counsel sought to question Shifflett\u2019s employer about Shifflett\u2019s employment, the trial judge sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection based on the prior ruling limiting the evidence. However, after the jury rendered its verdict on the sentence, the trial judge discharged the jury and heard the testimony of Shifflett\u2019s employer, William Amos Breeden, before he imposed the jury\u2019s sentence. Breeden testified that Shifflett did an \u201cexcellent job\u201d as his employee and that Shifflett was paid nine dollars per hour. Breeden also testified as follows about efforts Shifflett made to get to work:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVi\">Well, for a couple months or three months, I was going to pick [Shifflett] up at his house and taking him home and his dad also paints, so, I hired his dad a month ago and he brings him to my house and we leave from my house every morning at 5:30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Breeden testified that Shifflett displayed no \u201cindication of any alcohol abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The rule is long standing in Virginia that \u201c[w]ithin the limits prescribed by law, the terms of confinement in the state correctional facility or in jail and the amount of fine, if any, of a person convicted of a criminal offense, shall be ascertained by the jury, or by the court in cases tried without a jury.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-295. Recently, the legislature established a proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>dure bifurcating the trial and punishment proceedings. In pertinent part, the statute states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">In cases of trial by jury, upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony, a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable before the same jury____ After the Commonwealth has introduced ... evidence of prior convictions, or if no such evidence is introduced, the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. This statute vests in juries wide discretion in recommending a sentence within the statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">The purpose of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 is to provide two separate phases of a trial. \u201cThe procedure assures the jury access to \u2018information specific only to sentencing, apart from the considerations of guilt or innocence,\u2019 thereby promoting a punishment appropriate to the circumstances without [prejudicing] the initial determination of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Daye v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 688, 689, 467 S.E.2d 287, 288 (1996) (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018The sentencing decision ... is a quest for a sentence that best effectuates the criminal justice system\u2019s goals of deterrence (general and specific), incapacitation, retribution and rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 524, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996) (citation omitted) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The general principle is well established that in the exercise of its sentencing function, \u201c[a] jury must be allowed to consider ... all relevant evidence.\u201d <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 271, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 2956, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976); <em>see Pierce v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 581, 584-85, 466 S.E.2d 130, 132 (1996). \u201cFor the determination of sentences, justice generally requires consideration of more than the particular acts by which the crime was committed and that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania v. Ashe, </em>302 U.S. 51, 55, 58 S.Ct. 59, 61, 82 L.Ed. 43 (1937).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>[W]here sentencing discretion is granted, it generally has been agreed that the sentencing [jury\u2019s] \u201cpossession of the fullest information possible concerning the defendant\u2019s life and characteristics\u201d is \u201c[h]ighly <em>relevant </em>\u2014 if <em>not </em>essential\u2014 [to the] selection of an appropriate sentence____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\"><em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 602-03, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2964, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (quoting <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1083, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949)). Because the circumstances of the offense and the character and propensities of the offender vary in each case, \u201cthe concept of individualized sentencing in criminal cases generally, although not constitutionally required, has long been accepted in this country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 602, 98 S.Ct. at 2963.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The employer\u2019s testimony regarding Shifflett\u2019s success at work and his efforts to maintain a commuting schedule that obviated his need to drive reflects on Shifflett\u2019s \u201ccharacter and propensities.\u201d <em>Ashe, </em>302 U.S. at 55, 58 S.Ct. at 61. Moreover, relevant sentencing factors traditionally have included an accused\u2019s habits, lifestyle, mental resources, family, and occupation. <em>See Bassett v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 580, 581, 414 S.E.2d 419, 420 (1992); <em>State v. Lemley, </em>552 N.W.2d 409, 412 (S.D.1996); <em>State v. Morris, </em>750 S.W.2d 746, 750 (Tenn.Crim. App.1987). <em>Cf. Burket v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 596, 615, 450 S.E.2d 124, 135 (1994); <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 136, 141, 431 S.E.2d 48, 51 (1993); <em>Cornell v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 468, 352 S.E.2d 352, 360 (1987) (capital murder cases in which the trial judge considered issues such as defendant\u2019s age, family background, and work history in sentencing phase of trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Although the trial judge did not admit this mitigating testimony for the jury to consider, the trial judge obviously was aware that testimony concerning Shifflett\u2019s employment may have had a bearing on the punishment decision. The trial judge considered the testimony of Shifflett\u2019s employer before he imposed the jury\u2019s sentence. However, the principle is well established that judges \u201cdo not weigh the evidence\u201d of mitigation for the sentencing jury. <em>Eddings v. Oklahoma, </em>455 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>104, 117, 102 S.Ct. 869, 878, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). The testimony of Shifflett\u2019s employer was relevant, admissible, and erroneously excluded from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>See Jurele, </em>428 U.S. at 271, 96 S.Ct. at 2956 (stating that sentencing <em>juries </em>must be provided with \u201call relevant evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In addition, the testimony of Roach was not offered merely to prove the family\u2019s apparent need for his income. Her testimony would have proved that Shifflett was a responsible father who worked earnestly to provide for his children. Certainly, evidence that a defendant has contributed positively to his family situation is a relevant circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Shifflett\u2019s evidence reflected upon his habits, character, and family circumstances and was therefore relevant to determining an appropriate punishment. We therefore hold that the trial judge erred in excluding the evidence from the jury\u2019s consideration. <em>Accord State v. Lee, </em>600 So.2d 796, 799 (La.Ct. App.1992) (stating that when sentencing a defendant, \u201c[i]mportant elements to be considered are the convict\u2019s personal history (age, family ties, marital status, health, employment record), prior criminal record or absence thereof, [the] seriousness of the particular offense, and the likelihood of recidivism or rehabilitation\u201d); <em>People v. Andrade, </em>279 Ill.App.3d 292, 215 Ill.Dec. 859, 869, 664 N.E.2d 256, 266 (1996) (stating that when sentencing a defendant, \u201c[Relevant factors include ... defendant\u2019s credibility, demeanor, general moral character, mentality, social environment, habits, age, and criminal history\u201d). <em>See generally People v. Whalin, </em>885 P.2d 293, 298 (Colo.Ct.App.1994) (stating that when sentencing a defendant, \u201c[r]elevant factors to be considered include ... the character of the offender\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Cotter, </em>415 Mass. 183, 612 N.E.2d 1145, 1148 (1993) (stating that when sentencing a defendant, the \u201cdefendant\u2019s character and propensity for rehabilitation are relevant ... considerations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand the case for a new sentencing proceeding consistent with this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ANNUNZIATA, Judge, with whom COLEMAN and OVERTON, Judges, join, dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Because I believe the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding appellant\u2019s evidence of the impact of his incarceration on his family and employment, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, detailing the sentencing proceeding in bifurcated felony jury trials, a \u201cdefendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.\u201d The question before this Court is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the evidence appellant sought to introduce did not fall within the scope of \u201crelevant ... evidence related to punishment\u201d under Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1. <em>See Coppola v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 253, 257 S.E.2d 797, 804 (1979) (\u201c[Discretion is vested in the trial court to determine, subject to the rules of evidence governing admissibility, the evidence which may be adduced in mitigation of the offense.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Three well-accepted principles should guide our analysis of this issue. First, pursuant to the principles of statutory construction, the sentencing provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 may be validly analogized to the statutory provisions applicable to the sentencing phase of bifurcated capital murder trials. <em>See Gilliam v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 519, 522-23, 465 S.E.2d 592, 594 (1996); <em>Bunn v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 593, 598, 466 S.E.2d 744, 746 (1996). Second, this Court must look to the \u201cdeclared purposes of punishment for criminal conduct,\u201d including \u201c \u2018deterrence (general and specific), incapacitation, retribution and rehabilitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gilliam, </em>21 Va. App. at 524, 465 S.E.2d at 594 (quoting <em>United States v. Morris, </em>837 F.Supp. 726, 729 (E.D.Va.1993)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Third, Virginia law has historically maintained a clear distinction between the roles played by judge and jury in criminal sentencing. The trial judge, rather than the jury, \u201cis vested with the responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>bility of considering mitigating circumstances and pronouncing sentence.\u201d <em>Bruce v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 298, 303, 387 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1990) (citing <em>Duncan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 342, 345, 343 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1986)); <em>see also Vines v. Muncy, </em>553 F.2d 342, 349 (4th Cir.1977); <em>Allard v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 57, 67-68, 480 S.E.2d 139, 144 (1997); <em>Duncan, </em>2 Va.App. at 345-46, 343 S.E.2d at 394-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4, the statutory provisions applicable to the sentencing phase of bifurcated capital murder trials, \u201c[t]he jury has the duty to consider all the evidence relevant to sentencing, both favorable and unfavorable\u201d before making its determination. <em>E.g., Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 275-76, 257 S.E.2d 808, 819 (1979). Evidence considered relevant to jury sentencing and in mitigation of punishment in capital murder sentencing is specifically addressed under Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the list of mitigating factors is not exclusive, the enumerated factors share a common denominator: they all address either the defendant or the circumstances surrounding the crime. <em>See Coppola, </em>220 Va. at 253, 257 S.E.2d at 804 (\u201cThe kind of evidence therein contemplated bears upon the record of the defendant and the atrociousness of his crime.\u201d). Accordingly, under the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>scheme, mitigating evidence is that which shows \u201c \u2018extenuating circumstances tending to explain, but not excuse, [the] commission of the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Correll v. Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 468, 352 S.E.2d 352, 360 (1987) (quoting <em>Coppola, </em>220 Va. at 253, 257 S.E.2d at 797); <em>see also Burket v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 596, 616, 450 S.E.2d 124, 135 (1994); <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 136, 142, 431 S.E.2d 48, 52 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Applying these principles, I would find the trial court did not abuse its discretion. During the sentencing phase, appellant sought to elicit testimony from his girlfriend and employer concerning the financial impact of his incarceration on his family and employer. Unlike the fact that appellant resided with his family and that he was employed, evidence of which was before the jury during the guilt phase of the trial, the testimony in question did not relate to appellant himself or the circumstances surrounding the crime. The evidence was, therefore, not relevant evidence related to punishment under Virginia law. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-264.4; <em>Coppola, </em>220 Va. at 253-54, 257 S.E.2d at 804 (holding that the effect of incarceration upon relatives is not a mitigating circumstance \u201canalogous to any of the evidence specifically approved in the statute\u201d). Nor was the evidence in question offered to explain the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Furthermore, the relevance of appellant\u2019s proffered evidence in this case, as it relates to the purposes of sentencing, must be viewed, not in the abstract, but in the context of the jury\u2019s sentencing role under Virginia law. <em>See Duncan, </em>2 Va.App. at 345-46, 343 S.E.2d at 394-95. The declared purposes of punishment for criminal conduct relate to: (1) the defendant (specific deterrence, incapacitation and rehabilitation); (2) the victim (retribution); or (3) the public at large (general deterrence). <em>See Gilliam, </em>21 Va.App. at 524, 465 S.E.2d at 594 (citing <em>Morris, </em>837 F.Supp. at 729). However, the jury\u2019s role and its relationship to these sentencing purposes have been limited by Virginia law. Specifically, in non-capital cases, Virginia law confines the jury to determining the appropriate range of incarceration, with the exception that a judge may add a suspended sentence to the jury\u2019s recommen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>dation to ensure post-release supervision. <em>Allard, </em>24 Va.App. at 68, 480 S.E.2d at 144; <em>Bruce, </em>9 Va.App. at 303, 387 S.E.2d at 281 (citing <em>Duncan, 2 </em>Va.App. at 345, 343 S.E.2d at 394). Neither retribution nor rehabilitation through means other than incarceration comes within the purview of the sentencing jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Recent amendments to the statutory scheme have not eviscerated the distinction Virginia law has historically maintained between the respective roles of judge and jury, a distinction the majority opinion fails to reflect. <em>See Allard, </em>24 Va.App. at 68, 480 S.E.2d at 144. Most of the cases the majority relies upon arise not in the context of jury sentencing, but rather in the context of sentencing by the judge;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the remainder do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>address the question of what evidence a defendant is entitled to present to a sentencing jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The only authority cited by the majority which addresses mitigation evidence in the context of jury sentencing is <em>Jurek v. Texas, </em>428 U.S. 262, 271, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 2956, 49 L.Ed.2d 929 (1976). The analysis of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Jurek, </em>however, highlights the distinction between judge and jury sentencing in Virginia. The Texas statute at issue in <em>Jurek </em>provided that the jury\u2019s resolution of three statutory questions determined whether the death penalty would be imposed; the judge had no role to play in determining the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 96 S.Ct. at 2955. In contrast, Virginia sentencing procedure grants to the judge final authority over the sentence. <em>Duncan, 2 </em>Va.App. at 345, 343 S.E.2d at 394 (citing <em>Vines v. Muncy, </em>553 F.2d 342, 349 (4th Cir.1977)). Precisely because the judge bears the ultimate responsibility for imposing sentence, \u201cthe consideration of mitigating circumstances [is for] the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 343 S.E.2d at 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Finally, the majority\u2019s approach is foreclosed in large part by the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Coppola, </em>220 Va. 243, 257 S.E.2d 797.
