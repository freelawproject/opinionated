Briscoe contends that the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury that he would be ineligible for parole. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">On August 7, 1995, Briscoe shot Luis Glaize. A jury convicted Briscoe of aggravated malicious wounding and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The trial court instructed the jury that the penalty range for aggravated malicious wounding is twenty years to \u201cimprisonment for life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">Dining deliberations, the jury sent the trial court a note asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-12\">(1) Please provide definition (in number of years) of \u201cImprisonment for life\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-13\">(2) When is the eligibility of parole for a 20 year sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">In response to the first question, the trial court replied: \u201c \u2018Imprisonment for life\u2019 means the plain, common definition of those words.\u201d As to the second question, the trial court replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-15\">You should impose such punishment as you think is just under the evidence and within the instructions of the Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>You are not to concern yourselves with what may happen afterwards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The jury fixed Briscoe\u2019s punishment at thirty-two years in prison for aggravated malicious wounding and three years for use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. By final order, the trial court imposed these sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Our decision in this case is controlled by <em>Mosby v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 284, 482 S.E.2d 72 (1997). In <em>Mosby, </em>we held that a trial court is not required to instruct the jury on a defendant\u2019s eligibility for parole in non-capital cases. <em>Id. </em>at 286, 482 S.E.2d at 72. \u201cParole ineligibility\u201d is not based upon a defendant\u2019s character, culpability, or the nature of the offense, and is not, therefore, relevant to punishment. <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 50, 66, 486 S.E.2d 126, 134 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The trial court instructed the jurors that \u201cimprisonment for life\u201d is self-explanatory and that they should not concern themselves with what might occur in the future. These responses to the jury\u2019s inquiries were proper. <em>See Clagett v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 79, 94, 472 S.E.2d 263, 272 (1996); <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 201, 214, 257 S.E.2d 784, 792 (1979); <em>Hinton v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 492, 247 S.E.2d 704 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
