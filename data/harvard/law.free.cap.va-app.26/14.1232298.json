For the reasons that follow, we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Kathy Myrtle Adkins was indicted by a grand jury for murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder. Prior to her indictment, the victim\u2019s family hired David Epling, a private attorney, to assist in the prosecution of the case. Epling worked closely with an assistant Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and participated in the decision to indict Adkins on the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">While the case was pending, Sheila Tolliver was elected to serve as Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney and assumed the office. Because Tolliver had previously represented Adkins\u2019 daughter, Tolliver filed a motion for leave to withdraw and for appointment of a special prosecutor. Due to Tolliver\u2019s conflict, the trial judge granted the motion and appointed Epling to serve as special prosecutor. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Adkins objected to the appointment of Epling. At a hearing on the issue, counsel for Adkins stated that Adkins\u2019 concern was that \u201cEpling is prosecuting her after being employed by the family to do that.\u201d Counsel further stated that Adkins \u201cis entitled to a totally independent, objective prosecutor.\u201d Epling responded that he was no longer being compensated by the victim\u2019s family. Affirming the appointment, the judge stated that he considered \u201cEpling as a totally independent and impartial prosecutor.\u201d The judge further noted that although Epling \u201cmay have been employed by the family, ... that would [not] qualify him as an inappropriate person for prosecution in the cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Adkins was tried and convicted. She filed a motion to set aside the verdict because her rights to due process and a fair trial were denied by allowing Epling to act as special prosecutor. The trial judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Virginia adheres to \u201cthe common-law rule which generally permits the appearance of private counsel <em>to assist </em>the prosecution.\u201d <em>Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 387, 392, 329 S.E.2d 22, 26 (1985) (emphasis added). \u201cAt common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>law, a prosecuting attorney \u2018is the representative of the public in whom is lodged a discretion ..., which is not to be controlled by the courts or <em>by an interested individual.\u2019\u201d Ganger v. Peyton, </em>379 F.2d 709, 713 (4th Cir.1967) (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018[T]he breadth of discretion that our country\u2019s legal system vests in prosecuting attorneys carries with it the potential for individual and institutional abuse.\u2019\u201d <em>Lux v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 561, 568, 484 S.E.2d 145, 148 (1997) (quoting <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 365, 98 S.Ct. 663, 669, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978)). Thus, we require impartiality in the exercise of discretion on the part of the prosecutor. <em>See Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">This case is governed by the principles the Supreme Court of Virginia set forth in <em>Cantrell. </em>There, an attorney was hired by a murder victim\u2019s family \u201cto help get ... Cantrell convicted.\u201d 229 Va. at 391, 329 S.E.2d at 25. Although the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney was present at the trial and took an active role, the private prosecutor examined most of the witnesses, generally acted as lead counsel, and made the closing argument to the jury. The private prosecutor was also retained by the family in a civil suit to seek a change in custody of Cantrell\u2019s child from Cantrell to the victim\u2019s parents. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Cantrell argued that the private prosecutor\u2019s employment by the victim\u2019s family created a conflict of interest which rendered the private prosecutor\u2019s participation in the criminal prosecution improper to a degree that denied Cantrell due process of law. He also argued that the private prosecutor had an incentive other than the impartial administration of justice to seek a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In discussing the limitations on the role of a private prosecutor, the Supreme Court stated that when a private prosecutor has been engaged to assist in a criminal proceeding, \u201cthe public prosecutor must remain in continuous control of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 329 S.E.2d at 26. Noting the different roles of a private and a public prosecutor, the Court stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>duty of a private prosecutor is to zealously represent his client\u2019s interests while a public prosecutor\u2019s duty is \u201c \u2018to seek justice, not merely to convict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Supreme Court ruled that the private prosecutor\u2019s dual role as prosecutor and civil attorney created a conflict of interest which interfered with the fair administration of justice. The Court held that, under the circumstances, the private prosecutor\u2019s role infringed on the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Commonwealth contends that in <em>Cantrell </em>the private prosecutor had not been formally appointed as a special prosecutor, was not being paid by the Commonwealth, and had not taken an oath of office. The Commonwealth argues that Epling was formally appointed as special prosecutor and that, although Epling was initially hired by the victim\u2019s family to help in the prosecution of Adkins, he never represented them in any civil matter. Also, Epling terminated his representation of the family upon his appointment and was no longer being compensated by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">While the facts in this case differ from those in <em>Cantrell, </em>the rationale of <em>Cantrell </em>still applies. A public prosecutor is vested with a duty not merely to convict but to see that the accused receives a fair and impartial trial. A special prosecutor appointed by the trial judge steps into the role of public prosecutor and necessarily accepts that duty of impartiality. However, where a special prosecutor has a \u201cpersonal interest in the outcome of the prosecution,\u201d <em>Lux, </em>24 Va.App. at 569, 484 S.E.2d at 149, \u201chis objectivity and impartiality are called into question,\u201d <em>id., </em>and a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial is violated. A special prosecutor who was formerly employed by the victim\u2019s family in connection with the same proceeding is incapable of exercising the fair-minded prosecutorial discretion to which the defendant is entitled, <em>see id., </em>due to his pre-existing interest in securing the conviction of the defendant. Once the private prosecutor who has been paid by the victim\u2019s family to obtain a conviction becomes the special prosecutor with full discretionary authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ty, obviously, the opportunity to give full reign to the partiality that initially existed is unchecked.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Epling was initially hired and paid by the victim\u2019s family to protect its interest, not the interest of the Commonwealth. When Epling was appointed special prosecutor, he was no longer merely assisting in the prosecution; he was given ultimate control of the case. In view of Epling\u2019s earlier receipt of payment by the victim\u2019s family to represent them in the prosecution of Adkins, he owed his allegiance to those clients and had a duty not to act adversely to their interest. We cannot say that when the trial judge appointed Epling as special prosecutor, with sole authority to make prosecutorial decisions, Epling was then able to act with fair-minded discretion and impartially or unprejudiced by motives related to his earlier private gain. \u201cThe likelihood of conflict between those two duties rises to the level of an overwhelming probability.\u201d <em>Cantrell, </em>229 Va. at 393, 329 S.E.2d at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Having once been paid by the victim\u2019s family to protect its interest and to assist in the prosecution, Epling was prohibited for reasons of conflict of interest from becoming a special prosecutor. The conflict of interest between a special prosecutor\u2019s duty \u201cto seek justice\u201d and his duty to his former client denied the defendant her right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>See id. </em>at 394, 329 S.E.2d at 26-27. Accordingly, we reverse the convictions and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
