Bass, Jr. (\u201cclaimant\u201d). Employer argues that the commission erroneously: (1) excluded claimant\u2019s testimony regarding the relationship between work stress and his hypertension; (2) found that his claim was not time-barred; (3) found that claimant established the presence of coronary artery disease and met his burden of proving a compensable occupational disease; and (4) found that employer\u2019s evidence was insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption of Code \u00a7 65.2-402. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Claimant is a police captain who has been a member of the Richmond Police Department since 1964. During his tenure with the department, claimant worked in the organized crime unit, the detective division, and the narcotics squad. His duties were often dangerous, and he received numerous promotions and decorations.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In October 1994, while at home preparing supper, claimant experienced \u201ca strange sensation, and ... in a gradual manner, almost like a cloud drifting over, [he] lost sight in [his] eye.\u201d The vision loss occurred in claimant\u2019s left eye and lasted for approximately thirty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Claimant went to see Dr. Mullen, his ophthalmologist, on October 24, 1994. After examining claimant, Dr. Mullen referred him to Dr. Tulou, claimant\u2019s primary care physician. On October 26, 1994, Dr. Tulou referred claimant to Retreat Hospital for testing and to Dr. Davis, a vascular surgeon, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>treatment. The doctors diagnosed an atherosclerotic blockage in claimant\u2019s carotid artery which had reduced blood flow in his brain and caused his episode of vision loss. On November 10, 1994, claimant was admitted to Retreat Hospital for surgery to correct the blockage. While he was hospitalized, claimant also had surgery on a similar blockage in his iliac artery. Claimant was incapacitated until December 5, 1994, when he resumed his full duties as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">On April 15,1996, claimant filed a claim for benefits for this injury. On May 6, 1996, claimant\u2019s counsel filed an amended application for a hearing, requesting compensation for lost wages and payment of lifetime medical costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">It is undisputed that claimant has suffered from hypertension, or high blood pressure, since the 1970s. Claimant stated that he had never missed any time from work due to his hypertension prior to October 1994. It is also uncontroverted that claimant was a smoker who had been counseled over the years about controlling his cholesterol and his weight. Claimant testified that, until October 1994, he had never been told that he had heart disease, vascular disease, or atherosclerosis. He admitted that he had been told that he had high blood pressure; however, he stated that the various doctors with whom he discussed his high blood pressure did not indicate that his condition was related to his work as a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Dr. Tulou described claimant\u2019s condition as \u201catherosclerosis with cholesterol deposits compromising [blood] flow.\u201d Though \u201cit is certainly not exclusively a heart disease,\u201d there is \u201cevidence on the basis of a thallium scan of the heart that the tip thereof is not receiving adequate blood.\u201d Dr. Tulou gave conflicting statements on the relationship between claimant\u2019s work and his condition. In a letter to claimant\u2019s attorney, Dr. Tulou had \u201cabsolutely no reservation in stating that [claimant\u2019s] work as a police officer in large measure contributed to his hypertension,\u201d and claimant\u2019s \u201chypertension is clearly a risk factor for any atherosclerotic process.\u201d Therefore, Dr. Tulou felt that claimant\u2019s \u201cdisability ... was related to his work-related hypertension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>However, in a later deposition, Dr. T\u00fclou stated that whether claimant\u2019s hypertension and atherosclerosis were caused by his work in any way was \u201ca philosophical question. Speaking from a strictly scientific basis, no, not really---- I think it remains speculative as to whether the job itself did it.\u201d When questioned whether claimant\u2019s condition was caused by stress, Dr. Tulou responded: \u201cI just can\u2019t make a definitive statement one way or the other how that contributed---- In this particular case, I don\u2019t feel strongly one way or the other that it did or did not create his condition or contribute to his condition.\u201d Finally, when claimant\u2019s attorney queried whether, in Dr. Tulou\u2019s opinion to a reasonable degree of medical probability, claimant\u2019s work played a role in his hypertension, Dr. Tulou answered: \u201cPlausibly a role, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">Dr. Davis saw claimant on November 7, 1994, upon referral from Dr. Tulou. He diagnosed claimant with \u201catherosclerosis which had become symptomatic in his left carotid and right iliac.\u201d He explained that \u201c[atherosclerosis ... is a disease of the arteries. It can involve the arteries of the heart and create heart attacks; although, [claimant] showed none of these symptoms at the time of his care.\u201d Regarding the relationship between claimant\u2019s condition, atherosclerosis, and his work, Dr. Davis indicated that \u201c[t]he probable cause of his condition is genetic and environmental, and I cannot rule out work stress as a contributor to his diagnosis.\u201d He declined to comment on whether claimant suffered from heart disease or whether claimant\u2019s work as a police officer contributed to any such heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">Dr. Hess reviewed claimant\u2019s medical history and answered employer\u2019s questions. Dr. Hess offered a diagnosis of \u201caccelerated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease\u201d as a result of \u201cthe hypertensive syndrome with a combination of hypertension, cigarette smoking, and hypercholesterolemia.\u201d Regarding the source of claimant\u2019s disease, Dr. Hess stated that \u201cthere is no identifiable organic cause for his hypertension, and this more than likely represents a genetic predisposition in combination with his risk factors.\u201d As to the role of work stress in claimant\u2019s condition, Dr. Hess indicated that \u201cthere is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>very little objective proof that stress plays a major contributory role.\u201d Consequently, \u201cfrom a medical viewpoint, it is extremely difficult to incriminate the stress of command on a police officer in giving him his present problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Lastly, the record contains correspondence from Dr. Mel-horn, the doctor who diagnosed claimant\u2019s hypertension in the 1970s. On July 15, 1996, Dr. Melhorn answered certain general questions posed by employer. He stated that he recalled treating claimant in the 1970s; that it was his \u201cnormal practice to discuss any conditions which would require medication with a patient when such a condition is discovered\u201d; that he would typically discuss with a patient the probable causes or contributing factors for such a condition in order to help him avoid or reduce future problems; that work-related stress \u201ccould be\u201d a causal factor in claimant\u2019s hypertension because \u201cstress does play a part in hypertension\u201d; and that it was his normal practice to discuss the stress factor with a patient. Dr. Melhorn responded, \u201cYes \u2014 probably\u201d to the inquiry: \u201cGiven that you knew he was a police officer, that he had hypertension and needed medication for it, do you believe that you most probably told the patient that work related stress was a factor in his diagnosis of hypertension in the 1970s?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">However, on July 16, 1996, Dr. Melhorn wrote a letter to claimant\u2019s counsel addressing his specific concerns regarding his treatment of claimant and his earlier statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">I wish to state that I do not have the chart or records of my treatment of [claimant], and I do not have any independent recollection of having discussed with [claimant] the question of whether the hypertension with which I diagnosed in him [sic] years ago was related to his work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">When questioned about his past treatment with Dr. Mel-horn, claimant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">I wouldn\u2019t stretch anybody\u2019s imagination to think that I could recall a conversation in the \u201970\u2019s, other than he stressed to me the seriousness of taking the [blood pressure] medicine and of going back to Dr. Gill to have him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>monitor and be sure in fact that it was a problem. As far as work, I can only say that I have no recollection of him saying that it was work related, and if he had, I feel confident I would have followed up on that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The deputy commissioner awarded claimant compensation for temporary total disability for the period November 10 through December 4, 1995, together with related medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The commission affirmed the decision of the deputy commissioner. In doing so, it rejected \u201cemployer\u2019s argument that the Deputy Commissioner erred in not permitting the claimant to testify to his own opinion, as to whether stress was a factor in causing his hypertension. Inasmuch as this is strictly a medical issue, his testimony as to stress being a cause of high blood pressure would have no probative value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Next, the commission found that \u201cthere was insufficient evidence of a communication or awareness of an occupational disease more than two years before the filing of the Claim for Benefits on April 15, 1996.\u201d Thus, the commission rejected employer\u2019s statute of limitations defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The commission also determined that: \u201cthe medical records sufficiently establish the presence of coronary artery disease____ There is no medical evidence to the contrary, and this element of the claimant\u2019s case is clearly established.\u201d Additionally, noting the statutory presumption, the commission found \u201cno evidence that the Deputy Commissioner failed to consider [employer\u2019s] rebuttal medical evidence.\u201d Rather, the commission stated that \u201cthe rebuttal evidence was not persuasive and ... claimant\u2019s evidence was sufficient to bring him within the purview of the presumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">Finally, the commission found \u201cno evidence that the Deputy Commissioner failed to consider medical evidence from physicians other than Dr. Tulou, regarding the treatment of the claimant\u2019s hypertension.\u201d Accordingly, the commission considered any factual conflicts in the evidence and concluded that \u201call the medical evidence was weighed, and a finding was made on this issue based upon the entire record and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>conflicts so far as they existed.\u201d The commission concluded that employer\u2019s evidence was insufficient to overcome the statutory presumption that claimant\u2019s work stress was causally related to his disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\n<em>II. EXCLUDED TESTIMONY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Proffer facilitates appellate review of an exclusion of testimony. \u201c[WJhen testimony is rejected before it is delivered, an appellate court has no basis for adjudication unless the record reflects a proper proffer.\u201d <em>Whittaker v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 968, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81 (1977) (citation omitted). \u201c[I]t is incumbent upon the proponent of the evidence to make a proffer of the expected answer.\u201d <em>Speller v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 437, 440, 345 S.E.2d 542, 545 (1986). Without a proffer, \u201cwe are precluded from a consideration of this issue on appeal.\u201d <em>Mostyn v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 920, 924, 420 S.E.2d 519, 521 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The rule is the same for administrative proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a deputy commissioner refuses to admit evidence ... \u2018the party must proffer or avouch the evidence for the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daniel Constr. Co. v. Tolley, </em>24 Va.App. 70, 79, 480 S.E.2d 145, 149 (1997) (quoting <em>Smith v. Hylton, </em>14 Va.App. 354, 357, 416 S.E.2d 712, 715 (1992)). \u201c[O]therwise, the appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>late court has no basis to decide whether the party was prejudiced by the deputy commissioner\u2019s error.\u201d <em>Daniel Constr. Co., </em>24 Va.App. at 79, 480 S.E.2d at 149 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">In the instant case, employer asked claimant whether, before his loss of vision episode, he ever thought work stress was a factor in his high blood pressure, a question clearly relevant to his awareness of the possibility of an occupational disease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The deputy commissioner ruled that claimant\u2019s reply would not be material. Claimant did not answer the question, and employer did not proffer any expected testimony. The content and timing of claimant\u2019s knowledge of the relationship between his work and his disease were clearly relevant to the statute of limitations issue. However, we have . \u201cno basis to decide whether [employer] was prejudiced by the deputy commissioner\u2019s error,\u201d because employer failed to proffer the expected answer. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we cannot consider the exclusion of this evidence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>III. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides that claimants must file for compensation for occupational diseases within \u201ctwo years after a diagnosis ... is first communicated to the employee.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-406(A)(5). The statute \u201cdoes not require that an employee receive from a physician a communication that his disease is work related.\u201d <em>City of Alexandria v. Cronin, </em>20 Va.App. 503, 508, 458 S.E.2d 314, 317 (1995), <em>aff'd, </em>252 Va. 1, 471 S.E.2d 184 (1996). It requires only that he \u201clearn that the condition is an occupational disease for which compensation may be awarded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509, 458 S.E.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u201cWhether a diagnosis of an occupational disease was communicated and when the communication occurred are fac-</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>tual determinations.\u201d <em>Uninsured Employer\u2019s Fund v. Mounts, </em>24 Va.App. 550, 558, 484 S.E.2d 140,144 (1997) (citing <em>Roller v. Basic Constr. Co., </em>238 Va. 321, 329, 384 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1989)). On appeal, we will uphold the commission\u2019s findings of fact when they are supported by credible evidence. <em>See Mounts, </em>24 Va.App. at 558, 484 S.E.2d at 144 (citing <em>James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Viewed in the light most favorable to claimant, who prevailed before the commission, <em>see Fairfax County v. Espinola, </em>11 Va.App. 126, 129, 396 S.E.2d 856, 858 (1990), the record establishes that claimant had no knowledge of his heart disease until after the October 1994 loss of vision episode. Additionally, although claimant was aware that he had hypertension in the 1970s, Dr. Melhorn\u2019s letter and claimant\u2019s testimony about his treatment provide credible evidence that claimant did not learn of any work connection to the condition or that he had a compensable occupational disease before October 1994. Thus, based upon this record, we cannot hold as a matter of law that the commission erred in finding that claimant\u2019s application was not barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\n<em>TV. COMPENSABLE OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">To recover compensation for an ordinary disease of life as an occupational disease, a claimant must establish \u201cby clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable medical certainty, that [his illness] arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-401.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the legislature \u201chas accorded policemen who suffer from heart disease or hypertension preferential status.\u201d <em>Department of State Police v. Talbert, </em>1 Va.App. 250, 253, 337 S.E.2d 307, 308 (1985). Code \u00a7 65.2-402 creates a rebuttable presumption that a causal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>connection exists between an individual\u2019s employment as a police officer and certain diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u201cA presumption is a rule of law that compels the fact finder to draw a certain conclusion ... from a given set of facts.\u201d <em>Martin v. Phillips, </em>235 Va. 523, 526, 369 S.E.2d 397, 399 (1988) (citing <em>Simpson v. Simpson, </em>162 Va. 621, 641-42, 175 S.E. 320, 329 (1934)). \u201cThe primary significance of a presumption is that it operates to shift to the opposing party the burden of producing evidence tending to rebut the presumption.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>235 Va. at 526, 369 S.E.2d at 399. Here, \u201c[t]he effect of the presumption is to eliminate the need for a claimant to prove a causal connection between his disease and his employment.\u201d <em>City of Norfolk v. Lillard, </em>15 Va.App. 424, 426, 424 S.E.2d 243, 244-45 (1992). \u201cIn the absence of competent evidence to the contrary, the statutory presumption controls, and the claimant prevails.\u201d <em>Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Dep\u2019t v. Mitchell, </em>14 Va.App. 1033, 1035, 421 S.E.2d 668, 670 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">To trigger the presumption, claimant need only prove his occupation and his disability from heart disease or hypertension, the diseases identified in Code \u00a7 65.2-402. Once claimant has established his <em>prima facie </em>case, \u201c[t]he presumption shifts the burden of going forward with the evidence from the claimant to his employer.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Proof of claimant\u2019s disability from heart disease or hypertension depends upon medical evidence. \u201cA question raised by conflicting medical opinion is a question of fact.\u201d <em>Department of Corrections v. Powell, </em>2 Va.App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986). \u201cDecisions of the commission as to questions of fact, if supported by credible evidence, are conclusive and binding on this Court.\u201d <em>Manassas Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Farrar, </em>13 Va.App. 227, 229, 409 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In the instant case, the commission found that \u201cthe medical records sufficiently establish the presence of coronary artery disease,\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-402. Dr. Tulou testified that a thallium scan showed inadequate blood flow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>through the coronary arteries. This testimony provides credible evidence in support of the commission\u2019s finding. \u201cThe fact that there is contrary evidence in the record is of no consequence if there is credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.\u201d <em>Wagner Enters., Inc. v. Brooks, </em>12 Va.App. 890, 894, 407 S.E.2d 32, 35 (1991) (citation omitted). Consequently, we cannot hold that the commission erred in finding that the claimant established a compensable occupational disease, utilizing the presumption contained in Code \u00a7 65.2-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\n<em>V. SUFFICIENCY OF EMPLOYER\u2019S REBUTTAL EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">In a recent decision, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the standard for an employer seeking to rebut a law enforcement officer\u2019s use of the causation presumption. \u201c[I]n order to overcome the statutory presumption, the employer merely \u2018must adduce competent medical evidence of a non-work-related cause of the disabling disease.\u2019\u201d <em>Augusta County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t v. Overbey, </em>\u2014 Va.-, 492 S.E.2d 631 (1997) (citing <em>Doss v. Fairfax County Fire &amp; Rescue Dep\u2019t. </em>229 Va. 440, 442, 331 S.E.2d 795, 796 (1985)). The Court announced that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">nothing in the statute or the several decisions of this Court dealing with rebuttal of this presumption suggests that the employer has the burden of excluding the \u201cpossibility\u201d that job stress may have been a contributing factor to heart disease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\"><em>Overbey, </em>\u2014 Va. at-, 492 S.E.2d at 634.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">In the instant case, Dr. Davis indicated that the \u201cprobable cause of [claimant\u2019s] condition is genetic and environmental,\u201d and Dr. Hess attributed claimant\u2019s cardiovascular disease to \u201ca genetic predisposition in combination with his risk factors.\u201d Under the standard set forth in <em>Overbey, </em>this evidence of a genetic cause sufficiently rebutted the statutory presumption that claimant\u2019s heart disease is work-related.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Without the benefit of the statutory presumption to establish a causal relationship between his job as a police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>officer and his heart disease, claimant \u201chad the burden of \u2018establishing by clear and convincing evidence, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u2019 that his [condition] arose out of and in the course of his employment.\u201d <em>Overbey, </em>\u2014 Va. at -, 492 S.E.2d at 634. Although claimant\u2019s job was undeniably stressful, claimant failed to meet this burden. None of the doctors opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that job stress was a causative factor in the disease claimant suffered. <em>Cf. Duffy v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 245, 251, 468 S.E.2d 702, 705 (1996) (employer\u2019s evidence failed to rebut presumption by a preponderance of the evidence and the statutory presumption thus controls). Thus, the evidence was insufficient to establish \u201cto a medical certainty\u201d that his heart disease arose out of his employment. Therefore, we are required to reverse the commission\u2019s award and dismiss claimant\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\">. In the administrative context, parties must proffer excluded evidence to complete the record for review within the agency as well as in the appellate court. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission regularly relies on proffered evidence and rejects claims for review in the absence of proffer. <em>See, e.g., Harrison v.
