The issues on appeal are whether the trial court erroneously (1) awarded physical custody of the parties\u2019 two minor children to Steven Marvin Jones (husband), without first determining that the commissioner\u2019s recommendation of joint physical custody was unsupported by the evidence and (2) reduced the amount of wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees to be paid by husband from $2,500 to $1,000, also without finding the commissioner\u2019s recommendations unsupported by the evidence. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment appealed from and remand this cause for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">There is little, if any, disagreement over the facts upon which the commissioner\u2019s recommendation was made. The parties married on September 25, 1988. A son was born of the marriage in 1989, and husband adopted wife\u2019s daughter, who had been born in 1985. By agreement of the parties, wife stayed home to care for the children rather than working during the marriage. The parties separated in the fall of 1995. Pursuant to a <em>pendente lite </em>order entered March 11, 1996, and a revised decree <em>pendente lite </em>entered March 22, 1996, the parties exercised joint legal custody of the children, with wife having primary physical custody. The revised decree provided husband with visitation during specific hours on alternate weekends and each weekday afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Although wife preferred to stay home to care for the children, the trial judge told her to get a job, and she began working as a glass blower, which necessitated a change in the custody/visitation arrangements. Her job required her to be at work between 7:00 a.m. and 7:30 a.m., but her children did not have to be at school until 8:20 a.m. Husband worked nights at the Ford Motor Company plant from midnight to 8:30 a.m. and did not arrive home until 8:45 a.m. or 9:00 a.m. Wife made arrangements to get the children up between 6:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. and take them, still in their pajamas, to Frances Hart, the mother of husband\u2019s cousin, whom wife paid to feed and dress the children for school. Wife followed this practice so the children could obtain as much sleep as possible. Mrs. Hart continued this routine for about a month. She stopped the practice because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to be in the middle\u201d between husband and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Thereafter, the parties arranged for wife to-take the children to husband\u2019s house each morning, where husband\u2019s live-in nanny fed and dressed the children and took them to school. Husband slept only three and one-half to four hours per night, from 7:30 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. until getting up at 11:30 p.m. to be at work at midnight. He was awake and present when the children arrived home from school each day around 3:00 p.m. Husband helped the children with their homework and fed them dinner. Wife picked the children up after work between 5:15 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., bathed them, and spent \u201ca couple of hours in the evening [with them] ... before they [went] to bed\u201d at her residence. During the summer months, a babysitter came to wife\u2019s home to stay with the children from the time wife went to work at 6:30 a.m. or 7:00 a.m. until husband picked them up on his way home from work around 8:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">While the children were staying predominantly with husband, he and his mother obtained medical attention for son that resulted in diagnosis of an eye-tracking problem. Son had previously been improperly diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. Once the misdiagnosis was corrected, husband retained a tutor, and son made the honor roll for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>The Social Services report of August 2, 1996 indicates that daughter \u201cfelt like a \u2018ping pong ball\u2019 going back and forth between her parents\u2019 homes\u201d and that son said, \u201cIt\u2019s not good to have two homes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Husband testified that he earned $69,000 in 1996 (yielding a gross monthly income of $5,750) but indicated that he planned to eliminate all overtime hours, which would reduce his gross monthly income to $3,857. He claimed monthly expenses of $5,624. Wife began working on January 16,1996 and earned a total of $15,684 during 1996. She claimed monthly expenses of $1,898.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Wife\u2019s counsel submitted an itemized statement of attorney\u2019s fees, showing fees of $5,325 for 40.4 hours of time, and costs of $420.25, for a total of $5,745.25. Husband presented no rebuttal evidence on the fee issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">In his report of March 7, 1997 and amended report of March 11, 1997, the commissioner recommended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the parties have joint legal and physical custody of the children and detailed precisely how the physical custody was to occur. He also recommended that husband pay $2,500 of wife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. In ruling on the issue of child support, he found that husband had a gross monthly income of $5,750 and wife an income of $1,421.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Husband filed exceptions to the custody and attorney\u2019s fee recommendations, and both were sustained without comment by the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court granted husband primary physical custody of the children with \u201cliberal visitation\u201d to wife, \u201cincluding but not limited to one overnight each week.\u201d The court also reduced the attorney\u2019s fees to be paid by husband from $2,500 to $1,000. Wife specifically objected to these rulings in her endorsement of the final decree and noted her appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>There can be no dispute in this matter that both husband and wife are fit and proper parents and each sought to achieve what they believed to be the best interests of the children. Where both parents are regularly employed and have children of tender years, trial judges have difficulty making an award satisfactory to both parties. Recent legislation concerning joint custody has not decreased the difficulties faced by trial judges. <em>See, e.g., </em>1994 Va.Acts ch. 769 \u00a7 1 (deleting provision in Code \u00a7 20-107.2 that \u201ccourt may give consideration to joint custody or sole custody\u201d and enacting Code \u00a7 20-124.2(B), which provides that court \u201cmay award joint custody or sole custody\u201d but \u201cshall assure minor children of frequent and continuing contact with both parents, when appropriate, and encourage parents to share in the responsibilities of rearing their children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In the absence of limited jurisdiction family courts, referrals to commissioners in chancery are necessary to assist trial courts with their large domestic caseloads. The referral system has resulted in the development of judicial principles establishing the weight to be given commissioners\u2019 recommendations. The Virginia Supreme Court has clearly stated, and often repeated, the principles governing appellate review of a chancellor\u2019s decree that has set aside a commissioner\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abk\">While the report of a commissioner in chancery does not carry the weight of a jury\u2019s verdict, Code \u00a7 8.01-610, <em>it should be sustained unless the trial court concludes that the commissioner\u2019s findings are not supported by the evidence. </em>This rule applies with particular force to a commissioner\u2019s findings of fact based upon evidence taken in his presence .... [WJhere the chancellor has disapproved the commissioner\u2019s findings, this Court must review the evidence and ascertain whether, under the correct application of the law, the evidence supports the findings of the commissioner or the conclusions of the trial court. Even where the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact have been disapproved, an appellate court must give due regard to the commissioner\u2019s ability, not shared by the chancellor, to see, hear, and evaluate the witnesses at first hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number><em>Hill v. Hill, </em>227 Va. 569, 576-77, 318 S.E.2d 292, 296-97 (1984) (citations omitted) (emphasis added); <em>accord Yeskolski v. Crosby, </em>253 Va. 148, 152-53, 480 S.E.2d 474, 476 (1997); <em>Jarvis v. Tonkin, </em>238 Va. 115, 121-22, 380 S.E.2d 900, 904 (1989); <em>Morris v. United Va. Bank, </em>237 Va. 331, 337-38, 377 S.E.2d 611, 614 (1989); <em>Sprott v. Sprott, </em>233 Va. 238, 240, 355 S.E.2d 881, 882 (1987); <em>see also Goetz v. Goetz, </em>7 Va.App. 50, 53, 371 S.E.2d 567, 568-69 (1988); <em>Robinson v. Robinson, </em>5 Va.App. 222, 225-26, 361 S.E.2d 356, 357-58 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Applying those principles to the case before us, we see nothing in this record showing the trial court found insufficient evidence to support the commissioner\u2019s recommendation that the best interests of the children would be served by continuing joint custody, in keeping with recent legislation encouraging joint custody in appropriate cases. We conclude from our review of the record that the trial court, for reasons not disclosed, simply preferred to make a different ruling. This is not to say there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion. However, the commissioner\u2019s report came to the trial court with a presumption of correctness, <em>see Dodge v. Dodge, </em>2 Va.App. 238, 241, 343 S.E.2d 363, 364 (1986), and the trial court made no finding that the commissioner\u2019s report was unsupported by the evidence. <em>Cf. Robinson, </em>5 Va.App. at 226-27, 361 S.E.2d at 358 (in visitation case, remanding for additional findings where, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cjudge\u2019s oral opinion ... does not reflect a consideration of the role of the commissioner in weighing the testimony ... given in her presence ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Because the record here fails to show that the evidence does not support the commissioner\u2019s report, and because from our review of that report it appears that it does, we reverse that portion of the decree that awards physical custody of the children to husband, contrary to the commissioner\u2019s report, and remand that issue for further consideration consistent with this opinion. For that same reason, based on an absence of findings supporting deviation from the commissioner\u2019s recommendation, we remand the issue of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Nothing in this opinion should be construed to preclude the trial court from modifying custody and support awards upon a proper showing of changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-9\">. The court noted only that it \"made its own conclusions as to the appropriate relief required,\" having \"given due weight to the report of the commissioner ...
