Defendant complains on appeal that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for a mistrial based upon alleged juror misconduct and later disallowed post-verdict investigation of the incident. Finding no error, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">A venire was assembled for trial of defendant on indictments charging the murder of Walter C. Williams and attendant use of a firearm. After advising the panel that the purpose of <em>voir dire </em>was to \u201censure that [no one was] related to any of the parties,\u201d conscious of any \u201cinterests or bias in the case,\u201d or otherwise ineligible to serve on the jury, the following questions, pertinent to this appeal, together with the collective responses of the venire, were propounded by the court and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>The Court: Have any of you or have any members of your immediate family been the victim of a crime involving the use of a firearm?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">The Court: Have any members of your immediate family been the victim of a homicide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">The Court: Have you or have any members of your immediate family ever been prosecuted by the Norfolk Commonwealth Attorney\u2019s Office?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">The Court: Do any of you have any interest in the trial or outcome of this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-11\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-12\">The Court: Have any of you acquired any information about the alleged offense or the accused from any source outside of the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-13\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-14\">The Court: Our system of justice presumes the accused is innocent until proven guilty. Is each of you able to keep this presumption alive in your mind throughout the entire case until you have entered the jury room to begin you [sic] deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-15\">The Jurors: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-16\">The Court: You understand the Commonwealth must prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond all reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-17\">The Jurors: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-18\">The Court: Have any of you expressed or formed any opinion concerning the guilt or innocence of the accused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-19\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The Court: Are any of you sensible of any bias or prejudice for or against the Commonwealth or the accused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">&amp; * &gt;\u00a1s * <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">The Court: Do any of you know of any reason whatever which would prevent you from giving a fair and impartial trial to the Commonwealth and to the accused based solely on the law and the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\">Defendant\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">Attorney: Are there any jurors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-11\">among you that have the opinion that just because the defendant has been charged under the pending indictments that he\u2019s guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-12\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-13\">Defendant\u2019s</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-14\">Attorney: Have any of you been the victim of a crime involving violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-15\">The Jurors: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-16\">Counsel then exercised their respective peremptory challenges and a jury was impaneled, free from exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-18\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established that defendant inflicted gunshot wounds on both himself and Williams, the victim, during an argument between the two men. Williams later died as a result of his injuries. Commonwealth witness Edith Harris testified that she observed a \u201cdrive-by shooting\u201d but was unsure if a car was \u201cinvolved,\u201d didn\u2019t recall if either the \u201cshooter\u201d or victim was in a vehicle, and could identify no one involved in the offenses. However, witness Darnell Blunt testified that defendant exited a car, \u201cconfronted\u201d and \u201cswung\u201d at the unarmed Williams, \u201cshot himself\u2019 \u201cin the leg,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u201cturned around and shot\u201d Williams, and \u201cgot in the car and left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Defendant testified that he was walking toward his parked automobile, after conversing with a friend, when he \u201csaw a car turning around in my peripheral vision ... [and] somebody in the car ... said, [\u2018]there goes the M... F... right there.[\u2019]\u201d These remarks were followed by several gunshots, one of which struck him in the leg. He denied knowing or injuring the victim or possessing a firearm during the incident. Defense witness Melanie Woodhouse had observed \u201cfiring\u201d from a vehicle that rounded the corner \u201creal fast\u201d while defendant was \u201cstanding ... talking\u201d with someone.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">After several hours of jury deliberations, the foreman announced that, \u201c[w]e have a hung jury.\u201d Without objection, however, deliberations resumed following an <em>\u201cAllen </em>charge\u201d by the trial court. Shortly thereafter, the court received a handwritten note from the jury advising that, \u201cOne of the jurors has stated that relatives of hers were involved in a drive-by shooting\u201d and inquiring, \u2018Would or could this have any influence or importance in this case?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Defendant immediately moved for a mistrial, arguing that no juror had disclosed personal or immediate family victimization by \u201cviolence\u201d but \u201cnow ... [a juror is] asking us if ... she is impartial because ... a relative ... was a victim of a drive-by shooting.\u201d Noting that the question did not identify either the juror or a member of her <em>immediate </em>family as a <em>victim, </em>the status referenced in <em>voir dire, </em>the court denied defendant\u2019s motion and, without objection, instructed the jury to \u201cdecide this case on the testimony and exhibits ... [in] evidence,\u201d without considering \u201c[t]he experience of a relative of a juror.\u201d Deliberations resumed, followed by verdicts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>guilty, related sentencing proceedings, and discharge of the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Defendant requested a presentence report and an attendant hearing was conducted several months after trial. Defendant then renewed his earlier mistrial motion \u201cbased upon the question posed by the jury\u201d in its note to the court, asserting that it suggested a lack of \u201cimpartiality\u201d and juror \u201cmisconduct\u201d during <em>voir dire. </em>In the alternative, defendant urged the court to recall the \u201cwhole jury,\u201d identify the juror in issue, and permit defendant to examine her with respect to misconduct and bias. The court overruled both motions, resulting in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Defendant first contends the note clearly revealed that an unidentified juror had failed to disclose during <em>voir dire </em>that she \u201chad a relative who was a victim of a crime involving a firearm,\u201d despite inquiry by the court. He maintains that \u201can- affirmative answer ... could have led to a motion to exclude for cause as a result of bias\u201d or promoted a more informed exercise of peremptory strikes, thereby avoiding the \u201cimplied bias\u201d of the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">We are mindful that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">[t]he right to a trial by an impartial jury is guaranteed under both the United States and Virginia Constitutions. This guarantee is reinforced by legislative enactment and by the rules of court. It is the trial judge\u2019s duty to secure an impartial jury for the parties. Resolution of the question of a juror\u2019s impartiality depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. At a minimum, ... the law requires that the juror \u201cstand indifferent in the cause.\u201d Any reasonable doubt regarding the prospective juror\u2019s ability to give the accused a fair and impartial trial must be resolved in favor of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-10\"><em>Swanson v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 182, 184-85, 442 S.E.2d 702, 703-04 (1994) (quoting <em>Gosling v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 642, 645, 376 S.E.2d 541, 543-44 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>However, to be entitled to a mistrial for jury misconduct arising from <em>voir dire,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">\u201ca party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on <em>voir dire, </em>and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. The motives for concealing information may vary, but only those reasons that affect a <em>juror\u2019s impartiality </em>can truly be said to affect the fairness of a trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\"><em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 12, 18, 486 S.E.2d 108, 111 (1997) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>464 U.S. 548, 556, 104 S.Ct. 845, 850, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984)). Thus, \u201cjuror misconduct does not automatically entitle either litigant to a mistrial.\u201d <em>Robertson v. Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, </em>249 Va. 72, 76, 452 S.E.2d 845, 847 (1995). The trial court must also find a probability of prejudice, with the \u201cburden of establishing that probability ... upon the party moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">When the issue arises from a \u201cmidtrial\u201d challenge to a juror\u2019s impartiality, we \u201cwill reverse the trial court\u2019s decision only for an abuse of discretion,\u201d applying the \u201csame standard\u201d of review appropriate to appellate consideration of a decision to seat a venireperson. <em>Hunt v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 395, 399, 488 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1997); <em>see David v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 77, 80, 493 S.E.2d 379, 381 (1997) (juror impartiality a factual determination, disturbed on appeal only for \u201cmanifest error\u201d). Hence, we will not overturn \u201cthe denial of a motion for a mistrial ... unless there exists a manifest probability that [the ruling] was prejudicial.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>25 Va.App. at 17, 486 S.E.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Here, the jury\u2019s note indicated that \u201cone of the jurors\u201d had \u201crelatives ... involved in a drive-by shooting\u201d and questioned the \u201cinfluence or importance\u201d of such circumstances to \u201cthis case.\u201d On <em>voir dire, </em>the panel had been asked, \u201c[h]ave any of <em>you </em>or ... any member of your <em>immediate family\u201d </em>been \u201cthe <em>victim </em>of a crime involving ... a firearm,\u201d \u201chomicide,\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u201cviolence.\u201d (Emphasis added). Thus, lacking a disclosure that either a juror or immediate family member had been the victim of an offense named in the court\u2019s inquiry, the note did not establish an untruthful response on <em>voir dire. </em>Moreover, the note clearly did not facially demonstrate bias or partiality. Thus, defendant failed to demonstrate both juror misconduct and bias.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Further, the trial court, with the agreement of counsel, specifically instructed the jury to ignore \u201cthe experience of a relative of a juror\u201d and \u201cdecide this case on the testimony and exhibits [in] evidence.\u201d \u201cUnless the record shows to the contrary, it is to be presumed that the jury followed an explicit cautionary instruction promptly given.\u201d <em>Albert v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 734, 741, 347 S.E.2d 534, 538 (1986) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Defendant next contends that the trial court erroneously denied his post-verdict motion to recall the \u201cwhole jury\u201d and identify and investigate the juror referenced in the note. The record discloses that defendant made no effort to pursue such relief when the issue first arose during trial. Instead, fully aware of the note\u2019s contents and implications, defendant elected to forego a timely inquiry and await the verdict.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKZ\">\u201cTo permit prisoners to avail themselves, after verdict, of pre-existing objections to the competency of jurors, as a matter of right, would not only be unreasonable, but most mischievous in its consequences.... A prisoner knowing, or <em>willfully remaining ignorant </em>of the incompetency of a juror, would take the chances of a favorable verdict ...; and if the verdict should be adverse, would ... [seek to] avoid its effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\"><em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>122 Va. 834, 845-46, 94 S.E. 783, 787 (1918) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Bristow\u2019s Case, </em>15 Gratt. (56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Va.) 648). Thus, defendant\u2019s \u201cconscious decision to find out what the jury was going to do ... in hopes that [it] might acquit\u201d constituted a waiver of his right to further inquiry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Gray v.
