(Richfood) appeals the decision of the commission, finding Robert Ragsdale (claimant) to be a statutory employee of Richfood and, thus, qualified for benefits under the Act. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">Claimant operates his own trucking business as a sole proprietor and is uninsured for workers\u2019 compensation purposes. On March 2, 1993, claimant operated his truck under contract with Perdue, Inc. to deliver turkeys from Perdue\u2019s plant to Richfood\u2019s facility in Mechanicsville, Virginia. While unloading the Perdue turkeys at Richfood\u2019s warehouse, claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>ant was struck and injured by a pallet jack operated by a Richfood employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Claimant filed suit against Richfood in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond, alleging common law negligence against Richfood under a theory of respondeat superior. In response, Richfood filed a \u201cPlea of Worker\u2019s [sic] Compensation,\u201d alleging that claimant \u201cwas a statutory employee of Richfood at the time of the accident, [thus barring] his action against Richfood ... [under] the applicable provisions of the Worker\u2019s [sic] Compensation Act.\u201d The trial court sustained Richfood\u2019s plea, finding that the Act barred claimant\u2019s action at law and that Richfood \u201cwill cover any injuries sustained by [claimant].\u201d Claimant did not appeal this ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Claimant then pursued a claim before the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, which Richfood defended on the ground that claimant was not its statutory employee at the time of the accident. Richfood\u2019s defenses were sustained by the deputy commissioner but reversed by the full commission. The commission found that claimant was a statutory employee of Richfood at the time of the accident and, furthermore, that Richfood was estopped from asserting otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The issues on appeal are (1) whether, by virtue of the final order of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond barring claimant\u2019s action at law on the ground that he was the statutory employee of Richfood, an order which was granted upon Richfood\u2019s motion, Richfood is estopped from now asserting otherwise; and (2) if not, whether claimant qualifies as a statutory employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">It is well settled that in successive actions between two parties, \u201ca party will not be permitted to maintain incon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>sistent positions or to take a position in regard to a matter which is directly contrary to, or inconsistent with, one previously assumed by him.\u201d 28 Am.Jur.2d <em>Estoppel and Waiver </em>\u00a7 68 (1966); <em>see also Brown v. Lawson Transp. Corp., </em>7 Va.App. 679, 681, 377 S.E.2d 136, 137 (1989). Whether Rich-food is judicially estopped from asserting claimant is not its employee for purposes of entitlement under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) is a mixed question of law and fact, fully reviewable by this Court. <em>Sinclair v. Shelter Constr. Co., </em>23 Va.App. 154, 156-57, 474 S.E.2d 856, 857-58 (1996) (citing <em>City of Waynesboro v. Harter, </em>1 Va.App. 265, 269, 337 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">It is clear that Richfood defended against claimant\u2019s civil action for negligence by advancing a pleading denominated \u201cPlea of Worker\u2019s [sic] Compensation\u201d. Seeking to have claimant\u2019s suit dismissed, Richfood contended claimant\u2019s \u201csole remedy,\u201d as Richfood\u2019s \u201cstatutory employee,\u201d was under the \u201capplicable provisions\u201d of the Act. Before the commission, Richfood argued claimant was not its statutory employee, a position which, on its face, appears precluded under the doctrine of judicial estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">To avoid the reach of the doctrine, however, Rich-food argues that while claimant \u201cwas, in fact, its statutory employee as regards the tort claim[,] ... Richfood\u2019s obligation to pay benefits to-the claimant depends on whether he qualifies under the specific provisions of the Act.\u201d In other words, a \u201cstatutory employee\u201d whose status as such deprives the circuit court of jurisdiction to hear a civil negligence case is not necessarily a \u201cstatutory employee\u201d for the purposes of determining benefits entitlement under the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Richfood\u2019s position before the commission requires treating claimant\u2019s \u201cemployee\u201d status as transformed to that of \u201csubcontractor.\u201d Building from that unexplained premise, Rich-food argued that claimant\u2019s claim under the Act was governed by the dictates of Code \u00a7 65.2-302(A) and, accordingly, should have been dismissed by the commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Implicit in the position advanced before the commission is Richfood\u2019s contention that judicial estoppel has no applicability here because the concession that claimant was its statutory employee in the tort action does not control the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-302(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">We find no merit in Richfood\u2019s contention that the commission erroneously found that Richfood was judicially estopped from asserting that claimant was not an employee entitled to coverage under the Act. Richfood\u2019s reliance on Code \u00a7 65.2-302 is misplaced, as construction of the statutory provision is not at issue here. We focus instead on the estoppel effect of Richfood\u2019s conduct in the court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In defending the tort action in the circuit court based on claimant\u2019s status as \u201cstatutory employee,\u201d Richfood, <em>a fortiori, </em>postured itself as claimant\u2019s \u201cstatutory employer.\u201d As claimant\u2019s statutory employer, Richfood effectively conceded it is fully liable under the Act. Code \u00a7 65.2-302; <em>see, e.g., Sites Constr. Co. v. Harbeson, </em>16 Va.App. 835, 837, 434 S.E.2d 1, 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>(1993). Indeed, the effect of Richfood\u2019s position before the circuit court on the issue of liability was to claim that no distinction should be made between its liability to its direct employees under the Act, and its liability to claimant, its \u201cstatutory employee.\u201d Such is the effect of the term of art, \u201cstatutory employee,\u201d a term it freely employed in defeating claimant\u2019s tort action. <em>See Baker v. Nussman &amp; Cox, </em>152 Va. 293, 302, 147 S.E. 246, 249 (1929) (This section of the Code regarding statutory employer \u201cmade [statutory employees] eligible to compensation just as the employees of the owner or contractor are eligible under the definition of employees as defined [elsewhere in the Code].\u201d). To sustain such a distinction in claimant\u2019s status before the commission would be manifestly inconsistent with Richfood\u2019s prior representations before the trial court. Claimant, relying on the legal posture Riehfood assumed before the trial court, noted no appeal of the court\u2019s decision and submitted his claim for benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as Riehfood had invited.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Finally, the argument Riehfood posits would be inimical to the purpose of the Act: to provide the exclusive remedy for injured employees. The Act precludes double recovery, both in an action at law and pursuant to claim under the Act; Riehfood seeks the converse of the axiom, a double avoidance of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The decision of the commission is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-10\">. There is no dispute that claimant suffered an \"injury by accident\u201d within the meaning of the Act and that, at the time the injury was sustained, claimant was engaged in a function normally performed by Richfood employees in the course of Richfood\u2019s business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">. To establish an estoppel in judicial proceedings, one must prove by \"clear precise and unequivocal evidence that it should be invoked.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>7 Va.App. at 681, 377 S.E.2d at 137. Among those elements which must be established are \"1) the inconsistent position first asserted must have been successfully maintained; 2) a judgment must have been rendered; 3) the positions must be clearly inconsistent; 4) the parties and questions must be the same; 5) the party claiming estoppel must have been misled and have changed his position; and 6) it must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>appear unjust to one party to permit the other to change.\u201d 28 Am. Jur.2d <em>Estoppel and Waiver </em>\u00a7 70 (1966). With the exception of the claim that different questions were raised in each forum, neither the failure to establish the factual predicates nor to meet the burden of proof is before us on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b71-7\">. Code \u00a7 65.2-302 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">When any person (referred to in this section as \"owner\u201d) undertakes to perform or execute any work which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and contracts with any other person (referred to in this section as \"subcontractor\u201d) for the execution or performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the owner shall be liable to pay any worker employed in the work any compensation under this title which he would have been liable to pay if the worker had been immediately employed by him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
