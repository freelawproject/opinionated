For this reason, we reverse the commission\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">Lois K. Gray suffered injuries to her neck, back and hip when she fell on concrete steps while employed by Graves Mountain Lodge, Inc. When Gray\u2019s claim for benefits was pending before the commission, the commission ordered the employer to \u201cprovide to [Gray] a panel of three or more physicians who have reviewed the medical records in this case, who are qualified to treat [Gray\u2019s] injuries, including the anatomical parts involved, and who are willing to examine [Gray] with the expectation of rendering continuing medical treatment to [Gray] as her authorized treating physician.\u201d After Gray filed an application for enforcement of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>sion\u2019s order, the employer proffered a panel, consisting of two medical doctors and one chiropractor. Asserting that a chiropractor is not a physician within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A), Gray requested that her application for enforcement of the order be put on the hearing docket. The parties agreed that this issue was a question of law and requested the commission to decide the issue without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">After both parties submitted written statements outlining their respective positions, the deputy commissioner ruled that \u201c[d]ue to the longstanding policy approving chiropractors as treating physicians, we find that chiropractors are appropriate health care providers to be included on a panel of physicians pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A), and that a chiropractor is a \u2018physician\u2019 as contemplated by that section.\u201d On review, the commission upheld that ruling and stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">[T]he Commission has consistently held that a chiropractor is a proper attending physician when appropriately selected by a claimant. Additionally, the Commission has approved a chiropractor as the attending physician when selected from a panel provided by the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">The Commission is, of course, well aware that chiropractors are not licensed medical doctors and that chiropractors are not qualified to treat all injuries. Nevertheless, the Commission finds that chiropractors are health care providers appropriately included on a panel of physicians pursuant to Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 65.2-603(A). The claimant is not required to chose [sic] the chiropractor, but his inclusion on the panel does not render the panel improper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">(Citations omitted). Gray appeals from that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The Act requires employers to furnish to injured employees a panel of physicians. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-10\">As long as necessary after an accident, the employer shall furnish or cause to be furnished, free of charge to the injured employee, a <em>physician </em>chosen by the injured em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ployee from a panel of at least three <em>physicians </em>selected by the employer and such other necessary medical attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUH\">(Emphasis added). Code \u00a7 65.2-603(D) contains the following explanation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">As used in this section and in \u00a7 65.2-604, the terms \u201cmedical attention,\u201d \u201cmedical service,\u201d \u201cmedical care,\u201d and \u201cmedical report\u201d shall be deemed to include chiropractic service or treatment and, where appropriate, a chiropractic treatment report.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Gray argues that subsections (A) and (D) of Code \u00a7 65.2-603, read together, manifestly declare that a chiropractor is not a physician under the Act. In contrast, the employer argues that by including chiropractic service within the ambit of \u201cmedical attention\u201d in Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-603 and 65.2-604, the legislature has recognized chiropractors as physicians and that the commission correctly ruled that chiropractors are \u201chealth care providers\u201d appropriately included on a panel of physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The commission\u2019s construction of the act is entitled to great weight on appeal. <em>See Bohle ex rel. Majette v. Henrico County Sch. Bd., </em>246 Va. 30, 35, 431 S.E.2d 36, 39 (1993). However, the principle is well established that \u201c \u2018[a]n erroneous construction by those charged with its administration cannot be permitted to override the clear mandates of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hurt v. Caldwell, </em>222 Va. 91, 97, 279 S.E.2d 138, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>142 (1981) (quoting <em>City of Richmond v. County of Henrico, </em>185 Va. 176, 189, 37 S.E.2d 873, 879 (1946)). \u201cWhen an agency\u2019s statutory interpretation conflicts with the language of the statute ..., the usual deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation should be withheld.\u201d <em>Commonwealth Dep\u2019t of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy v. May Bros., Inc., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 119, 396 S.E.2d 695, 697 (1990); <em>see also Cox v. Oakwood Mining, Inc., </em>16 Va.App. 965, 969, 434 S.E.2d 904, 907 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l) provides that an employer must furnish to the injured employee <em>\u201ca physician </em>chosen by the injured employee from a panel of at least three <em>physicians ... and such other necessary medical attention.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). That same obligation existed in 1982 under Code \u00a7 65.1-88, the predecessor to Code \u00a7 65.2-603. However, in 1982, the General Assembly modified Code \u00a7 65.1-88 to add language that farther defined \u201cmedical attention.\u201d The legislature specifically changed the statute to state that \u201cthe terms \u2018medical attention,\u2019 \u2018medical service,\u2019 \u2018medical care,\u2019 and \u2018medical report\u2019 shall be deemed to include chiropractic service or treatment.\u201d Acts of Assembly 1982, ch. 585.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">This legislative action clearly establishes that the General Assembly intended to include \u201cchiropractic service or treatment\u201d within the ambit of the broad range of \u201cother necessary medical attention.\u201d Nothing in these amendments, however, permits an inference that the General Assembly intended that a chiropractor may be included on a panel of three <em>physicians. </em>Indeed, because the statute was not modified to include the term \u201cchiropractor\u201d within the definition of \u201cphysician,\u201d the inference is clear that the legislature did not intend that result. \u201c[W]hen analyzing a statute, we must assume that \u2018the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute, and we are bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>those words as we interpret the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>City of Virginia Beach v. ESG Enterprises, Inc., </em>243 Va. 149, 153, 413 S.E.2d 642, 644 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201cWe may not add to a statute language which the legislature has chosen not to include.\u201d <em>County of Amherst Bd. of Supervisors v. Brockman, </em>224 Va. 391, 397, 297 S.E.2d 805, 808 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">If the legislature had intended the term \u201cphysician\u201d to include chiropractors, it could have specifically included language in the 1982 amendment to state that a chiropractor shall be deemed a \u201cphysician\u201d within the subsection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We cannot read such language into the statute when the legislature did not include it. <em>See Brockman, </em>224 Va. at 397, 297 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>808. In reading Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l) and 65.2-603(D) together, we believe it is clear from the language of the statute that the legislature did not intend the term \u201cphysician,\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 65.2-603, to include chiropractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Furthermore, to interpret the term \u201cphysician\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-603 to include chiropractors would render the language of Code \u00a7 65.2-603(D) superfluous and meaningless. Under well-established principles of statutory interpretation, where possible, every word of a statute must be given meaning. <em>See Monument </em>Assocs. <em>v. Arlington County Bd., </em>242 Va. 145, 149, 408 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1991). If chiropractors were \u201cphysicians\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A), the language in Code \u00a7 65.2-603(D) would indeed be superfluous and meaningless because the definition of \u201cphysician\u201d would necessarily signify that the attention, services, care and report rendered by a physician, i.e., a chiropractor, would be medical. Code \u00a7 65.2-603(D) clearly establishes, not that chiropractors are physicians within the meaning of subsection (A), but that chiropractic treatment and service are \u201cdeemed\u201d to be \u201cmedical attention\u201d even though chiropractors are not \u201cphysicians\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-603.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We further note that the commission found \u201cthat chiropractors are health care providers appropriately included on a panel of physicians pursuant to ... Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A).\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>However, we find no basis to conclude that health care providers are, by definition, \u201cphysicians.\u201d We also find no basis to conclude that the legislature intended that the panel required by Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A) could consist of three health care providers, including chiropractors, none of whom were physicians. Such a result necessarily flows from the commission\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Because we cannot add language to a statute that the legislature did not include, and we cannot say that the legislature intended the term \u201cphysician\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A) to include \u201cchiropractor,\u201d we reverse the finding of the commission and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 65.2-604 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-8\">A. Any physician attending an injured employee shall, upon request of the injured employee, employer, or insurer, furnish a copy of any medical report to the injured employee, employer, or insurer or to each of them upon request for such medical report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-9\">B. Whenever any health care provider attending an injured employee refers the employee or transfers responsibility for his care to another health care provider, the referring or transferring provider, upon receipt of a request therefor, shall promptly transfer or cause to be transferred to the new or succeeding provider, or to the employee or someone acting on behalf of the employee, copies of all diagnostic test results, x-ray photographs, and other medicad records pertaining to the employee's injury for which further treatment is to be sought from the succeeding provider.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. When the Act was revised and recodified in 1991, these changes were retained and now appear in Code \u00a7 65.2-603(D). The terms that the legislature amended the Act to define are found in Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(1) (\"medical attention\u201d); Code \u00a7 65.2-603(B) (\"medical service\"); Code \u00a7 65.2-603(C) (\"medical care\u201d); and Code \u00a7 65.2-604(A) (\"medical report\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b401-5\">. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and its amendments constitute one act, <em>Commonwealth v. Granger, </em>188 Va. 502, 507, 50 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1948), and the purpose of that.act as a whole should govern its construction. <em>Griffith v. Raven Red Ash Coal Co., </em>179 Va. 790, 796, 20 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1942). However, because \" '[t]he Code of Virginia constitutes a single body of law, and other sections can be looked to where the same phraseology is employed,\u2019 \u201d <em>Hart v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 77, 79, 441 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1994) (citation omitted), we may look to other sections of the Code for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The term \"physician,\u201d as used in various sections of the Code, does not always include \"chiropractor.\u201d In at least one section of the Code, the General Assembly has specifically stated the term \"physician\u201d shall include chiropractor. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-66.12. In several other parts of the Code, the legislature has distinguished between the \"practice of medicine or osteopathic medicine\u201d and \"medical physician\u201d or \"osteopathic physician\u201d on the one hand, and \"the practice of chiropractic\u201d or \"chiropractor\u201d on the other. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-581.1; 32.1-249(8); 54.1- 2900, -2902, -2911. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2930, -2932. In yet other parts of the Code, chiropractors are separately listed with physicians for various purposes. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-225.1 (immunity for team physicians extends to \"[a]ny physician, surgeon or chiropractor\u201d); 8.01- 581.1 (\" 'health care provider' means ... a physician, ... chiropractor\"); 8.01-581.13 (\" \u2018health professional\u2019 means ... a physician ..., chiropractor, ... \"); 8.01-581.19 (\"[a]ny physician, chiropractor ... shall be immune\u201d); 38.2-2203 (\"[plolicy providing for reimbursement for services that may be performed by certain practitioners other than physicians\u201d includes chiropractors); 38.2-3408 (\"[p]olicy providing for reimbursement for services that may be performed by certain practitioners other than physicians\u201d includes chiropractors); 38.2-4221 (\"[sjervices of certain practitioners other than physicians to be covered\u201d includes chiropractors); 54.1-2911 (\"Board of Medicine shall consist of one medical physician ..., one osteopathic physician, one podiatrist, one chiropractor, ... \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">. This holding does not change the commission's long standing precedent that where an employer fails to provide a panel of physicians, the employee has the right to seek on his or her own medical attention, including chiropractic treatment. <em>See, e.g., Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, 9 </em>Va.App. 120, 128, 384 S.E.2d 333, 338 (1989) (holding that when the employer did not offer a panel of physicians, the employee could seek suitable medical attention from a chiropractor). That precedent is consistent with the requirement of Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l) that the employer of an injured employee must provide \"such other necessary medical attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Likewise, when a physician refers an employee to a chiropractor for treatment, that service is clearly within the definition of \"medical attention\u201d as provided by Code \u00a7 65.2-603(A)(l).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
