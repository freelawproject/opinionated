On appeal, he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support both convictions. For the reasons that follow, we find the evidence sufficient to support the object sexual penetration conviction and hold that Rule 5A:18 bars our review of the felony murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-12\">On April 30, 1996, between 2:30 p.m. and 3:00 p.m., Laurie Hunter went to her sister\u2019s house, leaving her sleeping eight-month-old son, Tyler, with appellant, Tyler\u2019s father, in the home the three shared. Neither Hunter nor appellant had noticed anything unusual about Tyler\u2019s behavior or body while caring for him that day, and Hunter also had not observed anything unusual the previous night.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-13\">At about 5:00 p.m., appellant called Hunter because Tyler was \u201cbreathing funny\u201d and was \u201csick.\u201d When Hunter arrived home several minutes later, Tyler was \u201cpale\u201d and \u201cunresponsive,\u201d his breathing was \u201cshallow and his eyes were ... rolled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>back.\u201d Hunter observed no injuries other than some \u201clittle bruises on [Tyler\u2019s] stomach.\u201d Hunter called 911, and Tyler was taken by ambulance to Riverside Hospital. He was later transported to Children\u2019s Hospital of the King\u2019s Daughters in Norfolk, where he died at 9:15 a.m. on May 1,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Tyler was examined by a Dr. Michaels, who contacted Dr. Beck, Tyler\u2019s pediatrician. Dr. Beck testified that when she saw Tyler in the emergency room around 6:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on April 30, 1996, she was unable to determine why he was ill. He had been \u201cvery healthy and well\u201d when Beck had seen him for a routine check-up on April 3, 1996. Appellant told Dr. Beck that Tyler had vomited when he awoke from his nap around 3:45 p.m., was \u201cvery listless and restless,\u201d and had rolled off the couch. Dr. Beck observed scattered bruises on Tyler\u2019s abdomen and in his groin area, but did not examine his rectum. No medical procedures were performed on Tyler\u2019s anal area in the emergency room. Dr. Beck said that Tyler would have been cleaned if he had defecated, but that he had not done so while she was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Dr. Nakagawa, a pediatric intensive care specialist, began treating Tyler at about 11:00 p.m. after Tyler had been transported to CHKD in Norfolk. Tyler was in \u201cprofound shock,\u201d and Nakagawa thought he might have a \u201chollow organ rupture,\u201d permitting organisms from his bowels to infiltrate his bloodstream. Nakagawa noted that Tyler \u201chad a lot of abdominal ... tension\u201d and some small bruises on his abdomen. Nakagawa did not examine Tyler\u2019s back because he was \u201ctoo unstable,\u201d and he performed no medical procedures on Tyler\u2019s anal area. He concluded that Tyler \u201csustained blunt abdominal trauma, secondary to a punch injury, and ... [the] circular marks [on Tyler\u2019s abdomen] [were] the results of either the fingertips ... or the knuckles being struck against the abdominal wall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">After Tyler\u2019s death on the morning of May 1, 1996, Dr. Bush autopsied the infant\u2019s body at 2:00 p.m. that same day, concluding that Tyler died from a \u201csevere blunt force trauma to the abdomen.\u201d She did not believe that Tyler\u2019s injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>could have resulted from falling off a couch onto pillows, but testified that Tyler\u2019s abdominal injuries could have been caused by an adult falling on the child, hitting his abdomen with an arm or a leg. Dr. Bush also observed \u201crelatively fresh\u201d contusions and abrasions around Tyler\u2019s anus and anal ring. She testified that the injuries on the anal ring could not have been caused by the trauma to Tyler\u2019s abdomen, nor could they have been caused by a rectal thermometer. She further testified that they could have been caused by a human finger \u201c[i]f the anus was digitalized or the finger was used in a rough manner.\u201d On cross-examination, she said that a rough towel in conjunction with a finger, \u201cvery roughly pushed up or battered against the anus,\u201d possibly could have caused the abrasions. She acknowledged that the bruising could have resulted from a prolapsed rectum, but said she saw no evidence of that condition on autopsy. She also detected no lacerations of the anus to indicate that penetration had occurred. All injuries appeared to be of the same age.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Hunter testified that appellant first told her over the telephone that Tyler had become ill and had thrown up on himself. When she arrived home, appellant said Tyler had rolled off the couch onto some pillows on the floor. On May 5,1996, the day of Tyler\u2019s funeral, appellant called Hunter from jail and said he had fallen on Tyler accidentally while playing a game called \u201cPounce,\u201d in which he lunged toward the infant in order to make him laugh.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Appellant testified at trial that he hit Tyler in the stomach with his lower arm when he accidentally fell on Tyler while playing \u201cPounce.\u201d Initially, Tyler did not appear hurt, but twenty to thirty minutes later, he began to whine, became pale and had trouble breathing. While appellant was phoning Hunter, Tyler rolled off the couch onto some pillows. Appellant gave no explanation for his not having told Tyler\u2019s doctors that he fell on the child. He denied doing anything to Tyler that would have injured his anus and denied knowing how those injuries occurred. He admitted to having five prior felony convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Appellant\u2019s counsel moved to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and again at the close of all the evidence. The Commonwealth argued that Tyler\u2019s injuries were consistent with an attempt \u201cto sodomize this child and stick [a] finger in [his anus],\u201d and also argued that, under Code \u00a7 18.2-32, a murder during \u201cthe commission of attempted inanimate <em>or </em>animate object sexual penetration\u201d is first degree murder. At no time in the trial court did appellant\u2019s counsel contend that proof of animate rather than inanimate object sexual penetration was insufficient to support a first degree murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In convicting appellant of murder and attempted inanimate or animate object sexual penetration, the trial judge said she \u201cdid not find [appellant] very credible at all\u201d and that \u201cthe evidence [was] consistent with guilt\u201d as \u201ceverything points to [appellant] in this case, and the Court doesn\u2019t have any reasonable doubt at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The judgment of a trial court will be disturbed only if plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See id. </em>The credibility of a witness and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters solely for the fact finder\u2019s determination. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194,199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989). In its role of judging witness credibility, the fact finder is entitled to disbelieve the self-serving testimony of the accused and to conclude that he or she is lying to conceal his or her guilt. <em>See Speight v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1987) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">\u201cCircumstantial evidence is as competent and is entitled to as much weight as direct evidence, provided it is sufficiently convincing to exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that of guilt.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 31, 53, 307 S.E.2d 864, 876 (1983). However, \u201cthe Commonwealth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>need only exclude reasonable hypotheses of innocence that flow from the evidence, not those that spring from the imagination of the defendant.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 755, 433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993). Whether a hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact. <em>See Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 269, 290, 373 S.E.2d 328, 339 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Appellant contends first that the \u25a0\u25a0 circumstantial evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for attempted inanimate or animate object sexual penetration in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it failed to exclude the possibility that the injuries to Tyler\u2019s anus occurred during medical treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree. By convicting appellant of attempted object sexual penetration, the trial court implicitly found that the only reasonable hypotheses flowing from the evidence were (1) that the injuries to Tyler\u2019s anus occurred while he was in appellant\u2019s care rather than while undergoing medical treatment and (2) that appellant was the criminal agent. On this record, we conclude that finding is not plainly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">The evidence showed that both Hunter and appellant had cared for Tyler, including changing his diapers, during the twenty-four hours preceding his medical treatment and that neither had noticed anything unusual. While Tyler was alone in appellant\u2019s care that afternoon, appellant delivered a severe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>blow to Tyler\u2019s abdomen. Thereafter, Tyler was transported by ambulance and treated at Riverside Hospital and Children\u2019s Hospital of the King\u2019s Daughters before dying at 9:15 a.m. the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Treating physicians Beck and Nakagawa testified that no medical procedures were performed on Tyler\u2019s anal area in either hospital. Although Dr. Beck testified that Tyler\u2019s anal area would have been cleaned if he had defecated while under medical care, he did not defecate while Dr. Beck was present. Autopsy physician Bush testified that Tyler\u2019s \u201crelatively fresh\u201d anal injuries were of the same age as his abdominal injuries and could not have been caused by the abdominal trauma or by a rectal thermometer. Although Dr. Bush believed they could have been caused by a finger, used with or without a towel, if \u201cvery roughly pushed up or battered against the anus,\u201d or by a prolapsed rectum, no evidence supported a hypothesis that the injury occurred in either of those ways. No evidence indicated that Tyler defecated at any time while under medical care or that any of the trained medical personnel rubbed Tyler\u2019s anus harshly enough to have caused the injuries described by Dr. Bush.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Furthermore, the trial judge was not required to believe appellant\u2019s testimony that he did not know how Tyler sustained those anal injuries. After giving conflicting accounts regarding Tyler\u2019s abdominal injuries, appellant, a convicted felon, admitted hitting Tyler in the stomach while Tyler was in his sole care, and the evidence proved that the anal injuries were of the same age.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Therefore, the only reasonable hypothesis <em>flowing from the evidence, </em>viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is that appellant inflicted Tyler\u2019s anal injuries, that he did so with the intent to penetrate Tyler\u2019s anus with some object, animate or inanimate, and that he performed a direct, but ineffectual, act to consummate the offense. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-26,18.2-67.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Appellant next contends that his conviction for first degree murder must be set aside on the ground that the evidence failed to prove the object with which he attempted penetration was inanimate, rather than animate, as required for a first degree murder conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-32.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We hold that appellant failed properly to preserve the issue and that Rule 5A:18 bars our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Pursuant to Rule 5A:18, this Court will not consider trial court error as a basis for reversal where no timely objection was made, except to attain the ends of justice. Where an appellant makes a general objection to the sufficiency of the evidence that \u201c[does] not specify in what respects [appellant] considered the evidence to be insufficient to prove [the charged offense,] ... the issue of whether the evidence was insufficient to prove a particular [unmentioned] element of the offense was not properly preserved.\u201d <em>Redman v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 215, 220, 487 S.E.2d 269, 272 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">To invoke the ends of justice exception to Rule 5A-.18, the record must \u201caffirmatively show[ ] that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, not ... merely ... that a miscarriage <em>might </em>have occurred.\u201d <em>Mounce v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 433, 436, 357 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1987). To satisfy this burden, an appellant must show \u201cmore than that the Commonwealth <em>failed </em>to prove an element of the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>fense____ [T]he appellant must demonstrate that he or she was convicted for conduct that was not a criminal offense[,] or the record must affirmatively prove that an element of the offense did not occur.\u201d <em>Redman, </em>25 Va.App. at 221-22, 487 S.E.2d at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In this case, although appellant moved to strike, he failed to specifically assert that the evidence was insufficient to prove sexual penetration with an inanimate rather than animate object, as required to preserve the issue for appeal. Furthermore, the ends of justice exception does not permit us to excuse this failure, for the record does not show that appellant \u201cwas convicted for conduct that was not a criminal offense or ... that an element of the offense did not occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 487 S.E.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Had the trial court convicted appellant for felony murder under the mistaken belief that proof of attempted penetration with any animate object<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would support such a conviction, we would be permitted to invoke the ends of justice exception to reverse the conviction because this would constitute a conviction for a non-existent offense. In this case, the record indicates the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney mistakenly believed that a killing is felony murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-32 if it occurs during \u201cthe commission of attempted inanimate <em>or animate </em>object penetration.\u201d (Emphasis added). However, the record contains no affirmative indication that the trial court also operated under this mistaken belief, and we are bound by the presumption that the trial court knew and properly applied the law, <em>see, e.g., Wilson v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 318, 326, 477 S.E.2d 7, 10 (1996), convicting appellant for felony murder based on the predicate offense of attempted <em>inanimate </em>object penetration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Finally, the evidence did not affirmatively prove that the attempted penetration occurred with an animate rather than inanimate object. Therefore, we may not invoke the ends of justice exception to review appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on this element. <em>See Redman, 25 </em>Va.App. at 222, 487 S.E.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we hold that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for object sexual penetration and that Rule 5A:18 bars our review of appellant\u2019s assignment of error regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support his first degree murder conviction. Therefore, we affirm both convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\">. That code section provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">An accused shall be guilty of <em>inanimate or animate </em>object sexual penetration if he or she penetrates the ... anus of a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse <em>with any object, </em>other than for a bona fide medical purpose ..., and ... [tjhe complaining witness is less than thirteen years of age....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-11\">. Appellant also challenges his first degree murder conviction on this basis. Because we affirm the conviction for object sexual penetration on this issue, we also affirm the conviction for first degree murder on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b682-8\">. In contrast to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.2, which prohibits object sexual penetration with an inanimate or animate object, a conviction for first degree felony murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-32 requires proof of \u201c[m]urder ... in the commission of, or attempt to commit ... forcible sodomy [or] <em>inanimate </em>object sexual penetration.\" <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Forcible sodomy, defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1 to include \"anallingus [sic], or anal intercourse\u201d of a victim less than thirteen years of age, would, therefore, include some, but not all, acts of animate object penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">The Commonwealth argued at trial that Tyler's injuries were consistent with an attempt \"to sodomize this child and stick [a] finger in [his anus].\u201d The former act amounts to forcible sodomy, which would constitute a valid predicate offense; the latter act amounts to neither forcible sodomy nor inanimate object penetration and, therefore, would not constitute a valid predicate offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b683-8\">. \"[A]nallingus [sic], or anal intercourse,\u201d acts of animate object penetration that also constitute forcible sodomy as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1, provide valid predicate offenses under Code \u00a7 18.2-32. See the discussion, <em>supra, </em>at note 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-9\">. As set forth above, forcible sodomy is also a valid predicate offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
