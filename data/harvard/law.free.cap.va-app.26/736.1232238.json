He contends the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he obtained the property by violence or intimidation. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-13\">The evidence at trial proved that Sandra Byrd walked from a shopping mall in Martinsville with her purse under her arm. Byrd testified that because she was cautious, she had \u201ctucked\u201d the purse under her arm and carried it against her rib cage. As she walked along the sidewalk, someone came behind her, tapped her on the shoulder, and \u201cjerked\u201d her around by pulling her shoulder. The man who \u201cjerked\u201d her around then looked directly in her face, snatched her purse, and ran. Byrd dropped her coffee, screamed, and chased the man. She saw him enter a white car which sped away.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>A witness, who was sitting in his vehicle near the mall, saw a man run up behind Byrd. The witness testified that the man snatched her purse but \u201cdidn\u2019t knock her down.\u201d During his testimony, the witness stepped from his seat and demonstrated how the man approached Byrd and grabbed her purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Another witness heard Byrd screaming and saw a man running across the parking lot with a purse. The witness noted the automobile\u2019s license plate number and gave it to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">A police investigator testified that the license plate number belonged to Christopher Beck\u2019s automobile. When the police investigator interviewed Beck and his passenger, Jones\u2019 cousin, they both identified another man as the person who took Byrd\u2019s purse. However, when the investigator later separately re-interviewed Beck and Jones\u2019 cousin, they both identified Jones as the person who took Byrd\u2019s purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Beck testified that he drove his white automobile to the mall with Jones and Jones\u2019 cousin as his passengers. Beck also testified that a short time after Jones exited the automobile, Jones ran back to the car, jumped in, and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d As they drove away, Jones showed Beck a purse and said he had taken it from a woman. Jones\u2019 cousin, who was the other passenger in the automobile, similarly testified that shortly after Jones exited the automobile, Jones ran back, jumped in, and showed them a woman\u2019s purse after they drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The trial judge denied defense counsel\u2019s motion to strike the robbery charge and reduce the charge to grand larceny from the person. At the conclusion of the evidence, the judge convicted Jones of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">\u201cRobbery, a common law offense in Virginia, is defined as the \u2018taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence, against his will, <em>by violence or </em>intimidation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 519, 521, 351 S.E.2d 356, 357 (1986) (emphasis added) (citation omitted). Recently in <em>Winn v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 179, 462 S.E.2d 911 (1995), this Court addressed the very issue raised by this appeal. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>noted that conduct which is generally described as \u201cpurse snatching\u201d is a larceny unless the evidence proves the accused employed violence against the victim\u2019s person or used intimidation. <em>See id. </em>at 181-83, 462 S.E.2d at 913. Citing cases from Virginia and other jurisdictions, <em>Winn </em>particularly addressed those additional elements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\u201cThe touching or violation necessary to prove [robbery] may be indirect, but cannot result merely from the force associated with the taking.\u201d Instead, \u201c[violence or force requires a physical touching or violation <em>of the victim\u2019s person.\u201d ... \u201c </em>\u2018[T]he offense of robbery ... is not related to the force used on the object taken but to the force or intimidation <em>directed at the person of the victim.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">$ H* H* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-7\">[T]here must be \u201cadditional circumstances at the time of the snatching tending to transform the taking from a larceny to a robbery.\u201d For example, these circumstances are present when a struggle ensues, where the -victim is knocked down, or where the victim is put in fear \u2014 in other words, where the defendant employs violence or intimidation against the victim\u2019s person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">21 Va.App. at 181-82, 462 S.E.2d at 912-13 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">The evidence in this case proved that Jones grabbed Byrd, \u201cjerked\u201d her around by pulling on her shoulder, looked directly into her face, and then grabbed the purse that Byrd was clutching under her arm. Although defense counsel stated in closing argument that \u201cbased on what [the witness] acted out, it is clear that whoever did this was a purse snatcher,\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney stated that the witness \u201cdoing the demonstration ..., basically knocked [defense counsel] almost off his feet.\u201d The trial judge found that \u201cthe taking [was] accomplished by a physical jerking of\u2019 Byrd. Thus, the testimony and the demonstrative evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Jones used \u201cforce ... directed at the person of the victim.\u201d <em>Winn, </em>21 Va.App. at 182, 462 S.E.2d at 912. The taking of the purse occurred after Jones touched and jerked Byrd.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Moreover, the evidence proved that Jones first \u201cjerked\u201d Byrd around to face him before he took her purse. This was a sudden physical confrontation. \u201cIntimidation results when words or conduct of the accused exercise such domination and control over the victim as to overcome the victim\u2019s mind and overbear the victim\u2019s will, placing the victim in fear of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Bivins v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 750, 753, 454 S.E.2d 741, 742 (1995). Jones\u2019 conduct, forcing Byrd to turn and face him, was an exercise of domination over Byrd that was designed to overbear her will and place her in fear of bodily harm. <em>See Hams, </em>3 Va.App. at 521, 351 S.E.2d at 357.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">This case is factually distinguishable from <em>Winn </em>because the evidence proved that Jones touched Byrd and violated her person in a manner unrelated to the force necessary to remove the purse. <em>See also Bivins, </em>19 Va.App. at 752, 454 S.E.2d at 742 (robbery occurs when \u201ca physical touching or violation of the victim\u2019s person\u201d is accomplished which does not \u201cresult merely from the force associated with the taking\u201d). In <em>Winn, </em>\u201cno evidence proved that [the accused] touched the victim\u2019s person at any time.\u201d 21 Va.App. at 183, 462 S.E.2d at 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
