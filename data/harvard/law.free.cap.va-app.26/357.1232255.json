Salehi (\u201cclaimant\u201d). Employer argues the commission erroneously concluded that: (1) claimant\u2019s back injury was compensable despite his repeated failure to comply with lifting restrictions; and (2) claimant adequately marketed his residual work capacity. For the following reasons, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">\u201c[W]e review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). \u201cFactual findings of the ... [cjommission will be upheld on appeal if supported by credible evidence.\u201d <em>James v. Capitol Steel Constr. Co., </em>8 Va.App. 512, 515, 382 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Claimant has been the owner and president of Carpet Palace, Inc. since 1976. On November 14, 1977, he lifted a heavy roll of carpeting and suffered a compensable back injury, which ultimately resulted in a settlement of $20,000 plus lifetime medical benefits. From 1977 through 1993, claimant sought medical treatment on eight occasions for back pain following heavy lifting at work. He was hospitalized at least four times for treatment of his back pain, and doctors performed at least two surgical procedures. After the first surgery in 1979, claimant\u2019s doctors imposed restrictions on repetitive bending and lifting over twenty-five pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">On October 3, 1994, claimant moved a \u201clarge box of carpet samples\u201d and immediately felt pain in his back and into his right leg. In response to questions about this incident, claimant acknowledged the restrictions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-10\">Q. Did you have restrictions on your activities prior to October of 1994?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">A. Yes, I was told, you know, not to lift more than 20, 25 pounds, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>Q. So you weren\u2019t following your doctor\u2019s advice on the day of this incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-5\">A. It says try not to lift more than 20, 25 and unfortunately I did that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">When asked about his history of back pain following heavy lifting, claimant explained: \u201cUnfortunately I do the same thing expecting different results.\u201d Claimant\u2019s primary work obligations were bill paying and administrative jobs. Lifting boxes was outside the scope of his normal duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Dr. Anthony Debs, the treating physician, opined that the October 3,1994 incident \u201caggravated a pre-existing condition.\u201d Dr. Debs also expressed his view that \u201cat this stage the persevering symptoms are most probably related to the chronic condition that he has been suffering from for the past 15-16 years.\u201d Although Dr. Debs told claimant he could work eight hours per day, claimant indicated that working more than four to six hours a day aggravated his back. As a result, claimant testified that he was unable to work full duty and had to hire another employee to perform part of his work. Thus, his income was decreased.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">On March 8, 1995, claimant was involved in an automobile accident. He sought treatment for back pain from Dr. G.R. Mahryar, and he failed to tell Dr. Debs about this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">On April 3, 1995, claimant filed his request for benefits related to the October 3, 1994 incident. After a hearing, the deputy commissioner found that because Dr. Debs was un- \u25a0 aware of the car accident, \u201cDr. Debs\u2019 finding of disability is based upon inaccurate and incomplete information provided to him by the claimant.\u201d He concluded \u201cthe claimant has failed to sustain his burden of proof that any disability after the claimant\u2019s March 8, 1995 motor vehicle accident was causally related to the claimant\u2019s compensable accident or aggravation of his pre-existing condition.\u201d The deputy commissioner awarded claimant medical benefits related to the incident, temporary total disability benefits beginning October 28 through December 4, 1994, and temporary partial disability benefits from December 5, 1994 through March 7, 1995. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Claimant did not contest termination of disability benefits as of March 7,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">On review, a majority of the commission affirmed the award, finding: (1) \u201cclaimant sustained a compensable injury by accident on October 3, 1994,\u201d (2) \u201cclaimant adequately marketed his residual capacity,\u201d and (3) \u201cemployer continues to be responsible for medical treatment which is proven to be causally related to the industrial accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Employer argues that claimant did not sustain a compensable injury by accident because his injury predictably resulted from his failure to comply with ongoing medical restrictions. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">A worker may receive benefits related to an \u201cinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101. However, \u201c[a]n injury by accident must be unexpected to be compensable.\u201d <em>Dollar Gen. Store v. Cridlin, </em>22 Va.App. 171, 178, 468 S.E.2d 152, 155 (1996) (shoulder injury was not expected result of deviation from restriction related to breast cancer surgery). \u201cThe basic and indispensable ingredient of \u2018accident\u2019 is unexpectedness.\u201d 2 Arthur Larson, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 37.20 (1997). \u201cThe definition of accident generally assented to is ... an event which, under the circumstances, is unusual and not expected by the person to whom it happens.\u201d <em>Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Hosey, </em>208 Va. 568, 570-71, 159 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1968) (citation omitted) (knee injury during door-to-door survey was unexpected). <em>Cf. L.B. Priester &amp; Son v. McGee, </em>234 Miss. 471, 106 So.2d 394, 398 (1958) (claimant\u2019s \u201cexpectation of a probable second heart attack [was not] so strong as to strip the occurrence of its accidental character\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Additionally, \u201c[a]n accident is an event which creates an effect which is not the natural or probable consequence of the means employed and is not intended, designed, or reasonably anticipated.\u201d <em>Lynchburg Foundry Co. v. Irvin, </em>178 Va. 265, 271,16 S.E.2d 646, 648 (1941) (citation omitted) (toe ulceration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>from work shoe and resultant foot amputation were unexpected). Although \u201cfew people intentionally persist in a line of conduct that expectedly results in personal injury ... such cases can be found.\u201d Larson, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 38.83(f). <em>See Capers v. Flautt, </em>305 S.C. 254, 407 S.E.2d 660, 662 (Ct.App.1991) (claimant\u2019s contact dermatitis was \u201can event which [claimant] could anticipate given his past experience\u201d and was not a compensable injury by accident); <em>Ernest Waters Constr. Co. v. Mills, </em>51 So.2d 180, 181 (Fla.1951) (claimant\u2019s dermatitis was not compensable where it was \u201cactivated [three times] by neglect on his part to obey his doctor\u2019s instructions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">In the instant case, claimant testified that he expected he would not hurt his back when he lifted the heavy box of carpet samples on October 3, 1994. However, on at least eight prior occasions, claimant had required treatment for back pain after lifting heavy items at work. Despite his experience, he did \u201cthe same thing expecting different results.\u201d Additionally, claimant knew that his doctor had restricted him from lifting more than twenty-five pounds, and he knew that the lifting restriction was intended to prevent exactly the type of injury that occurred. He chose to ignore his doctor\u2019s orders and lifted a heavy box. The resultant back injury was a predictable consequence of claimant\u2019s voluntary defiance of the lifting restriction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act does not contemplate benefits for injuries voluntarily inflicted. Claimant\u2019s injury was the expected result of an activity that violated the doctor\u2019s specific restrictions and does not constitute an injury by accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For this reason we hold that claimant\u2019s October 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>1994 back injury was not compensable, and we reverse the commission\u2019s award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-6\">. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has denied compensation to workers whose disregard of medical restrictions resulted in predictable injuries. \"[Cjlaimant should have reasonably anticipated the result that her strenuous work would cause. We conclude that her [back] injury is the result of that work, which was done in specific violation of restrictions placed upon her by her doctor.... [C]laimant incurred no injury by accident.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Independent Home Health Care, </em>File No. 1701061 (Workers\u2019 Comp. Comma Oct. 13, 1995). <em>Accord Ellis v.
