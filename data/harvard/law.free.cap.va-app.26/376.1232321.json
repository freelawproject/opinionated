Pearsall and the Monument Avenue Park Association (Association) contend that the trial court erred in ruling that the Association was not a \u201cperson aggrieved,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 59.1-373, and that, for that reason, the Association lacked standing to appeal from a decision of the Virginia Racing Commission, an administrative agency.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The Virginia Racing Commission (Commission) regulates horse racing and pari-mutuel betting in the Commonwealth, including the issuance of licenses to persons or entities desiring to operate race tracks and betting facilities. Code \u00a7\u00a7 59.1-364 <em>et seq. </em>On October 12, 1994, the Commission licensed Colonial Downs, L.P. (Colonial Downs) and Stansley Racing Corporation (Stansley) to own and operate a horse race track. On December 20, 1995, the Commission issued Colonial Downs and Stansley a license to operate a betting parlor at 3200 West Broad Street in Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Colonial Downs and Stansley sought an amendment of the Commission\u2019s order to relocate the betting parlor at 4700 West Broad Street, located in Richmond and Henrico County. On June 25, 1996, following public notice and a hearing, the Commission granted that amendment to the betting parlor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Pearsall and the Association appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the trial court. The Association is a civic group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>composed of individuals residing in the City of Richmond and \u25a0within the vicinity of the betting parlor.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The trial court conducted a hearing on the appeal. Landon Wellford testified that he was a member of the Association and owned a residence located within sight of the betting parlor. He stated that he believed that the licensing of the parlor \u201cwould negatively impact the neighborhood and probably hurt property values as a result of a negative commercial use ... inappropriately mixed in with a residential use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Robert Goodman, an expert on the effects of the siting and operation of gambling facilities on residential neighborhoods, testified that the presence of the betting parlor would reduce residential property values in the neighborhood. Cecil E. Sears, an expert on residential property values in the City of Richmond, testified that residences located within view of the betting parlor or on streets immediately behind the facility would likely suffer a decline in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The trial court dismissed the Association\u2019s petition for review. It held that Wellford had standing to bring the appeal, but concluded that his membership in the Association did not confer that standing on the Association. It ruled that neither the Association nor Pearsall was a \u201cperson aggrieved.\u201d For this reason, the trial court dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Association had standing to seek review of the Commission\u2019s decision on behalf of its members.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">The concept of standing concerns itself with the characteristics of the person or entity who files suit. The point of standing is to ensure that the person who asserts a position has a substantial legal right to do so and that his rights will be affected by the disposition of the case. In asking whether a person has standing, we ask, in essence, whether he has sufficient interest in the subject matter of the case so that the parties will be actual adversaries and the issues will be fully and faithfully developed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\"><em>Cupp v. Board of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 580, 589, 318 S.E.2d 407, 411 (1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Standing, in this case, is governed by statute. <em>See Environmental Defense Fund v. Virginia State Water Control Bd., </em>12 Va.App. 456, 462, 404 S.E.2d 728, 732 (1991). Code \u00a7 59.1-373 expressly limits the right to appeal a decision of the Commission.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">Any <em>person aggrieved </em>by a refusal of the Commission to issue any license or permit, the suspension or revocation of a license or permit, the imposition of a fine, or any other action of the Commission, may, within thirty days of such action, appeal to the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Anm\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the determinative inquiry in this appeal is whether the Association is a \u201cperson\u201d that was \u201caggrieved\u201d by an action of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Code \u00a7 59.1-365 defines a \u201cperson\u201d to include \u201ca natural person, partnership, joint venture, association, or corporation.\u201d An unincorporated association may sue or be sued. Code \u00a7 8.01-15. The Association is an unincorporated civic group comprised of persons in a defined region of the City of Richmond. Accordingly, we conclude that the Association is a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">However, the ability to initiate an action does not confer upon a party the right to maintain an action involving no direct interest of that party. To have standing, the Association must demonstrate that it is \u201caggrieved\u201d under Code \u00a7 59.1-373.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">The term \u201caggrieved\u201d has a settled meaning in Virginia when it becomes necessary to determine who is a proper party to seek court relief from an adverse decision. In order for a petitioner to be \u201caggrieved,\u201d it must affirmatively appear that such person had some direct interest in the subject matter of the proceeding that he seeks to attack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>The petitioner \u201cmust show that he has an immediate, pecuniary and substantial interest in the litigation, and not a remote or indirect interest\u201d.... The word \u201caggrieved\u201d in a statute contemplates a substantial grievance and means a denial of some personal or property right, legal or equitable, or imposition of a burden or obligation upon the petitioner different from that suffered by the public generally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><em>Virginia Beach Beautification Comm\u2019n v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>281 Va. 415, 419-20, 344 S.E.2d 899, 903 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The Association neither owns nor occupies any real property. No personal or property right of the Association was adjudicated by the Commission. The Commission did not order the Association to act or to refrain from acting. Nothing in the record suggests that the Association holds any right that will be affected by the outcome of this case. We agree with the trial court\u2019s finding that the Association was not a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">The Association contends that it has representative standing to assert the rights of its members who have been injured by the Commission\u2019s action. The Association relies upon <em>Citizens for Clean Air v. Commonwealth ex rel. State Air Pollution Control Bd., </em>13 Va.App. 430, 412 S.E.2d 715 (1991), in which we stated, <em>obiter dicta:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">As an association organized to protect the interests of individuals who would be entitled to bring suit in their own right, [the association] may bring suit in its representative capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 435, 412 S.E.2d at 718. In <em>Citizens for Clean Air, </em>we found support for \u201cassociational standing\u201d in <em>Lynchburg Traffic Bureau v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>207 Va. 107, 108, 147 S.E.2d 744, 745 (1966), which held:</p>\n<p id=\"APr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Citizens for Clean Air, </em>13 Va.App. at 435, 412 S.E.2d at 718 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>[I]t is well settled that \u201cin order to entitle any person to maintain an action in court it must be shown that he has a justiciable interest in the subject matter in litigation; either in his own right <em>or in a representative capacity.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>In W.S. <em>Carnes, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors, 252 </em>Va. 377, 478 S.E.2d 295 (1996), a home builders association brought a suit for declaratory judgment seeking invalidation of county ordinances that increased building permit fees. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 478 S.E.2d at 297. The Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Lynchburg Traffic Bureau, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">A plaintiff has standing to institute a declaratory judgment proceeding if it has a \u201cjusticiable interest\u201d in the subject matter of the proceeding, either in its own right or in a representative capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 383, 478 S.E.2d at 299. However, the Supreme Court held that the association lacked standing because it had failed to show that its own rights would be affected by the outcome of the proceeding. The Court noted that the association neither built houses nor paid building permit fees. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">This conclusion is not altered by the fact that the Association purports to act in a \u201crepresentative capacity\u201d on behalf of its members. An individual or entity does not acquire standing to sue in a representative capacity by asserting the rights of another, unless authorized by statute to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqm\"><em>Id. </em>at 383, 478 S.E.2d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">This passage in <em>Carnes </em>clarified the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition of representational standing in <em>Lynchburg Traffic Bureau </em>and tacitly overruled our extension of that standing in <em>Citizens for Clean Air. </em>Furthermore, the result in <em>Carnes </em>was reached despite the provision that the article governing administration of declaratory judgments is to be liberally interpreted. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-184, 8.01-191; <em>Fairfax County v. Southland Corp., </em>224 Va. 514, 297 S.E.2d 718 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">We note that federal courts have permitted organizations to pursue legal action on behalf of their members.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>nize that granting such standing may provide significant benefits in judicial economy and for interested parties. <em>See </em>14A Michie\u2019s Jurisprudence <em>Parties </em>\u00a7 11 (1989). However, Virginia holds that an association is not the <em>alter ego </em>of its individual members. The mere fact that its members have an interest in litigation does not, <em>per se, </em>vest the association with a justiciable interest in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Virginia recognizes representational standing only when it is specifically authorized by the legislature. <em>See Carnes, </em>252 Va. at 383, 478 S.E.2d at 300. Code \u00a7 59.1-373 contains no such authorization. Furthermore, this suit, brought against a state agency, is a suit against the Commonwealth and requires strict adherence to the statutes waiving sovereign immunity. <em>See Halberstam v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 248, 250-51, 467 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1996); <em>Virginia Bd. of Medicine v. Virginia Physical Therapy Ass\u2019n, 13 </em>Va.App. 458, 464-65, 413 S.E.2d 59, 63 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>245 Va. 125, 427 S.E.2d 183 (1993). We must construe the Commonwealth\u2019s waiver of its sovereign immunity narrowly. <em>See Virginia Bd. of Medicine, </em>13 Va.App. at 464-65, 413 S.E.2d at 63. Thus, the trial court correctly held that the Association lacked standing to maintain this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the appellants\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\">. The appellants do not contend that the trial court erred in dismissing Robin J. Pearsall from their petition for review.

However, the amendment does not apply to agency actions commenced prior to July 1, 1996. 1996 Va.Acts ch. 573, cl. 2.
