Woods\u2019 license to sell motor vehicles. Woods contends the Department\u2019s policy constitutes an improper promulgation of a rule in violation of the Administrative Process Act and violates his right to due process by arbitrarily revoking his license without the process afforded by statute. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The evidence before the administrative hearing officer proved that Woods was first licensed by the Department as a motor vehicle salesperson eighteen to twenty years ago. On December 15, 1994, Woods, who was then working as a construction supervisor, pleaded guilty in federal court to a felony charge of credit card fraud in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1644(a). This felony conviction did not arise out of the business of selling motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">Following the conviction, Woods was again employed as a motor vehicle salesperson. After beginning his employment as a salesperson, Woods mistakenly believed that his license to sell motor vehicles had expired, and he applied for renewal of his license on January 19, 1995. In his application for renewal, Woods disclosed his conviction and supplied the Department with the pertinent court documents. The Department then conducted an administrative review to determine whether Woods\u2019 license should be revoked pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-1575(13).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An informal fact finding conference was held. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:11. Following the conference, the Department informed Woods that in accordance with its policy his license was being revoked because he had been convicted of a felony. Woods then requested a hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">At the administrative hearing, Woods\u2019 supervising sales manager testified that Woods was the automobile dealership\u2019s best employee. He testified that Woods was honest and well-liked, had a good sales record, had a strong work ethic, and had been the top salesperson for four months in a row. The vice president and general manager of the automobile dealership testified as to Woods\u2019 \u201cimpeccable\u201d integrity and stated that the dealership would like to keep Woods as a salesperson.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">L.S. Stupasky, the Department\u2019s representative, testified that in 1994 the Department reviewed its policy concerning felony convictions. At that time, he and another Department employee sent the following memorandum to the Commissioner of the Department:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">This is a follow up to the \u201cFelony Conviction\u201d meeting held on Wednesday, June 29th and to confirm the DMV management decision and current policy guidelines followed by the Dealer Licensing Section. The following policy addresses <em>\u201cdenial\u201d </em>of an application for a license as a salesperson/motor vehicle dealer where the applicant has been convicted of a felony. If you affirm the prior decision and current process, please sign the attached approvals sheet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\n<em>CURRENT POLICY GUIDELINES FOR DENIAL</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">* Currently on Probation/Parole status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">* Felony conviction occurred within five years of the application date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>* Code Authority \u2014 \u00a7 46.2-1575 Grounds for denying, suspending, or revoking licenses or certificates for dealer registration or qualification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-4\">A license or certificate may be denied on any one or more of the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201c13. Having been convicted of a felony;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Stupasky testified that pursuant to the policy contained in this internal memorandum, he is required to recommend revocation whenever a licensee has been convicted of a felony. He further testified that prior to 1994, the Department\u2019s practice regarding felony convictions had been to revoke only the license of a licensee who had been convicted of a felony related to the business of selling motor vehicles. That policy had been in existence from 1988, when Code \u00a7 46.2-1575 was enacted, until the Commissioner changed the policy in 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Stating that \u201c[i]t is the policy of the Department of Motor Vehicles to revoke the license [of] any salesperson that has been convicted of a felony within the past five years,\u201d the hearing officer recommended revocation of Woods\u2019 license. The hearing officer ruled that the endorsements of Woods\u2019 sales manager and general manager were \u201cnot sufficient to overcome the statutory authority and the Department\u2019s policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The Commissioner accepted the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation and revoked Woods\u2019 motor vehicle sales license for five years from the date of his felony conviction. The Commissioner\u2019s decision stated that the revocation was consistent with Code \u00a7 46.2-1575(13) and \u201cthe DMV policy to revoke the salesperson license of anyone convicted of a felony within five years of the date of the application.\u201d The decision also stated that \u201c[although representation of your good character is commendable, that information is not sufficient to allow you to remain licensed in contravention of the <em>Code of Virginia </em>and DMV policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">After the Commissioner entered his final decision revoking Woods\u2019 license, Woods filed a petition for appeal to the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>court. The circuit court judge affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision revoking Woods\u2019 license.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-1508 states that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to engage in business in the Commonwealth as a motor vehicle ... salesperson without first obtaining a license.\u201d At all times relevant to the issues in this case, the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles was the entity charged with issuing and enforcing the licensing requirements. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1508 \u2014 46.2-1527.8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, Code \u00a7 46.2-1575 provided that \u201c[a] license ... issued under this subtitle <em>may </em>be denied, suspended or revoked [by the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles] on any one or more of the following grounds: ... 13. Having been convicted of a felony.\u201d (Emphasis added). The statute specified eighteen grounds for which a license may be denied, suspended or revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">The evidence at the administrative hearing proved that the Commissioner\u2019s statutory authority to deny, suspend, or revoke a license for the conviction of a felony was first enacted in 1988. <em>See </em>1988 Acts of Assembly, ch. 865. The evidence also proved that prior to 1994, the Department exercised its discretion under this provision of the statute to revoke the licenses of those licensees who had been convicted of felonies related only to the business of selling motor vehicles. However, in 1994, the Commissioner acted on a recommendation from the Department\u2019s management and instituted a policy that required the Department to suspend or revoke, without exception, the license of any licensee who had been convicted of <em>any </em>felony. Indeed, the Department\u2019s representative testified at the administrative hearing that when an applicant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>current holder of a license has a felony conviction the employee who reviews the application always recommends to the Commissioner, pursuant to the Department\u2019s current policy guidelines, that the license be denied or revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Thus, in 1994, the Department changed its earlier policy and enacted a policy that eliminates any discretion from the Department\u2019s review of the license status of a person who has been convicted of a felony. The current policy mandates, without exception, the suspension or revocation of the license of any salesperson convicted of a felony. The Department applied this changed policy to Woods\u2019 application. Thus, the Department enforced in a case decision a \u201cpolicy guideline\u201d that it adopted as a standard for applying the statutory mandate of Code \u00a7 46.2-1575(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In <em>Virginia Board of Medicine v. Virginia Physical Therapy Association, </em>13 Va.App. 458, 413 S.E.2d 59 (1991), <em>aff'd, </em>245 Va. 125, 427 S.E.2d 183 (1993), this Court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_7\">Under the [Administrative Process Act], \u201crule\u201d and \u201cregulation\u201d are defined as \u201cany statement of general application, having the force of law, affecting the rights or conduct of any person, <em>promulgated </em>by an agency in accordance with the authority conferred on it by applicable basic laws.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(F) (emphasis added). \u201cPromulgate\u201d means to publish or to announce officially, and is commonly used in the context of the \u201cformal act of announcing a statute.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>634 (5th ed.1983). The [Administrative Process Act] and the Virginia Register Act provide the procedure for the promulgation and adoption of a rule or regulation. An agency\u2019s rule or regulation is invalid if the agency failed to comply with these statutes in the promulgation process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">13 Va.App. at 466, 413 S.E.2d at 64. This Court noted that rules that are not promulgated according to the statutory procedure of the Administrative Process Act and the Virginia Register Act are invalid as <em>\u201cdefacto </em>\u201d rules. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>However, in <em>Jackson v. W, </em>14 Va.App. 391, 419 S.E.2d 385 (1992), we noted that this Court has held that \u201c[i]n order to carry out its [statutory] purpose, an agency may adopt an \u2018 \u201cinterpretative rule\u201d without the binding force of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 419 S.E.2d at 390 (quoting <em>Bader v. Norfolk Redev. &amp; Hous. Auth., </em>10 Va.App. 697, 702, 396 S.E.2d 141, 144 (1990)). We held that when the legislature authorizes an agency to supervise the administration of a regulatory act, the agency may establish guidelines for its employees to use in applying the statute so as to give effect to the intent and spirit of the legislation. <em>See Jackson, </em>14 Va.App. at 399, 419 S.E.2d at 389-90. Thus, we held that a state agency may issue to its employees \u201cguidelines ... [that] are ... interpretative rules adopted in order to carry out the agency\u2019s purpose of implementing the Commonwealth\u2019s policy [contained in the agency\u2019s basic law].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 419 S.E.2d at 390.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>Based upon the evidence in this record, we cannot say that the Commissioner\u2019s adoption of the guidelines in 1994 is the type of <em>\u201cde facto </em>\u201d rule that this Court condemned in <em>Virginia Board of Medicine. </em>When the Department enforced Code \u00a7 46.2-1575(13) prior to 1994, the policy of the Department was to exempt from suspension the licenses of salespersons whose felony convictions did not relate to the business of selling motor vehicles. The record does not establish whether this was a written policy or unwritten practice. However, in 1994, the Commissioner approved a written policy guideline statement that informed Department employees charged with reviewing licensees\u2019 applications of the guidelines that were to be employed from that date forward. As in <em>Jackson, </em>we believe that the Commissioner adopted an \u201cinterpretative rule\u201d for the purpose of fulfilling the Department\u2019s responsibility to administer the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Although we find that the Commissioner did not adopt a <em>\u201cde facto </em>\u201d rule when he approved the new interpretative guidelines, we do find that the policy guidelines are inconsistent with the statute. <em>See Jackson, </em>14 Va.App. at 400, 419 S.E.2d at 390.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The General Assembly used discretionary language in drafting Code \u00a7 46.2-1575. The statutory language evinces a recognition on the part of the General Assembly that, in some cases, license revocation may not be an appropriate remedy. Indeed, the General Assembly specified eighteen separate grounds that \u201cmay\u201d give rise to adverse action. The Department and Woods agree that the statute granted the Department the discretion to suspend or revoke a license to sell motor vehicles where the licensee has been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">When the Department established its mandatory revocation policy, however, it foreclosed any opportunity for a licensee who was affected by the policy to appeal to the discretionary authority of the Commissioner. Although the statute autho<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>rizes the use of discretion, the current policy guidelines allow no discretion to be exercised in determining whether a felony conviction will result in revocation or suspension of a license. The policy guidelines direct that a revocation or suspension <em>must </em>be imposed following a felony conviction. Clearly, the decision to revoke Woods\u2019 license did not result from the exercise of discretion; it was a mandatory act taken in accordance with an internal policy which directly contradicted the intent of the General Assembly when it enacted the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">In granting the Department the discretion to revoke licenses, the General Assembly intended for the Department to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether revocation properly serves the interests of the public. In those cases in which revocation would not serve the interests of the public and would work an injustice, the General Assembly intended for the Department to exercise its discretion in applying the statute. Under the mandatory revocation policy, however, the Department fails to exercise its discretion and revokes licenses in all cases involving felony convictions, without considering the best interests of the public or the purpose of the statute. We note that the policy guidelines do not provide such a mandatory feature for any of the other seventeen grounds specified in Code \u00a7 46.2-1575.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The record of the informal fact finding conference, the recommendation of the hearing officer, and the final agency decision all reference \u201cthe [Department\u2019s] policy\u201d to suspend or revoke the license of <em>anyone </em>convicted of a felony without exception or consideration of other circumstances. We hold that the Department\u2019s policy guidelines are inconsistent with the statute because they remove from the Department\u2019s review of licensees the discretion granted by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision and remand the case for reconsideration in accordance with the discretionary standard enacted within Code \u00a7 46.2-1575.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\">.
