He contends the trial court violated the Due Process Clause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>Fourteenth Amendment when it admitted the following evidence during a hearing to determine his sentence: (1) information contained in a presentence report regarding his prior adult criminal convictions to which his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached, (2) information contained in a presentence report regarding his entire juvenile record, and (3) a proffer by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney regarding the evidence presented at a trial of appellant on an unrelated murder charge that resulted in a hung jury. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">On October 10, 1996, appellant pleaded guilty to the charge that he possessed heroin with the intent to distribute \u201con or about January 5, 1996.\u201d After accepting appellant\u2019s guilty plea, the trial court scheduled a hearing to sentence appellant for this offense (\u201cheroin offense\u201d) and ordered the preparation of a presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">On November 12,1996, the trial court held a hearing to first sentence appellant for the heroin offense and then to receive appellant\u2019s guilty plea to an unrelated charge of murder.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the beginning of the hearing to determine appellant\u2019s sentence for the heroin offense, the following exchange occurred regarding the relevance of the murder charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-9\">TRIAL COURT: Counsel, do I understand that we have both a sentencing on one charge and a plea on another, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-10\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Yes, sir. The sentencing to occur before we take up this other matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY: Judge, although the sentencing is going to occur in time first, we believe we can stipulate and agree that the plea agreement is going to be, we\u2019re going to recommend imposition of sentence suspended on first degree murder upon the plea of guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APr-\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: Let me tell you additionally what that representation is all about. At the time that we agreed to the dispositions on today\u2019s cases, it was agreed that no conviction, no plea on the homicide would occur until after these pending charges had been disposed of. It was also agreed, however, that during the course of the sentencing, the Commonwealth could make known to you the anticipated plea and the plea agreement, but I think that we both agree that that conviction has not occurred and both of us, I think, would be free to address those matters during our comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">TRIAL COURT: Including summary of the evidence on that matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-6\">APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL: I think that will come up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">The Commonwealth stated that the evidence it intended to offer during the sentencing hearing consisted of \u201cthe guidelines, the presentence report, and the stipulation about what we anticipate occurring.\u201d The presentence report contained a list of appellant\u2019s prior adult criminal convictions and juvenile adjudications. Included among appellant\u2019s prior convictions were two felonies and one misdemeanor for which appellant was actually incarcerated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Neither the Commonwealth nor appellant offered any evidence about whether these convictions were obtained in compliance with appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The presentence report also stated that appellant\u2019s juvenile record included adjudications of \u201cnot innocent\u201d for twelve offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Appellant made two objections to the admissibility of the presentence report. He first objected to the portion of the presentence report summarizing his prior adult criminal record. He argued that admitting the summary of his adult criminal record violated his right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment because the Commonwealth failed to prove that any of these prior convictions were \u201ccounseled\u201d under the Sixth Amendment. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Appellant also objected to the admissibility of the portion of the presentence report summarizing his juvenile record. He argued that admitting evidence during the sentencing phase of an adult criminal proceeding regarding his prior juvenile record was unconstitutional because the procedures under which the juvenile proceedings were adjudicated rendered them \u201cunreliable.\u201d The trial court also overruled this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney subsequently argued that appellant\u2019s long and varied history of committing criminal offenses justified the imposition of the maximum sentence for the heroin offense. During his recitation of appellant\u2019s history of criminal convictions and juvenile adjudications, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney referred to the murder charge still pending against appellant. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">We see that he\u2019s also, he\u2019s committed larcenies. He\u2019s committed several larcenies, grand larceny, petty larceny, petty larceny. He\u2019s vandalized property. He\u2019s been convicted of vandalism.... <em>And now with the stipulation that we have, we know that he has committed a murder and that he is pleading guilty to a murder. </em>That is a record that goes across all the different categories of offenses from sex offense to murder to drugs to stealing and the entire gamut____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">At the beginning of his argument regarding appellant\u2019s sentence, appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s reference to the murder charge. He argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the trial court \u201ccannot consider [the murder charge] at all because there is in fact no conviction [and] ... no evidence before you of what occurred.\u201d The trial court ruled that references to the murder charge were \u201cadmissible\u201d and that the only remaining issues \u201c[were] how probative it is and how much should it be considered by the Court.\u201d The trial court then directed appellant\u2019s counsel to present arguments about these two issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In response to the trial court\u2019s request, appellant\u2019s counsel stated his understanding of the circumstances that led to the hung jury at the trial on the murder charge and argued that appellant\u2019s forthcoming guilty plea was unreliable and not probative. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney responded by arguing that appellant\u2019s forthcoming guilty plea to the murder charge was rehable and relevant to the determination of his sentence for the heroin offense. In support of his argument, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney proffered a detailed summary of the evidence presented at the trial of the murder charge, including his synopsis of all of the key witnesses\u2019 testimony. Appellant\u2019s counsel responded with a detailed summary of the evidence that impeached the credibility of the witnesses who testified at the trial on the murder charge. He argued that the unreliability of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses rendered appellant\u2019s forthcoming guilty plea to the murder charge \u201cof no probative value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">At the conclusion of the arguments, the trial court sentenced appellant to serve forty years in a state correctional facility, the maximum sentence of incarceration allowed for a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-248, and suspended twenty-five of these years for the remainder of appellant\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">After the proceeding on the murder charge, appellant made a motion to suspend or reduce the sentence imposed by the trial court for the heroin offense. Appellant argued that the trial court violated the Fourteenth Amendment when it admitted into \u201cevidence\u201d the proffer given by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney regarding the evidence presented at the trial on the murder charge. Appellant argued that the proffer was constitutionally inadmissible because \u201cit would be unreliable evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>dence coming as it did through various representations instead of [appellant] confronting that particular witness on the stand.\u201d The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion. It explained that it considered the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s proffer to be \u201cadmissible testimony,\u201d and the fact that a trial had already been held on the murder charge, at which both attorneys were present, rendered the proffer sufficiently reliable to be considered as \u201cevidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">ADMISSIBILITY OF PRIOR ADULT CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Appellant contends the trial court violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when it admitted evidence during a sentencing hearing about his prior adult convictions to which his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached. He argues that prior criminal convictions are presumed to be tainted by a violation of the defendant\u2019s right to counsel and that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden of proving that his convictions were properly \u201ccounseled\u201d under the Sixth Amendment. Because appellant failed to rebut the presumption that his prior convictions were constitutionally valid, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Both a criminal defendant\u2019s right to counsel and the prohibition against using uncounseled prior convictions to enhance punishment are well established. Under the Sixth Amendment, a criminal defendant has a right to be represented by counsel, absent a knowing and intelligent waiver of this right, in all prosecutions of felonies and of misdemeanors for which the defendant is actually incarcerated. <em>See Scott v. Illinois, </em>440 U.S. 367, 373-74, 99 S.Ct. 1158, 1162, 59 L.Ed.2d 383 (1979); <em>Argersinger v. Hamlin, </em>407 U.S. 25, 37, 92 S.Ct. 2006, 2012, 32 L.Ed.2d 530 (1972); <em>see also Griswold v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 113, 115, 472 S.E.2d 789, 790 (1996). The right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment does not extend to prosecutions of misdemeanors for which no jail time is actually served by the defendant. <em>See Scott, </em>440 U.S. at 369, 99 S.Ct. at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>In addition, the Due Process Clause limits the types of prior convictions that may be used to enhance a convicted defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See Parke v. Raley, </em>506 U.S. 20, 27, 113 S.Ct. 517, 522, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). A prior conviction is used for \u201csentence enhancement\u201d when it is admitted (1) during a trial to convict a defendant of violating a \u201crecidivist statute,\u201d i.e., a statute that criminalizes the commission of a successive violation of a particular offense, (2) during a sentencing hearing as part of the criminal history portion of a calculation of a sentence pursuant to the sentencing guidelines, or (3) during a sentencing hearing as part of the defendant\u2019s record of prior criminal convictions. <em>See Nichols v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 738, 747, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 1927, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994) (regarding recidivist statutes and sentencing guidelines); <em>Griswold, </em>252 Va. at 116, 472 S.E.2d at 789 (regarding prior criminal record). Among the prior convictions that may not be admitted for sentence enhancement are those that were \u201cuncounseled,\u201d i.e., obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Burgett v. Texas, </em>389 U.S. 109, 115, 88 S.Ct. 258, 262, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applying this principle, the Virginia Supreme Court has held that a defendant\u2019s prior misdemeanor conviction that was \u201cuncounseled\u201d and for which he served two days in jail was inadmissible during <em>both </em>the guilt and sentencing phases of his trial on the charge of driving under the influence of intoxicants (\u201cDUI\u201d), a second conviction within five to ten years of a first DUI conviction. <em>See Griswold, </em>252 Va. at 116, 472 S.E.2d at 790-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">When sentence enhancement is an issue, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving the existence of a defendant\u2019s prior, valid convictions, and it is assisted with this burden by the \u201cpresumption of regularity.\u201d Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>every final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is presumed \u201cto have been rightly done,\u201d a \u201cfinal\u201d criminal conviction is entitled to a \u201cpresumption of regularity\u201d when challenged collaterally, even on the ground that it was constitutionally invalid. <em>See Nicely v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 579, 584-86, 587, 490 S.E.2d 281, 283-84, 284 (1997); <em>see also James v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 746, 750-51, 446 S.E.2d 900, 903 (1994) (citing <em>Parke, </em>506 U.S. at 30, 113 S.Ct. at 523). Thus, if the Commonwealth offers evidence sufficient to prove the existence of a defendant\u2019s prior criminal conviction, a presumption arises that the prior conviction was obtained in compliance with the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Nicely, </em>25 Va.App. at 587, 490 S.E.2d at 284 (stating that \u201cthe record of a prior misdemeanor conviction, silent with respect to related incarceration <em>or representation of the accused by counsel, </em>is entitled to a presumption of regularity on collateral attack ...\u201d (emphasis added)). Unless the defendant rebuts this presumption with evidence that the prior conviction is constitutionally invalid, the prior conviction may be used for sentence enhancement in the current proceeding. Requiring the defendant to rebut the presumption of regularity does not violate the Due Process Clause because, as the United States Supreme Court has stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-5\">when a collateral attack on a final conviction rests on constitutional grounds, the presumption of regularity that attaches to final judgments makes it appropriate to assign a proof burden to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-6\"><em>Parke, </em>506 U.S. at 31, 113 S.Ct. at 524.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Appellant argues that <em>James </em>stands for the proposition that the Commonwealth always retains both the burden of production and persuasion on the issue of whether a defendant\u2019s prior conviction was valid under the Sixth Amendment. Although the issue in <em>James </em>did not involve a collateral challenge to a prior conviction based upon the right to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>secured by the Sixth Amendment, we did, albeit by way of <em>dictum, </em>make the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-5\"><em>The Commonwealth </em>had the burden of going forward with evidence and <em>always retains the burden of persuasion to prove that the predicate convictions relied upon were valid under [the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel] </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-6\">We hold that the Commonwealth satisfies its burden of going forward when it produces a properly certified conviction from a court of competent jurisdiction which appears on its face to be a valid final judgment, <em>provided that in all felony cases and those misdemeanor proceedings where imprisonment resulted, there is evidence establishing that the defendant was represented by or properly waived counsel in the earlier criminal proceeding. Burgett v. Texas, </em>389 U.S. 109, 114, 88 S.Ct. 258, 261, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967); <em>Nichols, </em>[511 U.S. at 746-47], 114 S.Ct. at 1927; <em>Scott, </em>440 U.S. at 373, 99 S.Ct. at 1161.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">18 Va.App. at 752, 446 S.E.2d at 904 (emphasis added). This statement is correct, although perhaps incomplete. When the Commonwealth seeks to prove that a defendant has a prior criminal conviction, it bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient to prove that such a conviction did, in fact, occur. Once the Commonwealth establishes this fact, the presumption of regularity that attaches to such convictions satisfies any burden the Commonwealth had to prove that the conviction was obtained in compliance with the defendant\u2019s right to counsel. This <em>dictum </em>in <em>James </em>does not require the Commonwealth to offer <em>additional </em>evidence that independently establishes that the prior conviction was \u201ccounseled\u201d as a prerequisite to the conviction\u2019s admissibility. Instead, the Commonwealth is only required to produce such additional evidence if the defendant first produces evidence of his or her own that rebuts the presumption of regularity. <em>See Nicely, </em>25 Va.App. at 585, 490 S.E.2d at 283 (stating that \u201c \u2018[a] silent record or the mere naked assertion by an accused\u2019 that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>constitutional rights were violated is \u2018insufficient\u2019 to rebut the presumption of validity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">We hold that the trial court did not violate the Due Process Clause when it admitted at the sentencing hearing for the heroin offense the evidence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions. The Commonwealth proved the existence of appellant\u2019s prior convictions by offering the out-of-court statements of Anita G. Sweetwyne, the probation and parole officer who prepared the presentence report. Appellant did not contend that the summary of his prior adult criminal record contained in the presentence report was inaccurate or that the hearsay contained in the report was inadmissible at the sentencing hearing. <em>See Williams v. People of State of New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 250-51, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1086, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). On appeal, he does not contend that this evidence was insufficient to prove the existence of his prior convictions. The presentence report indicates that two of these prior convictions were felonies and that one was a misdemeanor for which appellant was actually incarcerated. Thus, appellant\u2019s right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment attached to these convictions. <em>See Scott, </em>440 U.S. at 373-74, 99 S.Ct. at 1162; <em>Burgett, </em>389 U.S. at 114, 88 S.Ct. at 261 (citing <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963)). When the Commonwealth offered evidence that proved the existence of these convictions, a presumption arose that they were constitutionally valid. Appellant offered no evidence to rebut the presumption that these prior convictions were obtained in compliance with his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment. Because appellant failed to rebut the presumption of regularity, the trial court did not violate the Due Process Clause when it admitted these prior convictions for the purpose of sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">ADMISSIBILITY OF PRIOR JUVENILE ADJUDICATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Appellant contends the trial court violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when it admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>ted evidence during the sentencing hearing about his prior juvenile record. He argues that the procedures attendant to juvenile proceedings render these adjudications so unreliable that it is fundamentally unfair to consider them during the sentencing phase of later adult criminal prosecutions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Under Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A), a probation officer who has been ordered to prepare a presentence report is required \u201cto fully advise the court\u201d of \u201cthe history of the accused, including a report of the accused\u2019s criminal record as an adult and <em>available juvenile records, </em>and all other relevant facts.\u201d (Emphasis added); <em>see Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 656, 659, 446 S.E.2d 469, 471 (1994) <em>(en </em>banc). The trial court, in turn, is required to read and consider the content of the presentence report when \u201cdetermin[ing] the appropriate sentence to be imposed.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-299(A); <em>cf. Duncan v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 342, 345-46, 343 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1986) (stating that \u201c[a] defendant convicted of a felony has an absolute right to have a presentence investigation and report prepared upon his request and submitted to the court prior to the pronouncement of sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">We hold that the trial court did not violate appellant\u2019s right to due process when it admitted into evidence at the sentencing hearing the summary of his juvenile record contained in the presentence report. The process of determining a convicted defendant\u2019s sentence is, in a constitutional sense, \u201cless exacting than the process of establishing guilt.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>511 U.S. at 747,114 S.Ct. at 1927. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number><em>Williams v. Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. 576, 584, 79 S.Ct. 421, 426, 3 L.Ed.2d 516 (1959). Evidence about the convicted defendant\u2019s \u201clife and characteristics\u201d that is constitutionally admissible during a sentencing hearing includes evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s prior criminal conduct, whether adjudicated or unadjudicated. <em>See Nichols, </em>511 U.S. at 747, 114 S.Ct. at 1928. Because the evidentiary restrictions imposed by the Due Process Clause upon sentencing hearings are significantly relaxed, we conclude that the trial court did not err when it admitted into evidence the summary of appellant\u2019s juvenile record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>[O]nce the guilt of the accused has been properly established, the sentencing judge, in determining the kind and extent of punishment to be imposed, is not restricted to evidence derived from the examination and cross-examination of witnesses in open court but may, consistently with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, consider responsible unsworn or \u201cout-of-court\u201d information relative to the circumstances of the crime and to the convicted person\u2019s life and characteristics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b854-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Appellant argues that admitting prior juvenile adjudications at a sentencing hearing is fundamentally unfair because they are not as \u201creliable\u201d as adult criminal convictions. We disagree. Criminal convictions do not set the standard for determining the admissibility at a sentencing hearing of information regarding a convicted defendant\u2019s prior criminal conduct. Cf<em>. Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. at 244, 250-51, 69 S.Ct. at 1081, 1086 (holding that the Due Process Clause did not prohibit the trial court from considering hearsay contained in a presentence report that appellant committed thirty unadjudicated burglaries); <em>Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 768, 774, 454 S.E.2d 737, 741 (1995). Instead, under the Due Process Clause, the prior criminal conduct of a convicted defendant may be established by evidence offered at a sentencing hearing, and \u201cthe state need prove such conduct only by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Nichols, </em>511 U.S. at 748, 114 S.Ct. at 1928. Thus, the mere fact that a juvenile adjudication is not a criminal conviction does not bar its admission into evidence at a sentencing hearing. Moreover, an adjudication that a juvenile has committed a criminal offense is arguably more reliable than hearsay evidence regarding unadjudicated criminal conduct because it is determined pursuant to the due process protections that are applicable to juvenile proceedings, which include the \u201cbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt\u201d standard of proof.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">ADMISSIBILITY OF PROSECUTOR\u2019S PROFFER REGARDING THE EVIDENCE ADMITTED AT APPELLANT\u2019S MURDER TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Appellant contends the trial court violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when it considered the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s proffer regarding the evidence at the murder trial to be \u201cadmissible testimony\u201d at the sentencing hearing. He argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s summary of the testimony against him at the murder trial was not sufficiently reliable to be considered \u201cevidence\u201d that he committed the murder because he was denied the opportunity to confront and cross-examine those witnesses during the sentencing hearing. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">We hold that the trial court did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment when it admitted into evidence at the sentencing hearing the proffer by the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney regarding the evidence presented at the trial on the unrelated murder charge. Consistent with due process, a sentencing court \u201cis not restricted to evidence derived from the examination and cross-examination of witnesses in open court\u201d and is permitted to consider <em>\u201cresponsible unsworn </em>or \u2018out-of-court\u2019 <em>information </em>relative to the circumstances of the crime and to the convicted person\u2019s life and characteristics.\u201d <em>Williams v. Oklahoma, </em>358 U.S. at 584, 79 S.Ct. at 426 (emphasis added). As previously stated, the mere fact that appellant was not convicted of the murder charge did not constitutionally bar the trial court from considering it when determining appellant\u2019s sentence for the heroin offense. Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s proffer concerned only the <em>evidence </em>admitted at the trial on the murder charge. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>Although appellant argued that the witnesses at this trial were not credible, he did not disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s representations regarding the substance of their testimony and the other evidence at the trial. As such, we cannot say the trial court violated the Due Process Clause when it chose to rely upon the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney\u2019s \u201cresponsible unsworn\u201d proffer regarding this evidence. <em>See id. </em>at 583-84, 79 S.Ct. at 426 (holding that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s statement of the details of the crime and of the defendant\u2019s criminal record at a sentencing hearing following a guilty plea did not \u201cdeprive [the defendant] of fundamental fairness <em>or of any right of confrontation or cross-examination </em>\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the sentence imposed by the trial court following the conviction of possession of heroin with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-11\">. Appellant was charged with murdering Thomas Lee Smithers (\"victim\u201d) on October 8, 1995 (\"murder charge\u201d). A trial of appellant on the murder charge ended in a hung jury. Appellant and the Commonwealth subsequently negotiated a plea agreement, pursuant to which appellant agreed to enter a guilty plea to the murder charge on the condition that he receive a suspended sentence. The parties agreed that appellant would be sentenced for the heroin offense <em>before </em>pleading guilty to the murder charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-8\">. The two felonies are listed as \"Dist. Heroin w/Intent to Dist.\" and \"Poss.

A prior conviction obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s right to a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights when making a guilty plea also cannot be used to support guilt or enhance punishment for another offense. <em>See James v.
