For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">Following a jury trial, Michael Tracy Watkins was convicted of burglary, grand larceny, receiving stolen property and possession of burglarious tools. He was sentenced to a total of ten years incarceration and was fined $2,000. Appellant represented himself at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">The primary issue before us is whether appellant knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his right to counsel. \u201cIf the accused has not competently and intelligently waived that constitutional right, the Sixth Amendment stands as a jurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or liberty.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 116, 123, 462 S.E.2d 566, 570 (1995) (citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 468, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1024-25, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>I. WRIT OF CERTIORARI</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">After review of the record originally presented, we were unable to determine whether appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel was knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently made. The record contained an order of the trial court reflecting the events of November 22,1995, which stated that, on that date, appellant\u2019s court-appointed counsel withdrew and appellant proceeded <em>pro se.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>While the order further stated that the motions taken up that day were \u201cmore specifically set forth in the stenographic record of this case,\u201d the record transmitted to this Court contained no transcript of the November 22, 1995 hearing or any statement of facts describing the events of that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Finding that resolution of the issue before us depended on our review of the transcript from the November 22, 1995 hearing, we issued a writ of certiorari, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-675.4, to compel the clerk of the trial court to forward the missing transcript.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth filed a motion to vacate the writ, alleging that Code \u00a7 8.01-675.4 is inapplicable because appellant failed to make the missing transcript part of the record on appeal, as defined by the Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">The Commonwealth contends that Code \u00a7 8.01-675.4 allows the Court to order only portions of the appellate record as defined by the Rules of Court. <em>See </em>Rules 5A:7 and 5A:8. The Commonwealth\u2019s contention finds no support in the recent cases addressing Code \u00a7 8.01-675.4 or the parallel provision applicable in the Supreme Court, Code \u00a7 8.01-673(A). <em>See Crumble v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 231, 233, 343 S.E.2d 359, 360 (1986); <em>Buck v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 449, 453 n. *, 443 S.E.2d 414, 416 n. * (1994). In <em>Crumble, </em>a panel of this Court exercised its authority under Code \u00a7 8.01-675.4 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201cdirected the clerk of the trial court to cause that portion of the trial court record consisting of the court reporter\u2019s recordation of closing arguments to be transcribed and forwarded to us for review.\u201d In <em>Buck, </em>the Supreme Court noted that the jury list at issue in the case was \u201cnot part of the record on appeal until ... a writ of certiorari to the trial court pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-675.4 to add the list to the record on appeal ... [was] granted.\u201d Both <em>Crumble </em>and <em>Buck </em>exemplify the Supreme Court\u2019s recitation of the general rule that certiorari will lie to \u201cenlarge\u201d the record on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">After the record has been transmitted to this Court pursuant to [the Rules of Court] and an appeal has been granted, the record on appeal cannot be enlarged except by our award of a writ of certiorari under Code \u00a7 8.01-673.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>Godfrey v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 460, 465, 317 S.E.2d 781, 784 (1984); <em>see also Town of Narrows v. Clear-View Cable TV, Inc., </em>227 Va. 272, 275 n. 2, 315 S.E.2d 835, 837 n. 2 (1984); <em>Old Dominion Iron &amp; Steel Corp. v. Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co., </em>215 Va. 658, 660, 212 S.E.2d 715, 718 (1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Our decision to compel the production of the missing transcript in this case is fully supported in the case law of both this and the Supreme Court. Our ruling is also in accord with the principle that the judgment of the trial court is presumed correct and the burden is on the appellant to submit to the appellate court a record that enables the court to determine whether there has been an error. <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 630, 635, 432 S.E.2d 2, 6 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The Commonwealth\u2019s position initially fails to acknowledge that the issue before us is anything but typical. \u201cThe right to counsel ... is so fundamental to the human rights of life and liberty that its waiver is never presumed, and the \u2018courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver.\u2019 \u201d <em>Church v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 208, 215, 335 S.E.2d 823, 827 (1985); <em>see also Sargent v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 143, 149, 360 S.E.2d 895, 898 (1987). Waiver of the right to counsel cannot be assumed from a silent record. <em>Church, </em>230 Va. at 215, 335 S.E.2d at 828; <em>Sargent, </em>5 Va.App. at 149, 360 S.E.2d at 899 (\u201c \u2018Presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible. The record must show that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Ca<em>rnley v. Cochran, </em>369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S.Ct. 884, 890, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962))). Moreover, when the issue of waiver of counsel is presented, the Commonwealth bears the burden \u201cto show by the record that an accused who proceeds <em>pro se </em>has competently, intelligently, and understanding^ waived his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>21 Va.App. at 123-24, 462 S.E.2d at 570.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion, therefore, the onus of producing the missing transcript in the present case lies with the Commonwealth, not appellant. <em>Church, </em>230 Va. at 216, 335 S.E.2d at 828 (\u201cThe right to assistance of counsel is so fundamental to the integrity of the criminal justice process that we must reverse because of the fortuitous omission of that part of the record which might have demonstrated the competence of the defendant\u2019s waiver.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the absence of the November 22, 1995 transcript, the record fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>to establish that appellant knowingly, intelligently and understanding^ waived his right to counsel. We issued the writ to ensure that justice was served. The Commonwealth\u2019s motion is denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">II. WAIVER OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">In <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 194, 197, 455 S.E.2d 759, 760 (1995), we held that \u201c[t]he law requires more than the court\u2019s bare assumption that the defendant was aware of his right to counsel and knew of the pitfalls of self-representation.\u201d \u201c[A] party relying on such a waiver must prove its essentials by \u2018clear, precise and unequivocal evidence. The evidence must not leave the matter to mere inference or conjecture but must be certain in every particular.\u2019\u201d <em>Church, </em>230 Va. at 215, 335 S.E.2d at 827 (quoting <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 559, 560, 203 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201cWhether a waiver is voluntary and competent depends upon the particular circumstances of each case, including the defendant\u2019s background, experience, and conduct, but no particular cautionary instruction or form is required.\u201d <em>Church, </em>230 Va. at 215, 335 S.E.2d at 828 (citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Doe, </em>743 F.2d 1033, 1038 (4th Cir.1984). While a formal, specific inquiry on the record regarding the capability of the accused to understand and decide the issue of waiver may be the wiser practice, the absence of such a procedure is not fatal. <em>See United States v. Singleton, </em>107 F.3d 1091, 1097 (4th Cir.1997); <em>Edwards, </em>21 Va.App. at 124-25, 462 S.E.2d at 570-71 (citing <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 374-75, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 1757-59, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979), which upheld an \u201cimplicit waiver\u201d upon considering the whole record); <em>Kinard v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 524, 527, 431 S.E.2d 84, 86 (1993) (quoting <em>Doe, </em>743 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>F.2d at 1038). The required determination can be made upon considering the record as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Here, the appellant contends the trial court erred by not having him sign a form reflecting the waiver of his right to counsel and further erred by not placing on the record the \u201crequired inquiry as to defendant\u2019s need for counsel or determine on the record the defendant\u2019s decision to waive counsel was knowing and voluntary.\u201d He also contends the trial court failed to make him aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation. We find appellant\u2019s argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u201c \u2018[W]hile it is preferable practice for trial courts to warn an accused of the risks of self-representation, we believe that a cautionary instruction is only one of the \u2018facts and circumstances\u2019 relevant to a determination of the validity of a waiver of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Edwards, </em>21 Va.App. at 125, 462 S.E.2d at 571 (quoting <em>Superintendent v. Barnes, </em>221 Va. 780, 784, 273 S.E.2d 558, 561 (1981)). Furthermore, the absence of a written waiver is not determinative of the question.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Edwards, </em>21 Va.App. at 124, 462 S.E.2d at 570. Rather, applying the principles set forth in <em>Barnes, Kinard, </em>and <em>Edwards, </em>our review of the record as a whole supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>conclusion that appellant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Although the trial court did not make the searching, formal inquiry that we would prefer, the record before the trial court allowed the court to determine that appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel was knowing, voluntary and intelligent. At the hearing on November 22, 1995, at which appellant was present, appellant\u2019s counsel told the court that appellant wished to represent himself. The court reviewed the nature of the charges, and appellant\u2019s counsel discussed his preparation for trial. Appellant personally told the court that he was ready to argue his motions but that he did not want the court to hear the motions filed by his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Our confidence in appellant\u2019s understanding of the charges brought against him emerges from the fact that he prepared motions for the November 22 hearing in which he sought to have the indictments quashed. While there is no direct evidence of appellant\u2019s educational background or his understanding of the judicial process, the record makes clear that he had the capacity to and did, in fact, appreciate the judicial process and the nature of the proceedings he was electing to conduct <em>pro se. </em>Prior to his waiver of counsel, appellant personally drafted pretrial motions without the aid of his attorney, extensively citing and arguing case law and the attendant analysis of the facts. Among the many motions appellant personally drafted and filed with the court were a motion to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle and motions to dismiss the charges based on claimed violations of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, his right to a preliminary hearing, and his rights under the agreement on detainers. Appellant also drafted several discovery motions, including a motion to subpoena witnesses and a motion for funds for an investigator. These motions make it clear that he understood the importance of conducting discovery in preparation for his trial. Appellant\u2019s extensive experience with the motions he filed himself and those filed by his counsel demonstrates that appellant understood the nature of the charges brought against him, the responsibilities imposed on him while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>representing himself, and the value of being represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Finally, appellant requested the court to appoint another attorney in an advisory capacity, reflecting his understanding of the value to his defense of having specialized legal knowledge and ability in the trial of the charges against him and his understanding of the consequences of his waiver. Appellant further stated that he was \u201cready for trial\u201d and did not want a continuance. The court granted appellant\u2019s request to represent himself in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">THE COURT: If [appellant\u2019s counsel] Mr. Stith wants out of the case and his client wants him out of the case I am inclined to grant Mr. Stith\u2019s motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">[THE COMMONWEALTH]: I don\u2019t have a problem with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">THE COURT: I will grant counsel\u2019s motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-8\">THE DEFENDANT: That\u2019s appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Finally, the court granted appellant\u2019s request for advisory counsel and stated to appellant\u2019s new counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">It may develop that you would be counsel in the case, but at least at this point you would be appointed to assist the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-11\">I think in every respect he needs a lawyer. He is not a lawyer himself. I would hope that he will be able to recognize your skills and that they could be put to use to his benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">While the better practice would have been for the trial court to have conducted a systematic review of the defendant\u2019s competent, knowing and voluntary waiver of this important right, we find under the circumstances of this case that appellant\u2019s waiver was knowing, voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">III. APPELLANT\u2019S RIGHT TO SPEEDY TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">There is no dispute that August 31,1995 is the date of appellant\u2019s \u201carrest\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 19.2-243, and of his \u201carrival\u201d in Virginia, for purposes of the agreement on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>detainers. Code \u00a7 53.1-210, Art. IV(e). Further, there is no dispute that Code \u00a7 19.2-243 required the Commonwealth to try appellant within five months of his arrest and that the agreement on detainers required the Commonwealth to try appellant within 120 days of his arrival in Virginia. Appellant was tried on February 5, 1996, 158 days, or five months and six days, following his arrest and arrival in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Both Code \u00a7 19.2-243 and the agreement on detainers provide for tolling of the time limits they prescribe. Under Code \u00a7 19.2-243(4), the five-month prescription is tolled upon the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">continuance granted on the motion of the accused or his counsel, or by concurrence of the accused or his counsel in such a motion by the attorney for the Commonwealth, or by the failure of the accused or his counsel to make a timely objection to such a motion by the attorney for the Commonwealth ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Under the agreement on detainers, the court, for good cause shown, may grant any \u201cnecessary or reasonable continuance,\u201d and extend the 120 day period. Code \u00a7 53.1-210(IV)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">In the present case, trial was originally set for October 25, 1995. At a motions hearing held one week before trial was scheduled to begin, appellant requested additional time to prepare pretrial motions. The defense was fully aware that a continuance on the motions would require a continuance of the trial. Upon appellant\u2019s motion for additional time, the trial date was continued until December 5, 1995. On December 5, 1995, the defense again requested and was granted a continuance, this time until January 22, 1996, to prepare for trial. Trial was again continued on motion of both parties from January 22, 1996 until February 5, 1996, the date on which it was finally held. In sum, the entire delay in the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to try appellant from October 25, 1995 until February 5, 1996 was attributable to or acquiesced in by the defense. Accordingly, none of that time is properly considered in computing whether appellant was tried within the prescriptions of Code \u00a7 19.2-243 and the agreement on de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tainers. <em>See Price v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 785, 789-90, 485 S.E.2d 655, 656 (1997); <em>Jefferson v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 652, 656, 479 S.E.2d 80, 81-82 (1996). The relevant time period under both sections is the period from August 31, 1995 to October 25, 1995. The trial took place well within the time prescriptions of both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">IV. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMA\">Code \u00a7 18.2-94 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">If any person have in his possession any tools, implements or outfit, with intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny, upon such conviction thereof he shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony. The possession of such burglarious tools, implements or outfit by any person other than a licensed dealer, shall be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of an intent to commit burglary, robbery or larceny.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The tools at issue in the present case are those which were contained in the \u201cpouch\u201d of tools found in the van. Appellant does not dispute that the tools at issue are \u201cburglarious tools\u201d within the meaning of the statute. He contends, rather, that the evidence is insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding that he possessed the tools with intent to commit burglary. We disagree.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">Where the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, that evidence must be construed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. In so doing, we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-9\"><em>Cirios v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 292, 295, 373 S.E.2d 164, 165 (1988) (citations omitted). The jury\u2019s verdict will not be set aside unless it appears to be plainly wrong or -without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680; <em>Traverso v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 172, 176, 366 S.E.2d 719, 721 (1988). \u201c \u2018[T]he credibility of witnesses and the weight accorded their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>testimony are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses.\u2019 \u201d <em>Collins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 177, 179, 409 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1991) (quoting <em>Schneider v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 379, 382, 337 S.E.2d 735, 736-37 (1985)). Where the trier of fact finds a defendant\u2019s testimony to be incredible, it is entitled to infer that the defendant lied to conceal his guilt. <em>See Speight v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1987) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Appellant contends the evidence fails to support a finding that he possessed the burglarious tools. The tools were found near the front and between the seats of the van that appellant drove. Although the remaining items in the van were identified as stolen, no one else claimed ownership of the pouch of burglarious tools. Appellant further contends that there was no evidence that the tools were actually used in either of the break-ins. To the contrary, however, the evidence showed that the lock on the door to the truck rental shop had been pried open with a device similar to one of the tools found in the pouch. Furthermore, the statute does not require that the tools actually be used in the burglary, only that they be possessed with intent to commit burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The evidence of appellant\u2019s intent to commit burglary was overwhelming. The police spotted appellant near the scene of a reported burglary, driving a van matching the description of the van used in the burglary. Appellant attempted to elude the police in a high speed chase that eventually ended with appellant\u2019s arrest. At the station house, appellant reported that he was \u201cdoing his job\u201d when the police caught him. In the van, the police found items stolen from the residence that was the subject of the burglary report, as well as items stolen from a truck rental shop the day before. Finally, the jury was entitled to disbelieve appellant\u2019s description of his role in the police chase and to infer that appellant was lying to conceal his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">For the reasons stated here, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-8\">. The order reflected that another attorney was appointed to assist the defense in a procedural capacity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b386-9\">. Code \u00a7 8.01-675.4 provides that this Court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-10\">in any case, after reasonable notice to counsel in the appellate court, award a writ of certiorari to the clerk of the trial court and have brought before it, when part of a record is omitted, the whole or any part of such record.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\">. Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion, <em>Godfrey </em>and <em>Old Dominion Iron </em>were reversed because a writ of certiorari was not employed to enlarge the record, not simply because the record itself was enlarged. The rule of those cases precludes the enlarging of the record by means other than the writ of certiorari; it does not preclude the enlarging of the record <em>per se. </em>To the extent <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, 216 </em>Va. 185, 188-89, 217 S.E.2d 815, 819-20 (1975), can be read to support a contrary conclusion, as the Commonwealth suggests, the Supreme Court's more recent recitation of the scope of the writ overrules it, albeit implicitly. We further note that <em>Washington </em>is not cited in any of the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent cases addressing the writ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b388-6\">. The Commonwealth suggests that <em>Church </em>is distinguishable because the proceeding in <em>Church, </em>unlike the relevant proceeding here, was unrecorded, and, thus, a transcript \"could not have been prepared for inclusion in the record.\u201d We find that a distinction without meaning. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument fails to address the availability of a Statement of Facts to reflect an unrecorded hearing. Moreover, as the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Church </em>makes clear, the relevant consideration is not why the record is silent, but that it is.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b389-8\">.
