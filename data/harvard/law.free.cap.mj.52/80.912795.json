She had been strangled and battered, and her throat had been cut all the way to her backbone.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-20\">Agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) interviewed appellant, along with numerous other witnesses and possible suspects, because he had been reported knocking on doors in the women\u2019s barracks around 2:00 on the morning of the murder. After waiving his rights under Article 31, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 831, and being interrogated for about 2 hours, appellant admitted that he entered BG\u2019s room in search of a sexual liaison, strangled her, knocked her head against the floor and left the room, leaving BG unconscious on the floor. Concerned about being in trouble as soon as BG regained consciousness, appellant returned to his room, obtained a knife, and cut her throat several times, stopping only after he \u201cfelt something hard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-21\">Appellant signed and swore to his written confession, consented to a search of his room and his car, and provided hair and fluid samples. Shortly thereafter, appellant re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>peated his confession in detail and, using an NCIS agent as a \u201cdummy,\u201d demonstrated how he choked and battered BG and cut her throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Appellant\u2019s confession was corroborated by physical and testimonial evidence. The NCIS found small droplets of blood, consistent with BG\u2019s but not with appellant\u2019s, on appellant\u2019s shoes. They found two hairs that were \u201cconsistent with\u201d appellant\u2019s on a chair near BG\u2019s body. They found a bloodstain on appellant\u2019s sweatshirt, but they could not determine if it was human or animal blood. In appellant\u2019s car the NCIS found a knife that tested \u201cpresumptively positive\u201d for blood. They found BG\u2019s shirt in a nearby dumpster, where appellant said he threw it after he cut it off her body. Finally, the confession was corroborated by a witness from an adjoining room, who testified that he heard a muffled scream and several thuds at about 2:30 a.m. 47 MJ at 673-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>Issue I: Cross-examination of Serologist</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A99\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Chief Warrant Officer 4 (CW04) Werner, a forensic serologist from the United States Army Criminal Investigation laboratory, Fort Gillem, Georgia, testified about two hairs found on a chair next to BG\u2019s body that were \u201cconsistent with\u201d appellant\u2019s. On cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to ask CW04 Werner if he agreed with the opinion of Michael Odell, a fellow forensic serologist at the laboratory. In an unrelated court-martial, Mr. Odell had testified that \u201chair is not a very definitive piece of evidence.\u201d The military judge sustained the Government\u2019s objection to the question. He told defense counsel: \u2018You can ask him what his opinion is but not ask him his opinion of somebody else just in an effort to get in that other person\u2019s opinion in to court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">Appellant asserts that the purpose of the question was to test CW04 Werner\u2019s opinion regarding the scientific reliability of hair-comparison evidence. The Government asserts that Mr. Odell\u2019s testimony in an unrelated court-martial was inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">We review the military judge\u2019s ruling on admissibility of evidence for \u201cclear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>46 MJ 8, 10 (1997). A military judge has broad discretion to prevent a party from smuggling inadmissible hearsay into the case under the guise of testing the basis for expert testimony. <em>See United States v. Stark, </em>24 MJ 381, 384-85 (CMA 1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1026, 108 S.Ct. 750, 98 L.Ed.2d 763 (1988). In this case, the military judge did not inhibit appellant\u2019s ability to test the basis for CW04 Werner\u2019s testimony by cross-examination, reference to treatises, periodicals or other writings under Mil.R.Evid. 803(18), Manual, <em>swpra, </em>or by calling other experts, including Mr. Odell, to point out the weaknesses and limitations of hair analysis. We hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\n<em>Issue II: Testimony about Truthfulness of the Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">The defense theory was that appellant\u2019s purported confession was unreliable. This theory was announced in the defense opening statement. It was developed during the defense cross-examination of Special Agent (SA) Young, who obtained a written statement from appellant. It was supported by expert testimony from two Navy psychiatrists, who testified that appellant had \u201cextremely low self-esteem,\u201d that he was \u201csuffering from an alcohol-induced blackout on the night\u201d of the murder, and that \u201che could not possibly have remembered all the details\u201d set out in his confession. They opined that \u201cappellant simply adopted the facts\u201d suggested by the NCIS agents, a process known as \u201csuggestibility\u201d or \u201cconfabulation.\u201d 47 MJ at 674. Finally, the defense theory of confabulation was argued at length in the defense closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-13\">The granted issue arises from the cross-examination and redirect examination of SA Young. Defense counsel extensively cross-examined SA Young about interrogation techniques, the psychological pressures exerted on persons being interrogated, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>inhibiting circumstances inherent in any interrogation. He questioned SA Young extensively about his failure to make a videotape or audiotape of appellant\u2019s interrogation and about his failure to include certain facts contained in the interview notes in appellant\u2019s written confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">Defense counsel established that SA Young had learned many of the facts surrounding the murder before he interrogated appellant. In response to questioning, SA Young denied suggesting that appellant had left fingerprints in the room or that he had entertained certain sexual thoughts. SA Young denied telling appellant that he was \u201cfacing the death penalty\u201d or that \u201cit would go easier on him\u201d if he confessed. SA Young denied feeding appellant information about the murder or asking him leading questions. Defense counsel concluded his cross-examination of SA Young by asking the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Q. You are familiar with the concept that if someone is to confess to something, you must have some corroboration that the person committed the crime?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">A. Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Q. Isn\u2019t it true, sir, that the reason behind that rule is that people do make false confessions?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">A. Yes, sir. In this case, he provided us information that only \u2014 that I didn\u2019t know. Q. That\u2019s your opinion, sir?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">A. Yes, sir, that\u2019s my opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Q. Part of the reasons these people might make false confessions is because of the interrogation techniques and the pressure on them during that interrogation?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">A. I don\u2019t know that, sir. I don\u2019t think this was a false confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">Q. Would you be embarrassed if it was? A. Would I be embarrassed?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Q. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">A. Yes, sir, I would. I sure would.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">During trial counsel\u2019s redirect examination of SA Young, he elicited the following testimony:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">Q. Defense was also asking you about false confessions; and in your 27 years as an officer, you\u2019ve done several hundred interrogations.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-19\">During this interrogation of Lance Corporal Schlamer, did it appear to you that he was making\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b277-20\">CC: (Mr. McNeil): Objection, Your Hon- or. Speculation, ultimate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-21\">MJ: Overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-22\">Questions by the assistant trial counsel:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-23\">Q. Did it appear to you that he was making this information up?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-24\">A. No, sir, it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-25\">Q. Prosecution Exhibit 5, based on the way the interview was conducted and how he appeared, do you think this is a false confession?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-26\">A. Absolutely not, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-27\">Although defense counsel had objected to a question on the ground that it called for a speculative answer, he did not object to the question and answer regarding a \u201cfalse confession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-28\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-29\">Appellant first asserts that defense counsel\u2019s objection to speculative testimony was sufficient to preserve the issue. Appellant then concedes that any error in permitting SA Young to testify that appellant\u2019s confession was not false was an \u201cevidentiary error,\u201d not error \u201cof constitutional dimension.\u201d Final Brief at 26. Appellant argues that SA Young\u2019s testimony \u201cwas tantamount to testifying that Appellant was truthful in his confession,\u201d thus violating the prohibition against \u201chuman lie-detector\u201d testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 28. The Government argues that the objection was not preserved for appellate review, and in any event, any error was harmless. Answer to Final Brief at 14,15.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-30\">We agree with the Government that defense counsel\u2019s objection to speculative testimony was not sufficient to preserve his objection to \u201chuman lie-detector\u201d testimony. Thus, we review for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-31\">To overcome waiver, appellant must convince us that (1) there was error; (2) that it was plain or obvious; and (3) that the error materially prejudiced a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>right. <em>United States v. Powell, </em>49 MJ 460, 463 (1998). We will reverse for plain error only if the error had \u201can unfair prejudicial impact\u201d on the findings or sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Both sides treated SA Young as an expert within the meaning of Mil.R.Evid. 702, based on his training and extensive experience. It is well settled that an expert may not opine that an out-of-court declaration is true. <em>See United States v. Hill-Dunning, </em>26 MJ 260, 262 (CMA), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 967, 109 S.Ct. 494, 102 L.Ed.2d 531 (1988); <em>United States v. Petersen, </em>24 MJ 283, 284-85 (CMA 1987). On the other hand, this Court has recognized that a defense theory of coached responses to questioning may open the door to prosecution rebuttal. <em>See United States v. Cacy, </em>43 MJ 214, 218 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The defense cross-examination of SA Young clearly suggested that he had obtained a falsp confession by creating an intimidating environment, using leading questions, and suggesting facts to a suggestible suspect. The term, \u201cfalse confessions\u201d was introduced during the defense cross-examination. When trial counsel asked SA Young on redirect if he obtained a \u201cfalse confession,\u201d it was clear from the context that he was asking if SA Young had employed any of the techniques suggested by the defense. While it may have been improper to ask SA Young if \u201cthis [wa]s a false confession,\u201d we hold that it did not rise to the level of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\n<em>Issue III: Challenges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AMr\">\n<em>Challenge of Staff Sergeant B</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ad-dedup-0\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Before trial, each panel member was asked to complete a comprehensive 19-page questionnaire. Appellant asserts that his challenge of Staff Sergeant (SSgt) B should have been granted, because of her answers to these three questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">(1) In Question 6-J, she was asked, \u201cDo you believe that an accused in a criminal case should testify or produce some evidence to prove that he or she is not guilty?\u201d She responded, \u2018Tes,\u201d and explained, \u201cIn any situation there are always two sides, therefore both sides should be heard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">(2) In Question 56, she was asked, \u201cDo you believe the courts deal with criminals too severely or not severely enough?\u201d She responded, \u201cNot severely enough.\u201d She explained, \u201cThere should be a set punishment for a set crime. \u2018An eye for an eye.\u2019 Example: Rape \u2014 castration. Theft \u2014 remove hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">(3) In Question 62, she was asked, \u201cWhat is your general feeling about the death penalty?\u201d She responded, \u201cIf you take a life, you owe a life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">In other parts of the questionnaire, SSgt B revealed that she had no legal training (Question 4D) and no legal experience (Question 5C). At the time of appellant\u2019s trial, she had never served as a member of a court-martial or as a juror in a civilian trial (Questions 6B, 6C, and 6D). She had never \u201cbeen a witness in any investigation, a court-martial or a civilian court.\u201d (Question 13)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-15\">She responded that she did not \u201cpersonally know any lawyers who practice criminal law, whether as a defense attorney or as a prosecutor.\u201d (Question 36) When asked \u201cthe first thing that comes to your mind when you think of a prosecuting attorney?\u201d, she responded, \u201cIntense.\u201d (Question 38) Asked the same question about a defense attorney, she responded, \u201cMatlock.\u201d (Question 39)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-16\">Regarding her personal beliefs, SSgt B responded that she strongly agrees with the statement, \u201cAn accused is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Question 6-1-1) She strongly disagrees with the statement, \u201cRegardless of what the law says, an accused in a criminal trial should be required to prove his or her innocence.\u201d (Question 6-1-4) She was asked her opinion of the State of California\u2019s decision not to seek the death penalty for O.J. Simpson, and she responded, \u201cThe punishment should fit the crime for everyone.\u201d (Question 75)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">During voir dire, SSgt B was extensively questioned about her responses to Questions 6-J, 56, and 62. Regarding question 6-J, she responded as follows to questions from the military judge (MJ):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>MJ: Looking at your questionnaire, I noticed that one of the questions was: Do you believe that an accused in a criminal case should testify or produce some evidence to prove that he or she is not guilty. And you wrote: Yes. In any situation, there are always two sides, therefore, both sides should be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">You heard me earlier saying that there\u2019s no requirement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">MJ: \u2014for the accused to testify on his own behalf. Of course, he can do so if he wants to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">MJ: And you understand that the burden is on the Government to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acu\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">MJ: Would you hold it against Lance Corporal Schlamer if he did not take the stand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-11\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-12\">MJ: You wouldn\u2019t hold it against, him at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-13\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir, I would not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-14\">MJ: If the Government failed to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, could you vote for not guilty even if Lance Corporal Schlamer did not take the stand and testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-15\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir, I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ4\">MJ: Would you have a problem with that at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-16\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir, I would not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">Trial counsel (TC) followed up with additional voir dire about Question 6-J, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-18\">TC: What I assume you\u2019re meaning by that [appellant not testifying], and as you\u2019ve explained, is that it sounds like you\u2019re trying to be fair. If the accused wants to present some evidence and has a side of a story, you believe they should be allowed to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-19\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Exactly, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-20\">TC: But what we need to check on \u2014 as the judge has already kind of asked \u2014 is that because of that belief, especially when you say there\u2019s two sides to every story, you need to understand that you can\u2019t anticipate or hold the accused to any requirement to tell his side of the story?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-22\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir, I do understand that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-23\">TC: So you understand that the accused has an absolute right to remain silent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-24\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): I understand that, and I understand that the accused is also innocent until proven guilty, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-25\">TC: And you understand that the burden to prove that guilt rests with the Government\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-26\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-27\">TC: \u2014and it never shifts over. Even at the end of our case, there\u2019s no requirement that any evidence or any telling of the other side of the story ever has to come from the defense. Do you understand this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-28\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): I understand that, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-29\">TC: So it\u2019s fair to say that when you are answering those questions, you were basically saying that if the accused had something to present, you certainly wouldn\u2019t want to interfere with his opportunity to do so, but you aren\u2019t going to require the accused to present any evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-30\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Exactly, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-31\">Defense counsel did not question SSgt B about Question 6-J.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-32\">Regarding Questions 56 and 62, the military judge conducted the following voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-33\">MJ: ... There was a question on the questionnaire about: Do you believe that the courts deal with criminals too severely or not severely enough. And you wrote: Not severely enough. I might add, like, virtually all the other court members have. You said: There should be a set punishment for a set crime. An eye for an eye; example, rape, castration; theft, remove hand. That seems awfully severe. Do you believe there should be a sentencing session where we hear further evidence about the crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir, I do. Could you explain that a little bit more, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\">MJ: Well, you wrote that you believe there should be a set punishment for a set crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Based on all the facts, sir, yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">MJ: Well, for example, in the military, when someone\u2019s convicted of a crime, then we have another sentencing session right after that where both sides can introduce additional evidence that was not relevant to the crime itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">In other words, the members can consider the circumstances of the crime, but they can also get to consider other things. Like the Government might bring in that an individual was previously convicted of other offenses. The defense might bring in that there were extenuating circumstances as to the crime or that he has a family, et cetera. Then the members may decide on a sentence after that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Sir, like you said on the. maximum penalty, one could be death, and one could be life imprisonment. Those are based on all the facts, not just the preliminary facts. I\u2019m talking about when a judgment is passed, it should be based on all the facts down to the last fact, not just the preliminary facts; that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-9\">MJ: It is unusual in the military or, in fact, in any system to have a minimum sentence that must be adjudged. But for particularly serious offenses, in this case premeditated murder or felony murder, we have that situation that you just repeated to me; and that\u2019s the situation where even if the death penalty is not adjudged, the accused must receive a mandatory life imprisonment. But ordinarily \u2014 that\u2019s what I was talking about \u2014 in a court-martial, there\u2019s no minimum sentence. So for example, if someone were convicted of rape, they could get a sentence from no punishment to all the way up to life imprisonment. So if you were the juror or court members in a rape case, would you automatically have already decided what the punishment would be before you hear all the extenuating circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-11\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir. Maybe I didn\u2019t answer that question very clearly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS0G\">MJ: Can you explain any more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-12\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): What I mean is regardless of who a person is, whether \u2014 or position, they should all be judged equally across the board; but if they\u2019re a celebrity or just a common person, the punishment should be based on all the facts, not just any preliminary facts for everyone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-13\">MJ: So you think it should be fairly adjudged for all people regardless of their station in life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-14\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-15\">MJ: But would you \u2014 but does that also mean that you would automatically impose certain punishments without listening to all the facts and circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-16\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-17\">MJ: Now, we don\u2019t have, obviously, castration or removal of hands or any of those things as legitimate sentences. We do have the possibility of the death penalty which is obviously more severe than any of that. You also wrote on the question regarding the death penalty: If you take a life, you owe a life. And you wrote that you had held that opinion for 10 years since you came from a sheltered life in the Marine Corps. Does that mean that you would automatically adjudge the death penalty in this case if the accused is convicted of premeditated or felony murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL6j\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Based on all the facts, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-18\">MJ: So the answer then was, no, you would not automatically do that? I\u2019ve asked a backwards question, haven\u2019t I? Let me ask it again. Have you already decided what the punishment would be if you convict the accused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-19\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir, I have not. I don\u2019t know all the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-20\">MJ: So you\u2019d be willing to listen to everything before you make the decision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3u\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Sir, that would be part of my responsibility to listen to all the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAFLO\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>MJ: I think that all of us would have some concern about your \u2014 what you wrote here about a set punishment for a set crime. So let me just get back to it one more time. We don\u2019t have set punishments for set crimes with the exception, and it is a major exception, that there\u2019s a minimum sentence of life imprisonment if an individual is convicted of felony murder or premeditated murder; but there is no set penalty of the death penalty, for example.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjG\">And if the accused is not convict[ed] of premeditated or felony murder, then, for example, unpremeditated murder, the members could decide anything from no punishment all the way up to life imprisonment. So there\u2019s no set punishment with that one exception.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): I understand that, sir. But even those punishments are based on all the facts. There\u2019s still the minimum; there\u2019s still the maximum; and they\u2019re both based on all the facts. Like you said, even if you find somebody guilty, then you have additional information given, and there\u2019s one or two roads you can take either way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">:\u25a0{ <em>ifc </em>:j&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">MJ: Are you open-minded then on the issue of whether the accused should or should not receive a death penalty or life imprisonment if he\u2019s convicted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-10\">MJ: Have you made up your mind in that regard at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-11\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir, I have not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Trial counsel continued the <em>voir dire </em>regarding SSgt B\u2019s attitude about punishment in the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-13\">I think we discussed \u2014 you discussed with the military judge fairly extensively that you\u2019d said in your questionnaire that there should be a set punishment for a set crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-14\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-15\">TC: And if I interpreted your responses correctly, it sounds like that was more born out of some frustration you might have had with civilian cases or whatever where you hear about convicts getting off too lightly. Was that kind of what you were talking about there? In other words, that because there is sometimes some misuse of the range of punishments and you hear about people getting off with too light of a sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-18\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir. My opinion \u2014 or my answer was based on that it appears, from what I hear \u2014 because I have not sat down and watched the O.J. Simpson case or whatever, is that someone that popular is being very publicized, but yet, someone else\u2019s crime is equivalent, you don\u2019t even hear about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-19\">TC: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-20\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): That\u2019s what I\u2019m basing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-21\">TC: So a lot of this is because of the O.J. Simpson circumstances that is driving some of your thoughts about when you talk about punishment in general?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-22\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): No, sir, not at all. What I \u2014 okay. What I mean \u2014 let me clarify this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-23\">TC: Please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-24\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): Is that there is already a set punishment. There\u2019s a minimum; there\u2019s a maximum; and they\u2019re both based on facts completely. And that\u2019s exactly what I mean. There\u2019s no\u2014 before an outcome comes or a finally \u2014 all the facts are presented, nothing should be ruled out. Everything should be just left and set and then all the facts should come into play afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-25\">TC: Okay.

But in the actual case, the law provides that you will get instructions from the military judge, and you will have heard all the evidence before you have to make any choice regarding punishment.

From your responses in the questionnaire and what you just told me, would I be correct in assuming that there could be circumstances \u2014 in other words, after you\u2019ve heard all the evidence that relate to the circumstances of the case, there could be circumstances where you feel that the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-22\">MEMBER (SSGT [B]): If you\u2019re asking me if the possibility exists, yes, sir, it does. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>The possibility exists in anything, and also the possibility exists that there would not be a death sentence but imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">TC: ...

Counsel argued that \u201cwe\u2019ve never seen something that extreme regarding her feelings about punishments for certain crimes.\u201d The military judge denied the challenge. He explained, \u201cI listened to her, talked to her, and I heard her answers to both counsel. And although I certainly gave her every opportunity, and I know Mr. McNeil [civilian defense counsel] did, too, to allow her the opportunity to say that she had already made up her mind. On her own, she clearly stated that she had not. I completely believe her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-17\">The defense then exercised a peremptory challenge against SSgt B. Defense counsel preserved the issue for appeal by announcing that, if the challenge for cause had not been denied, he would have used the peremptory challenge against some other member.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-18\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b284-19\">Appellant asserts that SSgt B\u2019s responses to Question 6-J reflects a belief that an accused- should testify, and her responses to Questions 56 and 62 reflect Draconian sentencing beliefs. Appellant argues that she adhered to those views during <em>voir dire </em>and only \u201cappeared to back off her beliefs\u201d because of \u201cthe extensive rehabilitation by the Military Judge and trial counsel.\u201d Final Brief at 32. The Government argues that SSgt B\u2019s answers on <em>voir dire </em>explained her views and made clear that the accused should be given the opportunity \u201cto tell his side if he so desires,\u201d but that she strongly believed in the presumption of innocence, could follow the military judge\u2019s instructions, \u201cand would not \u2018hold it against [appellant] if he did not\u2019 \u201d testify. Answer to Final Brief at 18. The Government further argues that her answers during <em>voir dire </em>reflected an open mind on sentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 20. Accordingly, the Government asserts that the military judge did not clearly abuse his discretion by denying the challenge for cause. <em>Id. </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-20\">ROM 912(f)(l)(N) requires that a court member \u201cbe excused for cause whenever it appears that the member ... [s]hould not sit as a member in the interest of having the court-martial free from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality.\u201d This rule includes challenges for actual bias as well as implied bias. <em>United States v. Napoleon, </em>46 MJ 279, 283, <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 953, 118 S.Ct. 375, 139 L.Ed.2d 292 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-21\">Mere distaste for certain offenses is not automatically disqualifying. <em>United States v. Bannwarth, </em>36 MJ 265, 268 (CMA 1993). The test for actual bias is whether it \u201cis such that it will not yield to the evidence presented and the judge\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>Napoleon, supra </em>at 283, quoting <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>v. Reynolds, </em>28 MJ 292, 294 (CMA 1987). Because an accused \u201chas only a single peremptory challenge, challenges for cause are to be liberally granted.\u201d <em>United States v. Glenn, </em>25 MJ 278, 279 (CMA 1987) (citation omitted). \u201cThe question of actual bias \u2018is essentially one of credibility and therefore largely one of demeanor\u2019 thus a \u201cmilitary judge enjoys \u2018great deference because we recognize that he has observed the demeanor of the participants in the <em>voir dire </em>and challenge process.\u2019\u201d <em>Napoleon, supra </em>at 283. We will overturn a military judge\u2019s ruling on a challenge for actual bias \u201conly if we find a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>36 MJ 284, 287 (CMA 1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1090, 114 S.Ct. 918, 127 L.Ed.2d 212 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">While actual bias is viewed subjectively, \u201cthrough the eyes of the military judge or the court members,\u201d implied bias is viewed objectively, \u201cthrough the eyes of the public.\u201d There is implied bias \u201cwhen most people in the same position would be prejudiced.\u201d <em>United States v. Daulton, </em>45 MJ 212, 217 (1996). Questions \u201cof implied bias are reviewed under a somewhat less deferential standard.\u201d <em>Napoleon, supra </em>at 283. We focus \u201con the perception or appearance of fairness of the military justice system.\u201d <em>United States v. Dale, </em>42 MJ 384, 386 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Applying the foregoing principles, we hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the challenge of SSgt B. With respect to question 6-J, SSgt B made clear that her answer on the questionnaire meant only that she thought an accused ought to have the opportunity to be heard, but that she would not draw an adverse inference if the accused elected not to testify or present evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">With respect to questions 56 and 62, pertaining to her sentencing philosophy, her answers clearly reflect her willingness to follow the military judge\u2019s instructions, her open mind on sentencing, and her concern with individualized sentencing \u201cbased on all the facts.\u201d She answered the questionnaire without benefit of any legal training, legal experience, or instructions from the military judge. As elicited by defense counsel, she answered the questions from the perspective of a lawmaker, stating what she thought the maximum punishment should be. Her answers on <em>voir dire </em>clearly reflect acceptance of the proposition that \u201cthere\u2019s a minimum; there\u2019s a maximum,\u201d with the actual sentence being determined \u201cbased on all the facts.\u201d In response to questioning by defense counsel, she unequivocally stated that she would not automatically vote for the death penalty and would not make up her mind until she had \u201call the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">While SSgt B may have tough views on sentencing, she did not show any inflexibility. An inflexible member is disqualified; a tough member is not. <em>See United States v. Bannwarth, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">SSgt B\u2019s responses on question 56 were out of line with the maximum penalties for rape and larceny, but her response to question 62 was consistent with Article 118 and paragraph 43e(l), Part IV, Manual, <em>supra. </em>Since rape and larceny were not charged, her views about punishment for those offenses were less significant than her views about murder. Even with respect to rape and larceny, her responses show willingness to follow instructions about the minimum and maximum and to assess punishment based on \u201call the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">SSgt B did not provide monosyllabic responses acquiescing to leading questions from trial counsel or the military judge. <em>Cf. United States v. Harris, </em>13 MJ 288, 292 (CMA 1982) (opinion of Fletcher, J.) (\u201cmere declarations of impartiality\u201d not sufficient). She was not pushed by either the military judge or trial counsel into giving the \u201ccorrect\u201d answers on <em>voir dire. </em>To the contrary, she gave thoughtful answers, frequently disagreeing with her questioners or explaining her responses. The military judge specifically commented on SSgt B\u2019s credibility, saying: \u201cI believe her.\u201d His assessment of her credibility is entitled to great deference. We hold that he did not abuse his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">On the question of implied bias, we likewise hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion. It is clear from the record of trial that SSgt B\u2019s responses on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>questionnaire did not accurately reflect her views. While those responses might cause concern if considered standing alone, they would not cause a reasonable person to question the fairness of the proceedings, when considered in the context of the entire record, including her thoughtful and forthright responses on <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\n<em>Challenge of First Lieutenant H</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">In his pretrial questionnaire, First Lieutenant (1st Lt) H disclosed that he had received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) for destruction of government property. (Question 14) During <em>voir dire, </em>1st Lt H was questioned about the incident. He stated that it occurred in January of 1990, 5 years and 3 months before appellant\u2019s court-martial. Defense counsel asked 1st Lt H how he felt about his experience, and he responded, \u201cIt was one I hope I never go through again, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Trial counsel asked 1st Lt H the following questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">TC: If I judged your reaction to the question properly, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking, it appeared to be something that understandably affected you going through that office hours; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">MEMBER (1STLT [H]): Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">TC: Do you think the matter was handled fairly by the CO [commanding officer] at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">MEMBER (1STLT [H]): At the time, I felt I shouldn\u2019t be there, sir. In retrospect, I think it was the right decision for the CO to make; and I think that it brought me to an awareness of my driving habits that was like a slap in the face when I needed that.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-11\">TC: So as you sit back and reflect on it now, you think that the punishment that was imposed was appropriate?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">MEMBER (1STLT [H]): Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">TC: Now, you understand that, obviously,</p>\n<p id=\"ae-dedup-0\">NJP is different than a general court-martial. Do you think that looking into your own thoughts and mind that as you\u2019re sitting in this court you may have some thoughts back to when you were facing potential punishment and that might make it difficult for you to render a decision in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">MEMBER (1STLT [H]): No, sir. It was an entirely different situation, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-17\">TC: Do you feel comfortable sitting in judgment of another even though you weren\u2019t too comfortable while you were being judged yourself?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-18\">MEMBER (1STLT [H]): I wouldn\u2019t say I feel comfortable in it, sir. I feel it\u2019s a duty that I\u2019ve been assigned, and I\u2019ll carry out that duty if I\u2019m a member of the board, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-19\">TC: I\u2019m just wondering if you have any \u2014 I understand that. Obviously, the commanding general said you\u2019re going to be here. The presumption is that you\u2019re going to want to be here. I\u2019m looking for\u2014 to see if you have any hesitation about sitting in that position. I\u2019m not saying that that makes you inappropriate or anything. I\u2019m just seeing if you have any personal concerns about that based on your own history?</p>\n<p id=\"b286-20\">MBR (1STLT [H]): No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-21\">Trial counsel challenged 1st Lt H \u201cbased on his potential for ... overidentification with the accused.\u201d Trial counsel acknowledged that 1st Lt H gave appropriate responses on <em>voir dire, </em>but argued that \u201chis body language and his immediate responses\u201d made it \u201cclear that he felt that he had been at least wrongfully accused or shouldn\u2019t have been at that sort of punishment; and it appears that it would be difficult for someone to set that kind of thought aside when dealing in a case of this magnitude and hearing possible evidence that someone else is wrongfully accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-22\">Defense counsel opposed the challenge, arguing that \u201cit seems clear that he\u2019s embarrassed by that, but he certainly didn\u2019t hold it against the Government.\u201d The military judge denied the challenge. Later, after ruling on several other challenges, the military judge reconsidered his ruling and noted that 1st Lt H \u201cdid give some conflicting answers as well regarding his prior NJP, although he ended up saying that he thought the CO did the right thing.\u201d After giving defense counsel opportunity to argue further in opposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>to the challenge, the military judge granted the challenge. He explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">I do find that he himself, being a participant in an NJP and he thought it was unfair at the time that it happened, even though later, upon reflection, I guess as he got older, thought it might be the best thing, causes me to believe that he cannot be fair and impartial in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Appellant now asserts that the military judge abused his discretion by granting the challenge of 1st Lt H over defense objection. Appellant argues that the military judge acted inconsistently. He asserts that \u201cif he allowed [the] challenge of 1st Lt H, he should also have granted the challenge for cause against SSgt B.\u201d Final Brief at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">We hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion. Trial counsel expressed concern about 1st Lt H\u2019s body language and his responses. Defense counsel conceded that 1st Lt H appeared embarrassed. The military judge, after reflection, became concerned about 1st Lt H\u2019s reaction to his nonjudicial punishment. The military judge was in the best position to judge demeanor and credibility. <em>See United States v. McLaren, </em>38 MJ 112,118 (CMA 1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1112, 114 S.Ct. 1056, 127 L.Ed.2d 377 (1994). We will not reverse his judgment in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>52 MJ at 93. In our view, the military judge, having heard 1st Lt H\u2019s responses and observed his demeanor, acted consistently with the liberal-grant mandate. <em>See United States v. Glenn, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">Implicit in appellant\u2019s argument is an assertion that the military judge was biased in his treatment of challenges. Appellant appears to argue that the military judge was liberal in granting government challenges but stingy in granting defense challenges. We note, however, that the defense did not challenge the military judge for cause. <em>See </em>ROM 902(d)(1). On the record before us, we are satisfied that the military judge was not biased.</p>\n<p id=\"Af4\">\n<em>Issue IV: Admission of Poem and Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-12\">Appellant made a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the court members from receiving evidence about a \u201cpoem\u201d or letter seized from appellant\u2019s room, and from hearing testimony about two graphic photographs that appellant had displayed in his barracks room at the time of the murder. The \u201cpoem\u201d was a rambling half-page typewritten document glorifying heavy consumption of beer and committing violent acts against women, including murder, mutilation, aggravated assault, and sexual intercourse with dead women. 47 MJ at 680. The photographs were described by witnesses but could not be found at the time of trial. One photograph depicted a woman with a pair of forceps or scissors stuck through her eyes; the other depicted the corpse of a woman in a pool of blood on an altar.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">The military judge denied the motion <em>in limine. </em>His findings of fact and conclusions of law were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">I find that there is evidence presented that the accused wrote the document contained in Appellate Exhibit CXL (140) and that he continued to have it in his possession on the dates of the offenses alleged against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-15\">That he also had in his possession on the dates of the offenses alleged against him photographs, or graphic depictions, of women either being murdered or stabbed in the eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-16\">I find that this evidence is probative and relevant on the issue of premeditation to commit murder and to rebut any defense that the murder was not the product of such consideration of the act intended or that the act was some spur of the moment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-17\">I find that this evidence is not substantially outweighed by any other \u2014 any unfair prejudice to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-18\">This does not appear to be [Mil.R.Evid.] 404(b) evidence, since none of it is illegal or misconduct. The fact appears to be more in the line of a relevance issue and a [MiLR.Evid.] 403 issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Appellant asserts that the evidence was not relevant and that any probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. With regard to relevance, Mil.R.Evid. 401 provides that evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable tha[n] it would be without the evidence.\u201d This rule establishes a low threshold of relevance. <em>United States v. Reece, </em>25 MJ 93, 95 (CMA 1987). A military judge\u2019s determination that evidence is relevant will not be overturned unless there is a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Orsburn, </em>31 MJ 182, 187 (CMA 1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1120, 111 S.Ct. 1074,112 L.Ed.2d 1179 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Mil.R.Evid. 402 provides: \u201cAll relevant evidence is admissible,\u201d with exceptions not applicable to this case. Mil.R.Evid. 403 provides that \u201crelevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d A military judge has \u201c \u2018wide discretion\u2019 in applying Mil.R.Evid. 403____ [Appellate courts \u2018exercise great restraint\u2019 in reviewing a judge\u2019s decisions under [Mil.R.Evid.] 403.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>46 MJ 221, 225 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Applying the foregoing principles, we hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion. The evidence was relevant on the issue of premeditation. The photographs were never displayed to the court members. The \u201cpoem\u201d describes mutilating a woman with a knife, the weapon used to kill BG. Although it graphically describes abuse and mutilation of women, it pales in comparison to the photographic evidence of BG\u2019s death. <em>See United States v. Schap, </em>49 MJ 317, 326-27 (1998) (books and pamphlets on knives relevant to show premeditation and intent), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. --, 119 S.Ct. 1116, 143 L.Ed.2d 111 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-12\">. Cited Manual provisions are unchanged from the version applicable at trial, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b288-13\">EFFRON, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AYL\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">I would reverse on the ground that the military judge erred in failing to grant the challenge to SSgt B.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-15\">The majority quotes the well-established principle that \u201cchallenges for cause are to be liberally granted.\u201d 52 MJ at 92-93, quoting <em>United States v. Glenn, </em>25 MJ 278, 279 (CMA 1987). The liberal-grant mandate reflects the fundamental distinctions between a jury and a court-martial panel. As we noted in <em>United States v. Tulloch, </em>47 MJ 283 (1997):</p>\n<p id=\"b288-16\">(1) courts-martial are not subject to the jury trial requirements of the Constitution; (2) military accused are tried by a panel of their superiors, not by a jury of their peers; (3) military panels are selected by the commander who convened the court-martial on a best-qualified basis and are not drawn from a random cross-section of the community; (4) military counsel are provided with only a single peremptory challenge, in contrast to the numerous peremptory challenges permitted by most civilian jurisdictions; and (5) in civilian jurisdictions, the numerous peremptory challenges are used to select a jury, but in courts-martial, a peremptory challenge is used to eliminate those already selected by the convening authority-</p>\n<p id=\"b288-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 285-86 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-18\">In the military justice system, the convening authority \u2014 who performs the critical prosecutorial task of determining which cases shall be referred to trial by court-martial\u2014 also determines the composition of the court-martial panel. Arts. 22-25, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 822-825, respectively. The convening authority\u2019s discretion is constrained by Article 25, which provides that the convening authority shall detail for court-martial duty \u201csuch members of the armed forces as, in his opinion, are best qualified for the duty by reason of age, education, training, experience, length of service, and judicial temperament.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>The material excerpted from the record in the majority opinion demonstrates that SSgt B was not qualified \u2014 much less \u201cbest qualified\u201d \u2014 to exercise the judicial temperament expected of a member of a court-martial panel. Throughout the extensive voir dire by the military judge and counsel for both parties, she demonstrated a firm and unwavering support for sentences that have long been outside the accepted range of punishments in military jurisprudence, including castration of persons convicted of rape and amputation of limbs for persons convicted of theft. <em>See </em>W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 437 \u2014 442 (2d ed. 1920 Reprint). Although she agreed that sentences should be tailored to individual circumstances, she insisted that there were cases in which castration or amputation should be imposed as an appropriate punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Lay persons selected to serve on courts-martial need not exhibit either the detailed understanding of legal concepts expected of judges or the same degree of judicial temperament expected of framed judges. Nonetheless, members of the armed forces have the right to expect that convening authorities will exercise their extraordinary panel-selection powers to exclude those who lack the type of judicial temperament necessary to ensure a fair trial on the merits and the sentencing proceeding. The \u201cliberal grant\u201d mandate is designed to ensure that, if information raising serious doubts about a person\u2019s qualifications comes to the attention of the court-martial, the military judge will grant the challenge to ensure compliance with the purposes of Article 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">SSgt B\u2019s extreme views would have disqualified her from sitting on a court-martial considering rape or larceny. The majority suggests that because \u201crape and larceny were not charged,\u201d her extreme views were not of significance. 52 MJ at 93. I disagree. If a person is so lacking in judicial temperament that she could not sit on a ease involving rape or larceny, she is hardly qualified to deal with the emotional impact of the ease in which charges involved a brutal murder with significant sexual overtones. I would hold that the decision by the military judge to deny the challenge of SSgt B constituted a clear abuse of discretion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
