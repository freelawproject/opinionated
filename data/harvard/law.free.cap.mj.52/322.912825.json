The military judge sentenced appellant to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for 25 years, total forfeitures, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. Pursuant to a pretrial agreement, the convening authority suspended confinement in excess of 60 months for a period of 12 months, but otherwise approved the sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and the sentence except for confinement in excess of 13 years and the forfeitures, on the ground that the adjudged sentence was \u201cinappropriately severe.\u201d <em>See </em>Art. 66(c), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 866(c) (1994). Unpub. op. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-21\">This Court granted review of the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b514-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b514-23\">WHETHER THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE SPECIFICATIONS UNDER CHARGES <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>I AND III ARE NOT \u201cFACIALLY DU-PLICATIVE\u201d BASED ON THE LANGUAGE OF THE SPECIFICATION, RATHER THAN THE FACTUAL CONDUCT ALLEGED IN THE SPECIFICATION AND SUPPORTED BY THE RECORD, IN CONFLICT WITH <em>UNITED STATES V. LLOYD, </em>46 MJ 19 (1997) AND <em>UNITED STATES V. BRITTON, </em>47 MJ 195 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">WHETHER CHARGE III, SOLICITATION TO DISTRIBUTE LSD, IS A LESSER-INCLUDED OFFENSE OF, AND THEREFORE MULTIPLICIOUS WITH, CHARGE I, CONSPIRACY TO DISTRIBUTE LSD, WHERE BOTH OFFENSES AROSE FROM THE SAME PHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE SAME PERSON, AND PROOF OF THE SOLICITATION WAS NECESSARY TO PROVE THE FORMATION OF A CONSPIRACY. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">For the reasons set out below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The solicitation specification alleged that, between May 1 and May 31, 1997, appellant solicited Corporal (CPL) Howard J. Rich \u201cto wrongfully distribute approximately 30 to 50 hits of [LSD] to Lance Corporal [(LCPL)] Jeremiah B. Rhynes, U.S. Marine Corps.\u201d The conspiracy specification alleged that, \u201cduring the month of May 1997,\u201d appellant conspired with CPL Rich to \u201cwrongfully distribute approximately 30 to 50 hits of [LSD] to Lance Corporal Jeremiah B. Rhynes, U.S. Marine Corps, and in order to effect the object of the conspiracy the said Corporal Rich did wrongfully distribute approximately 30 to 50 hits of [LSD] to Lance Corporal Rhymes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">During the plea inquiry, appellant told the military judge that at sometime \u201cin the month of May\u201d 1997, he telephoned CPL Rich from his barracks room at Marine Corps Base, Oahu, Hawaii, and told CPL Rich that he had left \u201cacid\u201d inside CPL Rich\u2019s car in a camera case \u201cand that [LCPL] Rhynes would be coming to his room to get it.\u201d He told CPL Rich \u201cto get the money from Rhynes and give it to me later.\u201d Appellant stated that the camera case contained 40 to 50 hits of LSD. Eventually, LCPL Rhynes picked up the LSD from CPL Rich and paid him for the LSD. In turn, Rich later gave the money to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The defense did not move to dismiss any offenses as multiplicious. After finding appellant guilty as charged, the military judge <em>sua sponte </em>asked, \u201cDoes either counsel see any of the offenses before the court as being multiplicious for either findings or sentencing purposes.\u201d Defense counsel responded by stating that \u201cthere is a slight multiplicity problem\u201d concerning the solicitation and the conspiracy. After considering this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>43 MJ 487 (1996), the military judge ruled that <em>Carroll </em>was factually distinguishable but that the two offenses were multiplicious for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">Appellant now asserts that the military judge erred by not dismissing the solicitation specification, because it facially duplicates the conspiracy specification. He argues that the solicitation specification merely describes the means used to form the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">The Government asserts that appellant waived any claim of multiplicity by failing to make a timely motion to dismiss, unless the offenses are facially duplicative. The Government argues that the offenses are not facially duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-15\">In <em>Carroll, </em>a plurality of this Court held that solicitation and conspiracy were separate offenses. The lead opinion, setting out the view of two judges, stated the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b515-16\">We hold that the offenses of solicitation under Article 134 and conspiracy under Article 81 are separate offenses. Not every solicitation results in a conspiracy. Proof of solicitation does not require proof of an agreement or of an overt act. Solicitation is an \u201cinstantaneous offense,\u201d which is \u201ccomplete when a solicitation is made or advice is given with the specific wrongful intent to influence another or others\u201d to commit an offense. <em>See </em>para. 105c (incorporates concept of \u201cinstantaneous offense\u201d from paragraph 6c, Part IV, Manual [for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Courts-Martial, United States (1995 ed.)]).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Conversely, proof of a solicitation is not required to prove a conspiracy. Two examples are illustrative. First, a person who responds to a solicitation and joins a conspiracy is guilty of conspiracy but not guilty of solicitation. Second, a person can join a conspiracy without being solicited, as occurred in this case, where members of appellant\u2019s unit heard about the conspiracy and decided to join it on their own initiative. Since each of the offenses in this case contains elements not contained in the other, they are not multiplicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">43 MJ at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Senior Judge Darden agreed that the offenses were separate in <em>Carroll </em>because of a 7-day break between the solicitations and the conspiracy. He reserved judgment on the question whether they would be separate if an agreement and an overt act promptly followed the solicitation. 43 MJ at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Judge Sullivan concurred separately, relying on <em>United States v. Teters, </em>37 MJ 370, 377 (1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1091, 114 S.Ct. 919, 127 L.Ed.2d 213 (1994), to support his conclusion that conspiracy and solicitation were separate offenses because they have different elements. 43 MJ at 490. <em>Teters </em>held that forgery and larceny were separate offenses, even though \u201cthe forgery was the \u2018means\u2019 for committing the larceny.\u201d 37 MJ at 378, 379. In <em>Teters </em>our Court rejected the \u201cmeans\u201d and \u201cfairly embraced\u201d tests, <em>id. </em>at 378, and adopted the \u201celements\u201d test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Schmuck v. United States, </em>489 U.S. 705, 716, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989), 37 MJ at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">In <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>46 MJ 19, 23 (1997), we applied the test articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Broce, </em>488 U.S. 563, 575, 109 S.Ct. 757,102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989). Our Court held that multiplicity issues were waived by failure to make a timely motion and an unconditional plea of guilty, unless the offenses \u201ccould be seen as \u2018facially duplicative,\u2019 that is, factually the same.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Harwood, </em>46 MJ 26, 28-29 (1997) (fraternization and conduct unbecoming an officer for same conduct were \u201cfacially duplicative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">With respect to the first granted issue, we hold that the specifications are not \u201cfacially duplicative.\u201d As we stated in <em>Carroll, supra </em>at 489, it is possible to have a solicitation without a conspiracy and a conspiracy without a solicitation. Unlike <em>Harwood, </em>the same act did not constitute two offenses. The solicitation was complete when appellant made his telephone call to CPL Rich. The conspiracy was not completed when Rich agreed to make the exchange; it was completed only when the overt act, the actual exchange of money and drugs, occurred. At any time after appellant\u2019s telephone call, but before the exchange of drugs and money, either appellant or Rich could have withdrawn from the agreement. Furthermore, the overt act might not have occurred for reasons unforeseen at the time the agreement was made. Thus, the two offenses are not \u201cfactually the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">In light of our holding that the specifications are not \u201cfacially duplicative,\u201d we need not reach the second granted issue, because the multiplicity issue was waived. <em>See United States v. Lloyd, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b516-12\">SULLIVAN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ADX\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">I would resolve this case based on my separate opinion in <em>United States v. Carroll, </em>43 MJ 487, 490 (1996) (concurring in part and in the result). There, I stated that since \u201cthe offenses of conspiracy and solicitation each require proof of different elements that the other does not,\u201d these offenses are not multiplicious under <em>United States v. Teters, </em>37 M J 370, 377 (CMA 1993) (emphasis omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1091,114 S.Ct. 919,127 L.Ed.2d 213 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">I need not decide the question whether the specification of conspiracy and the specification of solicitation are \u201cfacially duplicative\u201d in this case. See <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>46 MJ 19, 23 (1997) (\u201cbased on the very same conduct\u201d). However, I do note that the record in this case makes clear that the charged solicitation immediately led to the charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>conspiracy in this case. <em>See United States v. Savage, </em>50 MJ 244, 245 (1999) (marijuana possession with intent to distribute and distribution of same marijuana on same day); <em>United States v. Britton, </em>47 MJ 195, 198-99 (1997) (rape and assault \u201cfacially duplicative\u201d where assault is \u201cforce used to commit the rape\u201d). Some reconciliation of these cases is nee(je(j</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
