WHETHER THE ARMY COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED BY HOLDING THAT A TRIAL DEFENSE COUNSEL\u2019S RELEASE FROM ACTIVE DUTY PER SE CONSTITUTES GOOD CAUSE TO SEVER AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">A. RIGHT TO COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">In civilian life, the Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment right to \u201cassistance of counsel\u201d in all criminal prosecutions requires appointment of counsel at government expense if the accused cannot afford to employ an attorney. <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) (federal proceedings); <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963) (state proceedings). In federal proceedings, attorneys are appointed to represent indigent defendants from a court-approved panel or organization. 18 USC \u00a7 3006A(b). The right of an indigent to government-compensated counsel in federal civilian criminal proceedings extends only to the right to representation by an attorney designated by the Government and does not provide the accused with the right to appointment of a particular attorney. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>604 F.2d 474, 478 (7th Cir. 1979); <em>United States v. White, </em>451 F.2d 1225, 1226 (6th Cir.1971). <em>See </em>18 USC \u00a7 3006A(c) (permitting the court \u201cin the interests of justice\u201d to \u201csubstitute one appointed counsel for another at any stage of the proceedings\u201d). <em>Cf. Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 5, 12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983) (trial judge did not abuse discretion in denying continuance and proceeding with substitute counsel).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">Congress has provided members of the armed forces facing trial by general or special court-martial with counsel rights broader than those available to their civilian counterparts. A military accused in such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>proceedings has the right to representation by government-compensated military counsel regardless of indigence and also has the right to select a particular military counsel in limited circumstances. These rights reflect the unique nature of military life, in which members are subject to worldwide assignment and involuntary deployment under circumstances when civilian counsel are not readily available.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The right to counsel before general and special courts-martial is governed by Articles 27 and 38, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 827 and \u00a7 838, respectively. There are three types of counsel under these statutes: (1) detailed counsel; (2) individual military counsel; and (3) civilian counsel retained by the accused at his or her own expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Article 27(a)(1) requires that \u201cdefense counsel shall be detailed for each general and special court-martial.\u201d The Secretary of each Military Department, by regulation, establishes the process for detailing defense counsel to courts-martial. <em>Id. </em>In the Army, defense counsel are detailed by the Chief of the trial defense service or that officer\u2019s des-ignee. Para. 5-4, Army Regulation (AR) 27-10 (June 24, 1996). If the accused retains civilian counsel, the detailed defense counsel (DDC) acts \u201cas associate counsel unless excused at the request of the accused.\u201d Art. 38(b)(4). If individual military counsel is made available, the DDC is excused unless the detailing authority approves \u201ca request from the accused\u201d that the DDC remain as associate counsel. Art. 38(b)(5) &amp; (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Article 38(b) permits the accused to be represented by individual military counsel of his own selection if that counsel is determined to be \u201creasonably available\u201d under applicable regulations. If civilian counsel is retained, the individual military\u2019 counsel remains as associate counsel unless excused at the request of the accused. Art. 38(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">As originally enacted in 1950, Article 38 did not authorize any limitation with respect to the determination of whether a particular military counsel was \u201creasonably available\u201d to serve as individual military counsel (IMC). Over time, this led to concern that some IMC requests for counsel located far from the situs of trial were being submitted as a negotiating tactic with a view towards promoting pretrial agreements rather than for the purpose of selecting a particular counsel. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 306, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 6-7 (1981). As a result, Congress modified Article 38 in a number of respects, including establishment of a new subsection (7) authorizing regulations governing the selection of IMC. Military Justice Amendments of 1981, Pub.L. No. 97-81, \u00a7 4(b), 95 Stat. 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Article 38(b)(7) requires the Secretary of each Military Department and the Department of Transportation to define the term \u201creasonably available\u201d for purposes of requests for IMC and to \u201cestablish procedures for determining whether the military counsel selected by an accused ... is reasonably available.\u201d The regulations may not contain blanket exclusions for counsel from another military service. The statute also requires that \u201c[t]o the maximum extent practicable, such regulations shall establish uniform policies among the armed forces while recognizing the differences in the circumstances and needs of the various armed forces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">The IMC regulations- issued by each department are subject to the criteria established by the President in RCM 506(b), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 ed.). RCM 506(b)(1) lists eight categories of persons who \u201care not reasonably available to serve as individual military counsel because of the nature of their duties or positions.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Rule also provides that the Secretary of each Military Department and the Department of Transportation \u201cmay determine other persons to be not reasonably available because of the nature or responsibilities of their assignments, geographic considerations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>exigent circumstances, or military necessity.\u201d Under the Rule, the Secretaries \u201cmay prescribe circumstances\u201d in which a person may be found to be \u201creasonably available\u201d even if in an excluded category \u201cwhen merited by the existence of an attorney-client relationship regarding matters relating to a charge in question.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Under RCM 506(b)(2), the convening authority normally forwards an IMC request to the \u201ccommander or head of the organization, activity, or agency to which the requested person is assigned\u201d for a decision as to reasonable availability of the requested counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The convening authority, however, \u201cshall deny\u201d the IMC request without forwarding it if the requested counsel is within the category of persons excluded from consideration by RCM 506(b)(1) or service rule \u201cunless the accused asserts that there is an existing attorney-client relationship regarding a charge in question\u201d or that the person will not be in an excluded category at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The Army\u2019s IMC rules applicable to the present case provide that all judge advocates \u201ccertified under Article 27(b) ... are considered reasonably available\u201d unless otherwise excluded under applicable law or regulation. Para. 5-7(b), AR 27-10. The Army\u2019s rules add four specific categories to the list of persons excluded by position or duties under RCM 506(b)(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With respect to persons potentially available as IMC (i.e., those who do not fall within the categories excluded from service as IMC by regulation), paragraph 5-7(d) of the Army regulation sets forth a procedure for considering \u201call relevant factors\u201d in making the discretionary decision as to whether a requested counsel is reasonably available.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, paragraph 5-7(e) provides the following with respect to all counsel, whether potentially available or in an excluded category:</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">\n<em>Prior attorney-client relationship.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Notwithstanding the provisions of c and <em>d </em>above, if an attorney-client relationship exists between the accused and the requested counsel regarding matters that relate solely to the charges in question, the requested counsel will ordinarily be considered available to act as individual military counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">The requirement that requested counsel \u201cordinarily\u201d will be made available as IMC when an attorney-client relationship \u201cexists\u201d reflects the decisions of this Court governing severance of an attorney-client relationship. Our Court has been vigilant in protecting the relationship between a servicemember and his or her military counsel. <em>See United States v. Hanson, </em>24 MJ 377 (CMA 1987). We have emphasized that \u201c[d]efense counsel are not fungible items.\u201d <em>United States v. Baca, </em>27 MJ 110,119 (1988). A servicemember may not be deprived of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>services of his detailed military defense counsel or his appointed IMC simply because of a routine change in the military attorney\u2019s assignment or duty station. <em>United States v. Eason, </em>21 USCMA 335, 45 CMR 109 (1972); <em>United States v. Murray, </em>20 USCMA 61, 42 CMR 253 (1970); <em>United States v. Tellier, </em>13 USCMA 323, 32 CMR 323 (1962). Although there may be a \u201cfinancial, logistical, [or] ... administrative burden\u201d associated with providing representation by the military counsel with whom an accused has formed an attorney-client relationship, \u201cit is the duty and obligation of the Government to shoulder that burden where possible.\u201d <em>Eason, </em>21 USCMA at 340, 45 CMR at 114. If there is an existing attorney-client relationship between a servicemember and a military attorney concerning the substance of the charges at issue, it may be severed only for \u201cgood cause\u201d unless the relationship has been terminated with the consent of the member or by replacement of DDC as a result of the member\u2019s request for IMC. <em>See id. </em>at 339, 45 CMR at 113; <em>United States v. Iverson, </em>5 MJ 440 (CMA 1978); RCM 505(d)(2)(B), 506(b)(3), and 506(c). In the\u2019 context of an attorney-client relationship, the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement places a heavy burden on the Government to justify any action that would sever the relationship. <em>See Iverson, </em>5 MJ at 442-43 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">The \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement comes into play, however, only if an ongoing attorney-client relationship regarding the substance of the charges at issue exists at the time of the IMC request. <em>See </em>RCM 506(b); para. 5-7(e), AR 27-10; <em>United States v. Saenz, </em>18 MJ 327, 330 n. 1 (CMA 1984) (Everett, C.J., concurring); <em>cf. United States v. Catt, </em>1 MJ 41, 48 (CMA 1975). Communications between a servicemember and a military attorney, even if sufficient to qualify as confidential under the attorney-client privilege, do not necessarily establish the existence of an attorney-client relationship because the privilege protects a communication, even when there is no ongoing attorney-client relationship. <em>See </em>Mil.R.Evid. 502(b)(1) &amp; (2), Manual, <em>supra. </em>Such communications do not support the existence of an ongoing attorney-client relationship unless they reflect a bilateral understanding between an attorney and a client as to the ongoing nature of the services to be provided. <em>Cf. Jane Street Co. v. Rosenberg &amp; Es-tis, P.C., </em>192 A.D.2d 451, 597 N.Y.S.2d 17 (1st Dept.1993) (person\u2019s subjective unilateral belief does not establish existence of an attorney-client relationship). Prior representation of a servicemember by a military attorney does not necessarily demonstrate the existence of an ongoing attorney-client relationship, even when the charges at issue encompass the same subject matter covered during the earlier representation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gnibus, </em>21 MJ 1, 8 (CMA 1985) (where charges were not withdrawn by the Government as a \u201cstratagem\u201d for replacing defense counsel and the attorney-client relationship ceased to exist during the member\u2019s lengthy unauthorized absence, the member\u2019s request for the attorney to be designated as IMC would be considered under standard reasonable-availability criteria and not in terms of severance of an attorney-client relationship).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Likewise, if the purpose of a representation limited in time or scope has been completed, such prior representation will not demonstrate the existence of an ongoing attorney-client relationship. As Chief Judge Everett noted in <em>Saenz, </em>an attorney-client relationship may involve representation for a limited purpose or period of time, such as representation \u201cfor purposes of an identification lineup or merely to advise him in connection with a pretrial custodial interrogation.\u201d 18 MJ at 330 (concurring). <em>Cf. Volpe v. Canfield, </em>237 A.D.2d 282, 283, 654 N.Y.S.2d 160, 161 (2d Dept.1997) (requiring plaintiff in an attorney malpractice action to prove existence of an attorney-client relationship by showing \u201can explicit undertaking to perform a specific task\u201d). In addition, application of the \u201cgood cause\u201d limitation on severance requires more than an understanding as to future representation. The attorney\u2019s activities must reflect active engagement in the preparation and pretrial strategy of the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>See Eason, </em>21 USCMA at 339, 45 CMR at 113.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">In summary, under the Army regulation, all Army judge advocates certified under Article 27(b) of the UCMJ are potentially available to serve as individual military counsel except for those in a category excluded by Article 38(b), RCM 506,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or paragraph 5-7(c) of the regulation. If the judge advocate is not in an excluded category, the commander of the organization to which the judge advocate is assigned must make a reasonable-availability determination upon consideration of \u201call relevant factors, including\u201d specific regulatory criteria under paragraph 5-7(d) of the regulation. If there is an ongoing attorney-client relationship regarding matters that relate solely to the relevant charges, the requested counsel \u201cordinarily\u201d will be made available to act as IMC regardless whether the exclusions under paragraph 5-7(e) or the criteria under paragraph 5-7(d) apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">If an IMC request has been denied and the defense claims an improper severance of an attorney-client relationship, the defense as the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating that, at the time of the request, the accused had a viable ongoing attorney-client relationship regarding the substance of the charges at issue. In making this showing, the defense must demonstrate both a bilateral understanding as to the nature of future representation and active engagement by the attorney in the preparation and pretrial strategy of the case. If the defense makes such a showing, the burden shifts to the Government to demonstrate good cause for severance of the attorney-client relationship. If the defense cannot make such a showing, the burden shifts to the Government to demonstrate that the judge advocate was not reasonably available under applicable statutory and regulatory criteria. If there was a prior attorney-client relationship that is no longer viable at the time of the request, the Government is not required to demonstrate good cause, but must nonetheless demonstrate that the other reasonable-availability criteria warrant disregarding the prior relationship under the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">B. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Appellant, a Staff Sergeant (SSG), was stationed at Fort Bliss, Texas. In 1995, a year prior to the court-martial that is the subject of the present appeal, appellant was tried by a special court-martial. Captain (CPT) James Maus, a qualified judge advocate, was assigned by the Army to represent him during the 1995 trial at government expense as his detailed defense counsel. The trial resulted in an acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">On April 9, 1996, CPT Maus began a period of terminal leave (now officially designated \u201ctransition leave\u201d), a program which allows soldiers with accumulated leave to transition into civilian life before their formal date of separation. <em>See </em>para. 4-21, AR 600-8-10, \u201cPersonal Absences, Leaves and Passes,\u201d ch. 4, section XI (July 1, 1994). By taking terminal leave, CPT Maus was able to relinquish his full-time military duties and begin a new career in the private sector.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">Appellant discussed the original charges at issue in the present case with Maus on several occasions between May 21 and 23, 1996. At that time, Maus \u201cwas on terminal leave and working in a [civilian] law firm in El Paso, Texas.\u201d The record contains little information concerning the nature of the discussions or the amount of preparation, if any, engaged in by Maus. In a post-trial affidavit, Maus noted that \u201cI spoke with SSG Spriggs regarding legal issues he was facing and I gave him legal advice.\u201d One of the subjects they discussed was the question whether Maus \u2014 who was in civilian practice while on terminal leave \u2014 would represent appellant. According to appellant, Maus \u201csaid he would, if he could.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-16\">On May 23, appellant was apprehended by military law enforcement officials. According to the Criminal Investigation Command <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Ag\u00e9nt Activity Summary submitted on appeal by appellate counsel, appellant \u201crequested] that we contact his attorney, Mr. MAUS ....\u201d The summary added: \u201cSA HERNANDEZ contacted Mr. MAUS, but he was not at his office. Left message with his reception [sic] to have Mr. MAUS contact this office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The following day, May 24, CPT Joel No-vak was notified by his senior defense counsel (SDC) that he \u201cmight be detailed to represent\u201d appellant at a pretrial confinement hearing. According to Novak, the SDC told him that Maus had represented appellant previously and that it was likely that appellant would be requesting Maus to be his attorney. The SDC also said it was \u201clikely\u201d that Novak would \u201cbe deta\u00f1ed to represent\u201d appellant \u201cbeyond the pretrial confinement hearing, pending possible representation by CPT Maus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">When Novak met with appellant on May 24, appellant stated \u201cthat he wanted to be represented by CPT Maus.\u201d Appellant also informed Novak that Maus \u201cwas now a civ\u00fc-ian.\u201d Novak noted in response that Maus either \u201cwas\u201d or \u201cmight still be\u201d on active duty and that appeUant \u201cpossibly ... could obtain CPT Maus as his\u201d IMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">According to Novak, appeUant \u201cwas not sure if he was going to hire CPT Maus as a civ\u00fcian, submit an[] IMC request, or go to trial without his counsel of choice.\u201d At some point after May 24, appellant asked Novak to submit a request for Maus to serve as his IMC. Appellant also suggested that he wanted CPT Utz to serve as his IMC if Maus was not available. Novak subsequently determined that CPT Utz was \u201cunable to represent SSG Spriggs due to conflicts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Maus, who remained on terminal leave, was separated from active duty (ETS) on June 24 and entered the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) on that date. On June 27, appellant submitted a memorandum to the convening authority, through the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), requesting that Maus serve as his IMC for a pending pretrial investigation under Article 32, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 832, and possible court-martial. Although the request remained pending when the Article 32 investigation commenced on July 1, appellant was willing to proceed with the Article 32 represented only by his deta\u00fced defense counsel, CPT Novak. Appellant was informed by the SJA on July 19 that the IMC request would not be forwarded to the convening authority because Maus no longer was on active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">At the court-martial, which commenced with pretrial proceedings under Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 839(a), on July 25, 1996, CPT Novak appeared as appe\u00fcant\u2019s detailed defense counsel. The military judge advised appellant of his rights regarding representation by deta\u00fced defense counsel, individual military counsel, and civ\u00fcian counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">AppeUant requested representation by CPT Novak and CPT Maus. The m\u00fcitary judge was advised by the parties that CPT Maus was a reservist, that he was not on active duty, and that the IMC request had not been forwarded to the convening authority of Maus\u2019 command.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">After further inquiry by the m\u00fcitary judge, appellant stated that he wanted to be represented by CPT Maus and that he would like to keep CPT Novak as \u201csecond chair.\u201d The military judge advised appellant that if CPT Maus were to be \u201cmade ava\u00fcable,\u201d it would \u201cbe up to the detailing authority\u201d to decide whether CPT Novak would remain on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">The m\u00fcitary judge emphasized that he would treat the defense request \u201cas a motion, at this point, to compel forwarding the request through the channels\u201d to CPT Maus\u2019 commander. Until that commander was required by the judge to act, the issue of whether the military judge should require Maus to be made ava\u00fcable as IMC would not be ripe. Trial counsel opposed forwarding the request on the grounds that Maus should not be made ava\u00fcable because he was no longer on active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Pending Ms ruling on the motion to forward the request and any resultant action, the military judge provided appellant with two options for the court-martial proceedings: (1) at appellant\u2019s request, the military judge would postpone proceedings after arraignment until the IMC issue was resolved; or (2) with appellant\u2019s consent, the court-martial would proceed through preliminary motions with CPT Novak as his counsel. Appellant agreed to proceed with that day\u2019s consideration of preliimnary matters represented only by CPT Novak, but he continued to request representation by CPT Maus in any further proceedmgs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">On the following day, July 26, the detailed defense counsel, CPT Novak, submitted to the convening authority a new IMC request and asked that it be forwarded to CPT Maus\u2019 reserve commander at the Army Reserve Personnel Center in St. Louis, Mo. The portion of appellant\u2019s request concermng the existence of an attorney-client relationship noted that \u201cCPT Maus has spoke[n] to SSG Spriggs about tMs case, and represented Mm in a prior court-martial which is the subject of the perjury charge and specification.\u201d The request also stated that \u201ca defimte and long-term attorney-client relationship exists\u201d between appellant and CPT Maus. In terms of the time commitment involved, appellant\u2019s request stated that \u201ctrial preparation should take less than three weeks and trial should take less than a week.\u201d The request also noted that Maus was \u201cwilling to absent himself from his private law practice for this case.\u201d On July 28, appellant submitted a motion to the military judge requesting an order that CPT Maus be made available as IMC or that the military judge order the Government to present the request to the convening authority and that the convemng authority forward it to CPT Maus\u2019 commander at the Army Reserve Personnel Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">On July 81, the military judge announced that he had granted that portion of appellant\u2019s motion requiring the Government to forward the IMC request to CPT Maus\u2019 commander and stated that the balance of the motion \u2014 to compel production of CPT Maus as IMC \u2014 was denied as premature. An August 2 response from counsel at the Army Reserve Personnel Center stated that \u201cCPT Maus indicated he will not volunteer to serve on active duty\u201d as appellant\u2019s IMC, that there was \u201cno authority to order CPT Maus to active duty\u201d involuntarily absent war or national emergency (citing 10 USC \u00a7\u00a7 12301-02), and that \u201cCPT Maus is not, therefore, reasonably available to serve as IMC in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">In response to the demal, defense counsel submitted a motion on August 3 to \u201cSever and Continue\u201d the charge of perjury, wMch concerned statements made at the previous trial in which he was represented by CPT Maus. The motion stated that \u201cat the direction of his civilian employer, CPT Maus indicated that he would not volunteer to serve on active duty\u201d as appellant\u2019s IMC. The motion also noted that appellant had discussed the other charges with CPT Maus on various occasions, but added that \u201cDetailed Defense Counsel is unsure of the amount of involvement of CPT Maus\u201d on the charges other than perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">The motion, if granted, would have permitted trial to proceed on all charges except the perjury charge, with appellant represented only by detailed defense counsel. The perjury charge would be severed and continued until Maus could be made available, based on Maus\u2019 \u201cumque knowledge\u201d of matters concerning the perjury charge. The Government opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">At an Article 39(a) session on'August 12, the new military judge confirmed that appellant continued to request CPT Maus as Ms IMC but that he had agreed to proceed with the pretrial motions represented oMy by Ms deta\u00f1ed defense counsel, CPT Novak. No-vak advised the judge that any discussion of the IMC issue was \u201cpremature at this point\u201d because it was st\u00fcl pending action. He noted that the August 2 response from the Army Reserve Personnel Center had been issued by the command counsel, not the commander, and that the appropriate commander had not yet acted on the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">On August 20, CPT Maus\u2019 commander at the Army Reserve Personnel Center demed the IMC request, notmg that Maus would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>consent to active-duty orders and repeating command counsel\u2019s assertion that members of the IRR could be involuntarily ordered to active duty only during war or national emergency. Appellant submitted an administrative appeal, which was denied on September 23 by CPT Maus\u2019 commander at the Army Reserve Personnel Center. The Commander, in a memorandum to CPT Novak explaining the denial of the IMC request, provided the following information on the reason CPT Maus would not consent to active-duty orders:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">CPT Maus is not willing to absent himself from the private practice of law for this case. Regarding his availability, he was repeatedly telephonically contacted, offered a DA Form 1058 (Application for Active Duty) whereafter he indicated his necessity to remain at his place of private employment, especially at the beginning of his new legal career. He will be substituting for his civilian superior who has a capital homicide case to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The commander enclosed an Application for Active Duty, noting that the form, \u201cif signed by CPT Maus and returned, will cause a reconsideration of my position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">At an Article 39(a) session on September 30, the military judge obtained the parties\u2019 agreement that \u201cthe appropriate commander\u201d had acted on the request, that Maus would not \u201cconsent to being recalled to active duty\u201d as appellant\u2019s IMC, \u201cthat there was no mechanism to bring [Maus] back on active duty without his consent,\u201d and that both parties were prepared for the military judge to rule on the basis of \u201cthe factual predicate\u201d presented by the defense and the documents in the appellate exhibits. After considering those matters, the military judge denied the defense motion to compel CPT Maus\u2019 appearance as appellant\u2019s IMC. On the following day, the perjury charge was dismissed on motion by the Government for reasons unrelated to the IMC request. At trial on the merits, appellant was convicted of a number of the charged offenses, as noted at the outset of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">During review by the Court of Criminal Appeals, appellant claimed that he had an attorney-client relationship with CPT Maus, which the military judge severed. 48 MJ at 694. The court rejected this contention, concluding that appellant \u201cfailed in his burden to establish the existence of a bona fide attorney-client relationship regarding this case\u201d and that appellant \u201cmade no showing whatsoever that Captain Maus actively engaged in pretrial preparation and strategy of this case.\u201d The court added that even if there had been an attorney-client relationship, it \u201cwas legally severed by Captain Maus\u2019 departure from active duty\u201d and that the Army had \u201cno authority to compel or pay for the services of\u2019 a civilian defense counsel. With respect to CPT Maus\u2019 reserve status, the court noted that because CPT Maus had not volunteered for recall to active duty, \u201cthe Army and the accused would be limited to the fifteen days of involuntary active duty authorized by law in which to prepare for and try the case.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court concluded that 15 days would not have provided an adequate period of time for counsel \u201cto investigate, prepare, and try\u201d the case. Under thosexircumstances, the court concluded that denial of the IMC request was appropriate. 48 MJ at 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">The ruling of a military judge on an IMC request, including the question whether such a ruling severed an attorney-client relationship, is a mixed question of fact and law. Legal conclusions are subject to <em>de novo </em>review, and findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. White, </em>48 MJ 251, 257 (1998); <em>see </em>S. Childress &amp; M. Davis, 2 Federal Standards of Review \u00a7 7.05 at 7-26 to 36 (2d ed.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>At trial, appellant did not claim \u2014 as he does now \u2014 that the military judge severed his attorney-client relationship without good cause. Instead, as appellant has acknowledged on appeal, the issue was litigated at trial as an individual-military-counsel request. In that posture, the question before the military judge was whether the requested counsel was \u201creasonably available\u201d under Article 38(b), ROM 506(b), and paragraph 5-7 of AR 27-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Regardless how such an issue may be framed, an accused who either alleges severance of an attorney-client relationship or seeks to invoke such a relationship for purposes of supporting an IMC request must first demonstrate that, at the time of the request, the accused had a viable ongoing attorney-client relationship regarding the substance of the charges at issue. As noted in Part IA, <em>supra, </em>the accused must show that there was a bilateral understanding on the part of both the attorney and the client as to the nature of the services to be provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In the present case, the record of trial does not demonstrate that Maus agreed to enter into an attorney-client relationship with appellant. Appellant did not introduce or proffer any evidence demonstrating that Maus agreed to represent appellant at trial. Appellant\u2019s colloquy with the military judge at trial indicates that appellant understood that there was no agreement to enter into an ongoing attorney-client relationship:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">MJ: [W]hat did he [Maus] say about representing you?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">ACC: He said he would if he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">Appellant\u2019s testimony shows, at most, a conditional response by Maus, not a commitment to representation. Furthermore, the record of trial does not indicate that Maus engaged in any substantive activity on behalf of appellant beyond discussing some of the pending charges and the possibility of representation. As a result, appellant did not establish at trial the existence of an attorney-client relationship that would be protected under the \u201cgood cause\u201d limitations on severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">The only indication of a pertinent relationship between appellant and Maus reflected in the record of trial involved discussions undertaken by Maus in his capacity as a practitioner in the private sector. In that context, the military judge did nothing to sever the relationship between appellant and Maus. Appellant remained free to retain Maus as his civilian attorney under Article 38(b)(2). Insofar as the rules governing requests for individual military counsel take into account the existence of an attorney-client relationship, <em>see, e.g., </em>para. 5-7, AR 27-10, the context of those rules contemplates a relationship between a servicemember and a military attorney, not a civilian practitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">We hold that, if a civilian attorney happens to be a reservist, that person\u2019s availability as individual military counsel must be determined on the basis of activities undertaken in his or her military status, not on the basis of attorney-client relationships developed in civilian practice. To the extent that a servicemember forms a relationship with an attorney in the attorney\u2019s civilian capacity, that relationship does not require designation of the attorney as individual military counsel unless the person is otherwise found to be reasonably available under applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">Although appellant clearly formed an attorney-client relationship with CPT Maus during his first trial in 1995, that relationship ended with his acquittal. The subsequent perjury charges related to that trial did not revive the relationship absent a bilateral understanding establishing an ongoing attorney-client relationship and active engagement by the attorney in pretrial preparation and strategy. <em>See </em>Part IA, <em>supra. </em>In any event, dismissal of the perjury charge prior to trial on the merits rendered harmless any error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">Even if appellant could make the requisite showing concerning the existence of a qualifying military attorney-client relationship, the record demonstrates that there was ample basis for denying the IMC request under the good-cause standard. The Uniform Code of Military Justice authorizes providing defense services at government expense by persons who are in a military sta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tus. <em>See </em>Arts. 27 and 38. Absent government misconduct, the routine separation of a judge advocate from active duty normally terminates any attorney-client relationship established on the basis of the attorney\u2019s military status, except when: (1) the attorney agrees to represent the client in his or her civilian capacity; or (2) the attorney enters the reserves and is ordered to represent the client to the extent permitted by applicable law based upon a determination by the appropriate official of reasonable availability. <em>Cf. </em>para. lb(2), App. C., AR 27-10. In the present case, the record is clear that Maus, after his separation from active duty, did not agree to represent appellant either as a reserve judge advocate or as a civilian attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Even if Maus could have been involuntarily recalled to active duty for 15 days, <em>see </em>48 MJ at 695 (citing 10 USC \u00a7 12301(b)) we agree with the Court of Criminal Appeals that, as a general matter, 15 days would provide \u201cinadequate time to investigate, prepare, and try a general court-martial under normal conditions.\u201d 48 MJ at 697. Although we need not decide today whether there are any circumstances in which a reservist may be recalled involuntarily to active duty to serve as an IMC, we are confident that no such recall is required in a ease where the proponent of the request has not demonstrated that: (1) an attorney-client relationship was established in the context of the attorney\u2019s military assignment; (2) that the attorney accomplished substantial trial preparation while in that assignment; and (3) that any additional preparation and trial appearances could be readily accomplished within the authorized period of involuntary active duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In the present case, our review of the 746-page record of trial and the numerous exhibits confirms that this was not a trial in which counsel reasonably could have been expected to undertake investigation, preparation, and trial activities within 15 days. We note that appellant, in one of the submissions in support of designating CPT Maus as IMC, stated that the case was \u201cvery complex both factually and legally\u201d and in another submission indicated that the case could involve up to 3 weeks for trial preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">In short, even if appellant had demonstrated that there was an attorney-client relationship based upon Maus\u2019 military status, there was ample good cause for allowing the relationship to be terminated by the separation from active duty without involuntarily recalling him for 15 days\u2019 service as a reservist. Under those circumstances, any error at trial in overlooking the recall authority was harmless. <em>See </em>Art. 59(a), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 859(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Appellant has not demonstrated that he established a qualifying attorney-client relationship with CPT Maus. Even if he had demonstrated the existence of such a relationship, the separation of CPT Maus from active duty constituted good cause for termination of any such relationship in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">.
