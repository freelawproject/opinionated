On 16 May 1990, prior to authentication of the record of trial, the appellant filed a motion for appropriate relief in which he requested that the military judge declare a mistrial based upon ineffective assistance of counsel. Evidence was presented concerning the motion at post-trial Article 39(a), UCMJ, sessions conducted on 4, 7, and 12 June 1990. This evidence reflected that the appellant never admitted to his original civilian attorney, Mr. Allen Edmunds, that he had committed the alleged offenses; that the appellant had expressed a desire to take the stand and deny the charges; that Mr. Ed-munds nonetheless pursued a trial strategy which did not contest that the events occurred but rather offered \u201csleep deprivation\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>as the cause; that Mr. Edmunds was deficient in both his pretrial preparation of the appellant\u2019s case and in his courtroom performance; and, that the appellant testified that he could not \u201crecollect\u201d whether he had committed the offenses, testimony which was consistent with Mr. Edmunds\u2019 theory of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The military judge granted the motion for a mistrial as to the sentencing phase of the trial, but denied it as to the findings, subjectively concluding that he would have reached the same findings even if a competent defense had been presented. A rehearing on sentence was conducted and, on 21 August 1990, the military judge sentenced the appellant to a dishonorable discharge, six years confinement, total forfeitures, and reduction to pay grade E-l. The convening authority approved this adjudged sentence on 4 April 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">On appeal, the appellant asserted that the ineffective assistance of his civilian counsel extended to the merits as well as to sentencing and asked this court to set aside the findings and sentence. Although this court found \u201cserious deficiencies in the trial defense counsel\u2019s representation of the appellant on the merits, including the failure to interview or timely interview witnesses, the failure to follow through on seeking the assistance of an expert or requesting that the Government provide an expert, and the failure to adopt a sound theory to defend against the most serious offense,\u201d we affirmed based upon the overwhelming evidence of guilt and the fact that \u201cthere has been no showing that the defense has been prejudiced or that the outcome on findings would have been different but for this deficient performance.\u201d <em>United States v. Murray, </em>No. 9101350 (N.M.C.M.R. 14 Sept. 1993)(unpublished decision at 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces [CAAF] subsequently reversed this court\u2019s decision, finding that the appellant was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and holding that \u201cthere was a \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that a reasonable factfinder would have reached a different result if appellant had been competently represented.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Murray, </em>42 M.J. 174,178 (1995). Our superior Court set aside the findings and sentence, authorized a rehearing, and returned the record to the Judge Advocate General.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">On 5 December 1995, a general court-martial convening authority referred charges of rape, indecent acts upon a child, and indecent liberties with a child, in violation of Articles 120 and 134, UCMJ, for trial by general court-martial. The military judge subsequently dismissed the indecent acts upon a child specification. Record at 153. At trial, the Government made a Motion <em>in Limine, </em>requesting that the Government be allowed to admit the appellant\u2019s testimony at his original trial during the Government\u2019s case-in-chief, or, in the alternative, as rebuttal evidence. Appellate Exhibit XXV.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The motion was opposed by the appellant. Appellate Exhibit XXVII. Following vigorous argument by both sides, the military judge ruled that the appellant\u2019s testimony at his previous trial was admissible since it was relevant, did not constitute hearsay, and was not the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Record at 136-37. The appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>pled not guilty to all charges and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">After assembly of the court-martial, which was comprised of officer and enlisted members, the trial counsel made an opening statement in which he remarked that \u201cthere are two pieces of important evidence in this case.\u201d Record at 361. He went on to identify the first as the testimony of the child victim [M]. Explaining that [M] was 16 years-old at the time of the rehearing, but only nine years-old at the time of the alleged offenses, trial counsel noted that she cannot recall \u201cevery little detail\u201d of the alleged offenses. He also acknowledged that the members would learn \u201cthat her testimony in court today will differ from the accounts that she gave in 1989 and some previous testimony that she gave in 1990,\u201d but asks the members to keep the age variance in mind when considering the differences. Record at 363-64. Trial counsel then stated that \u201c[t]he second important piece of evidence in this case, besides [M]\u2019s testimony is the statements of the accused. We will present to you what the accused had to say about what happened; and gentlemen, you will learn that this is not a case of he said, she said.\u201d Record at 365. In concluding his opening statement, the trial counsel stated that the other evidence in the case, although tending to show the appellant was guilty, was \u201call fluff\u201d and that \u201cthe meat and potatoes in this case are what [M] says and what the accused says____\u201d Record at 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">A redacted copy of the appellant\u2019s testimony at his original trial was entered into evidence as Prosecution Exhibit 4. Over defense objection, Prosecution Exhibit 4 was published in written form to the members, and the members were allowed to take the exhibit with them into the deliberation room. The appellant did not testify in his own defense on the merits. During argument,' trial counsel reiterated the importance of the appellant\u2019s former testimony as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">As I said, you\u2019ve got two important pieces of evidence in this case. Besides the testimony of [M], you have the statement of the accused as to what happened. I want to once again take you back to voir dire. At the very beginning of defense counsel\u2019s voir dire, she stood up here, and she asked every member of the panel, have you ever been accused wrongly? Have you ever been accused of something you didn\u2019t do? And everybody in the panel put their hand in the air \u2014 either right away something immediately came to mind, or after a moment or two of thought \u2014 the hands went up. Every single member put their hand in the air, and Colonel Siegel was extremely meticulous in going down to each panel member and asking them what their reactions were when they were wrongly accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">And do you remember what virtually everybody said? Anger. Where is the anger? Where\u2019s even a shred of righteous indignation here in what the accused has to say happened? He\u2019s not wrongly accused; this is a pedophile. This is a child molester rationalizing to himself and to the body before which he was testifying for what he had done. Rationalizing away his actions, it was a dream. I was working hours and hours and hours, and I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t know if it happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">Record at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Trial counsel again commented on Prosecution Exhibit 4 in his final argument as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">In Prosecution Exhibit 4, the accused says, \u2018When I was approached by the investigator, and he started talking to me about this, I thought that was a dream.\u201d When asked to clarify his answers, \u201cNo, not in my recollection.\u201d \u201cWhat did you mean by that? Did you mean that if you searched back through your memory, the answer is no?\u201d Like Colonel Siegel characterizes it? He\u2019s given an opportunity to clarify that answer, \u201cNo, not in my recollection.\u201d \u201cSo does that mean that you could have done this; that you could have done both of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>them, the rape and the indecent acts?\u201d If you look at the exhibit, he says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">This is a criminal who did the crimes he is charged with, and it\u2019s a child molester who did the child molest, and he\u2019s rationalizing in his own mind, and to the person he\u2019s talking to about how that could possibly have come about. That\u2019s what Prosecution Exhibit 4 is all about, and that\u2019s the determination you\u2019ll come to when you consider this in light of the other testimony in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Record at 844-45. Later in his final argument the trial counsel stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">There are two important pieces of evidence in this case, what [M] told you, and what the accused had to say about it. In your search for the truth I don\u2019t ask you to disregard everything else that happened in this trial; I ask you to consider it all. The rest of it is interesting, and most of it points to the accused as guilty, just like the two important pieces of evidence in this case do.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Record at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">On 12 April 1996, the members entered findings of guilty of the lesser included offense of attempted carnal knowledge and of indecent liberties with a child, in violation of Articles 80 and 134, UCMJ. After the sentencing hearing, the members sentenced the appellant to a dishonorable discharge, five years confinement, total forfeitures, and reduction to pay grade E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged on 16 July 1997. The record is once again before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">Having carefully reviewed the record of trial, the appellant\u2019s assignments of error, and the Government\u2019s response, we find merit in the appellant\u2019s first and second assignments of error<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and conclude that error materially prejudicial to the substantial rights of the appellant was committed. Arts. 59(a) and 66(c), UCMJ. We provide relief in our decretal paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">Use of the Appellant\u2019s Prior Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">\u201cThe right to testify on one\u2019s own behalf at a criminal trial has sources in several provisions of the Constitution. It is one of the rights that \u2018are essential to due process of law in a fair adversary process.\u2019\u201d <em>Rock v. Arkansas, </em>483 U.S. 44, 51, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987)(quoting <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 819, n. 15, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975)). <em>See United States v. West, </em>27 M.J. 223 (C.M.A.1988)(holding that constitutional due process considerations enter trial when evidentiary rule infringes impermissibly on right of defendant to testify). The decision whether to testify belongs to the accused. Standards for Criminal Justice \u00a7 4-5.2 (2d edition 1980); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>14 M.J. 700, 702 (N.M.C.M.R.1982). The exercise of the right to testify requires a tactical decision to be resolved between an accused and trial defense counsel. <em>See United States v. Pennycooke, </em>65 F.3d 9, 11 (3d Cir.l995)(holding that determination of whether defendant will, testify is an important part of trial strategy best left to defendant and counsel without the intrusion of trial court, as that intrusion may have unintended effect of swaying defendant one way or the other.)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">\u201cWhen an accused testifies voluntarily as a witness, the accused thereby waives the privilege against self-incrimination with respect to the matters concerning which he or she so testifies.\u201d Mil.R.Evid. 301(e), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1984 ed.). <em>See Harrison v. United States, </em>392 U.S. 219, 222, 88 S.Ct. 2008, 20 L.Ed.2d 1047 (1968)(holding that defendant who chooses to testify waives privilege against compulsory self-incrimination with respect to the testimony and that waiver no less effective or complete because defendant motivated to take witness stand in first place only by reason of strength of lawful evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">In <em>Harrison, </em>the accused elected to testify after the Government introduced into evidence three confessions. On appeal, it was determined that the confessions were obtained illegally and should have been sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>pressed. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled, however, that the petitioner\u2019s prior testimony could be used against him at his new trial without regard to the confessions that had been introduced in evidence before he testified, since the accused had \u201cmade a conscious tactical decision to seek acquittal by taking the stand after [his] in-custody statements had been let in.\u201d <em>Harrison v. United States, </em>387 F.2d 203, 210 (D.C.Cir.1967). The Supreme Court overturned that decision, noting that the \u201cquestion is not <em>whether </em>the petitioner made a knowing decision to testify, but <em>why. </em>If he did so in order to overcome the impact of confessions illegally obtained and hence improperly introduced, then his testimony was tainted by the same illegality that rendered the confessions themselves inadmissible.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>392 U.S. at 223, 88 S.Ct. 2008 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The military judge at the appellant\u2019s second trial found that \u201cthere was no evidence of any ineffective assistance of counsel as to the decision of the accused to take the stand and testify; and, in fact, whatever ineffective assistance Mr. Edmunds may have been guilty of in that particular case really had nothing to do with the initial decision to have the accused take the stand and testify.\u201d Record at 137. We disagree and are convinced that the appellant testified as a direct consequence of the ineffective assistance provided to him by his civilian counsel. We agree with the military judge at the appellant\u2019s original trial who, in his findings of fact related to the post-trial motion for a mistrial, observed:</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">I find that there was no doubt between the two that Master Sergeant Murray was going to testify, and, indeed, the testimony of Master Sergeant Murray was a necessary predicate for the testimony of Dr. Light-ner.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Lightner was prepared to come to trial and to testify and offer opinions as to the facts as evidenced by the testimony of Master Sergeant Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">I specifically find that Mr. Edmunds \u2014 I believe that Mr. Edmunds, when he called Master Sergeant Murray, knew full well that Master Sergeant Murray was not going to unequivocally deny, but, indeed, was going to equivocate. That was the theory of the case in my opinion. Whether or not Master Sergeant Murray ever had it\u2014 well, whether or not it was an express verbal agreement between the two or understanding or whether it was unspoken, I find that Mr. Edmunds, and I am focusing it upon him now, had no doubts and understood that Master Sergeant Murray was to testify to tell the story. And again, that story was known to the defense team; that story was the basis for the consultation and the referral to Dr. Lightner and the use of Dr. Lightner\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"aih-dedup-0\">Original Record at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-10\">In essence, the testimony of the appellant was the foundation for a defense that CAAF found was not a legal defense to the most serious charge (rape); was poorly presented; neither tested nor attacked the Government evidence; did not represent an affirmative defense; and, resulted in a total breakdown of the adversarial process. <em>Murray, </em>42 M.J. at 178. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant did not voluntarily testify at his first trial and thus did not effectively waive his right against self-incrimination. Mil.R.Evid. 310(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Additionally, although there was no illegally obtained evidence introduced by the Government which precipitated the appellant\u2019s testimony, that testimony was the direct result of the denial of the appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Allowing the Government to use that testimony on the merits, brought the taint of the constitutional error of the first trial into the second trial. In <em>Harrison, </em>the Supreme Court found that \u201c[t]he exclusion of an illegally procured confession and of any testimony obtained in its wake deprive[d] the Government of nothing to which it ha[d] any lawful claim and create[d] no impediment to legitimate methods of investigating and prosecuting crime [and] ... no more than restore[d] the situation that would have pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676-678\">*676-678</page-number>vailed if the Government had itself obeyed the law.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>392 U.S. at 224, 88 S.Ct. 2008. We find that the exclusion of testimony obtained in the wake of the denial of an individual\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel deprives the Government of nothing to which it has any lawful claim and creates no impediment to legitimate methods of investigating and prosecuting crime, and no more than restores the situation that would have prevailed if the appellant had not been so denied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Thus, we conclude that the military judge erred in admitting the prior testimony of the appellant on the merits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This error was compounded by the publication of the testimony in written form and allowing the members to take the testimony with them into the deliberation room.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Applying the test established in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), to this \u201cfederal constitutional error,\u201d we are unable \u201cto declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The interests of justice require that the findings be reversed because the introduction of the appellant\u2019s former testimony materially prejudiced the appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">Accordingly, we set aside the findings and sentence. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General. A rehearing may be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">Chief Judge DeCICCO and Judge ANDERSON concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-24\">. The military judge merged the indecent acts and rape offenses, dismissing the former.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b866-8\">. The court wrote that:</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The military judge deduced \u2014 and correctly so in our view \u2014 that Mr. Edmunds\u2019 theory of the defense was to concede that the acts occurred but to defend on the ground that appellant was suffering from sleep deprivation at the time ... There are several problems with Mr. Edmunds\u2019 theory of the defense. First, as he frankly admitted, it was not a defense to rape. Second, as the military judge found, the defense was poorly presented. Finally, it was contrary to the wishes of appellant, who \u2014 according to Mr. Edmunds' own testimony \u2014 told Mr. Ed-munds that he wanted to testify and deny that he committed the offenses.... Mr. Edmunds had a choice of testing and attacking the government evidence or conceding that the acts occurred and presenting an affirmative defense. He did neither. This was a total breakdown of the adversarial process in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"a8d-dedup-0\"><em>Murray, </em>42 M.J. at 178.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b866-14\">.
