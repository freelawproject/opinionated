On our own motion, pursuant to Rule 7-1 (a) of our Internal Rules, we elected to reconsider that opinion, and it was withdrawn pursuant to our order issued on 18 November 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-21\">Contrary to his pleas, appellant was convicted by members of rape and wrongfully possessing alcohol while under 21 years of age in violation of Articles 120 and 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 920, 934. He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge and confinement for 3 years and 6 months. The convening authority reduced the confinement to 24 months but otherwise approved the sentence as adjudged. The appellant challenges the factual sufficiency of the finding of guilty of rape and the decision to allow testimony about his character for truthfulness. He also challenges the military judge\u2019s failure to admit the results of his polygraph, but this issue has been resolved adversely to the appellant. <em>United States v. Scheffer, </em>523 U.S. 303, 308-09,118 S.Ct. 1261,140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-22\">I. Admission of the Opinion on the Appellant\u2019s Character for Truthfulness</p>\n<p id=\"b922-23\">One of the investigators who interviewed the appellant was called as a witness by the prosecution. He testified about the appellant\u2019s statements to him. During cross-examination the appellant attempted to demonstrate that his statements were consistent and by implication more worthy of belief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>than the victim. Thereafter, the military judge, over a timely objection by trial defense counsel, permitted the appellant\u2019s first sergeant to offer his opinion of the appellant\u2019s character for truthfulness. A military judge has broad discretion to make rulings on the admission or exclusion of evidence. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>44 M.J. 27, 31 (1996). Therefore, our standard of review for this issue is abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">a. Admissibility of the Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The appellant argues this opinion evidence should not have been admitted under Mil.R.Evid. 806 because admissions under Mil.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A) are not covered by Mil.R.Evid. 806. He also contends the witness was not qualified to offer the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">Mil.R.Evid. 801(d) provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is an:</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">(2) Admission by party-opponent. The statement is offered against a party and is (A) the party\u2019s own statement in either the party\u2019s individual or representative capacity.....</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Mil.R.Evid. 806 provides in part,</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Mil.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E), has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of the declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had testified as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">The appellant\u2019s argument initially appears to have merit because subsections (A) and (B) of Mil.R.Evid. 801(d)(2), like their Federal counterparts, are not addressed by Rule 806. Therefore, it would appear that a party\u2019s own statement or adopted statement, once admitted under the rule, could not be attacked. However, anytime a party opponent\u2019s statement is entered into evidence, the finder of fact must determine the proponent\u2019s credibility. Thus, excluding attacks on the speaker\u2019s credibility simply because Rule 806 fails to list it appears unreasonable. Unfortunately, we have found no cases from the service courts or our senior court that address this exact issue. However, Mil.R.Evid. 806 is taken from the Federal Rule without change. Drafter\u2019s Analysis, <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, </em>A22-55 (1995 ed.). \u201cIn the absence of any indication that the drafters\u2019 intent was, nonetheless, for a different meaning and application, the same requirement should be ascribed to the military rule as to the federal rule.\u201d <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>42 M.J. 355, 357 (1995) (Wiss, J., concurring) (citing <em>United States v. Powell, </em>22 M.J. 141, 143 (C.M.A.1986)); S. Saltzburg, et al., <em>Military Rules of Evidence Manual </em>843 (3d ed.1991). Two federal circuits have rejected the argument now raised by the appellant because it is contrary to the intent of Rule 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-13\">In <em>United States v. Velasco, </em>953 F.2d 1467, 1473 (7th Cir.1992), where the identical argument was made, the court, in footnote 5, said,</p>\n<p id=\"ajy-dedup-0\">Although the quoted language does not specifically include statements defined in 801(d)(2)(A), the rule under which Garcia-Caban\u2019s statement came in, Rule 806 is not inapplicable: \u201cThe committee considered it unnecessary to include statements contained in rule 801(d)(2)(A) and (B) \u2014 the statement by the party-opponent himself or the statement of which he has manifested his <em>adoption </em>\u2014 because <em>the credibility of the party-opponent is always subject to an attack on his credibility </em>[sic].\u201d <em>Notes Of The Committee On The Judiciary, </em>S. REP. No. 1277, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 7051, 7069 n.28 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">The Seventh Circuit reaffirmed this holding in <em>United States v. Dent, </em>984 F.2d 1453,1460 (7th Cir.1993). The First Circuit adopted this view in <em>United States v. Shay, </em>57 F.3d 126,132 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">We discern no reason to apply Mil.R.Evid. 801 and 806 any differently. <em>Sutton, </em>42 M.J. at 357 (Wiss, J., concurring). Although the appellant\u2019s statements were admitted through the testimony of a prosecution witness, his defense counsel sought to show that those various statements were consistent and entitled to more weight than the victim\u2019s varying accounts. Therefore, the military judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the prosecution to offer opinion testimony about the appellant\u2019s character for truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>b. Foundation for the Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The appellant\u2019s former first sergeant at the 338th Training Squadron was called by the prosecution to provide testimony on a variety of matters, including his opinion of the appellant\u2019s character for truthfulness. The appellant had been assigned to the squadron for about one month prior to the rape and the first sergeant had no significant contact with him during that period. However, after the rape, the appellant received two Article 15s for minor disciplinary infractions. One of these infractions involved the appellant\u2019s lying to his supervisor about an appointment with his reserve/guard liaison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The appellant objected and the military judge heard the witness\u2019 testimony in an Article 39a, UCMJ, session. The military judge ruled,</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">MJ: Okay, I believe that constitutes adequate foundation for forming an opinion as to character for truthfulness. Truthfulness is one of those virtues, which can essentially be surrendered only once before people can form an adverse opinion as to that individual. So, in that sense, there is adequate basis presented in the form of foundation for the opinion, and I\u2019ll let you proceed with the members on that, Captain Kinslow, but I\u2019ll caution you to narrowly confine the witness\u2019 testimony to explaining that he has had certain contacts with the accused and, based upon those contacts with the accused, he has formed an opinion and then relating what his opinion is.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">ATC: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">MJ: Then it\u2019s up to the defense, to the extent to which they wish to cross-examine on that subject, and they can certainly pin it down to the fact that it\u2019s based upon one explanation of the accused\u2019s whereabouts at the time he was supposed to be at a detail if they wish. Do you understand that, Captain Tait?</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">ADC: Yes, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Although the first sergeant tried to embellish the basis for his opinion in front of the members, the military judge gave a curative instruction to them when the trial resumed the next day and during instructions on findings that left no doubt the opinion was based upon the single incident of lying to the supervisor. The appellant complains that this single incident of lying did not provide the first sergeant with an adequate foundation to express an opinion about his character for truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">\u201cTo lay a proper foundation for opinion evidence, the proponent must show that the character witness personally knows the witness and is acquainted with the witness well enough to have had an opportunity to form an opinion of the witness\u2019 character for truthfulness.\u201d <em>United States v. Toro, </em>37 M.J. 313, 317 (C.M.A.1993). \u201cOpinion evidence differs from reputation evidence as to its foundational requirements. The witness need not be a member of the community or unit to have known appellant long enough to have formed an opinion as to his character____\u201d <em>United States v. Breeding, </em>44 M.J. 345, 350 (1996). There can be no dispute that the first sergeant \u201cpersonally\u201d knew the appellant. The only issue is whether he was \u201cacquainted\u201d with the appellant well enough to have formed an opinion as to his character for truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">The appellant has cited three cases in support of his argument that the first sergeant did not have a sufficient contact with him to form an opinion about character for truthfulness. All three, however, are distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>United States v. Perner, </em>14 M.J. 181, 184-85 (C.M.A.1982), our superior court held that a psychiatric technician who saw the accused\u2019s wife professionally on three occasions did not enjoy a sufficiently close relationship to express an opinion as to untruthfulness because his opinion was based upon her \u201cerratic, basically immature, unpredictable\u201d personality which did \u201cnot necessarily support his opinions as to her credibility____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 185. Therefore, the nature of the witness\u2019 contact with the witness that formed the basis for his opinion was the crucial factor in the court\u2019s decision, not the number of contacts. Here, the first sergeant\u2019s opinion was based on the appellant\u2019s actual lack of truthfulness and not a hypothesis about truthfulness based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>personality traits. <em>See United States v. Dimberio, </em>52 M.J. 550 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">In <em>United States v. Dotson, </em>799 F.2d 189, 193 (5th Cir.1986), the accused, a convicted felon, was found guilty of three counts of receiving firearms. In rebuttal to the defense of necessity, the prosecution called four government agents who conducted the investigation against the accused to testify that, in their opinion, the accused and his supporting witnesses were untruthful. The court found that only one of the four agents had a sufficient basis to offer an opinion about truthfulness and that the other agents\u2019 opinions amounted to nothing more than bare assertions. The court, in reversing the conviction, held that a witness\u2019 opinion must be \u201crationally based on the perception of the witness and [ ] be helpful to the jury in determining the fact of credibility,\u201d and if the opinion does not meet this criteria, \u201cit should not become a part of the proof in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 193. The testimony of the appellant\u2019s first sergeant was more than speculation because it was based upon his personal knowledge of the appellant\u2019s false statement relating to his military duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Finally, the appellant cites <em>Wilson v. City of Chicago, </em>6 F.3d 1233 (7th Cir.1993), but this case is not the talisman he suggests. In <em>Wilson, </em>the plaintiff brought a civil rights action against police officers and the city of Chicago. The trial judge excluded the testimony of a British journalist called by the plaintiff concerning the credibility of a key defense witness. While the court found that the journalist had a sufficient basis to testify from both personal opinion and reputation in the community that the defense witness had a bad character for truthfulness, it also found he could not base his opinion on the fact that the defense witness provided him with two pieces of false gossip about a cousin of the Queen of England. Gossip by its very definition is inherently unreliable and speculative in nature. However, the first sergeant\u2019s opinion was not based on idle talk or rumor. Instead, it was based on the appellant\u2019s he.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">In <em>Wilson, </em>Chief Judge Posner wrote that one or two lies do not amount to a character for untruthfulness. If appellant\u2019s view of <em>Wilson </em>is correct for our purposes, the rhetorical question then becomes how many lies are enough? We believe the proper context in which to analyze this issue is that, in evaluating whether a witness is qualified to offer an opinion about an individual\u2019s truthfulness, it is not the number of lies which the witness has knowledge the individual has told but rather the nature of the falsehood that is crucial. Does the lie constitute a violation of the law? Does the lie involve a significant or trivial matter? Was the he offered before or after an event? How recent is the lie? In short, lying about one\u2019s weight is not as significant as lying about complying with applicable technical guidance when reinstalling a jet engine. In military society, however, individuals assigned together on short notice and for short periods of time must rely on each other while performing hazardous duties. The simple truth of this reality is that a single he can have a disproportionate impact on a person, unit, or mission.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">In reviewing the facts here, the evidence demonstrates that the first sergeant\u2019s opinion was based on his personal knowledge that the appehant hed to his supervisor, not speculation. The he involved the appellant\u2019s military duties and was a distinct offense under the UCMJ. The appehant hed to his supervisor beforehand, in order to avoid duty. The he occurred after the appehant was already under investigation for rape. Under these circumstances, we find the first sergeant was qualified to offer an opinion concerning the appellant\u2019s character for truthfulness. The appehant emphasized to the members that the opinion was based on a single incident. Although the military judge made it clear to the appehant that he was free to explore the incident with the witness during cross-examination, the appehant elected not to probe the matter further. The members were free to attach whatever weight they deemed appropriate to the opinion. This was appropriate and not an abuse of discretion. Further, even if it was error to admit this opinion evidence, the appellant was not prejudiced because the evidence of his guilt was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>II. Factual Sufficiency of the Evidence of Rape</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The appellant claims the evidence is factually insufficient because it proves the victim consented to sexual intercourse with him. In reviewing findings for factual sufficiency, our standard of review is whether, after weighing the evidence in the record of trial and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses, we ourselves are convinced of the appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 325 (C.M.A.1987). We must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, proof of every element and fact of the charged offense. We do not require that the evidence be free from conflict. <em>United States v. Lips, </em>22 M.J. 679, 684 (A.F.C.M.R.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">Our review of the record convinces us, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant\u2019s asserted belief that the victim consented was not honest and reasonable. <em>United States v. True, </em>41 M.J. 424 (1995); <em>United States v. Mathai, </em>34 M.J. 33 (C.M.A.1992); <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>33 M.J. 7 (C.M.A.1991); <em>United States v. Langley, </em>33 M.J. 278 (C.M.A.1991). We are convinced that the evidence is factually sufficient to sustain the appellant\u2019s conviction for rape. Article 66(c), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">Accordingly, the findings and the sentence are</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Chief Judge SNYDER and Senior Judge SENANDER<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-15\">.
