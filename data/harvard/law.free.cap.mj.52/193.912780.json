Appellant also was charged with indecent assault, in violation of Article 134, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 934, but he was convicted only of the lesser-included offense of assault consummated by a battery, in violation of Article 128, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 928. The court-martial sentenced appellant to a bad-conduct discharge and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority approved the sentence but suspended the bad-conduct discharge for 24 months from the date of his action. The Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence. 47 MJ 695 (1997). This Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED BY WITHHOLDING DOCUMENTS, AFTER AN <em>IN CAMERA </em>REVIEW, FROM THE DEFENSE WHICH CONSISTED OF THE ALLEGED VICTIM\u2019S MEDICAL AND FAMILY SERVICE CENTER RECORDS WHICH CONTAINED REFERENCES TO SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">For the reasons set out below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">Appellant and the victim, Lance Corporal (LCpl) CM, worked together as cooks and described themselves as \u201cgood friends.\u201d CM testified that they did not have a romantic or sexual relationship. They spent off-duty time together, \u201c[jjust hanging out\u201d in each other\u2019s barracks rooms, CM\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s room, or their workplace. LCpl CM testified that, \u201c[a]t times,\u201d they had conversations of a sexual nature. She testified that she and appellant gave each other back rubs, that appellant massaged the calves of her legs on one occasion, and that on two or three occasions appellant straddled her in bed to massage her back and shoulders. Asked if she remembered testifying previously that she and appellant sometimes fell asleep together, she responded, \u201cI don\u2019t remember ever saying that, occasionally, we did that.\u201d She testified further that she did not remember appellant lying down next to her. LCpl CM denied having any contact of a sexual nature with appellant before the incident underlying the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">Contrary to CM\u2019s denial that they had any sexual contact, appellant testified their friendship \u201cprogressed into a more physical touching and things of that nature.\u201d He testified that he had fondled her breast on one occasion and touched her vagina on another occasion. He testified that CM had squeezed his buttocks while he was working at the grill in the mess hall, and fondled his genitals while they were both sitting on his bunk in the barracks. Appellant testified that the fondling in the barracks happened while appellant\u2019s roommate was present, and the roommate corroborated appellant\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>On May 29, 1995, the day of the alleged offense, appellant visited CM in her barracks room four times. Approximately 30 minutes into the final visit, they began to talk about their relationship. At this point, their respective versions of the events diverge.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">CM testified that appellant told her that he \u201ccared deeply\u201d about her. She responded that she \u201cliked him, too \u2014 as a friend; but that nothing more than that could become of it,\u201d because she had a boyfriend. Appellant responded that they could be secret lovers. CM testified that appellant then took off his shorts and was nude from the waist down. CM was wearing a robe with nothing underneath. She testified that appellant got on top of her and was fondling her. She told \u201chim to get away from\u201d her, and he responded by saying, \u201c[W]e can keep this a secret; and you\u2019re going to like it; I know you want it.\u201d She testified that appellant sucked on her breasts and her neck, and grabbed one of her hands and placed it on his penis. She \u201csqueezed one of his testicles,\u201d causing him to \u201clet out a yell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">CM testified that the door of her barracks room was \u201ccracked open\u201d and that she and appellant were \u201cfighting and screaming and yelling\u201d the whole time, for about 20-30 minutes. She told him to get off her 4 or 5 times, but \u201che was trying to shut [her] up, and he sucked on [her] neck harder.\u201d Eventually LCpl CM told appellant \u201cto get the f\u2014 off me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">CM testified that \u201c[a]s soon as appellant got up, he said, \u2018I feel so stupid. I thought you wanted it.\u2019 \u201d She testified that appellant said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody anything, because it can be a big legal thing, and I could get in trouble; and you\u2019ll go crazy.\u201d Later, CM walked with appellant to the dining hall and barracks recreation area, and talked with several Marines before returning to her room for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">That night, CM\u2019s boyfriend noticed the \u201chickeys\u201d on her neck. He became angry, thinking that she had been cheating on him. CM testified that she first told her boyfriend that she had been cheating on him, because she wanted to hide the incident with appellant from him. As he started asking her with whom she had been cheating, she told him that appellant had attacked her.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">On the next day, after discussing the incident with another female Marine, CM reported the incident to her first sergeant and then to an agent of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Appellant\u2019s testimony regarding the incident differed significantly from CM\u2019s. He testified that CM asked him \u201cin a sexy tone or seductive tone\u201d how he felt about her. He told her, \u201cI like you a lot, I think you\u2019re fine.\u201d Appellant testified that CM responded that \u201cshe didn\u2019t know that that\u2019s the way [he] felt.\u201d Then she leaned forward and put her head on his chest, turned her head and kissed him on the neck. Appellant kissed her on the neck and ear lobe and began rubbing her hip, and she responded by moaning and saying that he was making her \u201chorny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">Appellant testified that when he attempted to kiss her on the lips, she said, \u201cNo, not on the lips.\u201d He stopped momentarily and then resumed kissing her on the neck. After more mutual kissing, appellant leaned CM back onto the bed. Her robe fell open and appellant began kissing her on the top of her breast. He testified that she responded by continuing to Mss him, moan, and say he was making her \u201chorny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Appellant testified that he then removed his shorts and underwear, and CM laughed or smirked and said, \u201cOh, my god.\u201d He placed her hand on his genitals, and she did not respond. He then lay on top of her, and they engaged in more mutual Mssihg and hugging. He testified that, \u201call of a sudden, she said, \u2018Stop,\u2019 \u201d in a \u201c[s]oft and sexy\u201d tone of voice. He said, \u201cWhat?\u201d and Mssed her. She again said, \u201cStop it\u201d in a \u201creal soft\u201d voice. Appellant testified that he asked her, \u201cWhat, are you toying with me?\u201d She then said, in a command tone, \u201cStop, get the f\u2014 off me.\u201d Appellant got off immediately. He testified that there was no screaming and yelling during the entire episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">He testified that he was upset and confused. CM told him, \u201cDon\u2019t tell nobody.\u201d He responded, \u201c[W]hy would I tell anybody, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>because I\u2019m the one that\u2019s married.\u201d At her request, appellant followed CM to the mess hall.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Appellant made two pretrial statements that were received in evidence. On May 30, 1995, the day after the incident, appellant was interviewed by an NCIS agent and provided a sworn statement. Appellant\u2019s trial testimony was generally consistent vrith this statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">On June 14, 1995, appellant was interviewed again and provided a second sworn statement. This statement was more incriminating than his first statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In this second statement, appellant said that he started kissing CM and became sexually aroused. He said that CM would not allow him to Mss her on the lips. He admitted that CM pushed him away when he began fondling her breast. He stated that he is \u201cvery aggressive\u201d when he has sex and he \u201cdid not notice her pushing [him] away.\u201d He stated that he \u201cjust thought she was playing hard to get.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Appellant stated that he then removed his clothing and opined that CM may have been frighten\u00e9d by the size of his penis. He admitted forcing her to touch it. He admitted attempting to fondle her genitals but said that CM \u201ckept pushing [his] hands away.\u201d He concluded his statement with the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">I do recall [CM] repeatedly telling me to get off of her but I did not take her seriously. I really thought she was trying to play hard to get. At that very moment I was not listening closely to what she was telling me because all I was thinMng about was having sex with her. After several minutes of [CM] telling me to get off of her, I did hear her tell me loudly and in no uncertain words, \u201cStop, get the f[ \u2014 ] off of me.\u201d I then got off of her and I put my clothes back on. I told [CM] that I felt she was toying with me.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">I would like to explain that I am very aggressive when I engage in sexual course [sic]. I have on various occasions been told by different women that I am rough and aggressive when I engage in sex. I guess I just got carried away with [CM].</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">I was not trying to scare [CM] nor was I trying to get her to do something she did not want to do. I am very sorry about what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">At trial, appellant repudiated the second statement and attempted to explain it away by testifying that he did not read it carefully. He testified that he trusted the NCIS agents to accurately record his answers to their questions and that he \u201cskimmed right through the statement\u201d without reading it carefully.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">Before the court-martial convened, appellant requested \u201call paperwork maintained by the Government (including files and records kept at MCAS [Marine Corps Air Station] El Toro, Camp Johnson, and Boot Camp) concerning [CM]\u2019s previous allegations of sexual harassment/assault/rape.\u201d The military judge ordered that these records be furnished to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-13\">Appellant also requested the following records:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-14\">[A]ll psychological and medical records of the alleged victim in the subject case, to include inpatient and outpatient medical records, counseling records maintained by the Family Service Center at MCAS El Toro and all other Family Service Centers that rendered assistance to the alleged victim, and to include the personal notes of the counselors and Doctors and Psychologists who evaluated and/or provided treatment to the alleged victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">The Government asserted that these records were irrelevant and that disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of CM\u2019s privacy. The military judge ordered that all such documents be delivered for his <em>in camera </em>review. Except for a statement the victim had made to her counselor concerning her recollection of the appellant\u2019s attack on the date in question, the military judge determined that these records did not include any information material to his defense. The records were sealed and attached to the original record of trial as Appellate Exhibit L(50).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">The theory of the defense was outlined in defense counsel\u2019s opening statement as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>[Bjefore I tell you what evidence you are going to hear from the defense and the Government in this case, basically, referring to the assault, I want to make one thing absolutely clear. Lance Corporal Morris did kiss Lance Corporal [CM] on the neck, on the cheek, between the breasts. No dispute. He did suck on her breasts as well. No dispute. And he did pull her hand to his erect penis. This is all going to be clear. Not in dispute. The only issue in dispute, an issue that you\u2019re really going to have to focus on during this week is whether he did it against her will and without her consent, with unlawful force and violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Appellant now asserts that the military judge erred by refusing to release medical records diagnosing LCpl CM as suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and counseling records describing her as having difficulty controlling her impulses. Appellant argues that this information should have been disclosed because it related to CM\u2019s credibility and her motive to fabricate the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The Government asserts that the information withheld by the military judge was irrelevant. The Government argues that, even if it was relevant, any error in refusing to disclose it was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Article 46, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 846 provides: \u201cThe trial counsel, the defense counsel, and the court-martial shall have equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence in accordance with such regulations as the President may prescribe.\u201d The President has promulgated RCM 701 and 703, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998 edition),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to implement Article 46. <em>See </em>Drafters\u2019 Analysis of RCM 701 and 703, Manual, <em>supra </em>at A21-31 and A21-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">RCM 701(a)(2)(B) entitles the defense, upon request, \u201cto inspect ... [a]ny results or reports of physical or mental examinations ... which are within the possession, custody, or control of military authorities, the existence of which is known or by the exercise of due diligence may become known to the trial counsel, and which are material to the preparation of the defensef.]\u201d RCM 701(h) defines \u201cinspect\u201d as including photographing and copying. RCM 701(g) places responsibility for regulating discovery on the military judge. RCM 703(a) gives the prosecution and the defense \u201cequal opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence, including the benefit of compulsory process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">The key question when discovery is denied is whether the information or evidence that was not disclosed was \u201cmaterial to the preparation of the defense.\u201d In <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676,105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481, the Supreme Court \u201crejected any ... distinction between impeachment evidence and exculpatory evidence.\u201d In accordance with <em>Bagley, </em>this Court has specifically held that \u201c[ijmpeachment evidence ... can obviously be material evidence at a criminal trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Watson, </em>31 MJ 49, 54-55 (1990). Impeachment \u201cevidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682,105 S.Ct. 3375. The determination of materiality \u201ccalls for assessment of the omission in light of the evidence in \u2018the entire record.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Stone, </em>40 MJ 420, 423 (CMA 1994), quoting <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 112, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). In applying \u201cthe \u2018materiality1 test, we give the benefit of any reasonable doubt to the military accused.\u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>37 MJ 88, 90 (CMA 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-13\">In <em>United States v. Eshalomi, </em>23 MJ 12 (1986), this Court set out the standard for reviewing the prosecution\u2019s nondisclosure of evidence. Where the defense has submitted \u201ca general request for exculpatory evidence or information\u201d but no request for any \u201cparticular item\u201d of evidence or information, failure to disclose evidence \u201cis reversible error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>only \u2018if the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, quoting <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. at 112, 96 S.Ct. 2392.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">An appellate court reviews a military judge\u2019s decision on a request for discovery for abuse of discretion. Because the determination of materiality is a question of law, we review the military judge\u2019s ruling <em>de novo. United States v. Charles, </em>40 MJ 414, 417 (CMA 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The undisclosed evidence might have added some credibility to appellant\u2019s trial testimony and his first statement to NCIS by making his description of CM\u2019s conflicting signals and sudden change of mood more believable in light of her mental condition. It might also have suggested that CM\u2019s poor impulse control and confused self-image might have caused her to falsely accuse appellant of sexually assaulting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">We need not decide, however, whether the military judge abused his discretion, because, under the particular facts of this case, disclosure of CM\u2019s records would not have \u201ccreate[d] a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Eshalo-mi, supra. </em>Appellant provided compelling evidence of his guilt. His second statement totally undermined the defense theory that CM consented to his sexual advances. In his second pretrial statement, he repudiated the description of the incident to which he testified at trial. He was forced to attempt to explain his conflicting sworn statements. In his second statement, he admitted that he did \u201cforce her to touch\u201d his genitals. He admitted that CM pushed him away when he began fondling her. He attempted to explain his conduct by saying that he is \u201cvery aggressive\u201d in his sexual activities. He admitted that CM repeatedly told him to get off her, but he \u201cdid not take her seriously,\u201d because he \u201cthought she was trying to play hard to get.\u201d He admitted that he was \u201cnot listening closely to what she was telling [him] because all [he] was thinking about was having sex with her.\u201d He concluded his statement by apologizing and explaining that he \u201cjust got carried away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">On the basis of the entire record, we have no \u201creasonable doubt [about] the validity of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Watson, supra </em>at 55. We are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that disclosure of CM\u2019s medical and counseling records would not have produced a different outcome. <em>See United States v. Briggs, </em>48 MJ 143, 144 (1998) (no abuse of discretion in denying discovery motion where appellant confessed).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-10\"> All Manual references are the same version as applicable at trial, unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b390-10\">EFFRON, Judge, in which SULLIVAN, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A7b\">joins (dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">I agree with the majority that \u201c[t]he undisclosed evidence might have added some credibility to appellant\u2019s trial testimony and his first statement to NCIS by making his description of CM\u2019s conflicting signals and sudden change of mood more believable in light of her mental condition.\u201d I also agree with the majority\u2019s view that the undisclosed evidence \u201cmight also have suggested that CM\u2019s poor impulse control and confused self-image might have caused her to falsely accuse appellant of sexually assaulting her.\u201d 52 MJ at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">In light of these observations, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">Prior to trial, defense counsel learned that CM may have made a prior accusation of sexual assault not involving appellant. The Government provided paperwork related to that allegation of sexual assault, as directed by the military judge. The defense requested a full range of medical and psychological records pertaining to CM\u2019s reaction to that alleged sexual assault. The Government objected, and the military judge ordered all medical and psychological records on CM produced for an <em>in camera </em>inspection. Thereafter, the military judge ruled that only one of the 25 pages he had reviewed was relevant to the defense, but he failed to articulate any standard for his determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>as to which material should be released. The judge ordered all nonreleased records sealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">The sealed records indicate that CM had reported being raped by another person only 6 months before the incident at issue in the present case. The records also indicate that she was diagnosed at the Naval Hospital Camp LeJeune as suffering from post-trau-matie stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the earlier rape. Additionally, the records include counseling documents containing a notation that CM had \u201ctrouble controlling her impulses.\u201d Appellate exhibit L.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u201c\u2018Military law provides a much more direct and generally broader means of discovery by an accused than is normally available to him in civilian courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Reece, </em>25 MJ 93, 94 (CMA 1987), <em>quoting United States v. Mougenel, </em>6 MJ 589, 591 (AFCMR 1978), <em>pet. denied, </em>6 MJ 194 (1979). When there is a defense discovery request under RCM 701(a)(2), Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (1998), the Government is required to \u201cpermit the defense to inspect: (A) Any ... papers ... which are within the possession, custody, or control of military authorities and which are <em>material to the preparation of the </em>defense----\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See also Reece, supra </em>at 95 (\u201cThe only restrictions placed upon the liberal discovery of documentary evidence by the accused are that the evidence must be \u2018relevant and necessary to the subject matter of the inquiry, and the request must be reasonable.\u201d). In the present case, I would hold that the military judge erred by declining to release information material to the preparation of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">According to the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>424 (4th ed.1994), PTSD may include intense distress or physiological reactions when the sufferer is exposed to a triggering event that is akin to, or that symbolizes some aspect of, the traumatic event at the foundation of the disorder. The symptom of \u201cpersistent reexperiencjng of the traumatic event\u201d can result from prior sexual assault, among other possible causes of stress. \u201cThe disorder may be especially severe or long lasting when the stressor is of human design (e.g., torture, rape).\u201d As the majority acknowledges, the information about CM\u2019s PTSD \u201cmight have added some credibility to appellant\u2019s trial testimony and his first statement to NCIS____\u201d Appellant\u2019s version of the events in CM\u2019s apartment reflects her abrupt, unexplained, and seemingly unexplainable mood change \u2014 from sensual and consensual to a sharp demand to stop. Without the PTSD evidence, the members were left to wonder why a supposedly close and intimate friend would suddenly reverse moods in the midst of purportedly consensual sexual activity. With that information \u2014 and with expert testimony explaining PTSD and applying it to the events in this case \u2014 the members would have had the opportunity to consider a plausible explanation, which they could choose to accept or reject, for CM\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">Similarly, the psychological evidence that CM had \u201ctrouble controlling her impulses\u201d would have provided the court members with an opportunity to consider a plausible explanation in support of the evidence that CM, while dating another man, permitted herself to be in a compromising position with appellant. The morning after the incident with appellant, CM\u2019s boyfriend inquired about marks on her neck, and she initially responded that she had been cheating on him, at which point he became enraged. This information would have set the stage for the members to consider whether CM fabricated the allegations of sexual assault to assuage the anger of her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">The undisclosed evidence in issue here \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>See Strickler v. Greene, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 1952, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (1999), quoting <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). The undisclosed evidence could have been used to raise the possibility that, with respect to CM, the combination of PTSD and CM\u2019s \u201ctrouble controlling her impulses\u201d placed her in a compromising position with appellant and could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>caused her sudden shift of attitude. Under these circumstances, I conclude that there is \u201ca reasonable probability\u201d that the members would have been inclined to accept the defense theory that this was a consensual situation in which the alleged victim fabricated the allegations of assault. <em>See </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 119 S.Ct. at 1953, citing <em>Kyles, supra </em>at 434,115 S.Ct. 1555.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Because the sealed records contained information that was \u201cmaterial to the preparation of the defense,\u201d the military judge abused his discretion to appellant\u2019s prejudice when he precluded defense access to it. <em>See </em>Art. 46, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 846; ROM 701(a)(2)(A) and 703(a). I would set aside the findings and sentence and authorize a rehearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b392-9\">SULLIVAN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AL8\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">I agree with Judge Effron\u2019s view of this case and join his separate opinion. In addition, I must note my further disagreement with the majority\u2019s approach to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">The core issue is whether relevant medical records of the rape victim should have been furnished to the defense. In my view, the majority\u2019s repetition of the detailed descriptions of the sex acts from the record is unnecessary and distracts the Court from deciding the issue before it. <em>See United States v. Hensler, </em>44 MJ 184, 189 (1996) (Sullivan, J., dissenting in part and concurring in the result).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
