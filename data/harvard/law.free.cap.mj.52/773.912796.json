Contrary to his pleas, a panel of officers and enlisted members convicted Staff Sergeant (SSG) Kelly of communicating a threat in violation of Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 834. The convening authority approved the sentence to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for one year, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El; and in an act of clem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ency, suspended the confinement in excess of six months for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">Appellant initially raised six claims of error, either through appellate defense counsel or personally pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982). After oral argument on 15 April 1998, this court found merit in one contention, granted partial relief and affirmed the sentence. <em>See </em>Appendix. On appeal, appellant raised those contentions on which he was unsuccessful in this court; and for the first time, alleged that the application of Article 57(a)(1), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 857(a)(1) to his case would violate the ex post facto clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">On 29 April 1999, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces set aside our previous decision, and remanded the case for our determination of whether appellant was in the class of persons eligible for protection under <em>United States v. Gorski </em>47 M.J. 370 (1997). Our superior court also asked that we give further consideration to appellant\u2019s contention that the military judge abused his discretion when he denied trial defense counsel\u2019s request to examine the personnel file of the alleged threat victim for impeachment material.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">After additional oral argument, we conclude that while the military judge erred by not conducting an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the victim\u2019s personnel file, his failure to do so did not prejudice appellant. Finally, we find that appellant is entitled to those protections afforded by <em>Gorski</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">\n<em>DISCOVERY OF VICTIM\u2019S PERSONNEL FILE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">Prior to trial, appellant\u2019s defense counsel sought discovery of the personnel and medical records of SSG N, the noncommissioned officer to whom SSG Kelly was convicted of communicating a threat. Counsel\u2019s request was based on her belief that SSG N had a medical profile that limited his duty hours- and that his performance fiche contained a letter of reprimand that could potentially impeach SSG N\u2019s integrity and credibility. Trial defense counsel further asserted that SSG N had refused to speak with her until just before the court-martial was scheduled to begin, and during this interview, he had been unresponsive to questions surrounding his medical profile and hours of actual duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">During a contentious Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, prior to the entry of pleas, defense counsel renewed her request for inspection of the victim\u2019s personnel and medical records. Government counsel initially responded that SSG N\u2019s personnel file contained \u201cno Article 15\u2019s or letters of reprimand,\u201d and \u201cthose are the only things that the defense can question him on.\u201d Defense counsel insisted that she review the files because the \u201cgovernment\u2019s not in a position to unilaterally decide what evidence is relevant and what is not.\u201d She further asserted that she had \u201can eyewitness\u201d who had seen a letter of reprimand in SSG N\u2019s personnel file. Trial counsel then conceded that SSG N\u2019s personnel file contained an unfavorable letter, but that it was an addendum to a noncommissioned officer evaluation report (NCOER), and was \u201cnon-discoverable\u201d because it could not be used as a basis to cross-examine SSG N.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">The military judge directed trial counsel to produce this letter for the defense. After settling the issue of access to SSG N\u2019s medical records by providing the trial defense counsel with a redacted version of SSG N\u2019s profile,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defense counsel again requested to review SSG N\u2019s personnel file. At this point, trial counsel asked the military judge, to review the victim\u2019s Official Military Personnel File and provide defense counsel with anything the judge deemed relevant. Defense counsel initially opposed the idea. After the military judge denied the \u201cmotion\u201d for an <em>in camera </em>inspection of SSG N\u2019s record based on defense counsel\u2019s opposition, defense counsel acceded to the judge\u2019s inspection. The military judge declined to perform an <em>in camera </em>inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>\n<em>A. Disclosure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">In our system of military justice, the trial counsel enjoys a special status to insure \u201cjustice shall be done.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>47 M.J. 621, 625 (Army Ct.Crim.App.1997), affd, 50 M.J. 436 (1999). Encompassed within this special status is a duty to ensure that the broad, liberal, open, and generous practice of discovery created by Article 46, UCMJ, and the various Rules for Court-Martial implementing this article are carried out forthrightly and punctually. <em>See Williams, </em>50 M.J. at 439-40; <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>38 M.J. 376, 380 (C.M.A.1993); <em>cf. United States v. Abrams, </em>50 M.J. 361 (1999); <em>United States v. Reece, </em>25 M.J. 93 (C.M.A.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">This duty to disclose extends to impeachment as well as exculpatory evidence. <em>See United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 119 S.Ct. 1936,144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). \u201cEach party is entitled to the production of evidence which is relevant and necessary.\u201d Rule for Courts-Martial 703(f)(l)[hereinafter R.C.M.]; <em>see also Abrams, </em>50 M.J. at 362; <em>Reece, </em>25 M.J. at 95. Assuming, based on the military judge\u2019s ruling, that the letter incorporated into one of SSG N\u2019s evaluation reports contained derogatory information that potentially eould be used to impeach his credibility, the entire report, including the letter, was relevant, <em>see </em>Military Rule of Evidence 401 [hereinafter Mil.R.Evid.], and discoverable upon defense request. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 703(f)(1) discussion. Trial counsel\u2019s failure to promptly produce this evidence, as well as his equivocation in the courtroom, did not meet the expectations of military discovery practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">\n<em>B. Review of Personnel Files</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Unlike the situation in <em>Williams, </em>the defense counsel\u2019s discovery request in this case was directed to the specific type of records and information sought (a review of the entire 201 file to find information affecting SSG N\u2019s integrity and credibility). Thus, we are initially faced with the question of whether a defense counsel is entitled to inspect the official personnel file of a victim when that counsel distrusts the government\u2019s response to a discovery request, with or without a showing that the file contains material relevant and necessary to the defense case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">As the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces unanimously stated in <em>Abrams, </em>\u201cWe can well understand [the military judge\u2019s] respect for the confidentiality of another servicemember\u2019s personnel records and his interest in not opening them up to a blanket fishing expedition.\u201d 50 M.J. at 362. This is especially true in the case at hand where the victim had a \u201cterminal illness.\u201d While individual privacy concerns will always bend before the constitutional dictate of due process, there is no statutory or procedural imperative within the military justice system that permits a defense counsel <em>carte blanche </em>access to a victim\u2019s personnel records. Accordingly, the military judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the trial defense counsel unfettered access to SSG N\u2019s personnel records. '</p>\n<p id=\"b965-13\">We find this military judge erred by \u201crelying upon a judicial determination by government counsel,\u201d rather than inspecting the sought-after personnel records <em>in camera </em>and making his own decision on the need to furnish defense additional documentation. <em>See United States v. Briggs, </em>48 M.J. 143, 145 (1998); <em>U.S. v. Abrams, </em>50 M.J. at 361. \u2018Where a conflict arises between the defense search for information and the Government\u2019s need to protect information, the appropriate procedure is <em>\u2018in camera </em>review5 by a judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivers, </em>49 M.J. 434, 437 (1998)(citing <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39, 61, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">The record of trial clearly shows a distrust between counsel, of each other\u2019s motives in either using and protecting the material in SSG N\u2019s personnel file, as well as a genuine dispute concerning the discoveiy procedure. To resolve such matters and facilitate, not encumber, the litigation process, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>the military judge must review the contested documents, seal those not furnished to counsel, and attach them to the record of trial. <em>See Abrams, </em>50 M.J. at 363; <em>Rivers, </em>49 M.J. 434. Even though the judge failed to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review and attach SSG N\u2019s personnel records, we find no prejudice to this appellant. Not every violation of a trial counsel\u2019s duty to disclose or a military judge\u2019s duty to referee the discovery process warrants reversal. <em>See Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at -, 119 S.Ct. at 1948-19; <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419,115 S.Ct. 1555,131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">We find no reasonable probability that the result of trial would have been different in this case<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> if either the trial defense counsel or military judge had inspected SSG N\u2019s military personnel file. First, there is no evidence that the trial counsel, albeit belatedly, failed to disclose all potentially exculpatory or impeachment material in SSG N\u2019s file. <em>See Briggs, </em>48 M.J. at 144. Appellate defense counsel have not contested either the accuracy or honesty of trial counsel\u2019s representation to the trial court concerning the quantity or quality of unfavorable information contained in SSG N\u2019s personnel file. Defense counsel received a copy of the one item of unfavorable information that she believed existed and to which she was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">Second, the evidence before the factfinders clearly showed both personal and professional animosity between appellant and SSG N. Staff Sergeant N was SSG Kelly\u2019s replacement at Fort Benning. During their period of transition, prior to appellant\u2019s scheduled departure for warrant officer candidate school, their differing leadership styles and opinions of their subordinate personnel led to conflict. Defense counsel exploited this conflict, as well as SSG N\u2019s personal investigation of appellant\u2019s housing situation, to show SSG N was \u201cout to get\u201d SSG Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">As there were no eyewitnesses to the alleged threat, the credibility of the two NCOs was critical to both sides. Appellant testified that he was not even in the area on the date and at the time he allegedly threatened SSG N. The victim and Captain Martindale, an impartial observer and SSG N\u2019s supervisor, testified otherwise. Captain Martindale saw both appellant and SSG N leave the building in which she and SSG N worked at the time the victim reported the threat occurred. Captain Martindale also testified that SSG N was visibly upset and shaken when he reported the threat to her. This report occurred immediately after the threat was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">Finally, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the victim was thorough, but never referred directly to the unfavorable NCOER or addendum thereto. Defense counsel\u2019s attempt to question the victim about an equal opportunity complaint, that may have been the impetus for the unfavorable letter in his personnel file, was objectionable and properly kept out of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">Pursuant to our Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866, mandate, we have carefully reviewed the evidence and find that it establishes appellant\u2019s guilt to all offenses for which he was convicted beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">We find appellant is within the class of persons who are entitled to protection under <em>Gorsky </em>47 M.J. 370. Our original decision and its decretal paragraph of 10 June 1998 remain in effect. <em>See United States v. Ginn, </em>47 M.J. 236, 238 n. 2. In accordance with the Order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, dated 29 April 1999, the <em>Gorski </em>issue is referred to The Judge Advocate General for appropriate disposition. Accordingly, The Judge Advocate General will determine the amount of relief, if any, that is warranted, subject to any setoffs that may arise under law or regulations. There is no requirement that this matter be returned to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">Judge MERCK and Judge TRANT concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"AA3\">10 June 1998</p>\n<p id=\"b966-16\">Before JOHNSTON, SQUIRES, and ECKER, Appellate Military Judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-17\">MEMORANDUM OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b966-18\">PER CURIAM:</p>\n<p id=\"b966-19\">Pursuant to his pleas, appellant was convicted of three specifications involving larce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>ny of basic allowance for quarters (BAQ) and three specifications of fraud, in violation of Articles 121 and 132, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921 and 932 (1988) [hereinafter UCMJ]. Contrary to his plea, a panel of officers and enlisted members convicted Staff Sergeant (SSG) Kelly of communicating a threat in violation of Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (1988). Staff Sergeant Kelly was sentenced to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for one year, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El. The convening authority approved the sentence, and in an act of clemency, suspended the confinement in excess of six months for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Appellant raises six claims of error either through appellate defense counsel or personally pursuant to <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982). We find merit only in the contention that, under the facts of this case, appellant cannot properly be convicted of both making and presenting a fraudulent claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The facts are not in dispute. Appellant, by stipulation and oral admissions, established that he prepared a fraudulent Department of the Army Form 5960 (Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change Basie Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) and/or Variable Housing Allowance (VHA))(Specification 1, Charge II) and then immediately handed that form to a finance clerk for payment (Specification 2, Charge II). At trial, defense counsel moved to treat these specifications as either multi-plicious or as an unreasonable multiplication of charges. The military judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">The making and the presenting of a fraudulent claim, in violation of Article 132(1)(A) and (B), UCMJ, respectively, represent separate offenses. <em>United States v. Steele, </em>2 U.S.C.M.A. 379, 9 C.M.R. 9, 1953 WL 2595 (1953); <em>United States v. Leach, </em>5 U.S.C.M.A. 466,18 C.M.R. 90,1955 WL 3289 (1955). <em>See also </em>Legal and Legislative Basis, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1951 at 291, 292. However, case law also holds that under some circumstances, these offenses are so interrelated as to be virtually indistinguishable, thereby becoming but one offense. <em>Leach, </em>18 C.M.R. at 94; <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>24 C.M.R. 553, 1957 WL 4846 (A.F.B.R.1957). <em>Accord, </em>Rule for Courts-Martial 307(c)(4) discussion (\u201cWhat is substantially one transaction should not be made the basis for an unreasonable multiplication of charges ... \u201d). In appellant\u2019s case, he simultaneously made and presented the fraudulent claim. Accordingly, he committed only one offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge II are consolidated by inserting into Specification 1 the words \u201cand presenting\u201d after the word \u201cpreparing\u201d and deleting the words \u201cfor presentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">The finding of guilty of Specification 1 of Charge II, as so amended, is affirmed. The finding of guilty of Specification 2 of Charge II is set aside and that Specification is dismissed. The remaining findings of guilty are affirmed. Reassessing the sentence in light of the error noted and the entire record, the court affirms the sentence. <em>See United States v. Sales, </em>22 M.J. 305 (C.M.A.1986).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b964-9\">. The redacted profile showed the victim\u2019s permissible duty hours (0830-1530), but deleted any reference to the malady that caused his abbreviated work schedule. While the record of trial is silent as to the exact nature of SSG N\u2019s \u201cincurable disease,\u201d it is apparent that the litigants' pretrial posturing and courtroom behavior stemmed from the trial counsel\u2019s notion that defense counsel wanted to exploit this illness before the members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b965-9\">. As no privilege pursuant to Mil.R.Evid. 506 was claimed by the government, we need not decide the issue, left open in <em>Abrams, </em>of whether individual personnel records fall under that rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b966-9\">. <em>See Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
