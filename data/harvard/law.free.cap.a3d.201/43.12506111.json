The mere word \"identification\" need not set off the constitutional fire bell. Just as there have been, since 1967, numerous constitutional issues involving identification law, there always have been and will continue to be numerous non-constitutional issues that may, coincidentally, involve the subject of identification. As will be more fully discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , there may be, for instance, a constitutional chasm of difference between what we will call selective identification issues and other merely confirmatory identification issues. We need to look at identification issues more closely before invoking the constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    The Charge\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The appellee, Daniel Joseph Greene, was indicted on December 28, 2017, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, for the first-degree murder of Jon Hickey. The appellee moved pre-trial to suppress both an out-of-court and an in-court identification of him by Jennifer McKay as the man depicted in a surveillance video tape. Following a hearing on August 20,\n   2018, the suppression hearing judge granted the appellee's motion. Appropriately, the State filed an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    The State Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The State filed its appeal on August 20, 2018. The appeal is authorized by Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Section 12-302(c)(4). Pertinent are subsections (c)(4)(iii) and (iv):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (iii) Before taking the appeal, the State shall certify to the court that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay and that the evidence excluded or the\n   property required to be returned is substantial proof of a material fact in the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    The appeal shall be heard and the decision rendered within 120 days of the time that the record on appeal is filed in the appellate court\n   </em>\n   . Otherwise, the decision of the trial court shall be final.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (iv) Except in a homicide case, if the State appeals on the basis of this paragraph, and if on final appeal the decision of the trial court is affirmed, the charges against the defendant shall be dismissed in the case from which the appeal was taken. In that case, the State may not prosecute the defendant on those specific charges or on any other related charges arising out of the same incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The record was filed with this Court on October 23, 2018. Accordingly, our decision must be rendered no later than February 20, 2019. We heard oral argument on January 7, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A Suppression Motion Based On Identification Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As part of an omnibus ten-pronged pre-trial motion pursuant to Maryland Rule of Procedure 4-252, the appellee moved for the suppression of both an out-of-court identification and an in-court identification of the appellee. The grounds asserted were that the identifying witness, Jennifer McKay, had been subjected to impermissibly suggestive procedures pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Stovall v. Denno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168284\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/293/\">\n    388 U.S. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168284\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/293/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6168284\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/388/293/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), and its progeny in the course of the identification procedure. Sections 5 and 6 of the omnibus motion claimed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   5. That any identification of the Defendant made at a pre-trial identification procedure be suppressed\n   <em>\n    as having been obtained by an impermissibly suggestive process\n   </em>\n   , and in violation otherwise, of this Defendant's Constitutional or other legal rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   6. That the in-court identification of this Defendant be suppressed as the product of a\n   <em>\n    pre-trial identification process which was impermissibly suggestive\n   </em>\n   , or which otherwise violates the Constitutional and other legal rights of the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the appellee chose constitutional identification law as the suppression hearing battleground, everyone else followed suit. There were, to be sure, enough surface similarities to familiar identification law to make that an easy mindset into which to fall. The challenge based on identification law was the sole focus of the suppression ruling and that is the only issue brought before us on this State appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    The Wrong Pew In The Wrong Church\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although we have elected to consider, purely\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , constitutional identification law as an alternative holding, our basic feeling is that this case is, quite to the contrary, not a case involving familiar constitutional identification law at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The facts are unusual. The victim, Jon Hickey, was murdered in his Fells Point apartment in the early morning hours of November 29, 2017. Several days after the murder, the police recovered a surveillance video from the house next door to Jon Hickey's apartment. It apparently showed a figure attempting to enter the Hickey apartment. The police believed that that unknown figure may have been the murderer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, Jennifer McKay was asked to come to the police station to see if she could identify the figure on the video cam recording. She readily assented. As of the time of the murder, Jennifer McKay had\n   been involved in an intimate\n   romantic relationship with Jon Hickey for several months. Prior to that, Jennifer McKay had been involved in an intimate relationship with the appellee for five years. She and the appellee, moreover, had known each other well since childhood. A strong theory as to murderous motive was the appellee's jealousy at having been replaced by Jon Hickey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the police station, Jennifer McKay was shown the relatively brief footage recorded by the video cam. It was not in evidence. The police interview with Jennifer McKay, however, was recorded and later transcribed. It was the police behavior during that interview that was the exclusive focus of the suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    There Was No Selective Process In Play\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Over the decades, it has been recognized that the very purpose of constitutional identification law has been to guarantee the reliability of the selection process. Whenever a witness is asked to select the wrongdoer from a line-up of suspects, to select a photograph of the wrongdoer from a photographic array, or otherwise to select the wrongdoer from a larger group, the law's concern is that the selection process be untainted by the police slipping the answer, by word or by more subtle behavior, to the witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In this case, by contrast, there was no selection process in play. Jennifer McKay was not asked to look at three separate video cam tapes and to select the one with the appellee in it. Jennifer McKay was asked simply to confirm, if she could, that the man on the surveillance tape was the appellee, Daniel Greene. Jennifer McKay's knowledge of the appellee's appearance was absolute, beyond any peradventure of a doubt. All that Jennifer McKay was asked to do could as readily have been asked of the appellee's mother or of his best friend or of his probation officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The difficult question in this case involved not Jennifer McKay's ability to identify the appellee but rather the quality of the picture or tape she was being asked to review. Was it a good picture or was it an essentially unrecognizable picture?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   How far away was the subject from the camera? Was the scene well-lit or dark? Did the subject ever turn and look at the camera? Did the camera have any adverse impact on color? She was not looking at high school yearbook photos but at possibly blurred and ambiguous images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    The Reliability Factors Are Totally Inapplicable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Since\n   <em>\n    Simmons v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170914\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/377/\">\n    390 U.S. 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170914\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/377/\">\n    88 S.Ct. 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170914\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/377/\">\n    19 L.Ed.2d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968), impermissible suggestiveness is nothing more than a threshold question. The primary concern is with ultimate reliability. Our focus is now on the reliability factors articulated by\n   <em>\n    Neil v. Biggers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/\">\n    409 U.S. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/\">\n    34 L.Ed.2d 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972), and\n   <em>\n    Manson v. Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177400\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/98/\">\n    432 U.S. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177400\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/98/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177400\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/432/98/\">\n    53 L.Ed.2d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). In the present day, almost the entire attention of constitutional identification law is on these reliability factors. In the case before us, however, those reliability factors are utterly irrelevant. Classic identification law is simply inapplicable. How then do we apply the heart of identification law if the heart of identification law is irrelevant?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    \"I Think So\" Versus \"I Know So\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   If this case is not about identification law, what then is it about? A fair reading of the suppression hearing transcript and a fair reading of the transcript of the police interview of Jennifer McKay reveal clearly that what really concerned the appellee and defense counsel and the suppression hearing judge was a discernible effort by\n   the police to coach the witness. Any suggestiveness, however, concerned not whom Jennifer McKay would select. There was no selective identification. It concerned how forcefully or persuasively Jennifer McKay would testify. The police wanted to prime her to be a more effective witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The police interview of Jennifer McKay was fundamentally friendly and amicable at all times. The exchanges were relaxed and pleasant. Jennifer McKay, moreover, was not ultimately affected by any police suggestiveness. She identified the appellee as the man on the video cam tape at the very outset of her\n   interview. She identified him in almost precisely the same terms at the very end of the interview. In response to the very first police question, Jennifer McKay responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   DET.

Her answers were consistently and invariably \"I think so\" rather than the prosecutorial desideratum \"I know so.\" At one point she explained that her answer meant that it \"looks more like him than it doesn't look like him.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   MS. MCKAY:\n   <em>\n    It looks very much like him.\n   </em>\n   But I mean, I can see small differences. Like that, the face frame.

O'CONNOR: Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). She is not being uncertain about Daniel Greene.

O'CONNOR: That's one thing,\n   <em>\n    we just can't have the \"I think\" or \"I don't know.\"\n   </em>\n   That is what it is right there in front of you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   MS.

Once again, however, any equivocation was based, almost certainly, on the poor quality of the video cam tape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    \"I Think So\": Good, Relevant Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Maryland Rule 5-401 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   \"Relevant evidence\" means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Maryland Rule 5-402 then provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Except as otherwise provided by constitutions, statutes, or these rules, or by decisional law not inconsistent with these rules, all relevant evidence is admissible. Evidence that is not relevant is not admissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Thus, \"I think that is Dan Greene\" is just as relevant as \"I know that is Dan Greene.\" Not as weighty, but just as relevant. Certainly weightier than \"I have no idea.\" \"I think so\" will take a close case to the jury, whereas \"I have no idea\" will not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fenner v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89814\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/1/\">\n    381 Md. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89814\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/1/\">\n    846 A.2d 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). What is the percentage of certainty, moreover, that permits a witness to graduate from \"I think\" to \"I know\"? Is that percentage higher for scientists and academics than it is among laymen? Is it higher for timid souls than it is for more assertive types? Is Albert Einstein's \"I think so\" less weighty than a blowhard's \"I know so\"? One inevitably thinks of British historian and philosopher Thomas Babington Macaulay, who was referred to by fellow historian George Trevelyan, \"I wish I could be as certain about anything as\n   Tom Macaulay is about everything.\" Assertiveness may be as much about personality as it is about actual certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    Coaching A Witness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Improperly or excessively coaching a witness could be, of course, with respect to any subject. The problem of coaching a witness is not one associated with identification law particularly. One could as readily be coached about testifying with greater certainty as to how much money was actually taken from the cash register or how provocative the threatening gesture actually was before one struck in self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In the last analysis, any police behavior found to have been offending in this case unquestionably would have been the effort to encourage or cajole Jennifer McKay to testify with a greater degree of certainty. Offensive as that effort may have been, moreover, it had no apparent effect. All of which is to say, this is not a classic selective identification case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    A Confirmatory Identification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The problem is that of recognizing those sets of circumstances where suggestiveness is simply not a pertinent factor. The preceding concatenation of distinguishing circumstances would be a lot easier to handle if we had the benefit of a convenient shorthand reference or tag.

The general reliability phase, by contrast, relied heavily on the weighing of evidence as a matter of fact by lay jurors.

Justice Brennan's opinion pointed out that it is not a due process violation\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . It must be not only suggestive, but also\n   <em>\n    impermissibly\n   </em>\n   suggestive.

Even under such hypothetical circumstances, the suppression of Jennifer McKay's identification of the appellee on the surveillance video tape would have been erroneous for any of four separate reasons, any one of which would require the remand of this case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    The Exclusionary Versus The Balancing Approach\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   We would hold, were the\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   hypothetical before us for decision, that the exclusionary act of suppressing Jennifer McKay's identification of the appellee on the surveillance tape was error, at least without compelling reasons to do so. There is no question but that the suppression court's ruling was one of\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   exclusion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   \"I will grant the Defense's motion to suppress the out of court identification.\" It is conceivable that there might be, sometime and somewhere, an impermissibly suggestive identification resulting in the \"very substantial likelihood of an irreparable misidentification.\" It is prudent, therefore, never to say \"never.\" Short of such an extreme situation, however, the exclusionary approach is in strong disfavor, certainly since the promulgation of\n   <em>\n    Manson v. Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   in 1977. Under the totality of circumstances approach, the jury would have been able to balance the many reasons\n   why Jennifer McKay's identification of the appellee would have been reliable against any reasons why they might not. It was error for the court to shortchange the efficacy of the weighing or balancing process. Notwithstanding any police pressure brought to bear on Jennifer McKay's level of certainty, we cannot see a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, and nothing short of that could justify excluding McKay's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <strong>\n    A Reliability Analysis Was Essentially Ignored\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Pre-trial hearings challenging the propriety of identification procedures are frequently referred to as \"taint hearings.\" The primary purpose of such hearings is not to discover taint and then to sanction the police for having tainted the identification by excluding the evidence. The predominant purpose is to give the State the opportunity to purge any initial taint by showing that the ultimate identification is, notwithstanding the taint, nonetheless reliable (to wit, untainted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Since the promulgation of\n   <em>\n    Simmons v. United States\n   </em>\n   in 1968, it has been perspicaciously clear that the factfinding jury should not be denied the knowledge of an identification unless the identification procedure was 1) suggestive, 2) impermissibly so, and 3) that there is a very substantial likelihood of an irreparable misidentification. As it has blossomed forth in\n   <em>\n    Neil v. Biggers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Manson v. Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   , that probing of ultimate reliability is now at the heart of constitutional identification law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   It is evident from a close reading of the record of the suppression hearing in this case that the hearing focused almost exclusively on the behavior of the police and ended up with the conclusion that the police behavior had been impermissibly suggestive. The decisive focus was on the suggestive language of the police interviewer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   From start to finish, the focus of the suppression court was on the suggestive behavior of the police-and it stopped there. At one point, the State wanted to call Jennifer McKay to\n   explain her reaction to the police interview. In denying that request, the court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   THE COURT: I just don't see whether that changes your position with regard to\n   <em>\n    whether the police were impermissibly suggestive in the way they conducted this interview.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The court reiterated that \"\n   <em>\n    the conduct that occurred\n   </em>\n   on this video\n   <em>\n    is the only thing we're talking about.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis supplied). Moments later, the court reiterated its view that Jennifer McKay's state of mind was not a factor in the exclusionary equation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   THE COURT: Right. I agree with [defense counsel]. I'm going to deny your request to call -- because what\n   <em>\n    her state of mind\n   </em>\n   is --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-213\">\n   [PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]: That's fine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-214\">\n   THE COURT: --\n   <em>\n    has nothing to do with whether the police conduct was impermissibly suggestive.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   At another point, the court observed, \"\n   <em>\n    The burden was always on the State to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    prove that it was not impermissibly suggestive\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis supplied). At yet another point, the court rejected the idea that Jennifer McKay's state of mind could have any redemptive influence once impermissible suggestiveness had been found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-217\">\n   THE COURT: I accept -- even if I accept that she was in shock that it could be somebody that she knew that murdered somebody else that she knew,\n   <em>\n    it doesn't impact whether the police were impermissibly suggestive.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Ultimately, the court ruled that Jennifer McKay could testify as to her state of mind during her police interview.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   If I understand\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , which I have reviewed a long time ago, what\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   is saying is once I determine that suggestiveness, that the identification was suggestive, then you have an opportunity to present the totality of the circumstances to demonstrate that it's still reliable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   On being called to the stand, Jennifer McKay explained that she was sure about her identification of the appellee on the tape, and explained that any hesitation on her part was because of her disbelief that someone she once had loved could commit this murder of her live-in boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   Q.

But yes, when I looked at the video I was able to identify him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   After rigorous cross-examination by defense counsel, the court announced that \"\n   <em>\n    the only thing that I need to decide\n   </em>\n   , my issue today,\n   <em>\n    is was the police conduct impermissibly coercive\n   </em>\n   in forcing Ms. McKay to pick out the defendant.\n   <em>\n    That's the only issue for me.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis supplied). The focus of the court continued to be on impermissible suggestiveness.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   THE COURT: [Prosecuting Attorney], I am not challenging Ms. McKay. She in effect is somewhat of a victim in this case.\n   <em>\n    What this goes to is the police conduct with regard to how they conducted this identification.

Now here's how this court after viewing the video sees this case; that the -- if the police had come in and said, here's the video, can you tell us who's in the video and she says I'm not sure, it's not very clear. I'd let it in. If the police said, okay, well, let's go get the still pictures and maybe\n   you can see it more clearly, that would be fine too.\n   <em>\n    But when they cross the line and say, now look, Daniel has a beard, that guy has a beard. Daniel has a nose. Do you see the nose? It's the same nose. And they lead her to make a positive identification. That is suggestive.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-236\">\n   Additionally, under the totality of the circumstances in this case, they're not asking her do you know Daniel. They're asking do you know the person that's in this video. And as [defense counsel] points out, that is in effect stranger to stranger because if she comes in not knowing who that person is and she does it of her own volition make that decision that it is in fact Daniel.\n   <em>\n    And the fact that she comes in today and reinforces the concept that they pushed her and pushed her and then reassured her that it is Daniel at the end of the interview that the State introduced\n   </em>\n   , the next part of the interview where they said, don't worry about it. I know this is hard and\n   <em>\n    they just reinforce and make her more sure that she's picked out the person that they want her to pick out.\n   </em>\n   So for those reasons\n   <em>\n    I find it is suggestive\n   </em>\n   and that\n   <em>\n    under the totality of the circumstances it's not a reliable identification\n   </em>\n   and therefore,\n   <em>\n    I will grant the Defense's motion to suppress the out of court identification.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Ultimate reliability was not a meaningful factor in that analysis, if it was, indeed, a factor at all. The conclusion seemed to follow that if the procedure was suggestive, the\n   identification would be\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   unreliable without any more detailed analysis. Even granting,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , impermissible suggestiveness in the police interview of Jennifer McKay, it was not nearly as strong as the impermissible suggestiveness found to have existed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Neil v. Biggers\n   </em>\n   . Impermissible suggestiveness, however, was not enough to justify exclusion. After examining the four-fold reliability factors articulated by that case, the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Sixth Circuit to exclude the identification. By the same token, any possible impermissible suggestiveness in this case was not nearly so strong as that found to have existed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Manson v. Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   . Once again, however, impermissible suggestiveness was not enough to justify exclusion. After examining in detail the countervailing reliability factor in that case, the Supreme Court did not hesitate to reverse the decision of the Second Circuit to exclude from evidence the identification in that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Were a case involving constitutional identification law before us, we similarly would reverse the decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City in the present case. The court did not undertake a serious assessment of whether, beyond impermissible suggestiveness, there was \"a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <strong>\n    An Erroneous Or A Clearly Erroneous Hypothetical Finding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Were this,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , a case of selective identification and were our framework of analysis,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the constitutional identification law that has been promulgated by the Supreme Court, we would find error for yet another reason. The suppression hearing court necessarily found, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Simmons v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Neil v. Biggers\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Manson v. Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   , that Jennifer McKay's identification of the appellee was, by a very substantial likelihood, an irreparable misidentification. Such a finding, we hold, would have been clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   There was no evidence of any misidentification having been made in this case. After first viewing the video camera surveillance tape, Jennifer McKay identified the appellee as the man pictured on the tape. At the end of the protracted police interview of her, Jennifer McKay continued to identify the appellee as the man pictured on the tape. That never changed. No police pressure or influence ever caused her to select anyone other than the appellee. The only thing that arguably might have changed (it appears to us not to have changed) was the degree of certainty with which Jennifer McKay made the identification. All of the alleged police suggestiveness was aimed at Jennifer McKay's level of certainty. The statement, \"I think that is the appellee\" and the statement, \"I know that is the appellee\" are both relevant evidence helping the jury to conclude that the man pictured on the tape is, indeed, the appellee. The difference between the two levels of certainty goes only to the weight of the evidence and not to its relevance and, therefore, its admissibility. \"I think so\" is just as relevant as, \"I know so.\" 60% certainty is just as relevant as 95% certainty. Not nearly as weighty, of course, but just as relevant. Sliding up and down the certainty scale does not alter the substantive nature of the thing one is either very sure about or perhaps only tentatively sure about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Weight, of course, is classic grist for the jury mill. Improperly to strengthen the certainty of an identification (just as, for that matter, improperly to weaken the certainty of an identification) does not transform an identification into a misidentification. It may, indeed, be a case of the improper coaching of a witness (by the police, by the prosecuting attorney, by the defense attorney, by anyone) but that is an entirely different matter than giving hints as to the selection of this person over the selection of some other person. It is not something, moreover, that has been argued on this appeal. As this Court pointed out in\n   <em>\n    Conyers v. State\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-244\">\n   To do something impermissibly suggestive is not to pressure or to browbeat a witness to make an identification but only to feed the witness clues as to which identification to\n   make. THE SIN IS TO CONTAMINATE THE TEST BY SLIPPING THE ANSWER TO THE TESTEE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"193868\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/115/114/\">\n    115 Md. App. at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"193868\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/115/114/\">\n    691 A.2d 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Under no circumstances, moreover, could an identification of the appellee by Jennifer McKay be inherently unreliable. The appellee and Jennifer McKay had known each other since childhood. They had lived together in a husband-wife relationship for five years, breaking up only recently before the appellee, as the ex-live-in-boyfriend shot and killed the new live-in-boyfriend. The appellee and Jennifer McKay had been in communication since that break-up. Under any set of criteria, any identification she made of him would be inherently reliable and thus, under\n   <em>\n    Simmons v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Neil v. Biggers\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Manson v. Brathwaite\n   </em>\n   would not call for exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   The inability even to apply\n   <em>\n    Neil v. Biggers\n   </em>\n   's reliability factors to the circumstances of this case simply illustrates the overriding reality that this is not truly an identification case at all, but rather a case involving, at worst, the improper or excessive coaching of a witness. Because this confirmatory identification does not in any way involve the identification of a criminal by a victim or other witness to the crime, the\n   <em>\n    Neil v. Biggers\n   </em>\n   reliability factors are utterly inapposite. The square peg of\n   <em>\n    Neil v. Biggers\n   </em>\n   specifically or of constitutional identification law generally simply do not fit into the round hole of this case. That\n   makes the point yet again that, despite some surface similarities, this is not truly a case involving identification law at all. This case would be the same if the arguably improper coaching by the police of Jennifer McKay had been about a dozen other subjects not remotely involving a confirmatory identification of the appellee. It might have been the time of day or whether the front door had truly been locked. In any event, a finding of circumstances giving rise to a very substantial likelihood of an irreparable misidentification would have been clearly erroneous and, therefore, reversible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   Actually, it is almost certainly not the \"clearly erroneous\" test that we should be applying at this point, even in analyzing\n   our\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   alternative. Although the Supreme Court has not given us express guidance in this regard, it is, from the very language of the ultimate reliability test itself, almost certainly the case that a conclusion by a suppression hearing judge that a particular identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification is not a finding, as a matter of fact, but a ruling, as a matter of law, that the identification in issue will not be permitted even to go to the jury for its weighing and balancing. Whether, however, the suppression hearing judge in this case was erroneous, as a matter of law, or clearly erroneous, as a matter of fact, really does not make any difference. In either event, a remand is required. For future guidance, however, we would opt for considering this to have been a ruling, as a matter of law, subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   right or wrong appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   <strong>\n    Excluding The In-Court Identification As Well As The Pre-Trial Identification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Immediately after the court suppressed the out-of-court identification, the State inquired about a subsequent in-court identification. There was no argument by counsel on the subject or even discussion. The in-court suppression followed the out-of-court suppression almost automatically.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   THE COURT: ....So for those reasons I find it is suggestive and that under the totality of the circumstances it's not a reliable identification and therefore,\n   <em>\n    I will grant the Defense's motion to suppress the out of court identification.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   Now let's go onto the motion to suppress the searches.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-253\">\n   [PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]:\n   <em>\n    Is Your Honor preventing her to do an in court looking at the video?\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, that was the whole court's --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-255\">\n   THE COURT:\n   <em>\n    That was the whole point.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-256\">\n   [PROSECUTING ATTORNEY]: Well, you said out of court. So -- then the State, Your Honor, at this moment\n   there's no -- the State would ask Your Honor to stay the proceedings so we can --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   THE COURT: No, denied, denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   If nothing else needed to be considered in assessing subsequent in-court reliability, how about the adjective \"irreparable\"? What was in play in this case, of course, was the degree of certainty of Jennifer McKay's identification of the appellee as the figure on the surveillance tape. If police questioning arguably had the effect of ratcheting the certainty dial upward, might not strong, forceful, and persuasive cross examination by defense counsel probably have ratcheted the dial back downward again? Would not such a vulnerability to countervailing pressures make any arguable \"misidentification\" a \"reparable\" one rather than an \"irreparable\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   one? The deliberate use of the adjective by the Supreme Court was not random or accidental. It is a key component of the constitutional reliability factor. Would the appellee have us simply ignore the adjective \"irreparable\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Might not any uncertainty about Jennifer McKay's level of assurance be explained by showing the jury, in court, the very security cam tape that she had been shown by the police? Is it possible that the images of the suspect on the tape were from a distance? Or in the dark? Or such circumstances where colors might be subject to change? Might a blurred or murky image have been such that one would have difficulty identifying a picture of oneself? In any event, could looking at the tape itself have thrown helpful light on Jennifer McKay's level of certainty? Might not this have made even equivocal testimony reparable?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   By showing the surveillance tape to the jury, the jurors would have had a chance to compare Jennifer McKay's ability to make an identification with their own. They would be viewing the same tape that she had viewed. They would be comparing the image on the tape, blurry or clear, with the person sitting immediately in front of them at the trial table. If that were not sufficient, the appellee could have been\n   directed to walk over immediately in front of the jury box, to bend over, to turn around, etc. This might have made the apparently irreparable reparable. Once again, we hold that the suppression of an in-court identification was in error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Our basic holding is that this case is not a case involving constitutional identification law at all, but a case rather of the arguably improper or excessive coaching of a witness, a contention that is not before us. Even if, however, it were, purely\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , a case involving classic identification law, we would rule that the suppression order would have to be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   <strong>\n    SUPPRESSION ORDER REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-268\">\n    In the immediate wake of\n    <em>\n     Manson v.
