Henderson, appeals from the judgment of the trial court, following a hearing in damages upon default as to liability, awarding the plaintiff, Hospital Media Network, LLC, monetary relief pursuant to the equitable theories of forfeiture and disgorgement in the amount\n   of $454,579.76 on its claim of breach of fiduciary duty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court's award was improper because the plaintiff failed to prove it suffered any damages. We conclude that the court abused its discretion in ordering a wholesale forfeiture of the defendant's salary and bonus and requiring the defendant\n   to disgorge in full all profits received from third parties, such that the award, in the full amount requested by the plaintiff, was inequitable. Accordingly, we reverse in part the judgment of the court as to the award of damages against James Henderson and remand the case for a new hearing in damages. We otherwise affirm the court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of this appeal. In November, 2013, the plaintiff commenced this action alleging that the defendant, its former employee, violated the Connecticut Uniform Trade Secrets Act (CUTSA), General Statutes \u00a7 35-50 et seq., committed tortious interference with the plaintiff's business and contractual relations, breached the duty of employee loyalty, breached his fiduciary duty, and usurped corporate opportunities of the plaintiff. The defendant was defaulted, and the trial court held a hearing in damages. After the hearing, the court awarded the plaintiff damages solely on its claim of breach of fiduciary duty,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the essential elements of\n   which were admitted by virtue of the defendant's default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With respect to its breach of fiduciary duty count, the plaintiff alleged that it employed the defendant as its chief revenue officer and paid him substantial compensation from January 1 to September 2013. On September 5, 2013, the plaintiff terminated the defendant's employment \"for cause for several reasons including, without limitation [the defendant's] actively working for various companies unrelated to [the plaintiff] for his own benefit and without [the plaintiff's] permission or knowledge during regular business hours.\" Specifically, it alleged that the defendant worked for or on behalf of Generation Partners (Generation), a private equity investment firm, \"to raise capital for other digital media companies including but not limited to\" Captivate Network Holdings, Inc. (Captivate), and used the plaintiff's computers and infrastructure to conduct business for those other digital media companies without the plaintiff's permission or knowledge. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant played golf on a social basis and otherwise took time off during regular business hours without the plaintiff's permission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff further alleged that the parties had a fiduciary relationship \"by virtue of the trust and confidence\" the plaintiff placed in the defendant as its chief revenue officer, a senior executive position. Among the duties allegedly owed to the plaintiff were the duty of loyalty, the duty to act in good faith, and the duty to act in the best interest of the plaintiff. The plaintiff asserted that the defendant breached these duties in advancing his own interests to the detriment of the plaintiff. Lastly, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant's\n   breach caused it to sustain damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff sought, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant answered and filed an amended counterclaim, alleging breach of contract, wrongful termination, misrepresentation and deceit, and violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The defendant requested, inter alia, compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties engaged in discovery disputes, resulting in an April, 2016 order from the court that the parties \"confer face-to-face in an effort to resolve these discovery disputes, bearing in mind that reasonable good faith efforts at compromise are essential to every discovery dispute.\" On June 27, 2016, after finding the defendant's objections to the plaintiff's discovery requests \"intentionally evasive and intended to obstruct the process,\" the court ordered full compliance within thirty days. On July 28, 2016, the plaintiff filed a motion for default and nonsuit on the basis that the defendant had failed to comply with the court's June 27 order. The court granted the motion, finding that the \"[p]laintiff is clearly prejudiced by these obstructive tactics and the only appropriate remedy proportionate to the infraction is default.\" On September 26, 2016, the court rendered judgment for the plaintiff on its affirmative claims and against the defendant on his counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 27, 2016, the court held a hearing in damages. The plaintiff presented the testimony of\n   Andrew Hertzmark, an employee of Generation;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Christopher Culver, chief executive officer of the plaintiff; Taylor Henderson; and James Henderson. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court requested posttrial briefing, which the parties submitted on October 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 15, 2017, the court issued a memorandum of decision. In its memorandum, the court reviewed the evidence presented during the hearing in damages. From 2011 to 2013, the defendant was a consultant to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff compensated the defendant by making payments to his consulting company, St. Ives Development Group. On January 1, 2013, the defendant became a full-time employee and chief revenue officer of the plaintiff. The plaintiff paid him a salary of over $12,000 per month, totaling $121,579.84 in 2013, and also paid him a sales target bonus of $25,000 in May, 2013. That bonus was paid to St. Ives Development Group.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Just weeks after becoming a full-time employee of the plaintiff, the defendant communicated with Hertzmark, identifying the plaintiff as a possible investment target for his fund, and included the plaintiff's revenues and possible buy-out price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2013, Hertzmark was working on a potential transaction in which Generation would acquire Captivate from Gannett Company, Inc. (Gannett).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Captivate\n   and the plaintiff are involved in the\n   same business sector. While Captivate sells advertising space on digital monitors in elevators, the plaintiff sells advertising space on monitors located in hospitals and medical offices. Hertzmark testified that the defendant assisted with the Captivate acquisition, giving a presentation with Hertzmark to Gannett and helping formulate the letter of intent memorializing Generation's proposed purchase of Captivate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March, 2013, Hertzmark e-mailed the defendant stating that Generation's letter of intent was not shared with the head of Captivate and, therefore, Gannett was surprised to learn that the head of Captivate was aware of plans to install the defendant as the new chief executive officer of Captivate once that business was acquired by Generation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March and April, 2013, the defendant corresponded with Hertzmark regarding Captivate's attributes as an investment and reviewed due diligence information provided by Captivate from February through April, 2013. He told Hertzmark on July 6, 2013, that he wanted his attorney to review his Captivate employment contract once completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiff terminated the defendant's employment on September 5, 2013, and Generation's acquisition of Captivate from Gannett closed on September 26, 2013. Upon the transaction's closing, the defendant was paid a finder's fee of $150,000, awarded a consulting contract with Captivate for three years at $50,000 annually, and given the opportunity to purchase restricted stock of Captivate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court found that \"during the events in this case [the defendant] either never comprehended or ignored the different consequences of being a company employee and being a consultant,\" referring to the defendant's testimony in which he described himself as a \"consultant employee\" of the plaintiff. The court referenced the testimony of Culver, the plaintiff's chief executive officer, that the plaintiff's sales increased from $1.9 million in 2010 to $6.6 million in 2013. The court additionally noted Culver's testimony that the plaintiff \"held itself out to be the fastest growing company of its kind during this period\" and his recognition that the defendant was part of this \"terrific growth.\" Crediting Culver's testimony, the court found that \"there was a sharp increase in the company's sales\" while the defendant worked for the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Turning to the plaintiff's claimed damages, the court first found that the plaintiff was not entitled to the defendant's \"compensation from Captivate\" on the theory that the defendant usurped a corporate opportunity. Specifically, the court found that the opportunity the defendant took was \"employment\" at Captivate, which was not an opportunity available to the plaintiff. The court determined, however, that damages were appropriate on the plaintiff's claim of the breach of fiduciary duty of loyalty, and measured the damages \"by the gain to the faithless employee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   court awarded damages against the defendant in the total amount of $454,579.76, including $146,579.84, representing the defendant's 2013 salary ($121,579.84) and bonus ($25,000); $150,000, representing the finder's fee paid by Generation or Captivate; $150,000, representing the\n   consulting fees to be paid by Captivate from 2013 through 2016; and $7999.92, representing the value of the Captivate stock at the time of purchase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court declined to award attorney's fees under CUTSA, finding that \"there was minimal or no misappropriation of trade secrets in this case, and no justifiable basis for awarding fees under that statute.\" The court further declined to award attorney's fees as punitive damages under the common law, on the basis that the defendant \"has been penalized severely already by this court's decision. To add hundreds of thousands of dollars more, would not only be punitive, it would be overkill.\" It additionally found that although the defendant's actions were \"uninformed, and even stupid,\" his conduct did not meet the common-law standard for awarding attorney's fees, which, the court observed, requires that the conduct be \"outrageous, done with a bad motive, or with reckless indifference.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the plaintiff was \"unable to offer proof as to any of [its] damages by a preponderance of [the] evidence\" and therefore is \"not entitled to any award of damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We begin by addressing the effect of the default. The defendant was defaulted for failure to comply with the court's discovery order, and he concedes that he did not file a notice of intent to present defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[C]ase\n   law makes clear ... that once the defendants had been defaulted and had failed to file a notice of intent to present defenses, they, by operation of law, were deemed to have admitted to all the essential elements in the claim and would not be allowed to contest liability at the hearing in damages.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Abbott Terrace Health Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parawich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184354\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/120/78/#p85\">\n    120 Conn.

It is not the equivalent of an admission of all of the facts pleaded. The limit of its effect is to preclude the defaulted defendant from making any further defense and to permit the entry of a judgment against him on the theory that he has admitted such of the facts alleged in the complaint as are essential to such a judgment. It does not follow that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment for the full amount of the relief claimed.\n   <em>\n    The plaintiff must still prove how much of the judgment prayed for in the complaint he is entitled to receive\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)

Specifically, he argues that the plaintiff waived its claims of breach of the duty of loyalty when hiring the defendant, in that the plaintiff hired him with full knowledge that he would continue to consult for other companies. The central contention expressed in the defendant's reply brief is that the duty of loyalty never applied to his relationship with the plaintiff, and that \"[w]here there was no duty of faithfulness, loyalty, or an agency or fiduciary relationship implicit in the parties' agreement, logically there cannot be any breach of it. Without a breach, damages are not available as a matter of fact and law.\" Such arguments are unavailing given the entry of a default, which operates as an admission by the defendant of the facts alleged in the complaint that are essential to the judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff on its claim of breach of fiduciary duty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant is entitled, however, to challenge the determination of monetary relief awarded by the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Our standard of review is as follows. \"As a general matter, [t]he trial court has broad discretion in determining whether damages are appropriate.... Its decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion....

Forfeiture of a disloyal employee's compensation, like disgorgement of material benefits received from third\n   parties, is an equitable rather than a legal remedy.... It is derived from a principle of contract law: if the employee breaches the duty of loyalty at the heart of the employment relationship, he or she may be compelled to forego the compensation earned during the period of disloyalty. The remedy is substantially rooted in the notion that compensation during a period in which the employee is disloyal is, in\n   effect, unearned.... Forfeiture may be the only available remedy when it is difficult to prove that harm to [the employer] resulted from the [employee's] breach or when the [employee] realizes no profit from the breach. In many cases, forfeiture enables a remedy to be determined at a much lower cost to litigants.

The court ordered a wholesale forfeiture of the defendant's salary for the entire duration of his full-time employment with the plaintiff, $121,579.84, and the entire amount of what the plaintiff itself categorized as the defendant's achieving his \"sales target bonus,\" $25,000, which it paid to the defendant\n   as an independent contractor through his consulting company.

The court did, in its memorandum of decision, make factual findings, fully supported by the record and corresponding with the\n   <em>\n    Wall Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , factors, but ultimately failed to give proper weight to these findings in fashioning its damages award. Specifically, the trial court expressly recognized the value of the services the defendant provided the plaintiff, finding \"a sharp increase in the company's sales\" while the defendant worked for the plaintiff, and concluding that the defendant was part of this \"terrific growth.\" That finding corresponds with the\n   <em>\n    Wall Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , factor prompting consideration of \"the effect\n   of the disloyal acts on the value of the employee's properly performed services to the employer.\" The court's finding, in essence a recognition that the defendant was providing extraordinary value to the plaintiff despite his breach of fiduciary duty, should have weighed in favor of a measured forfeiture, not the defendant's full salary and bonus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Indeed, as the court in\n   <em>\n    Wall Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , explained, forfeiture as a remedy \"is substantially rooted in the notion that compensation during a period in which the employee is disloyal is, in effect, unearned.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489115\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/989/#p729\">\n    Id., at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489115\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/989/#p729\">\n    154 A.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In accord with this principle, courts in other states have recognized that an employee may be entitled to retain some portion of his compensation where the breach is minor or the employee has provided value to the employer in the form of services properly rendered.

It provides: \"Although forfeiture is generally available as a remedy for breach of fiduciary duty, cases are divided on how absolute a measure to apply. Some cases require forfeiture of all compensation paid or payable over the period of disloyalty, while others permit apportionment over a series of tasks or specified items of work when only some are tainted by the agent's disloyal conduct. The better rule permits the court to consider the specifics of the agent's work and the nature of the agent's breach of duty and to evaluate whether the agent's breach of fiduciary duty tainted all of the agent's work or was confined to discrete transactions for which the agent was entitled to apportioned compensation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the present case, the court also made a finding related to the wilfulness of the defendant's actions, another of the\n   <em>\n    Wall Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , factors. The court characterized the defendant's actions as \"uninformed, and even stupid.\" By declining to award attorney's fees as punitive damages under the common law on this basis, it is evident that the court rejected any notion that the defendant's conduct was \"outrageous, done with a bad motive, or with reckless indifference.\" The court also found that the defendant had \"either never comprehended or ignored the different consequences of being a company employee and being a consultant,\" referring to the defendant's testimony in which he\n   described himself as a \"consultant employee\" of the plaintiff. Despite recognizing that the defendant potentially \"never comprehended\" the distinction between serving as an employee and a consultant and finding that the defendant's behavior was \"uninformed\" rather than done with a bad motive, the court failed to give proper weight to these findings when fashioning its award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We acknowledge that a trial court \"may conclude that all compensation should be forfeited because the employee's unusually egregious or reprehensible conduct pervaded and corrupted the entire [employment] relationship.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Wall Systems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pompa\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489115\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/989/#p729\">\n    324 Conn. at 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489115\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/989/#p729\">\n    154 A.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the present case, however, the trial court's express factual findings reflect an uninformed employee who continued to provide significant value to his employer despite his breach of fiduciary duty. These findings, clearly not in the nature of corrupt or reprehensible behavior, should have weighed in favor of an award of something less than full forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We further note briefly that forfeiture was not the sole remedy available to the court, as the court had before it evidence of the benefit the defendant received from third parties Generation and Captivate.

The defendant maintains that future compensation only may be subject to forfeiture, citing\n    <em>\n     Dunsmore &amp; Associates, Ltd.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     D'Alessio\n    </em>\n    , Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 409906 (January 6, 2000) (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20228\">\n     26 Conn. L. Rptr. 228\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20124995\">\n     2000 WL 124995\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ), in support of his argument. That superior court case involved claims of breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and thus is both distinguishable and not binding on this court. In contrast,\n    <em>\n     Wall Systems, Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Pompa\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489115\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/989/#p729\">\n     324 Conn. at 733-34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489115\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/154/989/#p729\">\n     154 A.3d 989\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , provides generally that \"[i]f the employee breaches the duty of loyalty at the heart of the employment relationship, he or she may be compelled to forego\n    <em>\n     the compensation earned\n    </em>\n    during the period of disloyalty.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Second, the defendant argues that because the plaintiff prospered during the period of the defendant's employment, the plaintiff cannot show it was damaged by his acts and is not entitled to recover damages for lost profits. Although the court abused its discretion in fashioning its damage award, it did not use lost profits as the measure of damages, and, thus, the defendant's argument is inapposite.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Third, the defendant argues that \"[t]he proper measure of damages for breach of covenant not to compete is the nonbreaching party's losses, not the breaching party's gains.... Where the judge reversed this standard in his memo on damages, he applied an incorrect standard, which rendered an incorrect award of damages\" to the plaintiff. Because this action contains no claim of breach of a covenant not to compete, the defendant's argument and supporting case law is inapplicable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Fourth, recognizing that no damages were awarded on the plaintiff's count alleging violation of CUTSA, the defendant nevertheless argues, in the event that the plaintiff \"may choose to raise [the CUTSA claim] in this appeal,\" that no recovery under CUTSA is proper. Specifically, he argues, citing\n    <em>\n     Dunsmore &amp; Associates, Ltd.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     D'Alessio\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20228\">\n     26 Conn. L. Rptr. 228\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%20124995\">\n     2000 WL 124995\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover compensatory damages under \u00a7 35-53 because it has failed to prove that it sustained actual loss or that the defendant was unjustly enriched as a result of his misappropriation. He also argues that the plaintiff is not entitled to punitive damages under CUTSA. He further argues that the plaintiff cannot recover damages for tortious interference, on the basis that it has failed to prove a loss suffered by the plaintiff and caused by the defendant's tortious conduct. Because the court awarded no damages under either the CUTSA or tortious interference counts and the plaintiff did not file a cross appeal from the trial court's judgment, we need not address these arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    With respect to the finder's fee, although Hertzmark testified that the defendant received $150,000 for the work he performed in 2013, he acknowledged that \"\n    <em>\n     during the course of several years\n    </em>\n    , [the defendant] and I have looked at a number of companies, thirty-five, thirty different companies, and ultimately settled in 2013 on Captivate. So ... what you're hearing about with Captivate was\n    <em>\n     the tail end of the relationship\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.) The arrangement between Hertzmark and the defendant began in 2010 or 2011, and the defendant was uncompensated when the two began to look at potential companies together. It was agreed that if an acquisition closed, the defendant would be paid a finder's fee at that time. For the majority of the term of that relationship, the defendant was not a full-time employee of the plaintiff. Hertzmark testified that even had he known that the defendant was a full-time employee of the plaintiff in 2013, he still would have paid him the \"cash compensation regardless of his employment because [the defendant] had made the introduction many years ago.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Moreover, although Hertzmark testified that the three year, $150,000 prospective consulting contract was part of the defendant's compensation for working on the Captivate transaction in 2013, he later clarified that the defendant \"has been given $50,000 per year for his work on the transaction\n    <em>\n     and since the transaction has closed\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.) He further testified that \"I would say through the work we did together in 2013, we saw that he would be a valuable post-transaction consultant, and so we signed him up to a three year agreement, post closing.\" Thus, although he was provided the opportunity to sign the agreement as a consultant on the basis of his work in 2013, he performed the services specified in the agreement and earned the $50,000 per year subsequent to the termination of his employment with the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
