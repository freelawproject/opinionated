The trustees decided that they could not remedy the\n   defects, so they dismissed the foreclosure case. Before the case was dismissed, however, the thwarted purchaser, appellant Dominion Rental Holdings, LLC (\"Dominion\"), made improvements to the property. Dominion took no action to challenge the dismissal or to assert a claim for reimbursement or for a credit for the improvements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In a new foreclosure action, Dominion acquired rights in the property at a foreclosure sale on September 7, 2017, but it paid a higher price, allegedly because of the enhanced value attributable to the improvements that it had made. It filed exceptions to the sale and a motion to abate the purchase price, arguing that it should not be required to pay the increased cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In an order docketed on October 27, 2017, the court denied the exceptions and the motion to abate. Dominion promptly noted an appeal, without waiting for the ratification of the sale. It did not note another appeal after the ratification of the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We must dismiss the appeal, because it is premature. Dominion noted the appeal before the entry of a final judgment, and no exceptions to the final judgment rule apply. Consequently, we lack appellate jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Generally, parties may appeal only upon the entry of a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.

Moreover, if the court refers the matter to an auditor to state an account, as it may under Rule 14-305(f), it may not enter a final judgment until it has adjudicated any exceptions to the auditor's report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Balt.Home Alliance, LLC v.

Here, Dominion acquired an inchoate equitable interest\n   in the property in the first foreclosure sale, and there were either no exceptions or no successful exceptions to that sale. Yet the court declined to ratify the first sale because of defects unrelated to the sale itself - problems with service at the outset of the case, which the trustees determined to be incurable. Had the court declined to ratify the second sale after Dominion appealed from the denial of its exceptions, the appeal would have become completely superfluous: it would make no difference whether the court erred or abused its discretion in denying Dominion's exceptions if the court ultimately declined to ratify the sale on other, different grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Furthermore, if the final judgment in a foreclosure proceeding could occur before the court ratifies the sale, there could be more than one final judgment in a single proceeding. It is conceivable that more than one party could file exceptions to the foreclosure sale: for example, both a homeowner and a junior lienholder might file exceptions. Yet, if the court ruled separately on each exception, and if the denial of each of the exceptions were considered to be a final, appealable judgment, then both of the exceptants could take their own, separate appeal. That result would obviously be in some tension with \"Maryland's long-established policy against piecemeal appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v. Md. Dep't of Agric.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173787\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/262/#p278\">\n    439 Md. at 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4173787\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/439/262/#p278\">\n    96 A.3d 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As of the date of Dominion's appeal in this case, the circuit court had neither ratified the foreclosure sale, nor referred the matter to an auditor, nor adjudicated any exceptions to an auditor's report. Dominion, therefore, has taken a premature appeal, before the entry of a final judgment. Because we acquire no appellate jurisdiction over a premature appeal (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

At oral argument, Dominion asserted that its appeal fell within \u00a7 12-303(3)(v), which authorizes an appeal from an interlocutory order \"[f]or the sale, conveyance, or delivery of real ... property ... or the refusal to rescind or discharge such an order[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A court enters an order for \"[f]or the sale, conveyance, or delivery of real ... property\" when, for example, it establishes a mechanic's lien, orders the property to be sold if the lien is not paid by a date certain, and appoints a trustee to conduct the sale.\n   <em>\n    Winkler Construction Co. v.

Rule 14-305(d) (listing exceptions to the sale among the procedures following a sale).

Thus we assume for the sake of argument that the order denying the exceptions and the motion to abate might fall within the scope of Rule 2-602(b), because it pertains to \"one or more but fewer than all of the ... parties.\" Even so, Rule 2-602(b) would not authorize an immediate appeal in this case, because the court did not expressly determine in a written order that there was no just reason to delay the entry of a final judgment as to Dominion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller Metal Fabrication, Inc. v.

It would be completely inconsistent with Maryland's strong policy against piecemeal appeals to delay the imminent conclusion of this foreclosure proceeding to allow Dominion to pursue an immediate appeal of the order denying its exceptions and its motion to abate the purchase price.

In this case, however, the final judgment was nigh at the time when Dominion took its premature appeal. An appellate court would have been no less able to grant full relief in an appeal after the ratification of the foreclosure sale than it would have been after the denial of Dominion's exceptions and its motion to abate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In summary, Dominion appealed before the entry of the final judgment, which would not occur at least until the ratification of the foreclosure sale. Hence Dominion's appeal is premature. It could have preserved its appeal by filing a second, protective notice of appeal after the entry of the final judgment, but it did not. None of the exceptions to the final judgment rule operate to save the premature appeal. Therefore we lack jurisdiction and must dismiss the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    APPEAL DISMISSED.

Rule 8-602(d) might save the appeal in this case if Dominion had noted its appeal after the court announced that it intended to ratify the sale or to approve an auditor's report, but before that ruling was entered on the docket. Dominion noted its appeal, however, well before the court announced its ruling on any such issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Because the circuit court could not properly exercise its discretion to certify its ruling as final under Rule 2-602(b), we too are foreclosed from exercising our discretion under Rule 8-602(g) to save the premature appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Abney v.
