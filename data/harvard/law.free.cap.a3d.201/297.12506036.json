The sole issue before this Court is whether the trial court erred by denying his appeal. After review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On May 9, 2017, Licensee entered into the Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) Program for violating Section 3802(a)(2) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802(a)(2) (relating to driving under the influence (DUI)). Pursuant to the ARD Admission Order (ARD Order), Licensee \"[a]gree[d] to a license suspension of 0 month(s).\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at R1 (ARD Order). On May 18, 2017, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (DOT) notified Licensee that \"\n   <strong>\n    no suspension\n   </strong>\n   is being issued at this time.\" Supplemental Reproduced Record (S.R.R.) at 15b (emphasis added). Also on May 18, 2017, in a separate correspondence, DOT notified Licensee that his \"commercial driving privilege is\n   <strong>\n    disqualified\n   </strong>\n   \" for a period of one year, effective June 22, 2017. R.R. at R4 (emphasis added). Licensee appealed from the disqualification to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 17, 2017, the trial court held a hearing and denied Licensee's appeal. Licensee appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 25, 2017, the trial court ordered Licensee to file a Concise Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal (Statement). On October 12, 2017, Licensee filed his Statement. On December 1, 2017, the trial court filed its opinion. Therein, the trial court cited\n   <em>\n    Kozieniak v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914284\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/100/326/6914284/\">\n    100 A.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014) as controlling. The trial court further opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   [DOT] and [Licensee] agreed 'to a license suspension for 0 month(s).' In accordance with that agreement, [Licensee's] driver's license was not suspended. In other words, he received the benefit of his bargain. The parties, however, made no such agreement with respect to his [commercial driver's license (]CDL[) ]. [DOT], therefore, was obligated to exercise its statutory duty of suspending his CDL. Had [Licensee] wished to protect his CDL in addition to his regular driver's license, he could have tried to negotiate a similar agreement with respect to his CDL. Since he failed to do so, his CDL was properly suspended pursuant to [Section 1611(a)(1) of the Vehicle Code,] 75 Pa.[C.S.] \u00a7 1611(a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Trial Ct. Op. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Licensee argues that\n   <em>\n    Kozieniak\n   </em>\n   is inapposite. The licensee in\n   <em>\n    Kozieniak,\n   </em>\n   as in the instant case, was arrested for DUI and entered into the ARD Program. The licensee also had a CDL which was suspended pursuant to Section 1611(a) of the Vehicle Code. On appeal, the licensee argued that ARD was not a conviction and thus, Section 1611(a) of the Vehicle Code did not apply. This Court held: \"[The l]icensee's acceptance into ARD constituted a 'conviction' of violating Section 3802 [of the Vehicle Code]. Once [the l]icensee was convicted of a Section 3802 [of the Vehicle Code] violation, [DOT] was required to disqualify his commercial driving privilege under Section 1611(a)(1) [of the Vehicle Code].\"\n   <em>\n    Kozieniak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914284\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/100/326/6914284/\">\n    100 A.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    Kozieniak\n   </em>\n   , the issue in the instant case is whether the terms of Licensee's ARD Order precludes DOT from suspending his CDL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court determined that the \"license\" referred to in the ARD Order was Licensee's \"driver's license\" and, since his \"regular driver's license\" was not suspended, the ARD agreement was satisfied. Trial Ct. Op. at 3. While the trial court essentially treats the ARD Order as the basis for its ruling, the Vehicle Code also supports the trial court's order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Initially, Chapter 15 of the Vehicle Code expressly pertains to \"Licensing of\n   <strong>\n    Drivers\n   </strong>\n   .\" Vehicle Code Chapter 15 (emphasis added). Pursuant to Section 1501(a) of the Vehicle Code: \"No person, ... shall drive any motor vehicle upon a highway or public property in this Commonwealth unless the person has a [valid]\n   <strong>\n    driver's license\n   </strong>\n   ....\" 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501(a) (emphasis added). Vehicle Code Chapter 16, however, separately relates to \"\n   <strong>\n    Commercial Drivers\n   </strong>\n   .\" Vehicle Code Chapter 16 (emphasis added). Section 1607 of the Vehicle Code specifies the \"Commercial driver's license\n   <strong>\n    qualification standards\n   </strong>\n   .\" 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1607 (emphasis added). Correspondingly, Section 3804(e) of the Vehicle Code pertains to \"\n   <strong>\n    Suspension of operating privileges\n   </strong>\n   upon conviction,\" 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3804(e) (bold emphasis omitted), and Section 1611(a) refers to \"\n   <strong>\n    disqualify\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    ing\n   </strong>\n   ] any person from driving a commercial motor vehicle[.]\" 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1611(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, the ARD Order specified \"a license suspension of 0 month(s).\" R.R. at R1. DOT's notices stated Licensee would receive \"no suspension,\" relative to his driver's license, but his CDL was \"disqualified.\" S.R.R. at 15b, R.R. at R4. Moreover, because Licensee was accepted into the ARD Program, his DUI did not\n   <strong>\n    require\n   </strong>\n   a license suspension.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of the foregoing leaves no doubt that the ARD Order related to the suspension of Licensee's driver's license, not the disqualification of his CDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition, Section 1611 of the Vehicle Code provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) First violation of certain offenses.--\n   </strong>\n   Upon receipt of a report of conviction, [DOT] shall, in addition to any other penalties imposed under this title, disqualify any person from driving a commercial motor vehicle ... for a period of one year for the first violation of:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (1) [S]ection 3802 [of the Vehicle Code] (relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1611. \"The term [conviction] shall include the acceptance of [ARD] ....\" 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1603. Therefore, Licensee's ARD constituted a conviction for violating\n   Section 3802(a)(2) of the Vehicle Code. Because Licensee was convicted of a Section 3802 violation, DOT was required to disqualify his commercial driving privilege pursuant to Section 1611(a)(1) of the Vehicle Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See Kozieniak.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed Licensee's appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the trial court's order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   AND NOW, this 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of January, 2019, the Chester County Common Pleas Court's August 18, 2017 order is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    \"Our standard of review in a license suspension case is to determine whether the factual findings of the trial court are supported by competent evidence and whether the trial court committed an error of law or an abuse of discretion.\"\n    <em>\n     Gammer v.
