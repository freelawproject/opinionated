Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellants Willie Walker, Jr. and Ricky Donaldson were tried by a jury between January and March 2014. The charges arose out of three separate events: the February 4, 2008, shooting of Patricia Holmes; the March 31, 2008, shooting of Delois Persha; and the September 13, 2008, murder of Delois Persha. Walker was found guilty of several crimes in connection with the three events and sentenced to 88 years in prison. Donaldson was found guilty of several crimes in connection with the murder of Persha and sentenced to 45 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Appellants and Their Victims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Walker (known as \"Wee Wee\") and Donaldson (known as \"Slick\") were members of the LeDroit Park crew. The crew was involved in selling drugs and committing violent crimes, and its members stored communal guns and ammunition in \"trap houses\" in the neighborhood. The government alleged that the LeDroit Park crew was a criminal street gang, citing evidence of the crimes its members committed and graffiti with messages such as \"DBD\" or \"Death Before Dishonor,\" \"Kill Rats,\" and \"Respect G's or Die,\" meaning snitching was not tolerated and members of the crew would die before snitching to the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Walker and Donaldson were close friends with Devon Davis\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (also known as \"D Nice\") who had a court-imposed curfew while Walker was incarcerated. Patricia Holmes (known as \"Trish\") grew up in LeDroit Park and bought drugs from many people there, including Walker, whose family she had known since before Walker was born. In the past Holmes had run errands for Walker and they got into physical altercations in which Walker threatened to shoot and kill Holmes. Delois Persha (known as \"Peaches\") had known Walker \"since he was a baby\" and had seen him selling drugs. Holmes and another witness from the neighborhood testified that they knew Walker as \"Wee Wee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Shootings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Patricia Holmes was shot outside of Jerry's carry-out restaurant at the intersection of Georgia and Florida Avenues, N.W., on February 4, 2008, after getting into an argument with appellant Walker. When the police arrived at the scene, Holmes repeatedly screamed, \"Wee Wee shot me.\" Two days later, Holmes looked at a nine-photo array and identified Walker as the shooter. Before her grand jury testimony in August 2008, Holmes identified Walker as \"Wee Wee\" from a book containing photographs of approximately 50 different people. (The jury was not told of this identification.) At trial Holmes identified Walker as \"Wee Wee\" and confirmed that Walker shot her. According to Holmes, Donaldson was with Walker at the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 31, 2008, Delois Persha was shot outside of an upstairs apartment at 242 W Street, N.W., a block north of LeDroit Park, while waiting for Terrill McCray to come to the door. When Persha entered the apartment building, she had seen Walker holding a gun and arguing with a man in the hallway. While waiting for McCray, Persha told Deandre Swann, who had come out of the apartment, to hurry up because she wasn't \"going to let him sit [her] down and shoot [her] like he\n   did that girl Trish [Holmes].\" Walker and Swann soon came up the steps while Persha was waiting outside the apartment, and Walker shot her multiple times. Before Walker shot Persha, he said \"what you looking at\" and \"you fuck with me, I'm going to shoot you like I did that bitch Trish. Bitch, I'll kill you.\" Persha briefly lost consciousness and when she woke up, she was shot two or three more times. In total, Persha was shot six times. While in the hospital in April 2008, Persha identified Walker as the shooter while examining a nine-photo array.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Less than six months later, while Walker was in jail, the police found Persha lying on the sidewalk bleeding. A medical examiner found that Persha died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head and torso. At trial the government introduced letters between Walker and Donaldson that police found while executing search warrants for Walker's jail cell and the homes of Donaldson's parents. The government argued that these letters were coded messages which showed that Walker and Donaldson conspired to shoot Holmes and Persha before they could testify at Walker's trial. The government also introduced calls Walker made while in jail that referred to Donaldson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Jolanta Little\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On September 27, 2008, Jolanta\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Little was arrested for an unrelated carjacking and interviewed by detectives. Little confessed to the carjacking and subsequently told other detectives that he saw Donaldson shoot and kill Persha. During that videotaped interview, Little identified a photograph of Donaldson and a photograph of the type of gun used by Donaldson, described characteristics of the gun used by Donaldson, and marked on maps to show where the shooting took place. The detectives also spoke to Little about the theory that Walker arranged Persha's murder and Little responded with information about the friendship of Walker and Donaldson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Little entered into a plea deal and signed a cooperation agreement with the government. When he testified before a grand jury on November 26, 2008, Little confirmed that he had reviewed the videotape of the September 27 interview and wanted to incorporate that recording into his grand jury testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, when the grand jury reconvened on December 11, 2008, Little testified that what he told the detectives in September was not the truth but was based on rumors he had heard. Little said that he lied to the detectives to get out of jail, and put Donaldson in jail instead, because he had heard a rumor that Donaldson was trying to rob him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At a pretrial deposition over which the trial court presided on January 14-15, 2014, Little testified that he was the person who killed Persha. At the time of this deposition, Little also stated that he had been granted immunity and believed he could not be prosecuted for Persha's murder. At trial Little testified again that he\n   had killed Persha and asserted that he did not know where Donaldson was when he did so. A large portion of the videotape of Little's interview with detectives in September 2008 was played before the jury at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    D. This Court's Decision in\n    <em>\n     Little\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After appellants' trial was over, this court reversed Little's convictions, holding that his confession to the carjacking should have been suppressed.\n   <em>\n    Little v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847155,6847038\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/125/1119/\">\n    125 A.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1122 (D.C. 2015). Looking at the totality of the circumstances and focusing on the detectives' statements to Little about possible sexual assault in jail and the police pursuing other charges against Little for crimes they did not truly suspect him of committing, we concluded that Little's ultimate confession to the carjacking on September 27, 2008, was coerced.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847155,6847038\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/125/1119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847155,6847038\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/125/1119/\">\n    at 1127-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court commented that a negotiation was taking place during the interrogation and that one of the detectives was trying to get Little to confess and \"work out a deal\" once he put \"some meat ... on the table.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847155,6847038\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/125/1119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847155,6847038\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/125/1119/\">\n    at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court remanded the case for a new trial from which Little's confession to the carjacking would be excluded because \"the combination of the timing and the nature and intensity\" of the detectives' tactics led to the conclusion that the confession was not voluntary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847155,6847038\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/125/1119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847155,6847038\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/125/1119/\">\n    at 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Soon after Little confessed to the carjacking, he spoke to homicide detectives. This court did not address whether Little's subsequent statements implicating Donaldson in the 2008 murder were involuntary, but merely referred to these later statements in a footnote.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6847155,6847038\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/125/1119/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1130 n.10 (referring to the police \"questioning [Little] about other crimes he witnessed or knew about\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Issues On Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Appellants timely appealed their convictions and also filed motions for a new trial, which the trial court denied. Portions of the videotape of Little's interviews with the carjacking and homicide detectives were played for the jury at the trial in 2014, prior to our ruling in\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   . Appellants now assert that their constitutional rights were violated because Little's statements implicating Donaldson and Walker are the tainted fruit of Little's coerced confession to the carjacking. As a result, they contend, the government has the burden to show that Little's statements about the murder were free of taint. The government responds that it is appellants' burden to show that Little's later statements about the murder were coerced\n   <em>\n    and unreliable\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Appellant Walker has also presented other issues, such as the trial court's denial of a pretrial hearing to determine the reliability of identification testimony by Holmes, the trial court's decision not to determine prior to trial whether the government had sufficient evidence that he was a member of a criminal street gang, and the trial court's admission of evidence as statements of co-conspirators. Appellant Donaldson also contends that the trial court admitted evidence that was the poisoned fruit of Little's involuntary statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Little's Testimony at Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Additional Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In February 2012 Walker's counsel filed a motion to exclude testimony by cooperating witnesses and requested a reliability hearing. His theory seemed to be that the testimony of any witness cooperating with the government is inherently (or at least presumptively) unreliable. Nowhere in this boilerplate motion does counsel specifically mention Little, nor does counsel move to\n   suppress Little's prior statements (or his anticipated testimony) by alleging that they were coerced. It appears that Donaldson's counsel joined this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During a January 23, 2014, pretrial hearing which occurred after Little's pretrial deposition, the trial judge asked defense counsel if they were still pursuing the motion to exclude testimony by cooperating witnesses. Counsel for both appellants responded separately saying \"no\" and \"I don't believe we have a realistic basis for pursuing it.\" Appellants' counsel received the transcript of Little's interview approximately a year before trial, which began on January 27, 2014, and seemed to have had the videotape at least as early as July 2013. Therefore, a reasonably diligent attorney who thought such a claim was well-founded would have been able to file and litigate a motion to exclude Little's testimony on the ground that it was involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nevertheless, when Walker and Donaldson moved for a new trial, claiming that Little's statements implicating them were involuntary, the government did not assert that appellants had waived this issue by failing to raise it prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under the rules of criminal procedure, motions to suppress evidence must be made before trial. Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12 (b)(3) (2014);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2023-104\">\n    D.C.

Moreover, \"[f]ailure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make requests which must be made prior to trial ... shall constitute waiver thereof, but the Court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.\" Super. Ct. R. Crim. P. 12 (d) (2014). Moving to suppress on one ground does not preserve a claim that the evidence should have been suppressed on a different ground.\n   <em>\n    Lowery v.

Appellants acknowledge that this court has not addressed whether the admission of an involuntary witness statement violates a defendant's due process rights. In this situation, appellants cannot establish plain error. Even if we were to recognize such a right, appellants have not established that Little's statements about the murder were involuntary, much less false or unreliable, or that the police conduct which elicited those statements was intolerably coercive.

After hearing the trial testimony, he found that the identification was \"entirely reliable based upon the fact that [Holmes] had known [Walker] for many years, [and] had interactions with him around the neighborhood.\" The court also asked Walker's counsel if it needed to make any further findings, and counsel responded \"no.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   There were no express findings on the issue of suggestivity as required by our case law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, even if the identifications were unduly suggestive, the trial court did not err in finding that Holmes's out-of-court and in-court identifications were reliable. That finding is firmly supported both legally and factually given Holmes's identification of Walker by his nickname immediately after the shooting, her familiarity with Walker and his family for years, her history of buying drugs from Walker, and her previous face-to-face encounters with Walker.

Fruits of Little's Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Donaldson argues that the letters between Walker and Donaldson and the recordings of Walker's calls from jail should have been excluded because they were the tainted fruits of Little's coerced statements. Although Little did not point them to this evidence, Donaldson's theory seems to be that, but for Little's statements to the homicide detectives, the police would not have obtained search warrants for the homes of Donaldson's parents and Walker's jail cell, and the letters would not have been found. In addition, appellant supposes, the government would not have had reason to review Walker's calls from jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Donaldson relies primarily on the seminal case of\n   <em>\n    Wong Sun v.

He asserts instead that \"if Mr. Little's coerced statements, Ms. Holmes's prior identification testimony, and Ms. Persha's prior statements had been properly excluded, the trial court would not have had sufficient evidence to find the existence of a conspiracy was more likely than not.\" In making this claim, he cross-references two arguments we have already rejected and alludes to one he has not briefed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not clear to us that Donaldson is making a similar argument, but even if he is, appellants have not established that the letters should have been excluded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

More specifically, he argues that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to determine prior to trial whether there was sufficient evidence of a criminal street gang.

In particular, he cites the\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   decision dealing with the admission of co-conspirator statements. In that case, however, we commented on \"the impracticality of the mini-trial necessary to unconditional admission under the preponderance standard,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7916796\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/481/431/#p439\">\n    481 A.2d at 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and concluded that the trial court should make the admissibility decision during the prosecution's evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7916796\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/481/431/#p439\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For example, the government was required to prove that the defendant murdered Persha for the benefit of a criminal street gang or in association with another person who was a member of or active participant in a criminal street gang. \"A crime that\n   <em>\n    happens\n   </em>\n   to have been committed by a gang participant falls outside of the statute's reach.\"\n   <em>\n    (Joseph) Jenkins v.

Cir. 2000) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Of course, there are significant risks involved in admitting such evidence without a hearing conducted prior to trial or outside the presence of the jury. If the government fails to prove (1) that a criminal street gang existed, (2) that the defendant was a member of the gang, or (3) that there was the statutorily required connection between the gang and the predicate offense, the court will be faced with a difficult choice between instructing the\n   jury to disregard the evidence or declaring a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gantt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1386822,3787079\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/831/\">\n    617 F.2d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Sensitive to the cost in time and judicial resources, the trial court decided it was not \"necessary or appropriate\" to have an entirely separate \"mini trial\" (\"but not really a mini\") on the criminal street gang charges. Nonetheless, the court did consider at a lengthy pretrial hearing whether to permit various criminal acts to be introduced to prove gang affiliation or as\n   <em>\n    Drew\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   evidence to show motive and context. For instance, the trial judge came to the conclusion that evidence of selling drugs was probative of the connection between Walker and Donaldson and the context of the relationship between them (teenagers) and Holmes and Persha (women in their late forties or fifties). In addition, the trial judge denied a motion to exclude photos of graffiti because this evidence \"was probative of the existence of a criminal street gang.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   No precedent mandates the type of pretrial hearing that Walker requested, there are good reasons not to require it, and appellant has not identified specific evidence that should have been excluded as irrelevant or unduly prejudicial. Further, appellant has not shown how the trial court abused its discretion in deciding that evidence of the street gang's existence and hatred for snitches was intertwined with the evidence of the shootings and murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Because appellants did not preserve this issue, and have not demonstrated plain error, we have not addressed the complex question of whether (and under what circumstances) a defendant has due process rights to exclude witness testimony on the grounds that it was coerced. Appellants therefore have not established that they are entitled to a new trial. Walker's additional claims of reversible error at trial are unsuccessful for the reasons stated above.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judgments of the Superior Court are\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Devon Davis was indicted with Walker and Donaldson, but entered a guilty plea and was sentenced in 2012.

This court has not considered appellate court opinions to be \"evidence\" for purposes of seeking a new trial. Appellants' proposition that evidence of the involuntariness of Little's statements could not have been discovered in advance of Walker and Donaldson's trial is incorrect. As discussed above, appellants could have timely moved to suppress Little's statements based on involuntariness. The fact that the judge presiding over Little's trial had already deemed his confession voluntary does not excuse appellants' failure to seek exclusion from their own trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Some courts recognize a defendant's right to challenge involuntary witness statements on due process grounds, but they require a showing that the witness testimony is false or unreliable or that there was extreme government misconduct.
