Foreman; Curtis K. Marando and Theresea L. Marando; Peter McKay and Gretchen McKay; Susan McMurray Living Trust; David A. Miller; Jonathan C. Miller; Vaughn P. Miller and Kim Miller; Carol Riffer; and Ruth Trent and George E. Trent (hereafter \"Private Landowners\") to Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, Inc.'s (Conservancy) Amended Petition for Review in the nature of a complaint in equity for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief filed in this Court's original jurisdiction. For the reasons that follow, we sustain the preliminary objections, in part, and transfer the matter to the Court of Common Pleas of Clarion County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Conservancy brings an action pursuant to the Declaratory Judgments Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7531 - 7541,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking a declaration that a public prescriptive easement exists across 12 parcels of land in Clarion County owned by DCNR and the Private Landowners. According to the Amended Petition for Review (Amended Petition), the Conservancy is a Pennsylvania non-profit corporation that is \"a volunteer-based organization dedicated to the development, protection, and promotion of hiking, biking, and walking trails throughout western Pennsylvania.\" (Amended Petition \u00b6 3.) Although the Conservancy was initially founded in 1992 as the Harmony Trails Council, in 2004 it became steward of both the Rachel Carson Trail and Baker Trail and adopted its current name.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Conservancy alleges that DCNR and the Private Landowners all own property in Clarion County, Farmington Township along River Lane, between the start of River Lane at its intersection with Gravel Lick Road and its terminus at the entrance to Cook Forest State Park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Conservancy avers that the Baker Trail is a 133-mile hiking and backpacking trail located north of Pittsburgh.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. In Clarion County, one portion of the Baker Trail follows the River Lane roadway for one-half mile across private and Commonwealth-owned property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. According to the Amended Petition, the portion of the Baker Trail that follows River Lane is important to the overall trail because it provides hikers with scenic views\n   of the Clarion River and it makes additional portions of the trail, leading into and out of Cook Forest State Park, readily and easily accessible to the public-at-large for hiking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Conservancy asserts that the Baker Trail was first marked, or \"blazed,\" by the Western Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Youth Hostel (AYH) in the 1950s.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The Baker Trail has also been recognized on hiking maps and in hiking guidebooks since then.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Since the 1950s, trail markers or blazes have been continuously maintained by volunteers along the River Lane section of the Baker Trail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. The hiking trail following River Lane has also been used since the 1950s for its scenic views of the Clarion River and provides access to additional trails in Cook Forest State Park.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Conservancy alleges that there has been continuous, uninterrupted, and historic use of the River Lane hiking trail for at least 21 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. According to the Petition, a 1950 issue of \"Hosteling\" magazine described the Baker Trail and included a hand-drawn map of the section of the Baker Trail that follows River Lane.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. Roger Mazzarella has hiked the Baker Trail, including the River Lane section, as a member of the general public, at least once a year since the 1960s.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Further, Glenn Oster maintained the Baker Trail from the late 1950s until 1990 as Baker Trail Manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. During this time, Oster viewed the River Lane section of the Baker Trail as open for public use and personally hiked that section of the trail a half dozen times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jim Ritchie took over Oster's position in 1990.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. From 1990 until 2002, Ritchie led members of the public and volunteers on recreational hikes and maintenance days along the River Lane section of the trail at least once a year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, from 2004 until the present, Dewaine Beard has personally hiked the River Lane section of the trail on a regular basis and organized annual outings that bring together volunteers and members of the public-at-large to hike and conduct maintenance of the River Lane portion of the trail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. The Amended Petition also asserts that one of the Private Landowners, George Trent, has owned property along River Lane from 1988 until the present, and that during that time he has observed members of the public, including Conservancy members, using River Lane for hiking.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Conservancy avers that when the Western Pennsylvania Chapter of the AYH disbanded in 2003, the Conservancy took over stewardship of the Baker Trail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. The Conservancy \"currently stewards the trail with assistance from volunteers, public agencies, municipalities, and Private Landowners, all for the benefit of the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   However, the Conservancy alleges that since 2011, several of the Private Landowners have attempted to prohibit the public's use of the River Lane section of the hiking trail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. In particular, in 2011, trail users began reporting to the Conservancy that \"they were confronted, intimidated, yelled at, or generally forced into leaving the trail along River Lane.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, in 2014, the Conservancy filed an action against the Private Landowners in the Court of Common Pleas of Clarion County seeking a declaration that a public prescriptive easement exists over the River Lane section of the Baker Trail. The Private Landowners filed preliminary objections, on the ground that the Conservancy had failed to join DCNR, which the Private Landowners argued was an indispensable party. The Court of Common Pleas of Clarion County determined DCNR was an indispensable party and\n   sustained the preliminary objections. Because it determined that DCNR was an indispensable party, the Court of Common Pleas of Clarion County also concluded that original jurisdiction was vested with the Commonwealth Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Conservancy subsequently sought clarity from DCNR regarding its position vis-\u00e0-vis the properties along River Lane.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. According to the Amended Petition, DCNR informed the Conservancy that \"if a court determines that a public easement exists for trail use of River Lane, DCNR would not oppose such use on its owned and controlled land.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Conservancy then filed the instant action against DCNR and the Private Landowners in this Court's original jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Amended Petition avers that the public has adversely used the River Lane section of the Baker Trail since the 1950s and that the public's use has been open and notorious as evidenced by the publication of the trail in hiking guides and maps, and maintenance of blazes along the trail.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 \u00b6 51-52. The Conservancy also avers that the public's use has been continuous and uninterrupted for at least 21 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Thus, the Conservancy asserts that the allegations in the Amended Petition establish the requisite elements of a public prescriptive easement for the hiking trail that runs along River Lane.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The Conservancy requests that we declare the existence of a public easement across both DCNR and the Private Landowners' land, which would enable the public to use River Lane for continued public pedestrian trail access.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 A. The Conservancy also requests that we grant injunctive relief against all Respondents \"thereby allowing [the Conservancy] and members of the public to continue to utilize the public easement along River Lane for public pedestrian trail access.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   DCNR has preliminarily objected to the Amended Petition on the following grounds: (1) legal insufficiency because the alleged easement is statutorily foreclosed due to passing through an unenclosed woodland; (2) legal insufficiency because prescriptive easements cannot be obtained on Commonwealth property; (3) legal insufficiency in that the Amended Petition lacks any allegation that the use of River Lane was adverse, which is necessary to establish a prescriptive easement; and (4) lack of subject matter jurisdiction because proper jurisdiction lies with the State Board of Property. The Private Landowners preliminarily object on the following grounds: (1) legal insufficiency in that \"easements in gross\" may not be established by prescription, but rather, only in writing; (2) legal insufficiency because the Conservancy lacks standing and, as a private organization, cannot bring a prescriptive easement claim on behalf of the \"public\"; and (3) the Amended Petition is insufficiently specific.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Legal Sufficiency of the Conservancy's Claim Against DCNR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We first address\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   whether the Conservancy is barred from obtaining a\n   prescriptive easement against DCNR, thereby making the Amended Petition legally insufficient. DCNR argues that the law governing prescriptive easement claims is analogous to adverse possession claims. DCNR contends that because adverse possession claims cannot be maintained against the Commonwealth, neither can prescriptive easement claims and, therefore, the Conservancy's claim that a prescriptive easement exists over two DCNR-owned properties is legally insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response, the Conservancy does not dispute that a prescriptive easement cannot be obtained on land owned by DCNR. However, the Conservancy argues that the preliminary objection should be overruled because DCNR has indicated it would not oppose a public trail across its parcels of land on River Lane if this Court finds a public prescriptive easement against the Private Landowners. The Conservancy contends that DCNR is an indispensable party to the action because DCNR owns two parcels of land on River Lane on either side of the Private Landowners' land. Because DCNR owns these two parcels of land, the Conservancy asserts that the public could not have lawful access to the entirety of River Lane, as necessary to make it a public trail, unless DCNR is a party to this lawsuit. Due to DCNR's alleged acquiescence to a public trail on its two parcels of land, the Conservancy admits that this Court does not need to find a prescriptive easement over DCNR's land to grant the Conservancy the relief it seeks. The Conservancy also contends that it joined DCNR as a party to this lawsuit in response to the Court of Common Pleas of Clarion County dismissing the Conservancy's complaint after determining the Conservancy had failed to join DCNR as an indispensable party to the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Public Prescriptive Easement Claims against Commonwealth Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is well-settled that \"a prescriptive easement is acquired by analogy to the acquisition of title to land through adverse possession for twenty-one years.\"\n   <em>\n    Morning Call, Inc. v.

In fact, the General Assembly has codified the general preclusion of claims of adverse possession against the Commonwealth as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to give any title to any lands by a claim of title adverse to that of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and no claim of title adverse to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall be made or recorded under the provisions of this act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Act of May 31, 1901, P.L. 352, 68 P.S. \u00a7 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because claims of adverse possession do not lie against the Commonwealth\n   and the establishment of prescriptive easements is analogous to the establishment of title to land by adverse possession, we conclude that prescriptive easements cannot be maintained against Commonwealth property. Thus, the Conservancy fails to state a prescriptive easement claim against DCNR. Before dismissing the Conservancy's claim against DCNR outright, however, we must first analyze whether DCNR is to any extent an indispensable party requiring continued joinder to this action, as alleged by the Conservancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Since the Conservancy is legally unable to obtain a prescriptive easement against DCNR, and DCNR is not a servient tenement to any prospective easement, this case differs from both\n   <em>\n    Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Barren\n   </em>\n   . Because DCNR would not be negatively affected by a finding of a prescriptive easement on the Private Landowners' land, it cannot be deemed an indispensable party based on any infringement of its rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While the Conservancy acknowledges in its brief that it cannot bring a prescriptive easement claim against a Commonwealth party, it argues that DCNR is indispensable because DCNR owns two parcels of land on either side of the Private Landowners' land and the public will not be able to access the River Lane hiking trail without traversing across DCNR's land. The Conservancy also argues that DCNR is indispensable because it has allegedly indicated, in a letter, that it will not oppose the use of its own land for the hiking trail in the event the Conservancy obtains a prescriptive easement for a hiking trail across the Private Landowners' land. However, because a prescriptive easement can never be established on DCNR's land, we conclude that DCNR's ownership of the two adjacent parcels and alleged agreement to permit a hiking trail on same is too \"tangential\" and \"minimal\" of an involvement to make it an indispensable party to this matter. Given that DCNR is not an indispensable party and its involvement is not required to afford meaningful relief, we sustain DCNR's preliminary objection to the Amended Petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    3.
