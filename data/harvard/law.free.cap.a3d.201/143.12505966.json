The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   (1) Did the Panel err by disregarding the plain language of the Municipality Authorities Act (\"MAA\"), 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5610(e) which expressly requires a vote by the majority of \"members present\" for an authority to take action, instead applying a common law quorum rule that has never applied to MAA authorities or to discretionary contracting processes, effectively superimposing the words \"and voting\" into the statute?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   (2) Did the Panel err by ignoring this Supreme Court's elimination of any presumption in favor of the common law voting rule for representative bodies of limited membership as well as operative provisions of the Statutory Construction Act (\"SCA\"), on the basis that the MAA was a pre-1937 enactment, where no applicable jurisprudence supports applying the common law rule to MAA authorities or discretionary procurement processes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   (3) Did the Panel apply an incorrect standard of review and improperly subvert the discretion of [the] JRA and its individual public official board members by superimposing a different voting standard than that chosen by [the] JRA for its discretionary procurement process, which tracks the language of 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5610(e)[,] and by ignoring the affirmative provisions of the RFP and the voting standard announcement?\n  </blockquote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
