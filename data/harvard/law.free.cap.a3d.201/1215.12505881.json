In February 2013, Carl E. and Elizabeth A. Breivogel contacted Sweet through his construction-business website and inquired about building \"an enclosed, [weathertight] frame home\" on land they own on Mount Desert Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] In March 2013, the Breivogels traveled to Maine and met with Sweet at his self-constructed timber frame home. During that visit, the Breivogels viewed\n   Sweet's workshops as well as two other timber frame homes that Sweet had constructed. While the parties did not reach any agreements that day, Sweet did provide the Breivogels with some information about the relative costs of the homes they visited. Specifically, he told the Breivogels that it would cost approximately $ 500,000 to build a 28' x 30' completed home like his and $ 400,000 to construct the 32' x 32' home they visited that was little more than a \"dried shell\" or \"weathertight\" home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] After that meeting, the parties continued to communicate via email. In one exchange dated March 26, 2013, the parties began to discuss the costs associated with building a saltbox style\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   timber frame home. The Breivogels asked Sweet whether it would be possible to build a home of this style for $ 275,000, not including the septic system for which the Breivogels would make other arrangements. Sweet responded that it was possible, but difficult to be certain at that early stage of the discussion because \"the devil[']s in the details.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] From that point forward, the parties did not share the same understanding of the scope and cost of the work Sweet was to perform. Sweet believed that the Breivogels wanted him to construct an enclosed, weathertight timber frame home-including only a frame, walls, roof, insulation, doors, windows, chimney, and exterior shingles. In contrast, the Breivogels believed that they had requested a fully completed home, ready for occupancy, costing no more than $ 275,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b67] In April 2013, the Breivogels authorized Sweet to begin construction; however, the parties never signed a contract. When the Breivogels inquired when the parties would formalize the terms of the project, Sweet insisted that he had never signed a written contract in over thirty years of business. The parties did, however, arrange that the Breivogels would be billed biweekly and pay for all materials and any labor at $ 32 an hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b68] Sweet and his team began construction of a dried shell structure in the summer of 2013 and completed the work in December of that year. Throughout the project, Sweet sent numerous emails to the Breivogels containing photographs depicting the progress on their home. He also provided biweekly invoices; despite these frequent communications, however, Sweet's overall record-keeping process throughout the project was highly informal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b69] After December, both parties understood that work on the home would progress beyond the dried shell phase. At that point, the Breivogels determined, without informing Sweet, that they would have Sweet continue to work on the project, but would initiate legal action against him after they obtained a certificate of occupancy. They intended to seek damages for payments made in excess of $ 275,000. The Breivogels continued to pay Sweet until May 4, 2014. Construction of the home was completed and the Breivogels\n   received their certificate of occupancy on May 15, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b610] In total, Sweet billed the Breivogels $ 602,250.98 for materials and services. The Breivogels had paid $ 601,195.75. After the Breivogels refused to tender any further payments, Sweet placed a $ 51,953.94 lien on the home for unpaid labor and brought this action against the Breivogels for that amount plus interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Breivogels asserted counterclaims for negligence, breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of the implied warranty of workmanship, and a violation of the UTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b611] The Superior Court (Hancock County,\n   <em>\n    R. Murray, J.\n   </em>\n   ) concluded that Sweet was entitled to the money that he had already received from the Breivogels for the home under the theory of quantum meruit; however, the court also determined that Sweet had actually overcharged the Breivogels by $ 640.77 for the work performed by a tiler. With respect to the Breivogels' counterclaims, the court concluded that they failed to establish that Sweet was negligent, had breached any contractual obligation to perform in a workmanlike manner, or had breached any implied warranty relating to workmanship. It also determined that Sweet did not commit fraud or negligent misrepresentation. However, the court did find that Sweet violated the HCCA by failing to furnish a written contract, which was prima facie evidence of a UTPA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b612] The Breivogels filed a motion for amended and additional findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court declined to amend the factual findings, but awarded the Breivogels $ 3,832.43 in costs and $ 30,000 in attorney fees as permitted by the UTPA. The Breivogels timely appealed. M.R. App. P. 2A(a), 2B(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b613] The Breivogels contend that the Superior Court erred in (1) determining that they did not meet their burden of proof as to their counterclaims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract; (2) calculating the damages recoverable under the UTPA stemming from Sweet's violation of the HCCA; and (3) awarding an insufficient amount of attorney fees. We disagree and affirm the trial court's judgment in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A. The Breivogels' Counterclaims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b614] Because, at trial, the Breivogels had the burden of proof on each of their counterclaims and the Superior Court concluded that they failed to meet their burden, we must determine whether, on appeal, they have demonstrated that \"a contrary finding is compelled by the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Gravison,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814201\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/857/\">\n    2016 ME 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6814201\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/857/\">\n    134 A.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v.

The court was entitled to find, as it did, that throughout the construction process, the parties held different understandings of the work to be performed and the total cost of the project. The court was also entitled to find that, because of this difference in understanding, the parties did not form an express contract. Therefore, the court did not err in concluding that the Breivogels failed to prove that Sweet committed fraud, negligent misrepresentation, or breach of contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784251\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/131/\">\n    2016 ME 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 8,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6784251\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/131/\">\n    143 A.3d 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868015\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/86/\">\n    2015 ME 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868015\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/115/86/\">\n    115 A.3d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    St. Louis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311135\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/55/443/\">\n    2012 ME 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311135\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/55/443/\">\n    55 A.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b616] The Breivogels also contend that the court abused its discretion in its award of damages in this case. Because the court found that there was no contract between the parties, it applied the principles of quantum meruit and concluded that the Breivogels had suffered a \"relatively slight loss of money in the amount of $ 640.77\" under the UTPA. The Breivogels argue that the court's application of this legal principle was misplaced because the parties never reached a common understanding of the material terms of the project and because Sweet's violations of the HCCA and UTPA warranted a larger award of damages. We will vacate an award of damages only when there is no competent evidence in the record to support it.\n   <em>\n    Woodworth v. Gaddis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311695\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/58/1109/\">\n    2012 ME 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7311695\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/58/1109/\">\n    58 A.3d 1109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   1. Quantum Meruit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b617] Quantum meruit is appropriate where there is no formal written contract but a contract implied in fact can be inferred from the parties' conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paffhausen v. Balano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11810252\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/269/\">\n    1998 ME 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11810252\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/269/\">\n    708 A.2d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In these circumstances, quantum meruit requires that \"(1) services were rendered to the defendant by the plaintiff; (2) with the knowledge and consent of the defendant; and (3) under circumstances that make it reasonable for the plaintiff to expect payment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Although contract formalities do not exist with respect to an implied contract, there must be a reasonable expectation of compensation for goods or services rendered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. A party may recover under quantum meruit even where \"there was not a clear accession on both sides to one and the same terms\" if it is clear from the circumstances that the services were not intended to be gratuitous.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b618] In this case, while it is clear that the parties did not sign a contract or share an exact understanding of the scope and terms of construction, the court's application of quantum meruit was appropriate. The parties engaged in months of discussions and planning before the project began and remained in fairly constant communication throughout every phase of construction. In particular, the binders of emails and hundreds of photographs admitted in this case, combined with evidence of the Breivogels' numerous site visits, support the court's conclusion that the Breivogels were aware of and assented to Sweet's performance of the work on their property. The Breivogels could have terminated the project at any time, but instead continued working with Sweet, despite admitted misgivings, and accepted the full benefit of Sweet's services in the form of a\n   completed timber frame home ready for occupancy. Given the court's findings, to allow the Breivogels to accept the benefit of Sweet's work without paying the value of materials and services undercuts the purpose of quantum meruit: to allow recovery for services rendered when the words or conduct of the recipient created an expectation of compensation.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Breivogels permitted Sweet to continue the project beyond the dried shell phase-the point at which the Breivogels realized that Sweet had a different understanding of the scope and cost of construction-and allowed him to continue working until their home was fit for occupancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b619] Moreover, contrary to the Breivogels' arguments challenging the court's assessment of the reasonable value of the work Sweet completed, the court did not err in its determination of damages. Based on the testimony of the parties and Sweet's expert witness, the evidence of multiple requested upgrades and demands for luxury-quality materials, and the biweekly invoices in evidence, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Sweet was entitled to $ 600,554.98, which had already been paid by the Breivogels, nor in concluding that the Breivogels overpaid by $ 640.77 for the tiler's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   2. Recovery Under the UTPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b620] The Breivogels further argue that they are entitled to greater recovery under the UTPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10 M.R.S. \u00a7 1490 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 213(1), (2). Contrary to their arguments, the court understood correctly the interplay between the HCCA and UTPA and properly applied the law in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b621] The court found, and neither party disputes, that the agreement to build the Breivogels' home falls within the ambit of the HCCA. 10 M.R.S. \u00a7 1487. The HCCA is intended to combat the problems of \"faulty home construction,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   L.D. 1044 (113th Legis. 1987), and requires that \"[a]ny home construction contract for more than $ 3,000 in materials or labor must be in writing.\" 10 M.R.S. \u00a7 1487. While there is no remedy specified under the HCCA, a violation of the HCCA is considered prima facie evidence of a violation of the UTPA, which does provide for specific remedies, including restitution and attorney fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10 M.R.S. \u00a7 1490(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   5 M.R.S. \u00a7 213(1), (2) ;\n   <em>\n    VanVoorhees v.

Like the homeowner in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , the Breivogels (1) proved violations of the HCCA and UTPA, but failed to identify any injury or demonstrate a substantial loss of money or property resulting from the violations-i.e. a loss stemming specifically from Sweet's failure to memorialize the parties' agreement in writing-and (2) received the benefit of the materials and services provided by Sweet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7939880\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/612/1283/#p1284\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1284-85 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tungate v.

Because the trial court is in the best position to observe the unique nature and tenor of the litigation as it relates to a request for attorney fees, we review the grant of fees for abuse of discretion and any underlying factual findings for clear error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roussel v.

We are not persuaded by the Breivogels' bare assertions that all of the claims and counterclaims in this case are inextricably linked, and we affirm the Superior Court's award of fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b626] In counterpoint to the Breivogels' challenge to the sufficiency of the attorney fees award in this case, the court's judgment\n   underscores the importance of the statutory requirement of having written contracts in home construction projects subject to the HCCA. 10 M.R.S. \u00a7 1487. In projects of this magnitude, especially in an industry as specialized as the construction of traditional timber frame homes, the absence of a written contract can lead to unfulfilled expectations, immense confusion between homeowners and contractors, and costly litigation. It is clear from the record that Sweet and the Breivogels did not share the same understanding of the scope and cost of this project, a failing that could have been clarified by a written agreement. However, Sweet's violations of the HCCA and UTPA were properly remedied by the court. Not only must Sweet pay his own attorney fees, he must also pay $ 30,000 of the Breivogels' fees, a substantial penalty for his serious violations, and, in addition, he has lost his lien claim of $ 52,478.35 for allegedly uncompensated work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    In their testimony, Sweet and his son, John Sweet III, explained that a \"dried shell\" or \"weathertight\" home refers to a building that has a traditional timber frame, a roof, and exterior walls, but does not have electricity, plumbing, fixtures, or completed rooms. Because cutting into the timbers after the frame is complete compromises the home's structure and integrity, a dried shell is often built with an overall plan for the completed home in mind. In contrast, a completed home ready for occupancy includes features such as a kitchen, functioning bathrooms, light fixtures, and internal walls for rooms.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    A saltbox style home is \"a house ... having two stories in front and one at the rear, and a gable roof with a much longer slope at the rear.\"\n    <em>\n     Saltbox\n    </em>\n    , Webster's New World College Dictionary (5th ed. 2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Although the record is sparse with regard to the basis for this amount, Sweet testified that he filed the lien to recover money owed to him for his own labor and for work performed on the project by the plumbing contractor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    When determining what constitutes reasonable attorney fees, the trial court considers the following factors:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    (1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions presented; (3) the skill required to perform the legal services; (4) the preclusion of other employment by the attorneys due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee in the community; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) the time limitations imposed by client or circumstances; (8) the degree of success; (9) the experience, reputation and ability of the attorneys; (10) the undesirability of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <em>\n     Homeward Residential, Inc. v.
