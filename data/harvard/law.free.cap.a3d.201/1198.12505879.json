Posey was convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm and related offenses. On appeal, Mr. Posey seeks reversal of his convictions on the ground that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress a handgun that was found on his person. He contends that the police lacked reasonable articulable suspicion to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   stop, and therefore, his Fourth Amendment rights were violated. For the reasons stated below, we agree with Mr. Posey and reverse his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the suppression hearing, the government presented the testimony of Metropolitan Police Department Officer Michael Kasco. Officer Kasco testified that he and his partner, Officer Ron Orgel, received a radio run (\"lookout\") for a robbery at gunpoint in the unit block of M Street N.W. According to Officer Kasco, this first lookout contained a description of the suspect, \"a black male dressed in all black.\" While responding to the scene, officers received a second lookout reporting that \"it was a group of black males, and the group was last seen heading towards North Capitol\" Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As Officers Kasco and Orgel arrived on the unit block of M Street, they saw \"Sergeant Ritchie[ ] was already on the scene with the complainant.\" The officers also observed a group of five or more black males mostly dressed in black jackets, on the same block as the complainant and their sergeant, walking towards North Capitol Street. Officer Kasco testified that \"[i]t was a group that possibly may have been involved with the robbery\" but admitted that the officers did not \"know.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Aware that the patrol was in a predominately African-American neighborhood where groups \"typically ... just scatter\" from police, Officer Kasco drove to within fifteen feet of the group that included Mr. Posey. The group briefly stopped, turned, and looked at the marked police cruiser. At the time they approached the group, nothing Mr. Posey did drew any particular attention to him. Officer Kasco testified that he did not observe Mr. Posey exchange anything with other members of the group, make any motions toward or to conceal his waistband, or do anything illegal. Officer Kasco's attention turned from the group to Mr. Posey only after Mr. Posey \"took off running\" and \"Officer Orgel immediately jumped out of the\" patrol car in pursuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly thereafter Mr. Posey was apprehended and handcuffed by Officer Orgel because the \"lookout was for an armed robbery with a gun.\" Officer Kasco then came up, conducted a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   pat down for safety, and found a handgun in Mr. Posey's front waistband. Mr. Posey did not resist and was not identified as the armed robber during a subsequent show-up identification with the victim. According to Officer Kasco, the entire encounter - from the time officers drove up to the scene to the time the show-up identification was conducted - took place within \"[f]ive to ten minutes\" of the second lookout.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In denying Mr. Posey's suppression motion, the trial court admitted that it was a close question. First, the trial court recognized that the description of the suspect was \"quite vague\" and there was a valid concern \"about the ability of the police to act on such a generalized description.\" It\n   determined, however, that the particular circumstances of this case were sufficient to overcome such vagueness because Mr. Posey was located \"a block away, within five to ten minutes after the crime had been reported.\" The trial court then found that Mr. Posey was the only member of his group to flee when officers arrived \"in their marked squad car in full uniform,\" without any \"demonstration that it was their intent to approach that group of individuals.\" Based on these facts, the trial court made the \"difficult\" determination that there was reasonable articulable suspicion for the police to stop Mr. Posey on suspicion of robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the suppression hearing, Mr. Posey entered into a stipulation agreement admitting to the facts related to the handgun found on his person during the stop. As a result of the stipulation, Mr. Posey was found guilty of four offenses. The trial court suspended his sentence pending this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we must defer to the [trial] court's findings of evidentiary fact and view those facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to sustaining the ruling below.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

But approached individuals are free to refuse to speak with officers or avoid them altogether.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , 590 A.2d at 1019 (\"Citizens have no legal obligation to talk to police.\"). Officers must then continue to establish facts corroborating reports from the public and build on their hunches by other means.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12321576\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/1259/#p1264\">\n    157 A.3d at 1262-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing step-by-step investigation of information, identifying a suspect, whose actions during the investigation justified a search). We thus require officers to make observations to develop their legitimate circumstantial hunches\n   into articulable suspicion that the individuals they choose to stop are engaged in criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347090\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/87/#p91\">\n    173 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   91 ;\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12321576\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/1259/#p1264\">\n    157 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1264-65 ;\n   <em>\n    Pridgen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6811550\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/297/#p302\">\n    134 A.3d at 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No evidence in our record suggests that the officers here completed the final investigative step prior to seizing Mr. Posey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Just as Mr. Posey's presence in a group on the same block as the robbery some five to ten minutes after the crime was\n   <em>\n    reported\n   </em>\n   does not exclude him from suspicion, he correctly notes that his presence amongst such a group does not necessarily point the finger in his direction. The trial court found that Mr. Posey was discovered by the officers near the scene of the crime five to ten minutes after the report of the robbery but heard no testimony and made no findings about when the crime actually occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7279542\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/26/745/#p754\">\n    26 A.3d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 (D.C. 2011) (recognizing that it takes \"some amount of time\" for reports of criminal activity to reach responding officers). These minimally proximate facts do not paint the picture brightly enough for us to afford them the seemingly dispositive weight assigned by the trial court. Because the officers did not make any observations fortifying the vague lookouts with specific probative facts describing this group in relation to the scene of the crime relative to the time that the robbery\n   <em>\n    occurred\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that they had no cause to cast any particular suspicion on this group or subsequently identify Mr. Posey as the robber due to his association with that group.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12317495\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/164/102/#p107\">\n    164 A.3d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Being alone in the area of the reported crime limits the universe of potential persons ensnared by a general description and strengthens individualized suspicion in any one person\" while \"[p]resence in a populated area ... does the opposite.\"). We therefore cannot accept the government's invitation to infer that Officers Kasco and Orgel arrived in close temporal proximity to the crime merely because they were in close spatial proximity to the scene when they heard the lookouts, headed to the crime scene, saw their sergeant already on the scene with the complainant, and found Mr. Posey in a group walking up the block on which the crime had at some earlier time occurred.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re T.L.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11615056\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/729/334/#p340\">\n    729 A.2d at 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The generality of the descriptions of the robbers may not have been fatal if the accused had been apprehended immediately after the robbery at the location where the crime occurred.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The government suggests that Mr. Posey's presence in a high crime neighborhood coupled with his flight from uniformed officers is enough to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies in the evidence before us. We harbor no doubt that more is required for officers to develop reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity justifying a stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While we cannot and do not say that encounters with police in a high crime neighborhood are irrelevant per se, we can accord no real significance to the nature of the neighborhood in this case.

Rather, the officers were investigating a robbery that had already occurred and been reported with nothing more than a vague lookout description.

Nothing about Mr. Posey's conduct prior to his flight or during Officer Orgel's pursuit supports a contrary finding.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494715\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/633/#p637\">\n    181 A.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]n individual may be motivated to avoid the police by a natural fear or dislike of authority, a distaste for police officers based upon past experience, an exaggerated fear of police ... or other legitimate personal reasons.\" (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted) ). Unlike those cases where flight contributes to reasonable articulable suspicion, Officer Kasco did not observe Mr. Posey doing anything illegal as the officers approached.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coghill v.

Nor did Officer Kasco indicate that the manner of Mr. Posey's flight was itself suggestive of armed robbery.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12347090\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/87/#p91\">\n    173 A.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When the officers approached ...

If Officer Orgel developed knowledge of any other fact tending to identify Mr. Posey as the robber, the government did not present that information at the suppression hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Under the totality of these circumstances, the officers approached the group and acted on a hunch short of the individualized and particularized knowledge needed to stop Mr. Posey on suspicion of robbery. We hold simply that a nondescript individual distinguishing himself from an equally nondescript crowd by running away from officers unprovoked does not, without more, provide a reasonable basis for suspecting that individual of being involved in criminal activity and subjecting him or her to an intrusive stop and police search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Because we conclude that the officers lacked the particularized suspicion necessary to subject Mr. Posey to a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop, the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Without the firearm evidence discovered as a result of the illegal stop, Mr. Posey could not have been found guilty of the various weapons offenses for which he was convicted. Because the stipulated facts leading to Mr. Posey's conviction by the trial court were conditioned on the admission into evidence of the gun illegally seized from him, his convictions are reversed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    <em>\n     Terry v.
