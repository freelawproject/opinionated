The commission held a public hearing on the\n   plaintiff's applications on July 9, 2009, July 23, 2009, September 3, 2009, and October 1, 2009, and closed the public hearing on October 1, 2009.... On October 15, 2009, the commission met and voted to deny both applications....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"The plaintiff filed an appeal with respect to each application (zoning appeals). In its appeals, the plaintiff alleged that the commission illegally and arbitrarily predetermined the outcome of each of its applications prior to the public hearing and was motivated by improper notions of bias and personal animus when it denied each of the applications....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Following a trial, the court,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Richard M. Rittenband,\n   </em>\n   judge trial referee, found that the plaintiff's allegations of bias and ex parte communication arose from the actions of [the defendant], a member of the commission. More specifically, the court found that [the defendant] took part in the hearing on the plaintiff's applications, played a significant role in the deliberations, and voted to deny the plaintiff's applications. [The defendant] had been a social friend of one of the plaintiff's owners, Jeannette Tallarita, and her husband, Patrick Tallarita.... There was a falling out among the friends, and the court found that [the defendant] was biased against Patrick Tallarita, who represented the plaintiff at the hearing before the commission.\n   <em>\n    The court also found that [the defendant] engaged in an ex parte communication regarding the applications.\n   </em>\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"The court found two instances of conduct by the defendant that gave rise to the plaintiff's claim of bias\n   against her, only one of which was relevant to the zoning appeals.... In the incident described by the court, the defendant had stated that she wanted [Patrick Tallarita] to suffer the same fate of denial by the commission that she had suffered.... At trial, Anthony DiPace testified that [the defendant] had stated to him that the commission, when it previously considered an application that she had submitted, had screwed her and treated her unfairly when it denied that application. She was unhappy with [Patrick] Tallarita, who was then mayor, because he did not intervene on her behalf. She stated in the presence of DiPace that she wanted [Patrick] Tallarita to suffer the same fate, i.e., that the commission deny the plaintiff's applications. [Patrick] Tallarita did not become aware of [the defendant's] statement regarding the fate of the plaintiff's applications until after the commission had closed the public hearing [on the plaintiff's applications]. The court found that [the defendant's] comments were blatantly biased [against Patrick] Tallarita and should not be tolerated. The court also found that it had not been possible for the plaintiff to bring [the defendant's] comments regarding [Patrick] Tallarita to the attention of the commission because he learned of them after the hearing had closed and the commission had denied the plaintiff's applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Credibility was a deciding factor in the court's decision regarding [the defendant's] ex parte communication. [Patrick] Tallarita, DiPace, and Bryon Meade testified during the trial. The court found that each of the men was a credible witness. [The defendant] also testified at trial, but the court found that her testimony was filled with denials of the allegations and concluded that her comments did not ring true. The court found that Meade, a representative of the Hazardville Water Authority, testified with confidence that [the defendant] had met with him in person regarding the plaintiff's\n   applications during the first week of October, 2009. [The defendant] testified, however, that Meade must have been confused because she met with him regarding another property. The court stated that [the defendant's] testimony was just not credible.\n   \"In addressing the plaintiff's claim that [the defendant] improperly engaged in ex parte communications with Meade, the court noted that [o]ur law clearly prohibits the use of information by a municipal agency that has been supplied to it by\n   <em>\n    a party\n   </em>\n   to a contested hearing on an ex parte basis.... The court found that it was clear that [the defendant] had an ex parte communication with Meade. Once the plaintiff had proven that the ex parte communication had occurred, the burden shifted to the commission to demonstrate that such communication was harmless.... The court found that the commission had not met its burden to prove that [the defendant's] ex parte communication was harmless....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The court reviewed the transcript of the commission's October 15, 2009 meeting when it considered the plaintiff's applications. It found that the transcript was twenty-three pages long and that [the defendant's] comments appeared on every page but one, and that on most pages, [the defendant's] comments were the most lengthy. Her comments raised many negative questions about the plaintiff's applications. Moreover, in offering her comments, she cited her experience as an appraiser. The court found that [the defendant] dominated the meeting and that she intended to have a major effect on the commission's deliberations and subsequent votes. The court found clear and egregious bias on [the defendant's] part, and that her impact on the commission's deliberations and votes alone were reason to sustain the plaintiff's appeals....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Judge Rittenband concluded that, on the basis of the bias [the defendant] demonstrated against the plaintiff and\n   <em>\n    her ex parte communication with Meade\n   </em>\n   , along with her biased, aggressive, and vociferous arguments against the applications on October 15, 2009, the commission's action was not honest, legal, and fair.

The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that the party is, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... Our review of the trial court's decision to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment is plenary.... On appeal, we must determine whether the legal conclusions reached by the trial court are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in\n   the facts set out in the memorandum of decision of the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cefaratti\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Aranow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485080\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/837/#p645\">\n    321 Conn. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 645,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12485080\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/837/#p645\">\n    138 A.3d 837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its complaint, the plaintiff presented two claims. First, it alleged that the defendant \"continuously intentionally misrepresented to the plaintiff that she was a neutral, honest, fair and unbiased member of the [c]ommission.\" Second, it alleged that the defendant\n   \"intentionally and tortiously interfered with the relationship between the plaintiff and the [c]ommission and tortiously interfered with the plaintiff's expectation that it was investing time money and effort into proceedings that were fair, honest and legal proceedings.\" We address each of the plaintiff's claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The first claim in the plaintiff's complaint is fraudulent misrepresentation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"The essential elements of an action in common law fraud, as we have repeatedly held, are that: (1) a false representation was made as a statement of fact; (2) it was untrue and known to be untrue by the party making it; (3) it was made to induce the other party to act upon it; and (4) the other party did so act upon that false representation to his injury.... Under a fraud claim of this type, the party to whom the false representation was made claims to have relied on that representation and to have suffered harm as a result of the reliance.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Sturm\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Harb Development, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345025\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/124/#p142\">\n    298 Conn. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 142,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20A.3d%20859\">\n    2 A.3d 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). In its memorandum of decision, the court concluded that the plaintiff \"failed to present evidence that would sufficiently support the essential elements of the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation that the defendant knowingly made misrepresentations to the plaintiff with the intention of inducing the plaintiff to rely on such misrepresentations.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the defendant made a false representation \"by continuously representing to the plaintiff that she was an honest, unbiased decision maker by sitting in judgment on the commission concerning the applications ....\" Assuming, arguendo, that the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence to support the first two elements of fraud, i.e., that her participation in the proceedings while biased constituted a false representation, the plaintiff has not established how the defendant's participation in the proceedings while biased against the plaintiff was intended to induce the plaintiff to act on that representation or caused the plaintiff to act on that representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In its brief, the plaintiff asserts that \"the fraudulent misrepresentation perpetrated by [the defendant led] the plaintiff to expend monies on application fees, engineering fees, interest on mortgages and [attorney's] fees all related to the process before the [c]ommission ....\" The plaintiff went before the commission to seek the approval of two applications on its own\n   initiative. Again, even if we were to assume that the defendant's participation in the proceedings while biased constituted a false representation, the plaintiff has proffered no evidence demonstrating that the defendant's false representation intended to induce, or, in fact, caused the plaintiff to pursue approval of its applications before the commission. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the plaintiff has failed to present evidence that would sufficiently support the essential elements of the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The second claim in the plaintiff's complaint is tortious interference with a business expectancy. \"It is well established that the elements of a claim for tortious interference with business expectancies are: (1) a business relationship between the plaintiff and another party; (2) the defendant's intentional interference with\n   the business relationship while knowing of the relationship; and (3) as a result of the interference, the plaintiff suffers actual loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Hi-Ho Tower, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Com-Tronics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120055\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/20/#p27\">\n    255 Conn. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=761%20A.2d%201268\">\n    761 A.2d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). \"It is not essential to such a cause of action that the tort have resulted in an actual breach of contract, since even unenforceable promises, which the parties might voluntarily have performed, are entitled to be sheltered from wrongful interference.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Connell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"676409\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/189/648/#p660\">\n    189 Conn. 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 660,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=458%20A.2d%20355\">\n    458 A.2d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). \"It does not follow from this, however, that a plaintiff may recover for an interference with a mere possibility of his making a profit.

Our review of Connecticut case law indicates that a business expectation arises out of a contract or an ongoing business relationship between parties and a business relationship, therefore, involves prospective profits. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Hi-Ho Tower, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Com-Tronics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1120055\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/255/20/#p27\">\n    255 Conn. at 31-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=761%20A.2d%201268\">\n    761 A.2d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (business expectation amounted to existing\n   or prospective contractual or business relationships between customers and defendant). The plaintiff does not argue that the defendant interfered with a contractual relationship or a relationship involving the reasonable probability that it would have entered into a contract or made a profit. Instead, it argues that the defendant interfered with the relationship between it and the commission, and the business expectation interfered with was the expectation that the commission was an honest legal forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The plaintiff relies exclusively on dicta from\n   <em>\n    Kelley Property Development, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lebanon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738644\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/314/\">\n    226 Conn. 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20909\">\n    627 A.2d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993), to support its assertion that a business relationship existed between the plaintiff and the commission. In\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   , where a real estate developer brought a civil rights action against town officials after his application for subdivision approval was denied, \"[t]he principal issue [was] whether the Connecticut constitution affords a monetary remedy for damages to persons whose state due process rights have allegedly been violated by local zoning officials.\" Id., 315,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20909\">\n    627 A.2d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that case, our Supreme Court concluded that it \"should not construe our state constitution to provide a basis for the recognition of a private damages action\n   for injuries for which the legislature has provided a reasonably adequate statutory remedy\" by enacting General Statutes \u00a7 8-8, which provides for appellate appeal of zoning board decisions. Id., 339,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20909\">\n    627 A.2d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court added, \"even if such administrative relief were deemed to be inadequate, a proposition to which we do not subscribe, [the plaintiff] might have pursued other actions to protect his interests. He might, for example, have brought an action for intentional interference with [a] business expectancy, or for equitable relief, such as an action for an injunction against the defendants' allegedly wrongful conduct.\" (Footnote omitted.)

By citing to nothing other than\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   to support its position, the plaintiff is essentially asking us to conclude, without the support of existing authority, that an element of the cause of action is satisfied because our Supreme Court, in dicta,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   mentioned that the defendant in that case \"might ... have brought an action for intentional interference with [a] business expectancy ....\" Id., 340,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=627%20A.2d%20909\">\n    627 A.2d 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We are not willing to so hold. Accordingly, we conclude that no business, relationship existed between the defendant and the commission and, therefore, we agree with the trial court that the defendant has met her burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The plaintiff also argues that the court erroneously concluded that the defendant was not collaterally estopped from disputing liability because it wrongly determined that the issues in the present case were substantially different from the issues in the zoning appeals. Because we agree with the trial court that no privity existed between the commission and the defendant, we need not address this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    In her brief, without citing to any legal authority, the defendant asserts that the plaintiff appears to be trying to advance a claim for fraudulent nondisclosure instead of fraudulent misrepresentation and that the \"[p]laintiff has never alleged such a claim and same is a distinct cause of action ....\" Because the defendant fails to set forth any law, legal analysis, or legal argument to support that assertion, it will not be addressed.
