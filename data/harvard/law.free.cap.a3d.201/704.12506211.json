Norman appeals from March 28 and April 24, 2018, decisions by the New Jersey State Parole Board (Board). The primary question raised on appeal is whether an appellant who has served his sentence pursuant to the Sex Offender Act (SOA), N.J.S.A. 2C:47-1 to -10, can be compelled to undergo a psychological evaluation for violation of certain conditions of parole supervision for life (PSL), and mandatory parole supervision\n   (MPS), imposed outside the SOA. We hold the Board cannot compel such an evaluation and reverse that part of its decision. We affirm the Board's imposition of a parole eligibility term (PET) for Norman's violation of a special condition of MPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We take the following facts from the record. Norman was twenty-one years old when he committed several acts of aggravated sexual assault against a fourteen-year-old family member. He was arrested in September 2008, and in December 2008, pled guilty to one count of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Norman was sentenced in the second-degree range to seven years of incarceration in the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center (ADTC), subject to the No Early Release Act (NERA),\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2(d)(7). NERA requires MPS for all first- and second-degree offenses. N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2(c). Norman was further sentenced to PSL following service of the custodial portion of his sentence, as required by N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6.4(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 9, 2014, Norman was granted parole and discharged from the ADTC \"by reason of the expiration of his maximum custodial sentence.\" Norman had served his entire seven-year sentence through a combination of jail credits and time served following his conviction. His final discharge stated he was \"being discharged from the custodial portion of his ... sentence only to commence the period of supervision as set forth by ... [NERA].\" Specifically, Norman was paroled for five years pursuant to MPS, and also began PSL pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:43-6.4(a). Notably, he was not paroled pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-5(a), which governs sex offenders who are paroled before the expiration of their maximum sentence under SOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In pertinent part, the conditions of MPS required Norman to: \"Immediately notify the assigned parole officer of any change in employment status. ... Refrain from initiating, establishing or maintaining contact with any minor[,] ... [and] [s]uccessfully\n   complete the EMP[.]\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   \" Separately, PSL also included the same conditions. Notably, the Board stated Norman's \"PSL status was previously continued to the [EMP] in 2016[,] and most recently continued to the [EMP] in February of 2017[ ]\" because of a prior violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In May 2017, Norman was arrested for violating parole by failing to inform his parole officer that he had been terminated from his job and for having unsupervised visits with his minor children. On October 18, 2017, a Board panel found Norman had violated the PSL and MPS conditions of his parole. The panel revoked Norman's PSL and directed him to serve twelve months of incarceration. It also revoked MPS and referred him to the ADTC for a psychological evaluation, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.54(i)(3) and 10A:71-7.19A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 28, 2018, the Board affirmed the panel's determination. According to the Board, the purpose of the psychological evaluation was to \"determine whether to affirm the revocation of the mandatory term of supervision and, if affirmed, whether ... Norman's eligibility for future mandatory supervision consideration will be based on N.J.S.A. 2C:47-5(a) or the relevant provisions of N.J.S.A. 30:4-123.45 [to -123.88].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Norman did not challenge the twelve months of incarceration for violating PSL. Rather, he requested the Board revise its determination to permit his release, effective May 16, 2018, having served the twelve months in confinement, and to resume parole. He argued neither the regulation governing MPS, nor the one governing PSL, granted the Board authority to require a psychological evaluation as a condition of resuming parole, and his continued confinement as a result was unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 24, 2018, the Board denied Norman's request. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The issue on appeal - the Board's interpretation of statutes governing Norman's sentence and regulations regarding his parole - presents a question of law. We owe considerable deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    US Bank, NA v.

These regulations are inapplicable to an inmate who has served the entirety of his sentence under the SOA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our conclusion is further supported by the fact N.J.A.C. 10A:71-7.19A was enacted to codify our holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Once he was returned to custody, a psychological evaluation was performed and revealed no issues or concern he would reoffend as a sexual predator.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20257\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, Dalonges challenged the revocation of parole where he had committed a non-sexual offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20257\">\n    319 A.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, we held the intent of the SOA was to treat sexual offenders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145-46,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20257\">\n    319 A.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded Dalonges' parole violations did not relate to\n   his original offenses and did not justify keeping him in custody for further treatment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 147-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20257\">\n    319 A.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most importantly, Dalonges' violations occurred while he was paroled and before he served his sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 143-44,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20257\">\n    319 A.2d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In contrast, Norman had already served his sentence. Thus, the facts and outcome of\n   <em>\n    Dalonges\n   </em>\n   underscore that N.J.A.C. 10A:71-7.19A does not apply to Norman. Moreover, we note MPS and PSL did not exist at the time of our holding in\n   <em>\n    Dalonges\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we reject the Board's assertion these parole supervision and monitoring regimes fall within the SOA, and thus constitute a continuation of Norman's SOA sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Furthermore, we reject the Board's argument that it can compel a psychological evaluation in order to determine Norman's future parole eligibility under MPS based upon N.J.S.A. 2C:47-5(a). The statute states: \"Any offender committed to confinement under the terms of this chapter shall become eligible for parole consideration upon referral to the State Parole Board of the offender's case by a special classification review board appointed by the commissioner.\" N.J.S.A. 2C:47-5(a). Thus, by its plain language, N.J.S.A. 2C:47-5 does not apply to Norman because he served his SOA sentence, and is no longer subject to its provisions, and because the PSL and MPS requirements operate under a different statutory framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, the Board's argument that N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.54(i)(3) applies when an MPS term is revoked, and authorizes the Board to order the psychological evaluation, misreads the regulation and N.J.S.A. 2C:47-5. In pertinent part, the regulation states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (i) If a term of parole supervision imposed by a court pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2 is revoked by the appropriate Board panel and the offender returned to custody for violation of a condition of supervision the Board panel shall determine:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   3. Whether the offender, if originally sentenced pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:47-1 [to -10] and eligibility for parole consideration required the recommendation of the Special Classification Review Board, shall be eligible for parole consideration pursuant to the provisions of N.J.A.C. 10A:71-7.19 or 7.19A, as appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.54(i)(3).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The plain language of the regulation demonstrates it does not apply to Norman. In Norman's final discharge document dated September 9, 2014, the Board acknowledged he had been released from ADTC because of the \"expiration of his maximum custodial sentence.\" Furthermore, the Board stated: \"This offender is being discharged from the custodial portion of his ... sentence only to commence the period of supervision as set forth by ... [NERA].\" Thus, the Board acknowledged MPS was not a continuation of the SOA sentence, which had already been completed. Moreover, for reasons we have already discussed, N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.54(i)(3)'s reference to N.J.A.C. 10A:71-7.19A does not apply to Norman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For these reasons, we reverse the Board's finding Norman was required\n   to undergo a psychological evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We hold that where an individual has already served his sentence, he cannot be required to undergo a psychological evaluation pursuant to N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.54(i)(3) and 10A:71-7.19A. Absent further comment by the Legislature, these regulations only apply to individuals who have been released on parole before completing their sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Norman argues that under N.J.A.C. 10A:71-3.54(i)(2) he should have received a term of nine months PET, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 10:71-7.17B(a)(2), and no more than twelve months under N.J.A.C. 10A:71-7.17B(a)(3)(viii). Norman asserts the Board failed to state its reasons for imposing a twelve-month PET. He argues the PET could not have been established for a violation of a special condition, under N.J.A.C. 10A:71-6.4(e) or (f), because the former provision only applies when the Board certifies to a special condition, and the latter concerns a violation where an individual fails to notify an employer of his parole status and criminal record. Norman argues neither provision applies here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We find no error in the Board's imposition of a twelve-month PET. The Board has broad discretion in parole release decisions.\n   <em>\n    Trantino v. N.J.

N.J.A.C. 10A:71-7.17B(a)(3)(viii) requires the imposition of a twelve-month PET for a violation of a special condition of parole imposed under N.J.A.C. 10A:71-6.4(e). The Board's March 28, 2018 decision stated as follows: \"The Board finds that ... Norman was placed on the [EMP] on February 15,\n   2017[,] as a result of a Board panel Notice of Decision dated January 18, 2017[,] that imposed the special condition that ... Norman successfully complete the [EMP].\" Thus, contrary to Norman's claims, the Board panel had imposed special conditions when it adjudicated a prior parole violation in 2017 and decided to continue him on parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Separate from the SOA, Norman was subject to MPS as a part of his original sentence, which he violated. Therefore, the imposition of a twelve-month PET, pursuant to N.J.A.C. 10A:71-7.17B(a)(3)(viii), for violation of the special condition was valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Reversed in part and affirmed in part.
