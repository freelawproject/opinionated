On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly concluded that the defendants were entitled to absolute immunity. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiff's claim. Reich is an attorney with the law firm of Bai, Pollack, Blueweiss &amp; Mulcahey, P.C. In the prior marital dissolution action between the plaintiff and his former wife; see\n   <em>\n    Dubinsky\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dubinsky\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. FA-12-4040496-S; Reich served as a court-appointed guardian ad litem for the plaintiff's minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In his operative complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   dated September 9, 2016, the plaintiff alleged that, on June 23, 2012, shortly before the dissolution proceedings commenced, he was arrested and charged with risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61, and disorderly conduct in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-182. The plaintiff alleged that, as a result, criminal protective orders were issued by the court, which prevented him from seeing his minor child and required him to stay away from his marital home. The plaintiff alleged that, on August 30, 2012, the criminal protective orders were dismissed. The plaintiff further alleged that, on January 28, 2013, the Department of Children and Families concluded that the charges against him were not substantiated and that there was no basis for a finding of abuse or neglect of his minor child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff alleged claims of legal malpractice, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress against the defendants. The plaintiff alleged that Reich \"continued to hold [the criminal charges and protective orders] against the [p]laintiff, despite clear resolution in his favor.'' The plaintiff alleged that, in doing so, Reich \"vindictively, intentionally and ... recklessly'' limited the plaintiff's access to his minor child, which was contrary to the best interests of the child. Specifically, the\n   plaintiff alleged that Reich wrongfully recommended to the court supervised visitation between the plaintiff and his minor child and recommended against the use of coparenting counseling.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff claimed that Reich's actions \"caused [him] to suffer severe emotional distress and anxiety in being separated from his minor son and stepdaughter, the humiliation of supervised visitation with his minor son, the emotional distress of not being able to return to [his] marital home, and the loss of reputation in the community.''\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 4, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's\n   complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the grounds that they were entitled to absolute immunity and that the plaintiff lacked standing to assert claims of legal malpractice. On January 12, 2017, the plaintiff filed a memorandum of law in opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss in which he contended that the defendants were not entitled to absolute immunity and that, even if they were, they still would be liable \"for the intentional actions undertaken by [Reich] that were outside the scope of her duty as a [guardian ad litem].'' The plaintiff also asserted that he had standing because he had a relationship with the defendants as a result of a retainer agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 17, 2017, the court held a hearing on the motion. The court issued its memorandum of decision on April 27, 2017, granting the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court ruled that the defendants\n   were entitled to absolute immunity and that the plaintiff lacked standing with respect to his claims of legal malpractice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The standard of review for a court's decision on a motion to dismiss is well settled. \"A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction.... [O]ur review of the court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [determination] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... When a ... court decides a jurisdictional question raised by a pretrial motion to dismiss, it must consider the allegations of the complaint in their most favorable light.... In this regard, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader.... In undertaking this review, we are mindful of the well established notion that, in determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction, every presumption favoring jurisdiction should be indulged.''

The plaintiff argues that Reich \"went well beyond the best interests of the minor child and fell outside her jurisdiction as [guardian ad litem].'' We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Carrubba\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moskowitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143093\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/274/533/#p537\">\n    274 Conn. 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=877%20A.2d%20773\">\n    877 A.2d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), our Supreme Court recognized that attorneys appointed by the court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-54 are entitled to absolute, quasi-judicial immunity for actions taken during, or activities necessary to, the performance of functions that are integral to the judicial process. Reich, as a guardian ad litem, was an attorney appointed by the court pursuant to \u00a7 46b-54.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, under\n   <em>\n    Carrubba\n   </em>\n   , Reich is entitled\n   to absolute immunity for any actions taken within her role as guardian ad litem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The conduct that forms the basis of the plaintiff's underlying claims is Reich's recommendation to the court of supervised visitation between the plaintiff and his minor child, as well as her recommendation against the use of coparenting counseling. Reich made these recommendations to the court while fulfilling her statutorily prescribed duties as guardian ad litem to the plaintiff's minor child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff has\n   not pointed to any actions taken by Reich outside of her role as guardian ad litem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Reich is entitled to absolute immunity.\n   The plaintiff further argues that \"[p]ublic policy requires that the trial court recognize that there is a limitation to the actions of a [guardian ad litem]'' and that \"[t]he grant of immunity allows unchecked abuses of power by a [guardian ad litem].'' We disagree. Granting absolute immunity to guardians ad litem is not contrary to public policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   There are sufficient procedural safeguards to protect against improper conduct by a guardian ad litem. Because a guardian ad litem is appointed by the court, the guardian ad litem is subject to the court's oversight and discretion and may be removed by the court at any time, either sua sponte or upon motion of a party. See\n   <em>\n    Carrubba\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moskowitz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143093\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/274/533/#p537\">\n    274 Conn. at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=877%20A.2d%20773\">\n    877 A.2d 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see, e.g., Connecticut Judicial Branch, Code of Conduct for Counsel for the Minor Child and Guardian Ad Litem, available at https://www.jud.ct.gov/family/GAL_code.pdf.

Therefore, because the complaint was not grounded on any conduct by Reich in which she acted outside the role of a court-appointed\n   guardian ad litem, the defendants are entitled to\n   absolute immunity and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    The plaintiff filed his original complaint on April 20, 2016, in which he named Reich as the sole defendant. The plaintiff later filed a motion to cite in Bai, Pollack, Blueweiss &amp; Mulcahey, P.C., as an additional defendant, which the court granted on August 29, 2016. On September 26, 2016, the plaintiff filed his amended complaint, which serves as the operative complaint, in which he alleged additional claims against Bai, Pollack, Blueweiss &amp; Mulcahey, P.C., in its capacity as Reich's employer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    We note that, although Reich made these recommendations, it was indisputably the role of the court to make the final determinations as to custody, visitation, and parenting issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    \"The court may order either party to pay the fees for [a] guardian ad litem pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62, and how such expenses will be paid is within the court's discretion.''

In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found that \"[t]here was no retainer agreement, as the court ordered the plaintiff to pay fees incurred by Reich for the execution of her duties in her role as the guardian ad litem for the minor child.''\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    On appeal, the plaintiff does not challenge the trial court's finding that he lacked standing to bring the legal malpractice claims. Therefore, this appeal relates solely to the issue of whether the defendants were entitled to absolute immunity with respect to the plaintiff's claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    In his reply brief, the plaintiff claims, for the first time, that \"[i]t was error for the court to dismiss the [plaintiff's] cause of action on the sufficiency of the pleadings rather than treating the motion to dismiss as a motion to strike.'' We decline to review this claim.

We find this argument unpersuasive. In\n    <em>\n     Carrubba\n    </em>\n    , our Supreme Court granted attorneys for the minor child the same level of immunity as guardians ad litem. The court stated: \"[F]or the purposes of an immunity analysis, the court-appointed attorney for the minor child most closely resembles a guardian ad litem,'' and \"we see no reason to accord appointed attorneys for minor children a lesser level of immunity than that traditionally accorded to guardians ad litem, at least in the performance of those functions that are integral to the judicial process.''\n    <em>\n     Carrubba\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Moskowitz\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3143093\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/274/533/#p537\">\n     274 Conn. at 546-47\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=877%20A.2d%20773\">\n     877 A.2d 773\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Further, the court acknowledged that \"[c]ourts in other jurisdictions have almost unanimously accorded guardians ad litem absolute immunity for their actions that are integral to the judicial process.... Courts have reasoned that the duty of a guardian ad litem to secure the best interests of the minor children places the guardian squarely within the judicial process to accomplish that goal ... and, therefore, that a grant of absolute immunity is both appropriate and necessary in order to ensure that the guardian will be able to function without the worry of possible later harassment and intimidation from dissatisfied parents.... These same reasons support the extension of the same scope of immunity to attorneys appointed pursuant to \u00a7 46b-54.'' (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)

Thus, in granting attorneys for the minor child absolute immunity, the court recognized that guardians ad litem had traditionally possessed such immunity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Because the plaintiff did not allege any claims against Bai, Pollack, Blueweiss &amp; Mulcahey, P.C., outside of its role as Reich's employer, it is similarly entitled to absolute immunity for any actions taken by Reich within her role as guardian ad litem.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 46b-54 (e) provides in relevant part: \"[A] guardian ad litem for the minor child or children shall be heard on all matters pertaining to the interests of any child, including the custody, care, support, education and visitation of the child, so long as the court deems such representation to be in the best interests of the child....''\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 46b-54 (f) provides in relevant part: \"[A] guardian ad litem for the minor child shall consider the best interests of the child, and in doing so shall consider, but not be limited to, one or more of the following factors ... the past and current interaction and relationship of the child with each parent, the child's siblings and any other person who may significantly affect the best interests of the child ... the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage such continuing parent-child relationship between the child and the other parent as is appropriate, including compliance with any court orders ... the effect on the child of the actions of an abuser, if any domestic violence has occurred between the parents or between a parent and another individual or the child ...
