Andrews (Thomas &amp; Libowitz P.A., on the brief) Baltimore, MD., for Appellant.\n </attorneys>\n <attorneys id=\"p-6\">\n  Argued by: Weon G. Kim, McLean, VA, for Appellee.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion id=\"p-7\">\n  Panel: Fader, C.J., Beachley, James A. Kenney, III (Senior Judge, Specially Assigned), JJ.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-8\">\n   Fader, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Won Sun Lee, the appellant, challenges the Circuit Court for Howard County's refusal to vacate a renewed judgment the court's clerk entered against him and in favor of his brother, Won Bok Lee. Before we can address the merits of this appeal, Mr. Bok Lee asks us to determine whether it is\n   timely. We conclude that it is. The clerk's entry of the order from which Mr. Sun Lee appeals initially failed to comply with the requirements of Maryland Rule 2-601(b) because the docket entry available through the case search feature on the Judiciary website did not identify the date on which judgment was entered. As a result, the appeal period did not start to run and Mr. Sun Lee's appeal was premature when it was filed. However, subsequent changes to the docket entry fixed the problem and Mr. Sun Lee's appeal is now properly before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Turning to the merits, Mr. Sun Lee asks us to decide whether his brother's 2015 attempt to renew a judgment in the circuit court was effective. The answer to that question revolves largely around two others: (1) whether Mr. Bok Lee's 2004 filing\n   in the circuit court of notice of a 2002 federal court judgment created a new state court judgment or just a lien; and (2) if that filing created a lien only, whether it extended the period for renewal of the underlying judgment, which otherwise expired by operation of law in 2014. We conclude that the 2004 filing created a lien, not a judgment, and so could not be renewed once the underlying federal court judgment had expired. We therefore reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand with instructions to vacate the renewed judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Initial Proceedings in Federal and State Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2002, Mr. Bok Lee obtained a judgment by default in the amount of $ 141,059.44 against Mr. Sun Lee in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In May 2004, Mr. Bok Lee filed a \"Request to File Notice of Lien\" in the Circuit Court for Howard County based on the federal judgment. On June 1, 2004, the circuit court entered a \"Notice of Lien of Judgment Received From United States District Court\" and made the following docket entry: \"Judgment entered on 06/01/04.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Howard County case remained dormant until July 23, 2015, when Mr. Bok Lee filed a \"Request to Renew Judgment.\" The request stated that \"[j]udgment in this case was entered on June 1, 2004,\" claimed that it had \"not expired (12 years from entry),\" and asked the clerk to renew it. The clerk promptly entered the renewed judgment on the docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 24, 2016, Mr. Sun Lee moved to vacate the renewal. He argued that Mr. Bok Lee's 2004 filing had created a lien, rather than a new judgment, and so could no longer be renewed once the federal judgment had expired. Although the circuit court agreed with Mr. Sun Lee that the 2004 filing had created a lien, not a new judgment, it also agreed with Mr. Bok Lee that it was nonetheless still subject to renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Three writings relating to the circuit court's ruling are central to our discussion below, so we present them in some detail. First, after a hearing, the court issued a one-page written order containing a single substantive sentence that identifies what the court considered (the motion to vacate, the opposition, and the arguments of the parties) and states that the motion to vacate is denied. The order is dated June 2, 2016 and bears (1) the signature of the judge, (2) a stamp identifying that it was \"ENTERED\" on June 3, 2016, (3) a true test certification, and (4) a notation of \"6000\" in the bottom right corner. We refer to this order as the \"June 2 Order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The second and third writings of significance are both docket entries. Each appears slightly differently in the circuit court's own system than it appeared as viewed through the case search feature on the Judiciary website at the relevant time-which, for purposes of determining the timeliness of the appeal, is the period between June 3 and July 6, 2016. The first, which we refer to as \"Docket Entry 6000,\" appears in the court's case management system as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the relevant time, that same entry appeared through the case search feature on the Judiciary website as:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The second entry, which we refer to as \"Docket Entry 14000,\" appears in the court's case management system as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the relevant time, that same entry appeared through the case search feature on the Judiciary website as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   We discuss both docket entries in more detail below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mr. Sun Lee noted an appeal on July 6, 2016. Mr. Bok Lee moved to strike the notice as late, arguing that the June 2 Order had been entered on June 3 and that any appeal-after accounting for weekends and a holiday-was due by July 5. The circuit court granted the motion and struck the notice of appeal. Mr. Sun Lee then appealed timely from the order striking his first notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The First Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In an unreported opinion, a panel of this Court concluded that the record did not reflect when, or even if, Mr. Sun Lee's time to appeal had begun to run.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Lee\n   </em>\n   , No. 945, Sept. Term 2016,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203634056\">\n    2017 WL 3634056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (Aug. 24, 2017). The panel identified three factors that are necessary for there to be a valid appeal: (1) under Rule 2-601(a), the final judgment must be \"set forth on a separate document\" that is signed by a judge or the clerk of court; (2) under Rule 2-601(b), the judgment must be entered on the court's electronic case management system; and (3) under Rules 2-601(d) and 8-202(a), an appeal must be noted within 30 days of the date on which the judgment was entered in that court's electronic case management system.\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203634056\">\n    2017 WL 3634056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on the record as it then stood, the panel found insufficient evidence to determine either (1) whether the separate document required by Rule 2-601(a) had been signed or (2) whether such a document had been entered on the court's electronic case management system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. With respect to the separate document, the panel considered it plausible that the June 2 Order was the required separate document setting forth the judgment, but it was uncertain because of a perceived inconsistency between the date of that order and Docket Entry 14000. That entry, although not made until June 6, seemed to contemplate that a separate order was still yet to come.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With respect to the entry of such a document, the panel first considered, and rejected, Mr. Bok Lee's contention that Docket Entry 6000 reflected the entry of the order in the court's electronic case management system. The panel's confusion in attempting to interpret this docket entry is perhaps best reflected in a footnote in which it observed that neither party had \"ventured an explanation, nor can we invent one, to explain why the portion of the docket entry that says '06/03/16 copies mailed' was made on (or added to) the March 24 docket entry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2 n.3. In the absence of any such explanation, the panel concluded that this could not possibly reflect entry\n   of the separate document by which the court had entered judgment and, therefore, that \"there is no way that June 3 can be the date of entry of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As an alternative, the panel considered whether Docket Entry 14000 could constitute entry of the separate document on the court's electronic case management system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The panel concluded that this docket entry might constitute entry of a separate order on the electronic docket, but was uncertain in light of the same perceived inconsistency as to dates between that June 6 entry-and its indication that an order still had to be submitted-and the June 2 Order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Out of that uncertainty, the panel posited three possibilities: (1) if a separate document had been executed before June 6 (such as the June 2 Order), and Docket Entry 14000 constituted its entry on the electronic case management system (on June 6), then Mr. Sun Lee's appeal would be timely; (2) if a separate document had been executed after June 6, then-still treating Docket Entry 14000 as the (premature) entry of that separate document on the court's electronic case management system-the appeal would be \"ripe to proceed,\" with June 6 being its operative date; or (3) if a separate document was never signed, the judgment \"has still not become final,\" and the appeal \"was, and remains, premature.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. \"Under none of these three possible scenarios,\" the panel concluded, \"was Mr. Sun Lee's appeal late.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The panel therefore reversed the order striking the notice of appeal and remanded to the circuit court with the following mandate:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR THE CIRCUIT COURT TO\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   DETERMINE DATE OF ENTRY OF JUDGMENT OR TO ENTER THE JUDGMENT ON A SEPARATE DOCUMENT. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Proceedings on Remand\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On remand, the circuit court asked the court clerk to explain his practices with respect to the relevant entries in the\n   court's electronic case management system. The clerk's responsive memorandum explained that the June 2 Order is the separate document reflecting the court's judgment and that it was entered on the court's electronic case management system on June 3 as part of Docket Entry 6000. With respect to the date of entry, the clerk's memorandum explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 \"It is the clerk's practice that when the clerk enters a ruling/order from the Court, the Order is 'entered' stamped. Which in this case was June 3, 2016.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 \"It is the clerk's practice to update the original motion in [the court's electronic case management system]. In this case the clerk entered the ruling of Denied under docket entry 6000 as of June 3, 2016 and mailed copies of the Order on June 3, 2016.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u2022 \"Adjacent to the ruling of Denied is the closed date of the motion of June 3, 2016 which also corresponds to the date of entry.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 \"Therefore the written Order Denying the Motion to Vacate Judgment was entered by the clerk on June 3, 2016.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Upon receiving the clerk's memorandum, the circuit court issued its own memorandum opinion in which it provided \"an explanation of the process.\" The court explained that Docket Entry 6000, although a single entry bearing an \"Entered\" date of March 24, actually reflects at least three different events: the filing of the motion to vacate the judgment, the scheduling of a hearing on that motion, and the court's denial of that motion. March 24, 2016, the court explained, is the date the motion was filed. The subsequent dates mentioned are the dates on which the two other events-scheduling of the hearing (April 20, 2016) and entry of the order (June 3, 2016)-were entered into the system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court also sought to answer the uncertainty regarding Docket Entry 14000, explaining that it reflects \"a hearing sheet[,] which is a summary of what occurred during a proceeding.\" Thus, the information in that entry reflects the court's statement in open court that it would deny the motion, not the entry of a written order. According to the court, \"[t]he entry of the hearing sheet on June 6, 2016 is just that, the entering of the hearing sheet into the electronic case management system. It is not an order, nor does it have the effect of an order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In summarizing its response to the questions raised by the panel, the circuit court stated that it \"issued a separate Order that was signed on June 2, 2016,\" and that \"[t]he Order was entered by the clerk in the electronic case management system on June 3, 2016 ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Alterations to the Docket Entries as Those Entries Appear Through the Case Search Feature on the Judiciary Website\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The status of the docket entries as discussed thus far was accurate through at\n   least July 31, 2016, as reflected in the filings of the parties in the circuit court and included in the record filed with this Court. When this Court independently queried the case search function available on the Judiciary website on January 11, 2019, however, Docket Entry 6000 appeared as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although there is nothing in the record about this change, we presume it was made in connection with the transition of the Howard County Circuit Court to the Maryland Electronic Courts (\"MDEC\") system in April 2018. For our present purposes, what is relevant is: (1) the change occurred after July 6, 2016; and (2) the entry now includes the following information: \"Decision: Denied - 06/03/2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Based on the circuit court's findings, Mr. Bok Lee moved to dismiss Mr. Sun Lee's appeal as late. Mr. Sun Lee counters that this Court already conclusively determined that the appeal was not late and cannot revisit that determination. We conclude (1) that we are not precluded from considering whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal, (2) that Mr. Sun Lee's July 6, 2016 notice of appeal was premature when filed, but that the appeal is now ripe for decision, and (3) that the circuit court erred in denying Mr. Sun Lee's motion to vacate the renewed judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

We now know definitively that (1) the circuit court intended the June 2 Order to be the separate order entering judgment in this case, (2) the clerk intended to enter that order in the court's electronic case management system on June 3 by adding the word \"Denied\" to Docket Entry 6000, and (3) Docket Entry 14000 is merely a hearing sheet and\n   does not reflect the entry of any written order. With this additional information and in light of our independent obligation to ensure that we have jurisdiction, we conclude that we are not precluded from revisiting the question of whether Mr. Sun Lee's original notice of appeal was late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MR. SUN LEE'S APPEAL WAS INITIALLY PREMATURE, BUT NOW IS RIPE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We now turn to the merits of the motion to dismiss, which requires us to return to the two questions we asked the circuit court to answer on remand: (1) whether the circuit court or its clerk had signed a separate document setting forth the judgment in compliance with Rule 2-601(a) ; and (2) if-and if so, when-the clerk entered that judgment on the court's electronic case management system in compliance with Rule 2-601(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to the first question, the circuit court's memorandum establishes that the June 2 Order is indeed the \"separate document\" setting forth the court's judgment that is required by Rule 2-601(a). The prior panel's uncertainty on that point arose from the notation in the later-dated Docket Entry 14000 indicating that an order was yet to come. With the court's explanation that the notation in Docket Entry 14000 reflects the situation that existed when the court closed the June 2 hearing, not the situation that existed when that docket entry was made on June 6, we consider that issue to be definitively resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The second question is more complicated. The prior panel thought that Docket Entry 14000 might reflect the entry of the judgment in the court's electronic case management system. The circuit court's explanation that Docket Entry 14000 does not reflect the entry of any written order eliminates that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Instead, the circuit court identifies Docket Entry 6000 as (1) reflecting entry of the judgment in the court's electronic case management system (2) on June 3,\n   2016. We accept the circuit court's memorandum as resolving conclusively the first of\n   these points-that the clerk actually entered the word \"Denied\" into Docket Entry 6000 on June 3, 2016, and that the clerk did so for the purpose of entering the judgment reflected in the June 2 Order. We also accept the circuit court's memorandum as establishing that the notation \"06/03/16 copies mailed\" in Docket Entry 6000 refers to the mailing of copies of the June 2 Order to counsel and that the \"Closed\" date of June 3 that appears in the court's case management system-though not in the docket then available on the Judiciary website-refers to the date on which the word \"Denied\" was added to Docket Entry 6000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Our difficulty in accepting those facts as establishing June 3 as the trigger date for the appeal period lies in the fact that Docket Entry 6000 itself-and particularly the version of that docket entry that was available on the Judiciary website in June and July of 2016-failed to establish clearly when the clerk added the \"Denied\" notation to the entry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Explaining why that issue is significant requires an exploration of the Court of Appeals's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hiob v.

In doing so, we are particularly mindful of the following guidance from the Court of Appeals: (1) Rule 2-601 is to be applied mechanically but must be interpreted \"in favor of the preservation of appeal rights,\"\n   <em>\n    Hiob\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/\">\n    440 Md. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/\">\n    103 A.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) the requirements of Rule 2-601 are designed to ensure that the public, as well as the litigants, have \"a clear indication of when judgment is entered,\" not an indication that depends on assumptions or deduction,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/\">\n    at 495-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/\">\n    103 A.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (3) if the entry requirements of Rule 2-601(b), as amended in 2015, are properly followed, \"[l]itigants and the public ought to be able to look at [the docket accessible through the case search feature on the Judiciary website] and determine when any judgment was entered,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/\">\n    at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308107\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/440/466/\">\n    103 A.3d 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tierco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89837\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/378/\">\n    381 Md. at 393-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89837\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/381/378/\">\n    849 A.2d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (alteration to reflect Rules change).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As discussed above, the June 2 Order satisfies the separate document requirements of Rule 2-601(a). The question before us now is whether Docket Entry 6000, as it existed in June and July 2016, met the entry requirements of Rule 2-601(b). We hold that it did not comply with the requirement of Rule 2-601(b)(3) that, unless shielding is required, \"the docket entry and the date of entry shall be available to the public through the case search feature on the Judiciary website ....\" That is because the date of entry was not available to the public. For ease of reference, the version of the docket entry that appeared\n   through the case search feature on the Judiciary website at that time was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   As an initial matter, we think it clear that \"date of entry\" as used in the Rule must necessarily mean the date of entry of the judgment. We clarify that because although Docket Entry 6000 contains a field\n   for \"Entered Date,\" the date provided is that on which the clerk entered the motion itself (March 24), not the date of the entry of judgment. For a litigant or member of the public interested in knowing the date of entry of the judgment, the \"Entered Date\" of March 24 is unhelpful at best and potentially quite confusing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Moreover, based on the information then available through the Judiciary website, the only way a litigant or a member of the public would know that a separate document reflecting the judgment was entered on June 3, 2016 would be to make at least three separate assumptions: (1) the ruling of \"Denied\" was reflected in a separate document constituting a judgment; (2) the word \"copies\" included in the phrase \"06/03/16 copies mailed,\" which appears at the end of the grammatically-challenging final line of text at the bottom of the entry, refers to copies of that separate document; and (3) the date on which the copies were mailed was also the date the judgment was entered into the electronic case management system. Although we know from the clerk's memorandum that all of this is consistent with the internal practice of his office, there is no way to reliably discern that from the docket entry itself. The entry thus failed the\n   <em>\n    Hiob\n   </em>\n   test because it failed to provide litigants and the public with a clear indication of when judgment was entered. Indeed, without the helpful explanation of the circuit court and its clerk, a prior panel of this Court was unable to discern from the docket entries that a separate document setting forth the judgment had even been entered, much less when it was entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In sum, Docket Entry 6000 did not provide notice of the date when judgment was entered as required by Rule 2-601(b) and, therefore, could not trigger the beginning of the appeal period. As a result, Mr. Sun Lee's appeal was premature when it was filed on July 6, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Subsequent to that, however, the version of Docket Entry 6000 that appears through the case search feature on the Judiciary website changed. It now appears as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   This entry contains what the prior version critically lacked: a clear identification that the decision to deny the motion to vacate was entered on June 3, 2016. Pursuant to Rule 8-602(f), the July 6, 2016 notice of appeal is treated as having been \"filed on the same day as, but after, the entry on the docket.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although we do not know for certain when Docket Entry 6000 changed in this way, we know it was after July 31, 2016. For that reason, Mr. Sun Lee's appeal is now ripe to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE CIRCUIT COURT ERRED IN DENYING MR. SUN LEE'S MOTION TO VACATE THE RENEWED JUDGMENT.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Mr. Sun Lee contends that Mr. Bok Lee's 2004 filing established a lien based on the federal judgment and not a new state court judgment. Because the\n   underlying federal judgment had expired before 2015, he argues, (1) the lien was not subject to renewal in 2015, (2) the clerk was wrong to renew it at that time, and (3) the circuit court erred in refusing to vacate it. Mr. Bok Lee argues that because he recorded and indexed the federal court judgment in the circuit\n   court in 2004, the judgment was subject to renewal in the circuit court in 2015 for a new 12-year period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The circuit court did not agree wholly with either party. The court first determined that in 2004 Mr. Bok Lee filed the federal judgment in Howard County \"as a lien\" and that the clerk therefore \"issued a notice of lien to the Defendants concerning that matter.\" However, the court also found that because the lien was based on a money judgment, which was recorded and indexed in Howard County in order to establish the lien, it was subject to renewal pursuant to Rule 2-625.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That Rule provides: \"A money judgment expires 12 years from the date of entry or most recent renewal. At any time before expiration of the judgment, the judgment holder may file a notice of renewal and the clerk shall enter the judgment renewed.\" Finding Rule 2-625 applicable, the court determined that the 2015 filing was effective and therefore declined to vacate the renewed judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Underlying the circuit court's decision is its legal conclusion that a lien that is based on a money judgment is renewable within 12 years of the establishment of the lien, even if the underlying judgment has subsequently expired. We review that legal conclusion de novo to determine if it was legally correct.\n   <em>\n    Walter v.

A money judgment is a final order of a court \"determining that a specified amount of money is immediately payable [by the judgment debtor] to the judgment creditor.\" Rule 1-202(q);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Md. Code Ann. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 11-401(c)(1). A lien, on\n   the other hand, is a mechanism allowing a debt-including but not limited to a money judgment-to be \"satisfied out of a particular property.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery County v. May Dep't Stores Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767729\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/183/#p195\">\n    352 Md. 183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"767729\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/352/183/#p195\">\n    721 A.2d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998) (quotation marks omitted).

In other words, where a money judgment establishes a debt, a lien is a mechanism that can be used to enforce it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Mr. Bok Lee's 2004 Filing Established a Lien, Not a Judgment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Mr. Bok Lee's May 21, 2004 filing with the circuit court consisted of three pages. The first page contains a top half and a bottom half, each with separate headings. The top half of the document, which is titled \"Request to File Notice of Lien,\" identifies two separate federal court judgments, one obtained on October 23, 2003 against a Kyung Hee Lee and a second obtained on July 23, 2002 against Mr. Sun\n   Lee and a Steve Woo-Shik Lee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   His filing then asks that the clerk \"record said Judgment [sic] and send recorded copies to me.\" The bottom half of the first page, which is separately titled \"Notice of Lien of Judgment,\" includes (1) a statement certifying \"that the following Judgments have been recorded in this Court ...\" and (2) a line for the clerk to sign and date the certification. The second and third pages of the 2004 filing are certified copies of the two federal judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The effect of this filing is governed by both statute and rule. Section 11-402(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (Repl. 2013; Supp. 2018) provides: \"If indexed and recorded as prescribed by the Maryland Rules, a money judgment of a court constitutes a lien to the amount and from the date of the judgment on the judgment debtor's interest in land located in the county in which the judgment was rendered ....\" A court, for purposes of this statute, includes the United States District\n   Court for the District of Maryland. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc., \u00a7 11-401(b). The Rules are to the same effect. Rule 2-601(c) requires that, \"[p]romptly after entry, the clerk shall ... record and index the judgment ... in the judgment records of the court ....\" Rule 2-623(a) similarly requires the clerk, upon receipt, to \"record and index\" a certified or authenticated judgment of, among others, \"a court of the United States.\" The effect of recording and indexing such judgments, whether the court's own or those of other courts covered by the Rule, is that doing so \"constitutes a lien from the date of entry in the amount of the judgment and post-judgment interest on the defendant's interest in land located in that county.\" Rule 2-621(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Under these provisions, the effect of recording and indexing any judgment is the establishment of a lien. John A. Lynch, Jr. &amp; Richard W. Bourne,\n   <em>\n    Modern Maryland Civil Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 13.3 (3d ed. 2016) (\"Although a money judgment is not self-executing, its entry constitutes a lien on the defendant's interest in land located ... in any county in which it is recorded.\"). As a result, pursuant to \u00a7 11-402 and Rules 2-621 and 2-623, Mr. Bok Lee's 2004 filing and the consequent indexing and recording of the federal judgment by the clerk created a lien against Mr. Sun Lee's land in Howard County.

The Rule, however, provides him no assistance because (1) it addresses the expiration and renewal of judgments, not their creation, and (2) it ties expiration and renewal to the\n   dates of entry of the judgments themselves, not liens based on them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Second, Mr. Bok Lee points to the circuit court's 2004 docket entry that stated, in connection with his filing, \"Judgment entered on 06/01/04.\" He also identifies other places in the docket that refer back to \"judgment\" being entered in 2004 and renewed in 2015. However, the clerk's descriptions of Mr. Bok Lee's filings cannot\n   change the nature of what Mr. Bok Lee actually filed or the legal effect of those filings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Short v.

The law provides that Mr. Bok Lee's 2004 filing created a lien; a clerk's contrary description in a docket entry does not make it something else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Third, Mr. Bok Lee contends that this matter is controlled by the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Equip. Fin., Inc. v. Asterbadi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174002\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/237/\">\n    841 F.3d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2016). There, the Fourth Circuit treated a judgment from a Virginia federal court that was recorded and indexed in a Maryland federal court as having the full effect of a judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174002\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174002\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/237/\">\n    at 244-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That decision, however, turned on a federal law that provided that a money judgment issued by one federal district court and registered in another \"shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174002\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/237/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174002\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/237/\">\n    at 243-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201963\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). That statute has no application here, where the issue is the effect of the indexing and recording of the federal judgment in the Circuit Court for Howard County, not another federal court. As to this circumstance, federal law defers to that of Maryland:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Every judgment rendered by a [federal] district court within a State shall be a lien on the property located in such State in the same manner, to the same extent and under the same conditions as a judgment of a court of general jurisdiction in such State, and shall cease to be a lien in the same\n   manner and time.... Whenever the law of any State requires a judgment of a State court to be registered, recorded, docketed or indexed, or any other act to be done, in a particular manner ... before such lien attaches, such requirements shall apply only if the law of such State authorizes the judgment of a court of the United States to be registered, recorded, docketed, indexed or otherwise conformed to rules and requirements relating to judgments of the courts of the State.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In sum, we are in agreement with the circuit court that Mr. Bok Lee's 2004 filing with the circuit court, and the clerk's recording and indexing of the federal judgment, created a lien against Mr. Sun Lee's property in Howard County. It did not create a new judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Rule 2-625 Does Not Permit Renewal of a Lien.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Mr. Bok Lee contends, and the circuit court agreed, that Rule 2-625 nonetheless\n   authorized the renewal of his judgment in 2015. For several reasons, we disagree. As an initial matter, Rule 2-625, by its plain terms, authorizes renewal of a judgment, not a lien. The Rule could not, therefore, have authorized a renewal of the lien that was created by the 2004 filing.\n   To the extent that Mr. Bok Lee's argument is that the recording and indexing of his federal judgment in a state circuit court somehow provided authorization for the state court to renew the underlying federal judgment itself, he has pointed us to no authority for that proposition and we are aware of none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   And even if there were such authority-which would, at a minimum, raise substantial federalism concerns-the federal judgment had already expired by the time of Mr. Bok Lee's 2015 filing. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 69(a) provides that the procedure for execution of a money judgment \"must accord with the procedure of the state where the court is located\" unless governed by a federal statute. Neither party has identified any contrary federal statute. As a result, the federal judgment was governed by Maryland law, including the 12-year expiration provision of Rule 2-625.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Asterbadi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174002\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/841/237/\">\n    841 F.3d at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By July 23, 2015, therefore, the judgment Mr. Bok Lee had obtained against Mr. Sun Lee on July 23, 2002 was no longer extant and could not be renewed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kroop &amp; Kurland, P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1187800\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/118/651/#p664\">\n    118 Md.
